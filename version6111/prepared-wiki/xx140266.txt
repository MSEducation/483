For syndicated reruns, Black Saddle was combined with three other Western series from the same company, Law of the Plainsman starring Michael Ansara, Johnny Ringo starring Don Durant and Mark Goddard, and the critically acclaimed creation of Sam Peckinpah, The Westerner with Brian Keith, under the umbrella title, The Westerners, with new hosting sequences by Keenan Wynn.

==Synopsis==

Peter Breck's character, Clay Culhane, is a gunfighter who becomes a lawyer after his brothers were killed in a shootout. Breck starred along with Russell Johnson and Anna-Lisa in the roles of Marshal Gib Scott and Nora Travers, respectively. Other recurring roles were filled by character actors J. Pat O'Malley in eight episodes as Judge Caleb Marsh and Walter Burke in five segments as Tim Potter.
In the episode "Client Neal Adams" (May 9, 1959),  James Drury, more than three years before the premiere of his The Virginian on NBC,  guest stars as Neal Adams, an old friend of Culhane's who has robbed a bank of $8,000. Shot in the back by a pursuing bounty hunter, played by Charles Aidman, Adams asks Culhane for help. Adams claims that the bounty hunter is the brother of a man whom Adams had earlier killed in self-defense. From the start, Marshal Scott doubts Adams' story and questions Culhane's judgment in the matter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0526608/|title=Black Saddle: "Client Neal Adams", May 9, 1959|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 4, 2012[/tpl]
In "Client Peter Warren" (October 30, 1959), John Lupton, a year after the close of his Broken Arrow western series, plays a man accused by townspeople of starting a fire that caused the death of his estranged wife's wealthy and respected aunt. The motive is inheritance of joint property from the aunt's pending estate. Culhane agrees to defend Warren but instead finds evidence that Warren had been present at the scene of the fire. Ed Nelson portrays Lee Coogan, a hot-headed man and a former suitor of Mrs. Warren, played by Aneta Corsaut. Coogan is also determined to show Warren's guilt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0526611/|title=Black Saddle: "Client Peter Warren", October 30, 1959|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012[/tpl]
