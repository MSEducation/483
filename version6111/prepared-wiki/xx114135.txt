Alric acceded with his two brothers on the death of his father Wihtred, according to Bede,Bede, Historia Ecclesia, book V chap. xxiii but is otherwise unknown. Kelly Kelly, S. E. 1995. Charters of St. Augustine’s Abbey Canterbury and Minster-in-Thanet. Anglo-Saxon Charters 4. observed that the reign of 762 to 796 attributed to him by William of Malmesbury “is evidently fantasy, inspired by a desire to account neatly for all the brothers mentioned by Bede”.
