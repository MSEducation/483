Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), also known as anxious personality disorder,Avoidant personality disorder - International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) is a Cluster C personality disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders handbook as afflicting persons when they display a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interaction."Avoidant personality disorder" – Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), American Psychiatric Association (2000) Individuals afflicted with the disorder tend to describe themselves as ill at ease, anxious, lonely, and generally feel unwanted and isolated from others.[tpl]cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|authorlink1=Theodore Millon|last2=Davis|first2=Roger D.|title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV and Beyond, 2nd Edition|year=1996|pages=263[/tpl]
People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be socially inept or personally unappealing and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, humiliated, rejected, or disliked. Avoidant personality disorder is usually first noticed in early adulthood. Childhood emotional neglect and peer group rejection (e.g., bullying) are both associated with an increased risk for the development of AvPD.[tpl]cite web|title=Avoidant Personality Disorder - Environmental Factors|url=http://www.tljones.co.uk/apd/envmnt.htm[/tpl]
There is controversy as to whether avoidant personality disorder is a distinct disorder from generalized social phobia and it is contended by some that they are merely different conceptualisations of the same disorder, where avoidant personality disorder may represent the more severe form.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Reich|first1=James|title=Avoidant personality disorder and its relationship to social phobia|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=11|issue=1|pages=89–93|year=2009|pmid=19187715|doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0014-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Huppert|first1=Jonathan D.|last2=Strunk|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Ledley|first3=Deborah Roth|last4=Davidson|first4=Jonathan R.

==Signs and symptoms==

People with avoidant personality disorder are preoccupied with their own shortcomings and form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these individuals will choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others. They often view themselves with contempt, while showing an increased inability to identify traits within themselves which are generally considered as positive within their societies.Will, Retzlaff, ed. (1995). p. 97 Childhood emotional neglect—in particular, the rejection of a child by one or both parents—has been associated with an increased risk for the development of AvPD, as well as rejection by peers.

==Causes==

Causes of avoidant personality disorder are not clearly defined and may be influenced by a combination of social, genetic, and psychological factors. The disorder may be related to temperamental factors that are inherited.[ref][tpl]cite web|last=Rettew|first=David C.|coauthors=Michael S Jellinek, Alicia C Doyle|title=Avoidant Personality Disorder|publisher=eMedicine|date=March 4, 2008|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/913360-overview|accessdate=January 26, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100212013103/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/913360-overview|archivedate=12 February 2010 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Millon's subtypes==

Psychologist Theodore Millon notes that because most patients present a mixed picture of symptoms, their personality disorder tends to be a blend of a major personality disorder type with one or more secondary personality disorder types.[tpl]cite web|last=Millon|first=Theadore|title=Personality Subtypes Summary|url=http://www.millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm|work=http://www.millon.net|publisher=Institute for Advanced Studies in Personology and Psychopathology|accessdate=8 January 2013[/tpl] He identified four adult subtypes of avoidant personality disorder.Millon, Theodore (2004).

==Diagnosis==

===World Health Organization===

The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists avoidant personality disorder as ([tpl]ICD10|F|60|6|f|60[/tpl]) anxious (avoidant) personality disorder. It is characterized by at least four of the following:WHO.int
It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfy a set of general personality disorder criteria.

===American Psychiatric Association===

The DSM-IV-TR also has an Avoidant Personality Disorder diagnosis. It refers in general to a widespread pattern of inhibition around people, feeling inadequate and being very sensitive to being evaluated negatively since early adulthood and occurring in a range of situations. In addition, four of seven specific criteria should be met, which are:

===Other===

Earlier theorists proposed a personality disorder with a combination of features from borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, called "avoidant-borderline mixed personality" (AvPD/BPD).Kantor, M. (1993, revised 2003). Distancing: A Guide to Avoidance and Avoidant Personality Disorder. Westport, Conn: Praeger Publishers.

===Differential diagnosis===

Research suggests that people with avoidant personality disorder, in common with sufferers of chronic social anxiety disorder (also called social phobia), excessively monitor their own internal reactions when they are involved in social interaction. However, unlike social phobics they also excessively monitor the reactions of the people with whom they are interacting. The extreme tension created by this monitoring may account for the hesitant speech and taciturnity of many people with avoidant personality disorder; they are so preoccupied with monitoring themselves and others that producing fluent speech is difficult.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, avoidant personality disorder must be differentiated from dependent, paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). "Anxiety disorders." In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev., pp. 450–456). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association.

===Comorbidity===

Avoidant personality disorder is reported to be especially prevalent in people with anxiety disorders, although estimates of comorbidity vary widely due to differences in (among others) diagnostic instruments. Research suggests that approximately 10–50% of people who have panic disorder with agoraphobia have avoidant personality disorder, as well as about 20–40% of people who have social phobia (social anxiety disorder).
Some studies report prevalence rates of up to 45% among people with generalized anxiety disorder and up to 56% of those with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Van Velzen, C. J. M. (2002). Social Phobia and Personality Disorders: Comorbidity and Treatment Issues. Groningen: University Library Groningen. (online version)

==Treatment==

Treatment of avoidant personality disorder can employ various techniques, such as social skills training, cognitive therapy, exposure treatment to gradually increase social contacts, group therapy for practicing social skills, and sometimes drug therapy.Comer, R. J. (1996). Fundamentals of Abnormal Psychology. Avoidant personality disorder, pp. 428–430. Third edition. New York: Worth. A key issue in treatment is gaining and keeping the patient's trust, since people with avoidant personality disorder will often start to avoid treatment sessions if they distrust the therapist or fear rejection. The primary purpose of both individual therapy and social skills group training is for individuals with avoidant personality disorder to begin challenging their exaggerated negative beliefs about themselves.[tpl]cite web|author=Eckleberry, Sharon C.|title=Dual Diagnosis and the Avoidant Personality Disorder|date=2000-03-25|work=The Dual Diagnosis Pages: From Our Desk|url=http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/avoid.htm|accessdate=2007-02-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061216233724/http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/avoid.htm|archivedate=2006-12-16[/tpl]
People with AvPD can improve social awareness and skills, but with deep-seated feelings of inferiority and significant social fear, these patterns usually do not change dramatically. MAOIs such as Phenelzine can be very helpful by increasing confidence and the feeling of wanting to become more socially active.[tpl]cite web|title=Avoidant personality disorder|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/avoidant-personality-disorder|publisher=Healthline Networks. 2003.|accessdate=25 October 2011[/tpl]

==Epidemiology==

According to the DSM-IV-TR, avoidant personality disorder occurs in approximately 0.1% to 0.5% of the general population.[tpl]cite book|last1=Webb|first1=James T.|last2=Amend|first2=Edward R.|last3=Webb|first3=Nadia|title=Misdiagnosis and dual diagnoses of gifted children and adults: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, bipolar, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Asperger's, depression, and other disorders|publisher=Great Potential Press, Inc|year=2005|pages=112|chapter=Ideational and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NQrtt-peg5AC&pg=PT149|isbn=0-910707-67-7[/tpl] However, data from the 2001-02 National Epidemiologic Survery on Alcohol and Related Conditions indicates a prevalence rate of the disorder of 0.36% in the American general population.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Bridget F.|last2=Hasin|first2=Deborah S.|last3=Stinson|first3=Frederick S.|last4=Dawson|first4=Deborah A.|last5=Chou|first5=S.

==History==

The avoidant personality has been described in several sources as far back as the early 1900s, although it was not so named for some time. Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler described patients who exhibited signs of avoidant personality disorder in his 1911 work Dementia Praecox: Or the Group of Schizophrenias.[tpl]cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|last2=Martinez|first2=Alexandra|editor-last=Livesley|editor-first=W.

Springer|year=1921[/tpl] in providing the first relatively complete description, developed a distinction.
