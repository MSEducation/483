John C. Erickson developed an industry-recognized prototype lifestyle for moderate-income retirees at the Charlestown Retirement Community in Catonsville, Maryland in 1983. Erickson converted the turn-of-the-century abandoned seminary at Charlestown into America's largest continuing care retirement community (CCRC) by 2000, with 2,500 residents.

Other Erickson communities, built following the success at Charlestown, include a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company on a $135 million campus in Novi, Michigan; Oak Crest Village in Parkville, Maryland; and communities in Springfield, Virginia; Ashburn, Virginia; Bucks County, Pennsylvania; Delaware County, Pennsylvania; Tinton Falls, New Jersey; Pompton Plains, New Jersey; Highlands Ranch, Colorado; Overland Park, Kansas; Houston, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Silver Spring, Maryland; Peabody, Massachusetts; and Hingham, Massachusetts.
Erickson Retirement was in the midst of a major expansion in several metropolitan markets when the severe downturn in housing sales brought on by the financial crisis of 2008 made it impossible for the company to continue meeting all of its loan obligations. On October 20, 2009, after an unsuccessful search for alternative funding sources, Erickson Retirement Communities filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The company emerged from bankruptcy within a few months of filing and has since been re-branded as Erickson Living.
In 2008, the company was identified as one of the best places to work in America.

John C. Erickson, CEO and Chairman of Erickson Retirement Communities, a privately held company based in Baltimore and founded in 1983, created RLTV Retirement Living TV with the goal of establishing a dominant one-stop portal for boomers and seniors.   Mr. Erickson has been involved in the senior care industry since the early 1970s, acquiring and developing moderate-income retirement housing in Florida and Arizona. In 1983, he began concentrating on providing full-service continuing care retirement housing in the northeastern United States with the flagship community of Charlestown, near Baltimore.

==Erickson Foundation==

Mr. Erickson and his family are enthusiastically dedicated to the study and promotion of healthy and positive aging in our society.  John and his wife Nancy founded the Erickson Foundation, which donated $5 million toward the formation of the Erickson School of Aging Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).

Moreover, the Foundation funded the NorthBay Adventure Camp, which mentors at-risk Baltimore-area sixth graders on decision-making for a brighter future. The Erickson Foundation is a founding member of the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, which was formed in partnership with the largest health care provider organizations in Maryland in the interest of establishing a statewide health information exchange.
