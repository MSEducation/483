[[X]]

CATEGORIES: ISO basic Latin letters, Placeholder names

X (named ex [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s[/tpl], plural exes"X", Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition (1989); Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged (1993); "ex", op. cit.) is the twenty-fourth letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. In Roman numerals, it represents 10.

==History==

In Ancient Greek, 'Χ' and 'Ψ' were among several variants of the same letter, used originally for [tpl]IPA|/kʰ/[/tpl] and later, in western areas such as Arcadia, as a simplification of the digraph 'ΧΣ' for [tpl]IPA|/ks/[/tpl]. In the end, more conservative eastern forms became the standard of Classical Greek, and thus 'Χ' (Chi) stands for [tpl]IPA|/kʰ/[/tpl] (later [tpl]IPA|/x/[/tpl]). However, the Etruscans had taken over 'Χ' from western Greek, and it therefore stands for [tpl]IPA|/ks/[/tpl] in Etruscan and Latin.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The letter 'Χ' ~ 'Ψ' for [tpl]IPA|/kʰ/[/tpl] was a Greek addition to the alphabet, placed after the Semitic letters along with phi 'Φ' for [tpl]IPA|/pʰ/[/tpl]. (The variant 'Ψ' later replaced the digraph 'ΦΣ' for [tpl]IPA|/ps/[/tpl]; omega was a later addition).[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl].

==Use in English==

In English orthography, x is typically pronounced as the voiceless consonant cluster [tpl]IPAc-en|k|s[/tpl] when it follows the stressed vowel, and the voiced consonant [tpl]IPAc-en|ɡ|z[/tpl] when it precedes the stressed vowel (e.g. 'exam'), or when it precedes a silent 'h' and an accented vowel ('exhaust').[tpl]cite book |first=Richard |last=Venezky|title=The Structure of English Orthography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mrt_G_RrJykC&pg=PA5|date=1 January 1970|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080447-8|pages=40[/tpl] Before 'i' or 'u' it can also be pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|k|ʃ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ɡ|ʒ[/tpl] for example, in the words 'sexual' and 'luxury', respectively: these result from earlier [tpl]IPAc-en|k|s|j[/tpl] and [tpl]IPAc-en|g|z|j[/tpl]. It also makes the sound [tpl]IPAc-en|k|ʃ[/tpl] in words ending in -xion (typically used only in British-based spellings of the language; American spellings tend to use -ction). Word-final 'x' is always [tpl]IPAc-en|k|s[/tpl] (e.g. 'ax'/'axe') except in loan words such as 'faux' (see French, below).
In abbreviations, it can represent "trans-" (e.g. XMIT for transmit, XFER for transfer), "cross-" (e.g. X-ing for crossing; XREF for cross-reference), "Christ" as shorthand for the labarum (e.g. Xmas for Christmas; Xian for Christian), the "Crys" in Crystal (XTAL), or various words starting with "ex" (e.g. XL for extra large; XOR for exclusive-or).
There are very few English words that start with X – the least amount of any letter. Many of the words that do start with X are either standardized trademarks (Xerox) or acronyms (XC). No words in the Basic English vocabulary begin with 'X', but it occurs in words beginning with other letters.
X is the third least common letter in English, with a frequency of about 0.15% in words. It is, however, more frequent than Q and Z.[tpl]cite web |last=Mička |first=Pavel |title=Letter frequency (English) |url=http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |website=Algoritmy.net |accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]

==Use in other languages==

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, [tpl]IPA|x[/tpl] represents a voiceless velar fricative.
In Latin, 'x' stood for [tpl]IPA|ks[/tpl]. In some languages, as a result of assorted phonetic changes, handwriting adaptations or simply spelling convention, 'x' has other pronunciations:
Additionally, in languages for which the Latin alphabet has been adapted only recently, 'x' has been used for various sounds, in some cases inspired by European usage, but in others, for consonants uncommon in Europe. For these no Latin letter stands out as an obvious choice, and since most of the various European pronunciations of 'x' can be written by other means, the letter becomes available for more unusual sounds.

==Metalinguistic usage==

In mathematics, 'x' is commonly used as the name for an independent variable or unknown value.  The modern tradition of using 'x' to represent an unknown was started by René Descartes in La Géométrie (1637).[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7juWmvQSTvwC&pg=PA382 |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |first=Florian |last=Cajori |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1993 |website=Google Books [/tpl]

==Computing codes==

In the C programming language, 'x' preceded by zero (0x or 0X) is used to denote hexadecimal literal values.
