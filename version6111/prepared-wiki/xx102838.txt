==Personal life==

===Childhood===

Sarah Waters was born in Neyland, Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1966.
She grew up in a family that included her father Ron, mother Mary, and a sister. Her mother was a housewife and her father an engineer who worked on oil refineries.[tpl]cite news |last=Allardice |first=Lisa |title=Uncharted Waters |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date =1 June 2006 | url =http://books.guardian.co.uk/hay2006/story/0,,1787355,00.html |accessdate =24 February 2007 [/tpl] She describes her family as "pretty idyllic, very safe and nurturing". Her father, "a fantastically creative person", encouraged her to build and invent.[tpl]cite news |last=McGrane |first=Michelle |title=Sarah Waters on writing: 'If I waited for inspiration to strike, it would never happen!'

Waters said, "When I picture myself as a child, I see myself constructing something, out of plasticine or papier-mâché or Meccano; I used to enjoy writing poems and stories, too." She wrote stories and poems that she describes as "dreadful gothic pastiches", but had not planned her career. Despite her obvious enjoyment of writing, she did not feel any special calling or preference for becoming a novelist in her youth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/features/144/2.html |title=Sarah Waters: Interview |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 July 2012[/tpl]

===Education===

After Milford Haven Grammar School, Waters attended university, and earned degrees in English literature. She received a BA from the University of Kent, an MA from Lancaster University, and a PhD from Queen Mary, University of London. Her PhD thesis, entitled Wolfskins and togas : lesbian and gay historical fictions, 1870 to the present,The thesis can be downloaded from the British Library's EthOS Archive: uk.bl.ethos.393332 served as inspiration and material for future books. As part of her research she read 19th-century pornography, in which she came across the title of her first book, Tipping the Velvet. However, her literary influences are also found in the popular classics of Victorian literature, such as Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and the Brontës, and in the contemporary novelists that combine a keen interest in Victoriana with a post-modernist approach to fiction, especially A.S. Byatt and John Fowles. Angela Carter's 'Nights at the Circus' had a huge influence on her début novel as well, and Waters praises her for her literary prose, her "common touch", and her commitment to feminism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.argief.litnet.co.za/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&news_id=3630&cause_id=1270 |title=Sarah Waters on writing: If I waited for inspiration to strike, it would never happen! |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 July 2012[/tpl]

==Career==

Before writing novels, Waters worked as an academic, earning a doctorate and teaching.[tpl]cite news |last=Page |first=Benedicte |title=Her Thieving Hands |publisher=Virago |url=http://www.virago.co.uk/author_results.asp?SF1=data&ST1=feature&REF=e2006111617063697&SORT=author_id&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&LANG=en |accessdate=17 November 2011[/tpl] Waters went directly from her doctoral thesis to her first novel. It was during the process of writing her thesis that she thought she would write a novel; she began as soon as the thesis was complete. Her work is very research-intensive, which is an aspect she enjoys.[tpl]cite news | last =Lo | first =Malinda | title =Interview with Sarah Waters | publisher =AfterEllen.com | date =6 April 2006 | url =http://www.afterellen.com/Print/2006/4/waters.html | accessdate =17 November 2011 [/tpl] Waters was briefly a member of the long-running London North Writers circle, whose members have included the novelists Charles Palliser and Neil Blackmore, among others.[tpl]cite web | title =North London Writers Official Website | url =http://www.northlondonwriters.co.uk/ | accessdate =17 November 2011 [/tpl]
With the exception of her most recent book, The Little Stranger, all of her books contain lesbian themes, and she does not mind being labelled a lesbian writer. She said, "I'm writing with a clear lesbian agenda in the novels. It's right there at the heart of the books." Despite this "common agenda in teasing out lesbian stories from parts of history that are regarded as quite heterosexual",[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/sarah-waters-is-there-a-poltergeist-within-me-1692335.html |title=Sarah Waters: 'Is there a poltergeist within me?' |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 July 2012 |location=London |work=The Independent |date=29 May 2009[/tpl] she also calls her lesbian protagonists "incidental", due to her own sexual orientation. "That's how it is in my life, and that's how it is, really, for most lesbian and gay people, isn't it? It's sort of just there in your life."

===Tipping the Velvet (1998)===

Her debut work was the Victorian picaresque Tipping the Velvet, published by Virago in 1998. The novel took 18 months to write.[tpl]cite news |last=Hogan |first=Ron |title=Sarah Waters (Interview) |publisher=IndieBound |url=http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/waterssarah |accessdate=17 November 2011[/tpl] The book takes its title from Victorian slang for cunnilingus. Waters describes the novel as a "very upbeat ... kind of a romp".
It won a 1999 Betty Trask Award, and was shortlisted for the Mail on Sunday / John Llewellyn Rhys Prize.
In 2002, the novel was adapted into a three-part television serial of the same name for BBC Two. It has been translated into at least 24 languages, including Chinese, Latvian, Hungarian, Korean and Slovenian.[tpl]cite news | title =Sarah Waters: Interview | publisher =Time Out London | url =http://www.timeout.com/london/books/features/144.html | accessdate =24 February 2007[/tpl]

===Affinity (1999)===

Waters's second book, Affinity was published a year after her first, in 1999. The novel, also set in the Victorian era, centres on the world of Victorian Spiritualism. While finishing her debut novel, Waters had been working on an academic paper on spiritualism. She combined her interests in spiritualism, prisons, and the Victorian era in Affinity, which tells the story of the relationship between an upper middle-class woman and an imprisoned spiritualist.
The novel is less light-hearted than the ones that preceded and followed it. Waters found it less enjoyable to write. "It was a very gloomy world to have to go into every day", she said.[tpl]cite news | title =Sarah Waters: From Victoria to VE Day (Interview) | publisher =Powells | url =http://www.powells.com/authors/sarahwaters.html | accessdate =24 February 2007[/tpl]
Affinity won the Stonewall Book Award and Somerset Maugham Award. Andrew Davies wrote a screenplay adapting Affinity and the resulting feature film premiered 19 June 2008 at the opening night of Frameline the San Francisco LGBT Film Festival at the Castro Theater.

===Fingersmith (2002)===

Fingersmith was published in 2002. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize.
Fingersmith was made into a serial for BBC One in 2005, starring Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy and Imelda Staunton. Waters approved of the adaptation, calling it "a really good quality show", and said it was "very faithful to the book. It was spookily faithful to the book at times, which was exciting."

===The Night Watch (2006)===

The Night Watch took four years for Waters to write. It differs from the first three novels in its time period and its structure. Although her thesis and previous books focused on the 19th century, Waters said that "Something about the 1940s called to me". It was also less tightly plotted than her other books. Waters said,
The novel tells the stories of a man and three women in 1940s London. Waters describes it as "fundamentally a novel about disappointment and loss and betrayal", as well as "real contact between people and genuine intimacy".
In 2005, Waters received the highest bid (£1,000) during a charity auction in which the prize was the opportunity to have the winner's name immortalised in The Night Watch. The auction featured many notable British novelists, and the name of the bidder, author Martina Cole, appeared in Waters' novel.[tpl]cite news  | title =Book role auction nudges £20,000 |publisher=BBC News | date =31 March 2004 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3586013.stm | accessdate =24 February 2007[/tpl]
The Night Watch was adapted for television by BBC2 and broadcast on 12 July 2011.

===The Little Stranger  (2009)===

Also set in the 1940s, The Little Stranger  also differs from Waters' previous novels. It is her first with no overtly lesbian characters. Initially, Waters set out to write a book about the economic changes brought by socialism in postwar Britain, and reviewers note the connection with Evelyn Waugh.Didock, Barry (30 May 2009). "Capturing the spirit of the age: A haunting novel evokes the claustrophobia of postwar Britain", The Herald (Glasgow), p. 9. During the novel's construction, it turned into a ghost story, focussing on a gentry family who own a large country house they can no longer afford to maintain.
