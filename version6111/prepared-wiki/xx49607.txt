[[Firmicutes]]

CATEGORIES: Firmicutes

The Firmicutes (Latin: firmus, strong, and cutis, skin, referring to the cell wall) are a phylum of bacteria, most of which have Gram-positive cell wall structure.[tpl]DorlandsDict|three/000040400|Firmicutes[/tpl] A few, however, such as Megasphaera, Pectinatus, Selenomonas and Zymophilus, have a porous pseudo-outer-membrane that causes them to stain Gram-negative. Scientists once classified the Firmicutes to include all Gram-positive bacteria, but have recently defined them to be of a core group of related forms called the low-G+C group, in contrast to the Actinobacteria. They have round cells, called cocci (singular coccus), or rod-like forms (bacillus).
Many Firmicutes produce endospores, which are resistant to desiccation and can survive extreme conditions. They are found in various environments, and the group includes some notable pathogens. Those in one family, the heliobacteria, produce energy through photosynthesis. Firmicutes play an important role in beer, wine, and cider spoilage.

==Classes==

The group is typically divided into the Clostridia, which are anaerobic, the Bacilli, which are obligate or facultative aerobes, and the Mollicutes.
On phylogenetic trees, the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic, as do their main genera, Clostridium and Bacillus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wolf M, Müller T, Dandekar T, Pollack JD |title=Phylogeny of Firmicutes with special reference to Mycoplasma (Mollicutes) as inferred from phosphoglycerate kinase amino acid sequence data |journal=Int.

==Phylogeny==

The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) [tpl]cite web |author = J.P.

and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 111 by The All-Species Living Tree Project All-Species Living Tree Project.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_111/LTPs111_SSU_tree.pdf | title=16S rRNA-based LTP release 111 (full tree) | publisher=Silva Comprehensive Ribosomal RNA Database http://www.arb-silva.de/projects/living-tree | accessdate=2013-03-20[/tpl]

==Genera==

While there are currently more than 274 genera within the Firmicutes phylum, notable genera of Firmicutes include:
Bacilli, order Bacillales
Bacilli, order Lactobacillales
Clostridia
Erysipelotrichi

==Health implications==

Firmicutes make up the largest portion of the mouse and human gut microbiome.Ley RE, Peterson, DA, Gordon JI. Ecological and Evolutionary Forces Shaping Microbial Diversity in the Human Intestine. Cell. 2006 Feb 24; 124:837-848. The division Firmicutes as part of the gut flora has been shown to be involved in energy resorption and obesity.Ley RE, Turnbaugh PJ, Klein S, Gordon JI. Microbial ecology: human gut microbes associated with obesity. Nature. 2006 Dec 21;444(7122):1022-3.

==Laboratory detection==

While there has up to this point in time not been a way to categorically define a given bacterium as belonging to Firmicutes, as the phylum is highly diverse in phenotypic characteristics due to its members' promiscuous plasmid exchange across species and genera, the presence of Firmicutes can now be detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.[tpl]cite journal |author=Haakensen M, Dobson CM, Deneer H, Ziola B |title=Real-time PCR detection of bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes Phylum |journal=Int. J. Food Microbiol. |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=236–41 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18501458 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.04.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168-1605(08)00167-0 |accessdate=2008-09-28[/tpl]
