Work Out in the Zone (previously known as Work Out) is a reality television series on Bravo. The show is centered around fitness trainers and models located in the many cities of California. The first three seasons featured many of the trainers who work for fitness trainer Jackie Warner, and some other aspects of the gym and its clients as well as Warner's other fitness ventures, and private life. The third season of Work Out ended on June 10, 2008, and was canceled. A fourth season is currently held in production, with eight different trainers cast for the show. Warner, will not return for the fourth season, after the network was not pleased with her interaction with the other trainers. The fourth season, which will revamp the show's concept, will mainly feature top fitness model and former army ranger Greg Plitt, who is the only cast member to return from the previous season.

===Work Out: Seasons 1-3===

In 2003, fitness expert Jackie Warner opened Sky Sport and Spa. On July 19, 2006, the Bravo network aired the first episode of Work Out (developed following Jackie's appearance on Jonathan Antin's Bravo reality series Blow Out). The show follows the day-to-day routine of Jackie and shows all of the drama that goes on behind the scenes in keeping a business afloat, while juggling her own personal life, as well as dealing with the personal issues of those who work for her as trainers.http://www.skysportspa.com/jackie_warner.aspxhttp://www.skysportspa.com/trainwithjackie.aspx

===Work Out in the Zone: Season 4===

In 2011, top fitness model Greg Plitt signed an exclusive contract with Bravo to document his fitness ventures and other commercial projects for a soon-to-air reality television show. This led to Plitt bringing back the idea of reviving Work Out, in which he was one of the trainers. As Bravo has declined to include Jackie Warner, the main character of all previous three seasons, to join the show, Plitt decided to contact several of his friends in the industry who are fitness models and trainers to join him. Seven trainers were chosen and are willing to let the show document their personal and professional lives.
