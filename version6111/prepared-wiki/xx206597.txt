Chalene Johnson is an American physical fitness authority, choreographer, author, and entrepreneur.  Chalene Johnson started studying dance and martial arts at age 3. As a child, she followed her mother to her Jazzercise classes and saw that they were all about music and dancing and just a lot of fun. She continued training in tae kwon do, dance, and aerobics while a student at Michigan State University. After moving to California in the early '90s, she worked as a paralegal and applied to law school. At that time personal training was becoming very popular and she began training before and after work, she quickly realized that she had a passion for fitness. Years later, she created a group exercise class that combined dance and kickboxing. This led to the creation of TurboJam home fitness exercise program. Since TurboJam, Johnson has launched the very similar TurboKick, PiYo, and Hip Hop Hustle which are all available in gyms in the United States and Australia.http://www.turbokick.com She has also launched TurboFire, which is a Beachbody DVD exercise program.
