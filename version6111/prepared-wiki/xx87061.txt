In 1994, he was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger and former Raleigh police chief Fred Heineman,  who won by a margin of less than 1%[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28958 |title=NC District 4 Race - Nov 08, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl] during the Republican Revolution, in part to lower-than-expected turnout in the Democratic stronghold of Orange County[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] (home to Chapel Hill), but despite the fact that heavily Republican Randolph County had been eliminated from the Fourth District during redistricting prior to that election year.

Price's opponent in the 2008 election was Republican B.J. Lawson. Lawson was called the most formidable opposition Price has faced since he was defeated by Heineman in 1994. For example, he ran television ads, which Price's opponents hadn't done in at least a decade. Despite increased efforts and expenditures by his Republican opponent, Price still defeated Lawson 63% to 37%.
On September 8, 2010, Price launched his reelection campaign. Price defeated Lawson in a rematch 56% to 44%.
