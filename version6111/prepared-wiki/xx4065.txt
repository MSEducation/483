</ref> The growth of the China trade in British ships increased the Company’s desire for bases in the region. Various islands were used for this purpose, but the first permanent acquisition was [[Penang]], leased from the [[Sultan of Kedah]] in 1786.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/malaya.htm |title=The Map Room: South East Asia: Malaya |publisher=British Empire |accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl]</ref> This was followed soon after by the leasing of a block of territory on the mainland opposite Penang (known as [[Province Wellesley]]). In 1795, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British with the consent of the Netherlands occupied Dutch Melaka to forestall possible French interest in the area.<ref name="state.gov"/>
When Malacca was handed back to the Dutch in 1815, the British governor, Stamford Raffles, looked for an alternative base, and in 1819 he acquired Singapore from the Sultan of Johor.[tpl]cite web|author=BCLim |url=http://www.mymalaysiabooks.com/malaysia/Malaysia_history.htm#British_Malaya |title=History of Malaya, Malaysia by mymalaysiabooks |publisher=Mymalaysiabooks.com |accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl] The exchange of the British colony of Bencoolen for Malacca with the Dutch left the British as the sole colonial power on the peninsula. The territories of the British were set up as free ports, attempting to break the monopoly held by other colonial powers as the time, and making them large bases of trade. They allowed Britain to control all trade through the straits of Malacca. British influence was increased by Malayan fears of Siamese expansionism, to which Britain made a useful counterweight.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] During the 19th century the Malay Sultans aligned themselves the British Empire, due to the benefits of associations with the British and the belief in superior British civilisation.
In 1824 British hegemony in Malaya (before the name Malaysia) was formalised by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, which divided the Malay archipelago between Britain and the Netherlands. The Dutch evacuated Melaka and renounced all interest in Malaya, while the British recognised Dutch rule over the rest of the East Indies. By 1826 the British controlled Penang, Malacca, Singapore, and the island of Labuan, which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements, administered first under the East India Company until 1867, when they were transferred to the Colonial Office in London.

===Federated and Unfederated Malay States===

Initially, the British followed a policy of non-intervention in relation between the Malay states.See: [tpl]Cite web |url= http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/small/cab-129-1-cp-133.pdf |title=Policy in regard to Malaya and Borneo |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] by the Government of the United Kingdom The commercial importance of tin mining in the Malay states to merchants in the Straits Settlements led to infighting between the aristocracy on the peninsula. The destabilisation of these states damaged the commerce in the area, causing British intervention. The wealth of Perak’s tin mines made political stability there a priority for British investors, and Perak was thus the first Malay state to agree to the supervision of a British resident. British gunboat diplomacy was employed to bring about a peaceful resolution to civil disturbances caused by Chinese and Malay gangsters employed in a political tussle between Ngah Ibrahim and Raja Muda Abdullah. The Pangkor Treaty of 1874 paved the way for the expansion of British influence in Malaya. The British concluded treaties with some Malay states, installing “residents” who advised the Sultans and soon became the effective rulers of their states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/478/mode/2up |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica : a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=17 October 2010[/tpl] These advisors held power in everything except to do with Malay religion and customs.
Johore alone resisted, by modernising and giving British and Chinese investors legal protection. By the turn of the 20th century, the states of Pahang, Selangor, Perak, and Negeri Sembilan, known together as the Federated Malay States, had British advisors. In 1909 the Siamese kingdom was compelled to cede Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu, which already had British advisors, over to the British. Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor and Queen Victoria were personal acquaintances who recognised each other as equals. It was not until 1914 that Sultan Abu Bakar's successor, Sultan Ibrahim accepted a British adviser.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The four previously Thai states and Johor were known as the Unfederated Malay States. The states under the most direct British control developed rapidly, becoming the largest suppliers in the world of first tin, then rubber.

===19th-century Borneo===

During the late 19th century the British also gained control of the north coast of Borneo, where Dutch rule had never been established. Development on the Peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century.[ref]
