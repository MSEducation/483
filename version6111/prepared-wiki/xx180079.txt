CATEGORIES: Civil parishes in Cumbria, Hamlets in Cumbria

Crosby Garrett is a hamlet and civil parish in the Eden District of Cumbria, England. It was formerly in the county of Westmorland.
The place-name 'Crosby Garrett' is first attested in a document of 1200, where it appears as Crosseby, and in another of 1206, where it appears as Crossebi Gerard. The first name is Old Scandinavian Krossa-byr, meaning 'village or homestead with crosses'. 'Garrett' is the French personal name 'Gerard', which is ultimately of Germanic origin.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.132.
In May 2010 the Crosby Garrett Helmet, a copper alloy parade helmet dating to Roman Britain, was discovered near the hamlet by a father and son using a metal detector. The helmet was sold to a private buyer at Christie's later that year for Â£2.3 million.

==Crosby Garrett Helmet==

In May 2010 a rare ceremonial Roman helmet was discovered by an unnamed metal detectorist not far from a Roman road near the hamlet. The copper-alloy helmet with integral mask, with the appearance of a youthful male face, and a griffin crest, is only one of three recorded finds of its kind in Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8000018/Rare-Roman-helmet-and-face-mask-discovered.html|title=Rare Roman helmet and face-mask discovered|work=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=13 September 2010[/tpl]
