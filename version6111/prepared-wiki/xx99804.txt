==Biography==

===Early life===

The son of a school principal, he was raised in the town of Haileybury, Ontario.  He became a freelance writer shortly after high school. He and his family moved to Whitby, Ontario, in 1936. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
This period is described in his 1975 book A Kid in Haileybury.

===Journalist===

As a young man he worked in Sudbury, Ontario, as a newspaper reporter, then for a weekly paper in Toronto, before taking a job at the Springfield Republican newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts.

===Stratemeyer Syndicate===

While in the U.S., he replied to a want ad placed by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, publisher of such titles as Nancy Drew, Tom Swift and the Bobbsey Twins. As a result, he freelanced in 1926 and 1927 as one of the authors using the pseudonym Roy Rockwood to write seven of the Dave Fearless serialized mystery novels.[tpl]cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=The Hardy Boys Mystery | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/08/the-hardy-boys-mystery_27.html |work=Children's books |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Washington| date=2013-08-27[/tpl]

====The Hardy Boys====

This led to his involvement with the Hardy Boys, a project on which he was a large contributor, writing 19 of the first 25 books between 1927 and 1946, and 21 overall. He also wrote books in several other juvenile series, published in pulp magazines, novellas or novels over his fifty year career, at one point writing six novels in one year. McFarlane earned as little as $85 per book during the Great Depression, yet he continued because he had a growing family.
According to his son, McFarlane regarded the Hardy Boys books as a nuisance. "In his diaries, my father talks about having to write another of those nuisent books, in order to earn another $85 to buy coal for the furnace. And he never read them over afterward. It was only much later that he accepted plaudits for the work."
His daughter, Norah McFarlane Perez, said in an interview that "They'd give him an outline, but to make it palatable, he'd come up with different characters and add colour and use large words, and inject his wonderful sense of humour. And then he'd finish and say, 'I will never write another juvenile book.' But then the bills would pile up and he'd start another."
However, McFarlane was not bitter about not earning a cut of the enormous revenues generated by his work. "He was very philosophical about it. His attitude was, 'Look, I took these on and I was glad to get the deal.' There was no rancour," according to his daughter.

====Nancy Drew, The Dana Girls====

McFarlane also wrote the first four volumes of The Dana Girls series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene,[tpl]cite book|last=McFarlane |first=Leslie |title="Ghost of the Hardy Boys", 1976 |pages=198–9| publisher=Methuen Publications|year=1976| isbn=0-8467-0157-X[/tpl] which the Syndicate also used for the Nancy Drew series of books. Although there are claims that his last Hardy Boys book, The Phantom Freighter, was actually written by his wife Amy,"Remembering Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane," CBC Radio his biographer Marilyn Greenwald concluded that this was unlikely.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenwald|first=Marilyn S.|title=The Secret of the Hardy Boys: Leslie McFarlane and the Stratemeyer Syndicate|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athwens, GA|year=2004|isbn=0-8214-1547-6|url=http://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Secret+of+the+Hardy+Boys[/tpl]
In his 1976 autobiography Ghost of the Hardy Boys, McFarlane says that The Phantom Freighter "was written in 1946 in motel rooms at night on a location in Nova Scotia when I was directing a film".

===Film and television work===

While still writing for the series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, McFarlane returned to Canada to work for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). As part of the NFB in Montreal, he wrote and directed documentaries and short dramas including the 1951 documentary Royal Journey, Here's Hockey, a 1953 documentary about ice hockey featuring Montreal Canadiens star Jean Beliveau. He also wrote the documentary titled Herring Hunt, nominated for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=14205|title=Herring Hunt|year=1953|work=Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] Moving to Toronto he wrote for CBC television and at the suggestion of his friend Lorne Greene.
