[[Los Angeles Anacondas]]

CATEGORIES: International Fight League

The Los Angeles Anacondas were an International Fight League team based in Los Angeles, California. The Anacondas were the first IFL team to have gone through not just one coach but two. Originally coached by three time King of Pancrase and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Bas Rutten, and then coached by Canadian MMA practitioner Shawn Tompkins, the Anacondas are now without a coach entering the offseason.
The Anacondas were one of four teams competing in the IFL's inaugural season. As of March 2007, the Anacondas were the only IFL team to hold two perfect sweeps (5 wins and no losses) over opposing teams (the Tokyo Sabres on September 9, 2006 and the San Jose Razorclaws on March 17, 2007).
During the inaugural 2007 IFL Grand Prix, the Anacondas had the most members from their team participate with an astounding four out of five members.
