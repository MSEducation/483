Clonakilty RFC is an Irish rugby club. They play in Division 1 of the Munster Junior League.
Clonakilty Rugby Club as it is now was formed in 1977 at a meeting in the Kilty Stone Tavern which has remained the spiritual home of the club ever since. The main reason at that time for the reformation of the club was to provide a social outlet for those involved.
Rugby had been played for periods previously in the town. In 1890 a Clonakilty side competed in the Munster Senior Cup for the first time. The club played their games in The Showgrounds but disbanded in the early 1900s. Clonakilty RFC took the field again in the 1930s when Paul Blewitt, father of former Hon. Sec. Jimmy Blewitt was a stalwart player and administrator. The club disbanded again before the Second World War and was not heard of again until that fateful evening in the Kilty Stone Tavern in 1977.
Clonakilty RFC is located in a small town of approximately 4.000 inhabitants; this is remarkable in that most of the principal clubs come out of Cork (120,000) and Limerick (90,000).
The club commenced competitive rugby at Minor A level and won its first trophy, the Dromleena Cup in 1978. 
Following victories in 1980 and 1982 in the Minor A league it was decided to move up to Junior grade in 1982/83.
The O'Neill Cup was won in the 1995/96 season (against Bandon in the final) and the Junior 1 team won promotion to the 1st Division as well as winning two local cups and the annual "Jimmy Blewitt Memorial Cup" played between Clonakilty and Donaghadee.
In 2001, Clonakilty reached the top of Munster regional rugby and obtained promotion through a round-robin league by winning over champion sides of the three other provinces. 
Since then, the club won the title of the Senior Third Division in 2006. 
Promoted to Senior second division, and obtained a brilliant third place the following season in the Second Division places.
