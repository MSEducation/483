The Audi S6 is the high performance variant of the Audi A6, an executive car produced by German automaker Audi.AudiWorld.com North American S6 Model Guide - historical S6 specifications, prices, and options  It went on sale in 1994, shortly after the "A6" designation was introduced, replacing the "100" nameplate.
The original S6 (Ur-S6) was largely the same car as the outgoing, original Audi S4 (C4) (Ur-S4), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging. In certain markets where the even-higher performance RS6 which is also based on the A6 is not sold, the S6 is the most powerful A6 trim there.
The S6, like all Audi "S" models, is fitted as standard with Audi's trademark quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, the S6 using the Torsen-based permanent 4WD.

==C4 (Typ 4A, 1994–1997)[tpl]anchor|C4[/tpl]==

Audi was restructuring their model lineup in early and mid-1990s, and in late 1994, began selling the fifth generation (C4) Audi 100 model, re-badged as the Audi A6.  Wanting to keep a sports-saloon in their lineup, the company made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4, renaming it the Audi S6; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller Volkswagen Group B platform-based Audi A4.  As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the Ur-S6, derived from the German augmentive, "Ursprünglich" (meaning: original).
It was available as both a saloon/sedan (typ 4A5), and an "Avant" (typ 4A9) (estate/wagon) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia.  Audi's trademark "procon-ten" safety system was standard fitment.

===C4 powertrain===

From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a [tpl]convert|2226|cc|1|lk=on[/tpl] turbocharged inline five-cylinder petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU), producing a motive power output of [tpl]convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on[/tpl] at 5,900 revolutions per minute (rpm), and [tpl]convert|326|Nm|0|lk=on[/tpl] at around 1,950 rpm, whilst consuming high octane "Super Plus" 98RON unleaded petrol.  This powerful engine gave the S6 good performance with a top speed of [tpl]convert|235|km/h|1[/tpl], and 0 to [tpl]convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in 6.7 seconds; with [tpl]convert|160|km/h|1|abbr=on[/tpl] being reached in 17.5 seconds.
The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic Torsen T-1 quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.
Audi made a high-performance, 4.2 litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a [tpl]convert|213|kW|PS bhp|0[/tpl] version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2 litre inline five-cylinder turbo.  Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive.  A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.

===C4 brakes, wheels and tyres===

C4 braking system included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear; with [tpl]convert|314|mm|1[/tpl] diameter by [tpl]convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] thick discs, with two-piston floating Girling calipers bearing the interlocking four-ringed Audi logo, and four individual pads per caliper up front, and [tpl]convert|269|mm|1[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|20|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] discs with Lucas single-piston sliding calipers at the rear.  Bosch Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with EDS was also standard.
Standard wheels were 7½Jx16 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels with 225/50 R16 tyres. Later cars received 8Jx17 "Avus" wheels with 255/40 R17 tyres.  An optional 7½Jx15 five-arm alloy wheel, with 215/60 R15 tyres, an 8Jx16 five double-spoke alloy, an 8Jx17 10-spoke alloy were also available.

===Audi S6 PLUS[tpl]anchor|S6+[/tpl]===

As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 PLUS was briefly available to European customers.  The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997).  A total of 952 cars were produced–855 Avant, and 97 saloons.
It was powered by another version of the 32 valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2 litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH).  Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the internal combustion engine, increasing the motive power to [tpl]convert|240|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on[/tpl].  It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.
Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and roadwheels.  The front brake discs were enlarged to [tpl]convert|323|mm|1[/tpl] in diameter by [tpl]convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] thick.  Standard roadwheels were 8Jx17 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.
With so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach [tpl]convert|100|km/h|1[/tpl] from a standstill in 5.6 seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7 seconds, making it comparable in terms of acceleration to vehicles like the Porsche 944 Turbo.
Hella xenon high intensity discharge (HID) headlamps (still with the C4s triple bulb design) were available as an option.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==C5 (Typ 4B, 1999–2003)[tpl]anchor|C5[/tpl]==

In late 1997, Audi introduced an all-new range of Audi A6 models, based on the Volkswagen Group C5 platform.  A new Audi S6, now officially known as the Audi S6 quattro appeared in 1999, to complement its A6 platform-mate.  It was available in a four-door saloon/sedan and a five-door Avant (estate/wagon).  In North America, the Avant bodystyle was the only version available.  The vehicle could accelerate from standstill to [tpl]convert|100|km/h|1[/tpl] in  5.7 seconds, and from 0 to [tpl]convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in just 21.7 seconds.  The top speed was electronically governed to [tpl]convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on[/tpl].
This generation of S6 went out of production in 2003.

===C5 powertrain===

The engine was a new rubber-hydro mounted all-aluminium alloy 4.2 litre 40-valve (five valves per cylinder) 90° V8 (parts code: 077, identification codes: AQJ 99-May 1, ANK 00-onwards). It had double overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank and solenoid-operated magnesium two-stage variable intake manifold.  It displaced [tpl]convert|4172|cc|1|[/tpl], and was rated at [tpl]convert|250|kW|PS bhp|0|[/tpl] at 6,600 rpm, producing [tpl]convert|420|Nm|0|[/tpl] of torque at 3,400 rpm.  It satisfied the European Union EU3 emissions standard, and was managed by a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU) with manifold-sited sequential fuel injection, mapped direct ignition with eight individual spark coils, Bosch longlife spark plugs, four heated lambda sensors and two catalytic converters, cylinder-selective knock control and a Bosch "E-Gas" drive by wire throttle.  The engine was cooled with the aid of two electric cooling fans, replacing the single viscous fan of earlier models.
An oil-cooled six-speed manual transmission (parts code: 01E, identification code: EEY) was standard; the gear ratios were: 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730; and final drive ratio: 4.111. An optional ZF 5HP24A five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code: 01L, identification codes: EFN 99-May 1, FBD 00-onwards) (gear ratios: 1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.508, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.803; and final drive ratio: 2.909), with steering wheel-mounted paddle-shifts, and "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP) was available.  Torsen T-2 based dynamic quattro permanent four-wheel drive was also standard.  Both front and rear axles utilised "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL), which is a function of the Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme.

===C5 suspension and steering===

Compared to its A6 sibling, the suspension on the S6 was stiffened and lowered by [tpl]convert|10|mm|2[/tpl], and utilised gas-pressurised shock absorbers.
ZF rack and pinion "servotronic" speed-sensitive power steering was standard.

===C5 brakes, wheels and tyres===

Brakes consisted of radially vented brake discs front and rear.  The fronts are sized at [tpl]convert|321|mm|2[/tpl] diameter by [tpl]convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] thick, and are clamped by Lucas HP2 four-pad calipers.  At the rear, the discs are [tpl]convert|269|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|22|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl], and use a Lucas single-piston sliding caliper.
Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) completed the brake system.
Wheels are 8Jx17" cast alloy "Avus" 6-spoke alloy wheels, with 255/40 ZR17 tyres.

===C5 body and interior===

The body panels were largely based on the Audi A6 4.2 model, with slightly flared wheel arches and door sills, with the bonnet (hood) and front wings being constructed from aluminium.  Other features included S6 badging, bolstered seats (optional Recaro seats), polished aluminium exterior door mirror housings, unique front grille, and rear bootlid/tailgate spoiler.

===Audi RS 6 (C5)===

A higher performance Audi RS 6 was also available from 2002 to 2004.  It was built by Audi's high performance private subsidiary quattro GmbH. It used a twin-turbo ("biturbo") version of the 4.2 litre V8 engine (identification code: BCY). Power output was [tpl]convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|[/tpl] at 5,700 to 6,400 (rpm), and torque was [tpl]convert|560|Nm|0|[/tpl] from 1,950 to 5,600 rpm.  Transmission was a five-speed tiptronic automatic.
Wheels and tyres were upgraded to [tpl]nowrap|255/40 ZR18 99Y XL[/tpl], or [tpl]nowrap|255/35 ZR19 96Y XL[/tpl] (5/15 arm design), and there was the "Dynamic Ride Control" (DRC) system available for the suspension, which featured diagonally interlinked shock absorbers to give better body control during extreme cornering, acceleration and braking.  Compared to the standard S6, the suspension was lowered by [tpl]convert|20|mm|2[/tpl].  The brake discs were ventilated and upgraded to [tpl]convert|365|mm|2[/tpl] at the front and [tpl]convert|335|mm|2[/tpl] at the rear.
0-[tpl]convert|100|km/h|1[/tpl] took just 4.6 seconds.  0-[tpl]convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on[/tpl] was 16.6 (saloon) and 16.8 (Avant) seconds.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==C6 (Typ 4F, 2006–2011)[tpl]anchor|C6[/tpl]==

The Audi S6 5.2 FSI quattro (Typ 4F) was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January.
The high-performance version of the C6 Audi A6, the S6 uses the Volkswagen Group C6 platform, and is available in saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) bodystyles.  Factory production started in June 2006. A facelifted version of the S6 was released in late 2008 for the 2009 model year.[tpl]cite web|last=Carter |first=Marc |url=http://www.thetorquereport.com/2008/08/2009_audi_a6_unveiled.html |title=2009 Audi A6 and S6 Unveiled with a Facelift and More Power |publisher=The Torque Report |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] In 2010, the S6 gained Audi's third-generation MMI electronics controller and real-time traffic information.[tpl]cite web|author=Prestige quattro |url=http://www.edmunds.com/audi/s6/2010/#fullreview |title=2010 Audi S6 |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl]

===C6 powertrain===

The engine in the C6 S6 is an all-aluminium alloy [tpl]convert|5204|cc|1|[/tpl] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) 40-valve (four valves per cylinder) 90° V10 (parts code: 07L, identification code: BXA).  Compared with the related 5.0 litre V10 found in the Lamborghini Gallardo, Audi's variant has a longer stroke and wider bore which increases the displacement of the engine so that it produces more torque at lower revs and is thus more suitable for the larger and heavier S6.  It produces [tpl]convert|320|kW|PS bhp|0|[/tpl] at 6,800 rpm and [tpl]convert|540|Nm|0|[/tpl] of torque from 3,000 to 4,000 rpm.  It uses twin chain-driven double overhead camshafts with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine is managed by a Bosch Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), which controls the mapped direct ignition, ten individual spark coils, common rail cylinder-direct sequential multi-point fuel injection, and drive-by-wire throttle.
A ZF 6HP26 six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code: 09E, identification codes: JBW, JMS, KHD, JLL) (gear ratios - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691), with steering wheel-mounted "paddle-shifters" is the only transmission available. Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive - initially with the T-2 symmetrical differential, and from 2007 model year with the latest 40:60 front:rear asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 differential, is standard.  The final drive ratio is 3.801.  Traction is assisted "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL) and "Anti-Slip Regulation" (ASR) (commonly known as traction control system) - both functions of the Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme.
The same engine is used in the latest Audi D3 S8, but in a higher state of tune where it develops [tpl]convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0[/tpl], as the S6 is not to be positioned above the S8 in output.[tpl]cite web|author=July 2006 BY RAY HUTTON |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/06q3/2007_audi_s6-first_drive_review |title=2007 Audi S6 - First Drive Review - Car Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl] With the discontinuation of the S8 5.2 FSI after the 2009 model year and the RS 6 5.0 TFSI in late 2010, the S6 5.2 FSI and R8 5.2 FSI were the remaining Audi vehicles that have V10 engines. The S6 5.2 FSI was discontinued after the 2011 model year, shortly before the release of the 2012 Audi A6 (C7).
For the sprint from rest to [tpl]convert|100|km/h|1[/tpl], the S6 saloon takes 5.2 seconds, with the quarter mile passing in 13.5 seconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/audi/a6/2007/specs/|title=2007 Audi S6 Specifications|work=JB car pages[/tpl]  Top speed is electronically limited to [tpl]convert|250|km/h|1[/tpl]. However a test by Edmunds found that the S6 takes 5.7-seconds to reach 60 mph, a full second or so behind the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG (which are the S6's closest competitors in North America, since the RS6 is not sold there), and that the 2009 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI (a supercharged 3.0L V6) has almost equivalent performance to the S6 5.2 FSI. Yet, in a 2007 track test by Road & Track, the C6 S6 went from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds, while it covered the quarter-mile in 13.5 seconds.  Despite its heft at 4,500 pounds, the S6 has quick reflexes and agility, even with Audi's highly regarded quattro system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Audi_S6/ |title=2010 Audi S6 Reviews, Pictures and Prices | U.S. News Best Cars |publisher=Usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl]

===C6 brakes, wheels and tyres===

The brakes consist of radially ventilated discs front and rear.  The fronts are sized at [tpl]convert|385|mm|2[/tpl] in diameter by [tpl]convert|36|mm|3|abbr=on[/tpl] thick, and are clamped by gloss black painted Continental Teves two-piston sliding calipers.  The rear discs are [tpl]convert|330|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|22|mm|3[/tpl] thick, and use gloss black Girling-TRW single piston sliding calipers with an integrated electro-mechanical parking brake.
A Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) completed the brake system.
Standard alloy wheels consist of 9Jx19" cast aluminium alloy "5-arm wing design", shod with Continental SportContact2 265/35 ZR19 tyres.  An optional 8½Jx18" cast alloy "S design" with 255/40 ZR18 tyres (either Conti SportContact2 or Bridgestone Potenza RE050A) are also available.  A direct-acting Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is also standard.

===C6 other features===

The S6 features two rows of five distinctive LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) along each side of the front bumper air intakes which indicates the 10-cylinder engine as a point of differentiation from other A6 models.  Bi-Xenon high-intensity discharge (HID) adaptive headlights which swivel around corners complement the LED DRLs.

===Audi RS 6 (C6)===

As with the previous generation, this C6 platform has also generated an RS 6 version available for the model years 2008 to 2010, again developed and produced by quattro GmbH.  This latest version of the RS6 now includes a 5.0 litre ([tpl]convert|4991|cc|1|[/tpl]) 90° V10 twin-turbocharged ("biturbo"), Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine, which produces [tpl]convert|426|kW|PS bhp|0|[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|650|Nm|0|[/tpl].  Available in both Avant and saloon bodystyles, it is Audi's single most powerful car.Audi UK - The New Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 1. 02/08Audi UK - Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 2. 05/08  Official performance figures for the 0-[tpl]convert|100|km/h|1[/tpl] sprint are 4.6 seconds for the Avant, with the saloon one tenth of a second quicker at 4.5 seconds.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==C7 (2012–)[tpl]anchor|C7[/tpl]==

The Audi S6 4.0 TFSI quattro and its mechanical twin S7 were launched as a 2013 models, a year after the C7 Audi A6 and Audi A7 were released.
The Audi S6 and S7 are powered by a 4.0L DOHC twin-turbo V8 engine mated to a 7-speed S-tronic Double Clutch Gearbox. This engine makes 420 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque, plus there is a cylinder-deactivation system and a stop-start system for improved fuel economy.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/reviews/2013-audi-s6s7-heroic-and-hedonistic/article2412971/ The 2013 Audi A8 shares the same engine, while the 2012 Audi S8 has a variant of the powerplant in a higher state of tune making 520 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque, both mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.http://www.eurotuner.com/news/eurp_1108_new_tfsi_v8_2012_audi_s6_s7_s8/index.html
The V8 performance option for the regular Audi A6, found in the 2004-11 Audi A6 4.2 FSI, has been discontinued and the S6 takes over as the engine upgrade.http://www.roadandtrack.com/2013-audi-s7 The S6 now compares more closely with the BMW 550ihttp://www.whatcar.com/car-news/2012-audi-s6-review/262314http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2011/09/new-audi-s6-s7-and-s8-first-look.htmlhttp://cars.about.com/od/audi/fr/2013-Audi-S6-And-S7-Review.htm and Mercedes-Benz E550, which also use twin-turbo V8 engines and have available all-wheel drive (the 2013 BMW 550i xDrive starts at $65,595 USD while the 2013 Audi S6 has an MRSP of $72,795 USD).
