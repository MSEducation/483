==History==

The Baptist Union of Great Britain was formed when the General Baptists and Particular Baptists came together in 1891. 
The Particular Baptist Missionary Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen (later the Baptist Missionary Society, and now BMS World Mission) was organised in 1792, under the leadership of Andrew Fuller (1754–1815), John Sutcliff (1752–1814), and William Carey (1761–1834). When the Baptist Union was founded in 1813, it was a Particular Baptist organisation. In 1833, it was restructured to allow for membership of General Baptists.  General and Particular Baptist work was united in the Baptist Union in 1891. The Baptist Historical Society was founded in 1908.
The basis of fellowship in the Baptist Union is a three-part "Declaration of Principle" stating belief in Jesus, Christian baptism, and world evangelisation.  Structure includes an annual Baptist Assembly, and the Baptist Union Council, which is made up of representatives from the 13 regional associations and the six Baptist Colleges affiliated with the Union. The national resource and offices are in Didcot, Oxfordshire, England, having moved from Baptist Church House 2–6 Southampton Row,Baptist Church House/Kingsgate House [tpl]NHLE|num=1378782[/tpl] London in 1989.
In 2013 Lynn Green was elected, with no votes against, as the first female General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain to commence in September 2013.  She was received at the vote by a standing ovation and her inaugural message included “I believe that our union is ready for generational change...  It is time to cast off the institutional mindset that has served us well in the past, and embrace a new way of being for the 21st century.”[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.abpnews.com/ministry/organizations/item/8473-woman-named-to-lead-british-baptists | title = Woman Named to Lead British Baptists | first = Robert ‘Bob’ | last = Allen | publisher = Associated Baptist Press | newspaper = News | date = 6 May 2013 | accessdate = 2013-07-28[/tpl]
