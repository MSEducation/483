Bonnybridge railway station was a railway station serving the village of Bonnybridge. The station was located on a short branch off the Caledonian Railway Main Line, close to the Greenhill Junction complex with the Scottish Central Railway and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.

==History==

The station opened on 2 August 1886, although there was a station of the same name on the nearby Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The E&GR station was not renamed to Bonnybridge High until 1953, after the closure of this CR station in the 1930s.
