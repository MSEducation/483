The surrounding areas have many onsen or natural hot springs. Kujū also has a flower park, which sells lavendar ice cream.
Many of the families in Kujū still live a traditional Japanese lifestyle, with extended families living together, houses with real shoji - rice paper sliding doors and tatami mats, and people eating rice, fish and miso soup for breakfast. Kujū is also home to TAO, one of Japan's foremost taiko groups, and Kudami Taiko, an all women taiko group.
