CATEGORIES: Dene peoples

The Slavey (also Slave) are a First Nations aboriginal people of the Dene group, indigenous to the Great Slave Lake region, in Canada's Northwest Territories, and extending into northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta.

==Name==

The name "Slave" is an English translation of the Cree name for their traditional enemies, including the people now known as the Slavey, whom they often enslaved; the French Esclave is analogous. However, in order to avoid the connotations of the word slave, the name came to be presented as indigenous, and this was indicated by pronouncing the e. Later the spelling was changed to Slavé, and then Slavey, to capture the new pronunciation. The name is seldom used by the Slavey, who call themselves Dene. Indigenous ethnonyms for South Slavey people and language are Dehcho or Dene Tha.Rice, Sally 2009. Athapaskan eating and drinking verbs and constructions. In J. Newman (ed.), The Linguistics of Eating and Drinking, 109-152. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.  indigenous ethnonyms for some of the Athapaskan languages represented in this paper are given in parentheses after the term likely to be more common in the traditional linguistic and anthropological literature: Babine (Witsuwit’en), Chipewyan (Dene Sųłiné), Navajo (Diné), Sarcee/Sarsi (Tsuu T’ina) South Slavey (Dehcho or Dene Tha), North Slave (Sahtu).''
Though most Athabaskan peoples call themselves Dene, those in the Northwest Territories tend to mean it for themselves only. However, the northern Slavey are also known in English as the Sahtú, while the southern band are known as the Deh Cho.http://www.dehcho.org
The names of the Slave River, Lesser Slave River, Great Slave Lake and Lesser Slave Lake all derive from this Cree name for their enemies, though not necessarily from the people now known as Slavey in English. The term Esclaves remains incorporated in each of these geographical features' French names.
