Utter Madness is a greatest hits album by the British pop band Madness, released in 1986 at the time of their original split. It is a sequel of sorts to their earlier compilation Complete Madness (meaning the completed title is interpreted by some fans as "Complete and Utter Madness") and comprises songs from the latter half of their career.  The new single "(Waiting For) The Ghost Train," which would become the band's final single of the 1980s, is featured here.
