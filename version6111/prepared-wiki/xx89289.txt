</ref> From 2000 to 2003, Texstar maintained his repository of RPM packages in parallel with the PCLinuxOnline site. In an interview, Reynolds said he started PCLinuxOS "to provide an outlet for [his] crazy desire to package [[source code]] without having to deal with egos, arrogance and politics."<ref name="Linuxblog">[tpl]cite web|url=http://linux-blog.org/index.php?/archives/91-Experiment-Interview-with-Texstar-of-PCLinuxOS.html|title=Experiment: Interview with Texstar of PCLinuxOS - Yet Another Linux Blog|date=8 June 2005|publisher=linux-blog.org|accessdate=2007-07-03[/tpl]</ref>
In October 2003, Texstar created a fork of Mandrake Linux 9.2. Working closely with The Live CD Project, Texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full-fledged distribution. The initial releases were successively numbered as "previews": p5, p7, p8 up to p81a, then p9, p91, p92, and p93.
Although it retains a similar "look and feel" to Mandriva Linux, PCLinuxOS has diverged significantly. The code was officially forked from Mandrake 9.2 into an independent project in 2003. After three years of continuous development, the developers took advantage of further development in (the renamed) Mandriva in late in 2006 for PCLinuxOS 2007. In the releases before 2007, it was normally necessary to perform a re-installation.

===PCLinuxOS 2007===

For 2007, PCLinuxOS used a one time source code snapshot from Mandriva to produce a new independent code base (no longer a fork of Mandriva). This implied a shift to a more modern code, which required a complete reinstall to this version. The new version featured a new look, and built-in 3D effects. A new logo was also designed for the new version, and was incorporated into the boot screen. A new login screen was designed, entitled "Dark". The final/official PCLinuxOS 2007 version was released on May 21, 2007.

===PCLinuxOS 2009===

The last version of the 2009 Live CD, PCLinuxOS 2009.2, was released on June 30, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05560|title=Distribution Release: PCLinuxOS 2009.2|date=2009-06-30|accessdate=2009-07-31[/tpl] Improvements included bug fixes, new backgrounds, sounds, and start-up screen, as well as quicker start-up times. It was the last PCLinuxOS live CD to ship with K Desktop Environment 3, and the last of the PCLinuxOS 2007 backward compatible series.
Remasters of PCLinuxOS, featuring the Xfce (Phoenix), LXDE (PCLinuxOS-LXDE), and Gnome (PCLinuxOS-Gnome) desktops were also made available.

===PCLinuxOS 2010===

The 2010 version of the Live CD was released on April 19, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxcritic.com/pclinuxos-2010-review/|title=Distribution Review: PCLinuxOS 2010[/tpl] It includes the new KDE SC 4.4.2, a new graphical theme and a new version of the Linux Kernel (Kernel 2.6.32.11). It is also the first PCLinuxOS Live CD to include the ext4 file system support. This version required a complete reinstall of the operating system.
While a version of PCLinuxOS that features the GNOME desktop environment was introduced in 2008, the 2010 version is the first one to not only offer the KDE Plasma and GNOME versions, but also versions with Xfce, LXDE, Enlightenment, and Openbox.

===PCLinuxOS 2010.1===

Version 2010.1 was released on May 5, 2010. Changes made since last version:

===PCLinuxOS 2011.6===

PCLinuxOS 2011.6 version was released on June 27, 2011.

===PCLinuxOS 2012===

PCLinuxOS 2012.02 version was released on February 22, 2012. Later another maintenance release was made on August 22, 2012. Major changes compared to 2011 release are:

===PCLinuxOS 2013 64-bit===

PCLinuxOS 2013 64-bit first version was released on April 10, 2013.
It featured:

==Features==

PCLinuxOS places specific emphasis on desktop computing, concentrating its efforts for home or small business environments, hence paying less attention to other more "traditional" uses, like servers, although packages for most server tasks are available.[tpl]Fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]
PCLinuxOS is distributed as a Live CD, which can also be installed to a local hard disk drive or USB flash drive. Since version 2009.1, provides a USB installer to create a Live USB, where the user's configuration and personal data can be saved if desired.  A live USB of older versions of PCLinuxOS can be created manually or with UNetbootin.UNetbootin - Homepage and Downloads Retrieved on 2009-5-1 The entire CD can be run from memory, assuming the system has sufficient RAM. PCLinuxOS uses APT-RPM, based on Advanced Packaging Tool (or APT), a package management system (originally from the Debian distribution), together with Synaptic Package Manager, a GUI to APT, in order to add, remove or update packages. If there is enough memory on the machine, and an active network connection, the Live CD can update packages. PCLinuxOS is also designed to be easy to remaster after installation, creating one's own personalized Live CD, using the mylivecd tool.
PCLinuxOS maintains its own software repository, available via the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) and its Synaptic front-end, completely replacing Mandriva's urpmi. This means that an installation could be continuously updated to the latest versions of packages, hence sometimes forgoing the need to re-install the entire distribution upon each successive release. Other differences include its own menu arrangement, custom graphics, and icon sets.

==Other versions==

There are several community projects associated with PCLinuxOS.

===KDE Fullmonty (FM) edition===

KDE FullMonty (Live & Install DVD) is a regular PCLinuxOS KDE installation, but is modified to include a special desktop layout and  many additional applications and drives preinstalled. It is available as either a 32- or 64-bit edition.
FM applies a new concept: activity-focused virtual desktop layout, which is designed to address typical user-needs/tasks, make their life easy, and working on the computer straightforward and fun. It has 6 virtual desktops:

File:pclinuxos_fullmonty_desktop3.png|Games
File:pclinuxos_fullmonty_desktop4.png|Multimedia
File:pclinuxos_fullmonty_desktop5.png|Graphics
File:pclinuxos_fullmonty_desktop6.png|System

The idea of the FM concept is to provide the best out-of-the-box experience in an intuitive, thematically organized desktop setup. FM is designed for Linux beginners and newcomers from other operating systems. The typical user is provided with a cream of the crop selection of activity-related applications available in PCLinuxOS. The most popular ones are easily accessible from the respective virtual desktop and many more applications can be accessed from the PCmenu. The variety of applications in FM serves several purposes: advertising those applications to users; stimulating the comparative usage of these applications in the forum, learning about and discussing specific application features, and finally helping deciding on and providing constructive feedback on finding the most popular application for a given task. FM should facilitate the entry into the Linux desktop experience and provide an intuitive and easy to use working environment.[tpl]Fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===LXDE edition===

The “Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment” is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment. Maintained by an international community of developers, it comes with a beautiful interface, multi-language support, standard keyboard short cuts and additional features like tabbed file browsing. LXDE uses less CPU and less RAM than other environments. It is especially designed for cloud computers with low hardware specifications, such as netbooks, mobile devices (e.g. MIDs) or older computers.[tpl]Fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Mate edition===

The newest edition of PCLinuxOS incorporates the MATE desktop environment, announced on the 3rd July 2013.  PCLinuxOS Mate ISO's are now available in both 32 and 64bit flavors. These ISOs are small enough to fit on a standard 700 mb CD or a small USB key.
Features: Mate Desktop 1.6.x, Kernel 3.4.52, Pulse Audio enabled by default, Udisks2, Hal daemon turn off but still available as a service if needed. All of the Mate desktop applications plus Firefox, Thunderbird, Pidgin and Skype. Clementine and VLC multimedia players. PysolFC for recreation.[tpl]Fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Third-party distributions===

Because PCLinuxOS includes the mklivecd script, there have been several third-party distributions over the years based on PCLinuxOS, though they may only mention that connection if they follow strict guidelines.  Currently
PCLinuxOS Gnome Edition is the premier example.

==Release history==

Almost all major releases have been accompanied by new boot-up and login screens, along with some changes in icon sets, and login sounds.
