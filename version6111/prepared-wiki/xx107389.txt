==Release==

The album was released on the band's own Phonographic Records on September 13, 2005.  The CD version feature a second disc of B-sides and outtakes in deluxe packaging.  In an effort to "embrace the indisputable fact of music in the 21st century",Why we’re releasing our latest album for free on the Internet, a press release from the band's website the band made the album available as a free download via BitTorrent and on the band's website.  They pointed out that "it’s important that people understand the free download concept isn’t a frivolous act. It’s a key part of our promotional campaign, along with radio and press promotion, live shows, and videos. It’s a bet that the resources of the Internet can make possible a new way for musicians to find their audience – and forge a meaningful artistic career built on support from cooperative, not adversarial, relationships."
On April 19, 2006, the band announced on their MySpace blog that the album had been picked up by Olympia-based label Kill Rock Stars for nation-wide release on July 25, 2006. The re-release's track listing, song order, and album art is different from the Phonographic Records release. The band did some limited touring to accompany the release.
