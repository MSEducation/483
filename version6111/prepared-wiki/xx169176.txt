[[Prenyltransferase]]

CATEGORIES: Peripheral membrane proteins, Protein domains

Prenyltransferases are a class of enzymes that transfer allylic prenyl groups to acceptor molecules.  Prenyl transferases commonly refer to prenyl diphosphate synthases.[tpl]cite journal | author = Takahashi S, Koyama T | title = Structure and function of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes | journal = Chem Rec | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 194–205 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16900467 | doi = 10.1002/tcr.20083 | url =  [/tpl]
Prenyltransferases are commonly divided into two classes, cis (or Z) and trans (or E), depending upon the stereochemistry of the resulting products.  Examples of trans-prenyltranferases include dimethylallyltranstransferase, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase. Cis-prenyltransferases include dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase (involved in the production of a precursor to dolichol).
The beta subunit of the farnesyltransferases is responsible for peptide binding. Squalene-hopene cyclase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of squalene into hopene, a key step in hopanoid (triterpenoid) metabolism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schulz GE, Wendt KU, Poralla K |title=Structure and function of a squalene cyclase |journal=Science |volume=277 |issue=5333 |pages=1811–1815 |year=1997 |pmid=9295270 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5333.1811[/tpl] Lanosterol synthase ([tpl]EC number|5.4.99.7[/tpl]) (oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase) catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to lanosterol, the initial precursor of cholesterol, steroid hormones and vitamin D in vertebrates and of ergosterol in fungi.[tpl]cite journal |author=Prestwich GD, Poralla K, Hewelt A, Abe I, Reipen I, Sprenger G |title=A specific amino acid repeat in squalene and oxidosqualene cyclases |journal=Trends Biochem.
