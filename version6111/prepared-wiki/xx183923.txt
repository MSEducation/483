Moving Wallpaper is a British satirical comedy-drama television series set in a TV production unit. It ran on ITV for two series in 2008–2009. The subject of the first series was the production of a soap called Echo Beach, each episode of which aired directly after the Moving Wallpaper episode about its production. The second series was based around the production of a "zombie show" called Renaissance. Ben Miller confirmed in May 2009 on his Twitter account that no further series will be made.http://twitter.com/bennylicious
The title, "Moving Wallpaper", is a disparaging term applied to uninspiring TV shows, or to television in general, referring to the perception that modern television viewers are "mindless absorbers of images", as if staring at wallpaper.Formations, p. 175, Dan Fleming, Henry A. Giroux and Lawrence Grossberg, Manchester University Press, 2000

Filming for series one started in July 2007 and the show began airing on ITV on 10 January 2008, continuing at 9 pm on Fridays thereafter for twelve weekly episodes.Television - News - 'Beach' and 'Wallpaper' supporting cast confirmed - Digital Spy The "fictional" soap opera Echo Beach was itself shown immediately afterwards at 9.30 pm.
A six-episode second series of Moving Wallpaper was commissioned and began airing on ITV on 28 February 2009, again in the Friday 9 pm slot.

==Premise==

Moving Wallpaper storylines revolve around a crazed producer, Jonathan Pope (played by Ben Miller), trying to hold together an assortment of egotistic and neurotic writers and actors through the vicissitudes of Echo Beach production (series one), while simultaneously fighting off his bitchy boss.
Series one ended with the producer on the verge of learning whether a second series of Echo Beach had been commissioned. Series two picked up from this point with the news that the network had cancelled Echo Beach (mirroring the real-life circumstance). However, a clause in Pope's contract compels the network to allow him to make a pilot for a new show, which largely by accident turns out to be the "zombie show" Renaissance. After rejection by the network, Pope forces a website editor to upload the pilot to the itv.com website[tpl]cite news|author=Parker, Robin|date=25 March 2009|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/03/moving_wallpaper_takes_zombie_show_to_itvcom.html|title= Moving Wallpaper takes zombie show to itv.com|work=Broadcastnow|publisher=Emap Media|accessdate=26 March 2009[/tpl] (again linking to the real-life circumstance).
