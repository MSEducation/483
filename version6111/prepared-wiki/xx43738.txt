Celis is a beer brand. Originally an independent based in Austin, Texas, was owned by Michigan Brewing Company for a decade, and was sold in 2012.

==History==

In 1966, a milkman named Pierre Celis in the town of Hoegaarden (about an hour’s drive east of Brussels) decided to revive witbier, a regional beer style that had become extinct almost a decade earlier when the town’s last brewery closed. 
Pierre Celis’s first brewery was in his father’s stable. In 1972, he relocated to an abandoned soft drink factory, and by 1985, he was brewing 300,000 barrels a year. But Celis never had luck in business. His Hoegaarden Brewery burned to the ground that year, and Celis, who was underinsured, wound up selling his Hoegaarden brand to Belgian giant Interbrew. That company, now known as Anheuser-Busch InBev, continues to make Hoegaarden to this day.
Celis, at the age of 67, founded a microbrewery in Austin in 1992.[tpl]Cite web | title=New microbrewery makes Austin debut | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+microbrewery+makes+Austin+debut.-a012120073 | work=Austin Business Journal | date=March 2, 1992 | publisher=The Free Library[/tpl] (At a Brickskeller tasting, Celis, who spoke English haltingly, remarked that he chose Texas because its inhabitants speak with a slow drawl, making them easier to understand.) Celis White received a perfect four-star rating from the late British beer writer Michael Jackson in his Pocket Guide to Beer.[tpl]cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Jackson |title=The Running Press pocket guide to beer: the connoisseur's companion to more than 2,000 beers of the world |location=Philadelphia |type=Print Hardcover |pages=208 |publisher=Running Press |edition=7th |date=August 10, 2000 |isbn=0762408855[/tpl] ISBN 978-0762408856.  Celis Brewery also made several other varieties of beer in addition to the celebrated White, including Dubbel, Grand Cru, Pale Bock, Pale Rider and Raspberry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20020311075809/http://www.austin360.com/aas/dining/beer01/celis01.html |last1=Lisheron |first1=Mark |date=February 21, 2001 |title=Last call for a Celis: Whether you blame the beer big boys, Texas tastes or marketing mistakes, a great little Austin brewery is gone |publisher=Austin American Statesman |accessdate=April 26, 2012[/tpl] at Wayback machine These types have been carried on by Michigan Brewing Company.
Celis Brewery floundered after ownership was purchased by Miller Brewing Company, and the plant was shuttered on the final day of 2000. In 2002, Celis White and other brands were acquired by Michigan Brewing Company in Webberville, Michigan, which continued to produce until it closed in 2012.
Pierre Celis died on April 9, 2011, at the age of 86.[tpl]cite web |url=http://belgianbeerspecialist.blogspot.com/2011/04/pierre-celis-conversation-in-hoegaarden.html |date=April 20, 2011 |first1=David |last1=Cook |title=Pierre Celis: A Conversation in Hoegaarden |work=Belgian Beer and Travel|accessdate=August 30, 2011[/tpl]

This (brand name repurchase) is just the one missing piece.”
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that the trademark for Celis was sold to Craftbev.  On June 25, 2012 The Austin Business Journal reported under the headline: Family brings Celis brewery back to Austin[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/retail/2012/06/family-brings-celis-brewery-back-to.html |title=Family brings Celis brewery back to Austin |work=Austin Business Journal |first1=Sarah |last1=Drake |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2012[/tpl] 
"Christine Celis, daughter of Belgian brewer Pierre Celis, plans to use an existing facility to begin producing beer as soon as possible.
The family has been developing plans for a new brewery for some time and can begin to move forward since the family name has been reclaimed, Christine Celis said.
“Now that we have the right to brew my Dad’s famous recipes under our own name once again, nothing can stop me from making that a reality,” she said."
