Globally hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2 million people as of 2004 (107.9 million of whom are in low and middle income countries).[tpl]cite book | author=WHO | title=The global burden of disease : 2004 update | year=2008 | publisher=World Health Organization | location=Geneva, Switzerland | isbn=9789241563710 | pages=35 | edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl] Of these 65 million acquired the condition during childhood.[tpl]cite book | first=Abdelaziz Y | last=Elzouki | title=Textbook of clinical pediatrics | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | isbn=9783642022012 | pages=602 | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FEf4EMjYSrgC&pg=PA602 | edition=2[/tpl] At birth ~3 per 1000 in developed countries and more than 6 per 1000 in developing countries have hearing problems.
Hearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%.

==Society and culture==

===Deaf culture===

Jack Gannon, a professor at Gallaudet University, said this about deaf culture. “Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.” Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Dr. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, "people tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa… our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies."Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981) Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the "pathological view of the deaf."[tpl]cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl] Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers. Dr. Bill Vicars expresses the power of this bond when stating, "if given the chance to become hearing most people would choose to remain deaf."[tpl]cite web | last=Drolsbaugh | first=Mark | title=Everything You've Wanted to Know About Deaf Culture (And Then Some) | url=http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | publisher=Deaf Culture Online | accessdate=2011-11-28 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110213211737/http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | archivedate=2011-02-13[/tpl]

===Views of treatments===

There has been considerable controversy within the culturally deaf community over cochlear implants. For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.
Many in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as sign language or total communication. Other concerns include loss of deaf culture and limitations on hearing restoration.
Most parents and doctors tell children not to play sports or get involved in activities that can cause injuries to the head, for example soccer, hockey, or basketball. A child with a hearing loss may prefer to stay away from noisy places, such as rock concerts, football games, airports, etc., as this can cause noise overflow, a type of headache that occurs in many children and adults when they are near loud noises.

===Sign language===

Sign languages convey meaning by manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This can involve simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to fluidly express a speaker's thoughts.
There is no single "sign language". Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages develop. While they use space for grammar in a way that oral languages do not, sign languages exhibit the same linguistic properties and use the same language faculty as do oral languages. Hundreds of sign languages are in use around the world and are at the cores of local deaf cultures. Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Deaf sign languages are not based on the spoken languages of their region, and often have very different syntax, partly but not entirely owing to their ability to use spatial relationships to express aspects of meaning. (See Sign languages' relationships with spoken languages.)
Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée was the first person to open a deaf school, in Paris. Épée taught French Sign Language (LSF) to children, and started the spread of many deaf schools across Europe. The American Thomas Gallaudet, who had traveled to England to learn methods of teaching deaf children in order to start a deaf school in the US, witnessed a demonstration of deaf teaching skills from Épée's successor Abbé Sicard and two of the school's deaf faculty members, Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu. Gallaudet studied under these French masters and perfected his own teaching skills; then, accompanied by Clerc, he returned to the United States, where in 1817 they founded the first successful American deaf school, in Hartford, Connecticut. American Sign Language, or ASL, started to evolve from primarily LSF, and other outside influences.[tpl]cite journal | last=Frishberg | first=Nancy | title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language | journal=Language |date=September 1975 | volume=51 | issue=3 | page=696 | doi=10.2307/412894[/tpl]

===School===

====Government policies====

Those who are hearing disabled do have access to a free and appropriate public education. If a child does qualify as being hearing impaired and receives an individualized education plan, the IEP team must consider, "the child's language and communication needs. The IEP must include opportunities for direct communication with peers and professionals. It must also include the student’s academic level, and finally must include the students full range of needs"Smith, D. D., & Tyler, N. C. (2010). Introduction to Special Education. Columbus: Merrill.  The government also distinguishes between deafness from hearing loss. The U.S. Department of Education states that deafness is hearing loss that is so severe that a person cannot process any type of oral information even if they have some sort of hearing-enhancing device. The U.S. Department of Education states that a hearing impairment is when a person's education is affected by how much that person is able to hear. This definition is not included under the term deafness. In order for a person to qualify for special services, they have to hear more than 20 decibels and their educational performance must be affected by their hearing loss. This is what the government has to say about governmental policies and individualized services.

====Inclusion vs. pullout====

There are mixed opinions on the subject between those who live in deaf communities, and those who have deaf family members who do not live in deaf communities. Deaf communities are those communities where only sign languages are typically used.
Many parents who have a child with a hearing impairment prefer their child to be in the least restrictive environment of their school. This may be because most children with hearing loss are born to hearing parents.  This can also be because of the recent push for inclusion in the public schools.
It is commonly misunderstood that least restrictive environment means mainstreaming or inclusion.  Sometimes the resources available at the public schools do not match up to the resources at a residential school for the deaf.  Many hearing parents choose to have their deaf child educated in the general education classroom as much as possible because they are told that mainstreaming is the least restrictive environment, which is not always the case.  However, there are parents that live in Deaf communities who feel that the general education classroom is not the least restrictive environment for their child. These parents feel that placing their child in a residential school where all children are deaf may be more appropriate for their child because the staff tend to be more aware of the needs and struggles of deaf children. Another reason that these parents feel a residential school may be more appropriate is because in a general education classroom, the student will not be able to communicate with their classmates due to the language barrier.
In a residential school where all the children use the same language (whether it be a school using ASL, Total Communication or Oralism), students will be able to interact normally with other students, without having to worry about being criticized. An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who aren't just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority.  These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.

===Myths===

There are many myths regarding people with hearing losses including, but not limited to:

==Research==

A 2005 study achieved successful regrowth of cochlea cells in guinea pigs.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | date = 2005-02-14 [/tpl] However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.  A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting Atoh1 can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice.  Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Gubbels | first1=SP | last2=Woessner | first2=DW | last3=Mitchell | first3=JC | last4=Ricci | first4=AJ | last5=Brigande | first5=JV | title=Functional auditory hair cells produced in the mammalian cochlea by in utero gene transfer | journal=Nature | volume=455 | issue=7212 | pages=537–41 | year=2008 | pmid=18754012 | pmc=2925035 | doi=10.1038/nature07265[/tpl]

Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.
