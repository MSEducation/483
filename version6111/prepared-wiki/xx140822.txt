[[Coin wrapper]]

CATEGORIES: Banking, Numismatics

A coin wrapper, sometimes known as a bank roll or roll is a paper or plastic container for a number of coins.
In the United States, empty rolls are available free at most banks in every denomination (though it is becoming increasingly difficult for half dollar and dollar to be readily made available).
The rolls come flat and one side will have to be folded to allow for coins to be placed inside. When the roll is full, the top side will need to be folded. Typically, the full rolls are brought back to the banks in exchange for currency or to be deposited.
In the Eurozone, you also find empty plastic rolls at the banks in every denomination, with five-coin staggered rows. Their main advantages are:

==Searching rolls==

Often, coin collectors will ask for full rolls from the bank to search the contents in hopes of finding an interesting piece. Some collectors also save coins of bullion value, such as copper cents and silver half-dollars. This practice is called coin roll hunting. Full rolls are also requested by vendors to make change.

==Fraud==

Bank rolls are vulnerable to a variety of scams, such as rolling slugs of no value or coins of a lesser value.[tpl]cite news |first=Deborah |last=Medenbach |date=July 22, 2009 |title=Penny Scam Yields Dime Profits in New Paltz |newspaper=Times Herald-Record |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090722/NEWS/907229991|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]  See also coin rolling scams.

==Coin bags==

In the United Kingdom, coin rolls are not used, instead small plastic bags are provided free of charge at banks which are filled by the customer with the appropriate amount of the same value coin as printed on the bag. When depositing or changing, the bags are weighed at the bank to check they contain the right amount.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
