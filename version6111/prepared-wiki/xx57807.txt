John Lydgate of Bury (c. 1370 – c. 1451)[tpl]cite book |last=Platt |first=Colin |title=King Death: The Black Death and its aftermath in late-medieval England |year=1996 |publisher=UCL Press Limited |location=London |isbn=1-85728-313-9 [/tpl] was a monk and poet, born in Lidgate, Suffolk, England.
The sheer bulk of Lydgate's poetic output is prodigious, amounting, at a conservative count, to about 145,000 lines. He explored and established every major Chaucerian genre, except such as were manifestly unsuited to his profession, like the fabliau. In the Troy Book (30,117 lines), an amplified translation of the Trojan history of the thirteenth-century Latin writer Guido delle Colonne, commissioned by Prince Henry (later Henry V), he moved deliberately beyond Chaucer's Knight's Tale and his Troilus, to provide a full-scale epic. 
The Siege of Thebes (4716 lines) is a shorter excursion in the same field of chivalric epic. The Monk's Tale, a brief catalog of the vicissitudes of Fortune, gives a hint of what is to come in Lydgate's massive Fall of Princes (36,365), which is also derived, though not directly, from Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium.Mortimer, Nigel, John Lydgate's 'Fall of Princes': Narrative Tragedy in its Literary and Political Contexts (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005). 
The Man of Law's Tale, with its rhetorical elaboration of apostrophe, invocation, and digression in what is essentially a saint's legend, is the model for Lydgate's legends of St. Edmund (3693) and St. Albon (4734), both local monastic patrons, as well as for many shorter saints' lives, though not for the richer and more genuinely devout Life of Our Lady (5932).

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Lydgate admittedly lived a profligate life: "I lied to excuse myself. I stole apples … I made mouths at people like a wanton ape. I gambled at cherry stones. I was late to rise and dirty at meals. I was chief shammer of illness".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/29/john-lydgate-graffiti-chaucer-monk-literary-talent|title=The message of love hidden in medieval graffiti|last=Stummer|first=Robin|date=29 March 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] He was admitted to the Benedictine monastery of Bury St Edmunds Abbey at fifteen and took initial vows as a monk there a year later.

===Patronage and works===

Having literary ambitions (he was an admirer of Geoffrey Chaucer and a friend to his son, Thomas) he sought and obtained patronage for his literary work at the courts of Henry IV of England, Henry V of England and Henry VI of England. His patrons included, amongst many others, the mayor and aldermen of London, the chapter of St. Paul's Cathedral, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and Henry V and VI, 
His main supporter from 1422 was Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. 
In 1423 Lydgate was made prior of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex. He soon resigned the office to concentrate on his travels and writing. He was a prolific writer of poems, allegories, fables and romances. His most famous works were his longer and more moralistic Troy Book, Siege of Thebes and the Fall of Princes. The Troy Book was a translation of the Latin prose narrative by Guido delle Colonne, Historia destructionis Troiae. 
At one time, the long allegorical poem The Assembly of Gods was attributed to him,See the edition of Oscar Lovell Triggs (1896). but the work is now considered anonymous. Lydgate was also believed to have written London Lickpenny, a well-known satirical work; however, his authorship of this piece has been thoroughly discredited.  He also translated the poems of Guillaume de Deguileville into English. 
In his later years he lived and probably died at the monastery of Bury St. Edmunds. At some point in his life he returned to the village of his birth and added his signature and a coded message  in a graffiti onto a wall [tpl]cite web|title=John Lydgate linked to Suffolk church graffiti|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-26816502|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 April 2014[/tpl] to St Mary's Church, Lidgate, near Haverhill, Suffolk
