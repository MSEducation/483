Attidops is a genus of jumping spiders. It is closely related to the genera Ballus, Admestina and Icius, possibly derived from the Dendryphantinae.Edwards 1999

==Description==

Attidops are from two to three millimeters in body length, with a dark reddish-brown prosoma which is darker around the eyes. On the underside, and on the legs they are reddish- to yellowish-brown. The entire body, but especially the sides are sparsely covered with short white hairs and translucent clear to white flattened hairs that look like scales. The sexes look similar to each other.

==Distribution==

Spiders of this genus occur in North America from Canada to Mexico.World Spider Catalog

==Name==

The genus name is combined from -attus, a common ending for salticid genera, and Greek '-ops' "to look like". Banks (1905) created the genus in a footnote, stating simply "Attidops, a new genus for Ballus youngi Peck".
