Her parents were Adamo Levi, an electrical engineer and mathematician, and Adele Montalcini, a painter.[tpl]cite news|last=Carey|first=Benedict|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/science/dr-rita-levi-montalcini-a-revolutionary-in-the-study-of-the-brain-dies-at-103.html|title=Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini, Nobel Winner, Dies at 103|date=30 December 2012|work=The New York Times[/tpl]
In her teenage years, she considered becoming a writer and admired Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf.[tpl]cite news|last1=Krause-Jackson|first1=Flavia|last2=Martinuzzi|first2=Elisa|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-30/levi-montalcini-italian-nobel-prize-laureate-dies-at-103.html|title=Levi-Montalcini, Italian Nobel Laureate, Dies at 103|date=30 December 2012|publisher=Bloomberg[/tpl] Adamo discouraged his children from attending college as he feared it would disrupt their lives as wives and mothers but he eventually supported Levi-Montalcini's aspirations to become a doctor anyway. Levi-Montalcini decided to attend University of Turin Medical School after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer.[tpl]cite news|last=Siegel|first=Judy|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1440078621.html?dids=1440078621:1440078621&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+04%2C+2008&author=JUDY+SIEGEL&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=Oldest+living+Nobel+laureate+arrives+today+on+solidarity+visit.+98-+year-old+Italian+neurologist+Rita+Levi-Montalcini+triumphed+over+Mussolini%27s+anti-Jewish+edicts&pqatl=google|title=Oldest living Nobel laureate arrives today on solidarity visit. 98- year-old Italian neurologist Rita Levi-Montalcini triumphed over Mussolini's anti-Jewish edicts|date=4 March 2008|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl] While attending, she was taught by neurohistologist Giuseppe Levi who introduced her to the developing nervous system. After graduating with an M.D. in 1936, she went to work as Giuseppe Levi's assistant, but her academic career was cut short by Benito Mussolini's 1938 Manifesto of Race and the subsequent introduction of laws barring Jews from academic and professional careers.

==Professional life==

Levi-Montalcini lost her assistant position in the anatomy department after a 1938 law was passed, barring Jews from university positions.Yount, Lisa, Twentieth-Century Women Scientists, Facts on File, Inc., 1996, p. 29, ISBN 0-8160-3173-8 During World War II, Levi-Montalcini would conduct experiments from a home laboratory, studying the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, which laid the groundwork for much of her later research. She described this experience decades later in the science documentary film Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times (1997),[tpl]cite web|title=Death by Design: Where Parallel Worlds Meet|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118947/fullcredits#cast|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl] which also features her identical twin sister Paola, who had entered a decades-long career in the arts. Her first genetics laboratory was in her bedroom at her home. In 1943, to escape the German occupation of Italy, her family fled south to Florence, and she set up a laboratory there also, using the corner of a shared living space. During this time she also volunteered her medical expertise for the Allied health service. Her family returned to Turin in 1945.
In September 1946, Levi-Montalcini accepted an invitation to Washington University in St. Louis, under the supervision of Professor Viktor Hamburger. Although the initial invitation was for one semester, after she repeated the exciting results from her home laboratory, Hamburger offered her a research associate position. She stayed in St. Louis for thirty years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating the nerve growth factor (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/30/nobel-winning-scientist-levi-montalcini-dies-in-rome-at-103-biologist-studied/|title=Nobel-winning scientist Levi-Montalcini dies in Rome at 103, biologist studied growth factor|date=30 December 2012|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl] By transferring pieces of tumors to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibers. This discovery, of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells, was surprising. Montalcini described this "like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones." [tpl]cite book|last=Yount|first=Lisa|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini: Discoverer of Nerve Growth Factor|year=2009|publisher=Chelsea House[/tpl] The nerve growth produced by the tumor was unlike anything she had seen before – the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves. 
She was made a Full Professor in 1958, and in 1962, established a research unit in Rome, dividing the rest of her time between there and St. Louis.
From 1961 to 1969 she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the CNR (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978 the Laboratory of Cellular Biology.
Rita Levi-Montalcini founded the European Brain Research Institute in 2002, and then served as its president.[tpl]cite web|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mig/bios/levi-montalcini.html|publisher=Washington University|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The European Brain Research Institute in Rome|url=http://www.eni-net.org/organization/home-institutions/the-european-brain-research-institute-in-rome/|publisher=Network of European Neuroscience Institutes|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl] Her role in this institute was at the center of some criticism from some parts of the scientific community in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/463270a.html|title=Self-inflicted damage.The autocratic actions of an institute's founder could destroy a centre of excellence for brain research.Nature 463, 270 (21 January 2010)[/tpl]
Controversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical industry Fidia . While working for Fidia, she improved the understanding of gangliosides. Beginning in 1975, the scientist supported the drug Cronassial (a particular ganglioside) produced by Fidia from bovine brain tissue. Independent studies showed that the drug actually could be successful in treatment of intended diseases (periphrastic nervous system neuropathies).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6377852|title=Ganglioside (Cronassial) therapy in diabetic neuropathy|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2272191|title=Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a mixture of gangliosides ('Cronassial') in post-herpetic neuralgia.|accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl] Years later, some patients under treatment with Cronassial reported a severe neurological syndrome (Guillain-Barré syndrome). As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing use of the drug in treatment of diseases where it had not been tested.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dmi.unipg.it/~mamone/univ/QUALIT.htm|title=Qualità Intellettuale|publisher=UNIPG|accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dica33.it/argomenti/farmacologia/farmacovigilanza/farmacovigilanza2.asp|title=Fallimenti storici|publisher=Dica33|accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://politicamolecolare.blogspot.com/2007/11/rita-levi-di-montalcini-e-i.html|title=Rita Levi Montalcini e la vicenda Cronossial|publisher=Politica Molecolare|date=November 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl] During the investigation, one of the witnesses spoke about the use of Levi-Montalcini as a sponsor for the drug and serious criticism was levied at Levi-Montalcini.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/02/22/nobel-comprato-non-ne-so-nulla.html|title=Nobel comprato?

In the 1990s, she was one of the first scientists pointing out the importance of the mast cell in human pathology.[tpl]cite pmid|8170980[/tpl] In the same period (1993) she identified the endogenous compound palmitoylethanolamide as an important modulator of this cell.[tpl]cite pmid|7505999[/tpl] This line of research led to using this endogenous compound as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug.www.omicsgroup.org pdf

==Political activity==

On 1 August 2001, she was appointed as Senator for Life by the President of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
On 28–29 April 2006, Levi-Montalcini, aged 97, attended the opening assembly of the newly elected Senate, at which the President of the Senate was elected. She declared her preference for the centre-left candidate Franco Marini. Due to her support of the government of Romano Prodi, she was often criticized by some right-wing senators, who accused her of "saving" the government when the government's exiguous majority in the Senate was at risk. She was insulted by politician Francesco Storace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/politica/napolitano-tre/mastella-storace/mastella-storace.html |title=Mastella: sì al procedimento su Storace|publisher=Repubblica|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/04/sezioni/politica/elezioni-2008/montalcini/montalcini.html |title=Dispetto alla Montalcini al seggio|publisher=La Repubblica|date=14 April 2008|accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl]

==Death==

Rita Levi-Montalcini died in her home in Rome on 30 December 2012 at the age of 103.[tpl]cite news|url=https://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/scienza/2012/12/30/morta-Rita-Levi-Montalcini_8011133.html|title=Addio al premio Nobel Rita Levi Montalcini|publisher=ANSA|date=30 December 2012|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]
Upon her death, the Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, stated it was a great loss "for all of humanity." He praised her as someone who represented "civic conscience, culture and the spirit of research of our time." Italian astrophysicist Margherita Hack told Sky TG24 TV in a tribute to her fellow scientist, "She is really someone to be admired." Italy's premier, Mario Monti, paid tribute to Levi-Montalcini's "charismatic and tenacious" character and for her lifelong endeavor to "defend the battles in which she believed." Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi praised Levi-Montalcini's civil and moral efforts, saying she was an "inspiring" example for Italy and the world.[tpl]cite news|last=D'Emilio|first=Frances|title=Nobel-winning biologist Rita Levi-Montalcini dies at 103|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50324234/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.UOFU4W9FWYc|accessdate=31 December 2012|publisher=NBC News|date=30 December 2012|agency=Associated Press[/tpl]
