Until January 1, 2007, Holmegaard was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in Storstrøm County in the southern part of the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in south Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 66 km², and had a total population of 7,442 (2005).  Its last mayor was Søren Dysted, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Fensmark. 
The municipality was created in 1966 when the following parishes were combined: Fensmark-Rislev Parish and Holme-Olstrup Parish. As the result of kommunalreform ("Municipality Reform") in 1970, Toksværd Parish was incorporated into Holmegaard municipality, and Rislev Parish was incorporated into Næstved municipality.
Holmegaard municipality ceased to exist as the result of Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007).  It was merged with existing Fladså, Fuglebjerg, Næstved,  and Suså municipalities to form the new Næstved municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 681 km² and a total population of 78,446 (2005).  The new municipality belongs to Region Sjælland ("Zealand Region").
