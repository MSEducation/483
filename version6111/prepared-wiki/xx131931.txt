CATEGORIES: Lighthouses in Maryland, Lighthouses completed in 1876

The Mathias Point Light was a screw-pile lighthouse in the Potomac River in Maryland; the station was located near the Port Tobacco River. It was particularly noted for its ornate woodwork.

==History==

Funds for a light near Quantico, Virginia were appropriated in 1872. An engineering study recommended instead that lights be built [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] downstream, and an appropriation was made in 1874 to build a light on Port Tobacco Flats, with a day beacon for Matthias Point. By the time construction began the two were switched, and the light was completed in 1876. Matthias Point was like no other screw-pile structure on the bay, with much decorative woodwork and a distinctive three tiered structure that some described as resembling a wedding cake.
It was intended that this light replace that at Upper Cedar Point; in the end the number of complaints led to the latter's reactivation in 1882. Matthias Point Light itself was automated in 1951 and replaced in 1961 by a beacon mounted on the old foundation.
