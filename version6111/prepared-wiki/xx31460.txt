Louis VI (1 December 1081 – 1 August 1137), called the Fat ([tpl]lang-fr|le Gros[/tpl]), was King of the Franks from 1108 until his death (1137). Chronicles called him "roi de Saint-Denis".

==Life==

Louis was born in Paris, the son of Philip I and his first wife, Bertha of Holland. The first member of the House of Capet to make a lasting contribution to the centralizing institutions of royal power,Norman F. Cantor, The Civilization of the Middle Ages 1993, p 410.  Almost all of his twenty-nine-year reign was spent fighting either the "robber barons" who plagued Paris or the Norman kings of England for their continental possession of Normandy. Nonetheless, Louis VI managed to reinforce his power considerably and became one of the first strong kings of France since the division of the Carolingian Empire. The biography of Louis prepared by his loyal advisor Abbot Suger of Saint Denis offers a fully developed portrayal of his character, in contrast to what little is known about most of his predecessors.
In his youth, Louis fought the Duke of Normandy, Robert Curthose, and the lords of the royal demesne, the Île de France. Suger became his adviser already before Louis became king. He succeeded his father at the age of 27 upon the death of the old King Philip on 29 July 1108. Louis's half-brother prevented him from reaching Rheims, and so he was crowned on 3 August in the cathedral of Orléans by Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens. Ralph the Green, archbishop of Rheims, sent envoys to challenge the validity of the coronation and anointing, but to no avail.
On Palm Sunday 1115, Louis was present in Amiens to support the bishop and inhabitants of the city in their conflict with Enguerrand I of Coucy, one of his vassals, who refused to recognise the granting of a charter of communal privileges. Louis came with an army to help the citizens besiege Castillon (the fortress dominating the city, from which Enguerrand was making punitive expeditions). At the siege, the king took an arrow to his hauberk, but the castle, considered impregnable, fell after two years.
Just before his death in 1137, William X, Duke of Aquitaine, appointed Louis guardian of his daughter and future successor, Eleanor, and expressed his wish for her to marry Louis's son. The prospect of adding the Aquitaine to his son's domains made him so elated that he could hardly speak.[tpl]cite book | title=Eleanor of Aquitaine, a Life | last=Weir | first=Alison | authorlink=Alison Weir | page=22 | year=1999 | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-345-40540-4 [/tpl]
Louis VI died on 1 August 1137 at the castle of Béthisy-Saint-Pierre, near Senlis and Compiègne, of dysentery. He was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded on the throne by his son Louis VII, called "the Younger", who had originally wanted to be a monk.
