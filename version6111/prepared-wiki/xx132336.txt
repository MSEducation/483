NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3) or cryopyrin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hoffman HM, Wright FA, Broide DH, Wanderer AA, Kolodner RD | title = Identification of a locus on chromosome 1q44 for familial cold urticaria | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 1693–8 |date=Jun 2000 | pmid = 10741953 | pmc = 1378006 | doi = 10.1086/302874 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: NLRP3 NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=114548| accessdate = [/tpl] The gene is also called cold induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1) and is located on the long arm of chromosome 1. Another name for the protein is caterpiller-like receptor 1.1 (CLR1.1).
This gene encodes a pyrin-like protein which contains a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. This protein interacts with pyrin domain (PYD) of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). Proteins which contain the caspase recruitment domain, CARD, have been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune response. This protein may function as an activator of NF-κB signaling.

==Pathology==

The encoded protein may play a role in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a spectrum of dominantly inherited autoinflammatory diseases called cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). This includes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.
Cryopyrin is contained in the intracellular inflammasome. It has also been linked to the pathogenesis of pseudogout, gout, and familial Mediterranean fever.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

==Current findings==

Deregulation of NLRP3 has been connected with cancer pathogenesis. For example, one study showed that all of the NLRP3 components are downregulated or completely lost in human hepatocellular carcinoma. [ref]
