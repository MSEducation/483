[[Classified information]]

CATEGORIES: Classified information, Information sensitivity

Classified information is material that a government body claims is sensitive information that requires protection of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people, and mishandling can incur criminal penalties and loss of respect. A formal security clearance is often required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The clearance process usually requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information assets are typically marked with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity - e.g. restricted, confidential, secret and top secret. The choice of level is often based on an impact assessment; governments often have their own set of rules which include the levels, rules on determining the level for an information asset, and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information. Although "Classified information" refers to the formal categorization and marking of material by level of sensitivity, it has also developed a sense synonymous with "censored" in US English. A distinction is often made between formal security classification and privacy markings such as "commercial in confidence". Classifications can be used with additional keywords that give more detailed instructions on how data should be used or protected.
Some corporations and non-government organizations also assign sensitive information to multiple levels of protection, either from a desire to protect trade secrets, or because of laws and regulations governing various matters such as personal privacy, sealed legal proceedings and the timing of financial information releases.

==Government classification==

The purpose of classification is to protect information. Higher classifications protect information that might endanger national security. Classification formalises what constitutes a "state secret" and accords different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause in the wrong hands.
However, classified information is frequently "leaked" to reporters by officials for political purposes. Several U.S. presidents have leaked sensitive information to get their point across to the public.Burn Before Reading, Stansfield Turner, 2006Classified Information in Woodward’s “Obama’s Wars”, September 29, 2010, Jack Goldsmith, Lawfare, via stephenkim.org

==Typical classification levels==

Although the classification systems vary from country to country, most have levels corresponding to the following British definitions (from the highest level to lowest)

===[tpl]Visible anchor|Top secret (TS)[/tpl]===

The highest level except of classification of material on a national level. The information is further compartmented so that specific access using a code word after top secret is a legal way to hide collective and important information**.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/pdf/customer/STINFOdata/DoD5200_1ph.pdf | title =DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents | author =Defense Technical Information Center | publisher =dtic.mil | date =April 1997[/tpl] Such material would cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if made publicly available.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/quist2/chap_7.html#1 | title =Chapter 7.

===Secret===

Such material would cause "serious damage" to national security if it were publicly available.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.uscg.mil/petaluma/e-pme/e-pme/apprentice/G-Lessons/4-G-03.pdf | title =E-PME Enlisted PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION Reporting Unsecured and Securing Classified Material 4.G.03 | author =United States Coast Guard | publisher =uscg.mil[/tpl]
In the USA, operational "Secret" information can be marked with an additional "LIMDIS", to limit readership.

===Confidential===

Such material would cause "damage" or be "prejudicial" to national security if publicly available.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet14/brief14/tab_d/br14d1b.txt | title =ATTACHMENT 2 AR 320-5, CLASSIFICATION OFC. Army Regulations (1936) | author =George Washington University | publisher =gwu.edu[/tpl]

===Restricted===

Such material would cause "undesirable effects" if publicly available. Some countries do not have such a classification; in public sectors, such as commercial industries, such level are also called and known as "Private Information".

===Official===

Such material forms the generality of government business, public service delivery and commercial activity. This includes a diverse range of information, of varying sensitivities, and with differing consequences resulting from compromise or loss. OFFICIAL information must be secured against a threat model that is broadly similar to that faced by a large private company.
The OFFICIAL classification replaces the Confidential and Restricted classifications after April 2014 in the UK.[tpl]cite book|title=Government Security Classifications April 2014|date=October 2013 Version 1.0|publisher=HMG Cabinet Office|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications[/tpl]

===Unclassified===

Technically not a classification level; but this is a feature of some classification schemes, used for government documents that do not merit a particular classification. This is because the information is low-impact, and therefore does not require any special protection, such as vetting of personnel.
There are a plethora of pseudo-classifications under this category. Please see the articles on Sensitive but unclassified and Controlled Unclassified Information for more information.

===Clearance===

Depending on the level of classification there are different rules controlling the level of clearance needed to view such information, and how it must be stored, transmitted, and destroyed. Additionally, access is restricted on a "need to know" basis. Simply possessing a clearance does not automatically authorize the individual to view all material classified at that level or below that level. The individual must present a legitimate "need to know" in addition to the proper level of clearance.

===Compartmented information===

In addition to the general risk-based classification levels above, there may be additional compartmented constraints on access, such as (in the U.S.) Special Intelligence (SI), which protects intelligence sources and methods, No Foreign dissemination (NOFORN), which restricts dissemination to U.S. nationals, and Originator Controlled dissemination (ORCON), which ensures that the originator can track possessors of the information. Information in these compartments is usually marked with specific keywords in addition to the classification level.
Government information about nuclear weapons such as nuclear warheads often has an additional marking to show it contains such information. See, for example, CNWDI.

==International==

When a government agency or group shares information between an agency or group of other country’s government they will generally employ a special classification scheme that both parties have previously agreed to honour.
For example the marking ATOMAL, is applied to U.S. RESTRICTED DATA or FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA and United Kingdom ATOMIC information that has been released to NATO. ATOMAL information is marked COSMIC TOP SECRET ATOMAL (CTSA), NATO SECRET ATOMAL (NSAT), or NATO CONFIDENTIAL ATOMAL (NCA).

===NATO classifications===

For example, sensitive information shared amongst NATO allies has four levels of security classification; from most to least classified:
A special case exists with regard to NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) information. Documents with this marking are NATO property (copyright) and must not be made public without NATO permission. In general documents with this classification aren't cleared for internet-transmission either, unless clearly marked with RELEASABLE FOR INTERNET TRANSMISSION. Documents that can be made public, however, should be clearly marked with NON SENSITIVE INFORMATION RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

===International organisations===

==By country==

Most countries employ some sort of classification system for certain government information. For example, in Canada, information that the U.S. would classify SBU (Sensitive but Unclassified) is called "protected" and further subcategorised into levels A, B, and C.

===Australia===

On 19 July 2011, the National Security (NS) classification marking scheme and the Non-National Security (NNS) classification marking scheme in Australia was unified into one structure.
The Australian Government Security Classification system now comprises TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL and PROTECTED. A new dissemination limiting markers (DLMs) scheme was also introduced for information where disclosure may be limited or prohibited by legislation, or where it may otherwise require special handling.  The DLM marking scheme comprises For Official Use Only (FOUO), Sensitive, Sensitive: Personal, Sensitive: Legal, and Sensitive: Cabinet.[ref]

Documents marked Sensitive Cabinet, relating to discussions in Federal Cabinet, are treated as PROTECTED at minimum due to its higher sensitivity.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, a top secret (Ultra-secreto) government-issued document may be classified for a period of 25 years, which may be extended up to another 25 years. Thus, no document remains classified for more than 50 years. This is mandated by the 2011 Information Access Law (Lei de Acesso à Informação), a change from the previous rule, under which documents could have their classification time length renewed indefinitely, effectively shuttering state secrets from the public. The 2011 law applies retroactively to existing documents.

===Canada===

====Background and hierarchy====

There are 2 main type of sensitive information designation used by the Government of Canada: Classified and Designated. The access and protection of both types of information is governed by the Security of Information Act, effective December 24, 2001,  replacing the Official Secrets Act 1981.Security of Information Act, [tpl]Wayback |date=20080116134930 |url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/newsroom/backgrounders/backgrounder12.asp [/tpl] To access the information, a person must have the appropriate level of clearance and a need to know.
In addition, the caveat "For Canadian Eyes Only" may be used to restrict Classified or Designated information to only Canadian citizens with the appropriate level of clearance and need to know.[tpl]cite web|title=Industrial Security Services - Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/questions/esp-pss-eng.html#q4|work=Public Works and Government Services Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl]

====Special operational information====

SOI is not a classification of data per se. It is defined under the Security of Information Act, and unauthorised release of such information constitutes a higher breach of trust, with penalty of life imprisonment.
SOIs include:

====Classified information====

Classified information can be designated Top Secret, Secret or Confidential. These classifications are only used on matters of national interest.

====Designated information====

Designated information is not classified. Designated information pertains to any sensitive information that does not relate to national security and cannot be disclosed under the access and privacy legislation because of the possible injury to particular public or private interests.Non-Insured Health Benefits Program Privacy CodeSecurity Policy - Manager's Handbook[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Federal Cabinet (Queen's Privy Council for Canada) papers are either designated (i.e. overhead slides prepared to make presentations to Cabinet) or classified (draft legislations, certain memos).Confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada

===People's Republic of China===

The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China (which is not operative in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao) makes it a crime to release a state secret. Regulation and enforcement is carried out by the National Administration for the Protection of State Secrets.
Under the 1989 "Law on Guarding State Secrets,"Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, "Law on Guarding State Secrets" (中华人民共和国保守国家秘密法), promulgated 1988 and effective 1989. state secrets are defined as those that concern:
Secrets can be classified into one of three categories: 

===France===

In France, classified information is defined by article 413-9 of the Penal Code.Article 413-9, Legifrance The three levels of military classification are
Less sensitive information is "protected". The levels are
A further caveat, "spécial France" (reserved France) restricts the document to French citizens (in its entirety or by extracts). This is not a classification level.
Declassification of documents can be done by the Commission consultative du secret de la défense nationale (CCSDN), an independent authority.  Transfer of classified information is done with double envelopes, the outer layer being plastified and numbered, and the inner in strong paper. Reception of the document involves examination of the physical integrity of the container and registration of the document. In foreign countries, the document must be transferred through specialised military mail or diplomatic bag. Transport is done by an authorised convoyer or habilitated person for mail under 20 kg. The letter must bear a seal mentioning "PAR VALISE ACCOMPAGNEE-SACOCHE". Once a year, ministers have an inventory of classified information and supports by competent authorities.
Once their usage period is expired, documents are transferred to archives, where they are either destroyed (by incineration, crushing or electrical overtension), or stored.
In case of unauthorized release of  classified information, competent authorities are the Ministry of Interior, the Haut fonctionnaire de défense et de sécurité ("high civil servant for defence and security") of the relevant ministry, and the General secretary for National Defence. Violation of such secrets is an offence punishable with 7 years of imprisonment and a 100 000 Euro fine; if the offence is committed by imprudence or negligence, the penalties are 3 years of imprisonment and a 45 000 Euro fine.

===Hong Kong===

The Security Bureau is responsible for developing policies in regards to the protection and handling of confidential government information.  In general, the system used in Hong Kong is very similar to the UK system, developed from the Colonial Hong Kong era.
Four classifications exists in Hong Kong, from highest to lowest in sensitivity:http://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/doclib/general.pdf[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl]
Restricted documents are not classified per se, but only those who have a need to know will have access to such information, in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.LCQ3: Equal Opportunities Commission[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===New Zealand===

New Zealand uses the Restricted classification, which is lower than Confidential. 
People may be given access to Restricted information on the strength of an authorisation by their Head of Department, without being subjected to the background vetting associated with Confidential, Secret and Top Secret clearances. New Zealand's security classifications and the national-harm requirements associated with their use are roughly similar to those of the United States.
In addition to national security classifications there are two additional security classifications, In Confidence and Sensitive, which are used to protect information of a policy and privacy nature. There are also a number of information markings  used within ministries and departments of the government, to indicate, for example, that information should not be released outside the originating ministry.
Because of strict privacy requirements around personal information, personnel files are controlled in all parts of the public and private sectors. Information relating to the security vetting of an individual is usually classified at the In Confidence level.

===Romania===

In Romania, classified information is referred to as "state secrets" (secrete de stat) and is defined by the Penal Code as "documents and data that manifestly appear to have this status or have been declared or qualified as such by decision of Government".[tpl]cite web | url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-150-cpen | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 150 | accessdate=January 28, 2013[/tpl] There are three levels of classification—Secret, Top Secret, and Top Secret of Particular Importance.[tpl]cite web | url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/182_2002.php | title=Law no. 182/2002 on protection of classified information | accessdate=January 28, 2013[/tpl] The levels are set by the Romanian Intelligence Service and must be aligned with NATO regulations—in case of conflicting regulations, the latter are applied with priority. Dissemination of classified information to foreign agents or powers is punishable by up to life imprisonment, if such dissemination threatens Romania's national security.[tpl]cite web | url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-157-cpen | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 157 | accessdate=January 28, 2013[/tpl]

===Russian Federation===

In the Russian Federation, a state secret (Государственная тайна) is information protected by the state on its military, foreign policy, economic, intelligence, counterintelligence, operational and investigative and other activities, dissemination of which could harm state security.

===Sweden===

The Swedish classification has been updated due to increased NATO/PfP cooperation. All classified defence documents will now have both a Swedish classification (Kvalificerat hemlig or Hemlig), and an English classification (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, or Restricted).[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]. The term skyddad identitet, "protected identity", is used in the case of protection of a threatened person, basically implying "secret identity", accessible only to certain members of the police force and explicitly authorised officials.

===United Kingdom===

Until 2013, the United Kingdom used five levels of classification—from lowest to highest, they were: PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET (formerly MOST SECRET). The Cabinet Office provides guidance on how to protect information, including the security clearances required for personnel. Staff may be required to sign to confirm their understanding and acceptance of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989, although the Act applies regardless of signature. PROTECT is not in itself a security protective marking level (such as RESTRICTED or greater), but is used to indicate information which should not be disclosed because, for instance, the document contains tax, national insurance, or other personal information.
Government documents without a classification may be marked as UNCLASSIFIED or NOT PROTECTIVELY MARKED.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/spf/faqs.aspx |title=CONTENT Understanding the Security Policy Framework & frequently asked questions |publisher=Cabinetoffice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01[/tpl]
This system was replaced by the Government Security Classifications Policy, which has a simpler model: TOP SECRET, SECRET, and OFFICIAL from April 2014.

===United States===

The U.S. classification system is currently established under Executive Order 13292 and has three levels of classification—Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. The U.S. had a Restricted level during World War II but no longer does. U.S. regulations state that information received from other countries at the Restricted level should be handled as Confidential. A variety of markings are used for material that is not classified, but whose distribution is limited administratively or by other laws, e.g., For Official Use Only (FOUO), or Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU). The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provides for the protection of information related to the design of nuclear weapons. The term "Restricted Data" is used to denote certain nuclear technology. Information about the storage, use or handling of nuclear material or weapons is marked "Formerly Restricted Data". These designations are used in addition to level markings (Confidential, Secret and Top Secret). Information protected by the Atomic Energy Act is protected by law and information classified under the Executive Order is protected by Executive privilege.

¹ In addition, Finland uses label Salassa pidettävä, "to be kept secret" for information that is not classified but must not be revealed on some other basis than national security. (E.g. privacy, trade secrets etc.)

==Corporate classification==

Private corporations often require written confidentiality agreements and conduct background checks on candidates for sensitive positions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs16-bck.htm |title=Employment Background Checks: A Jobseeker's Guide | Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=Privacyrights.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12[/tpl] In the U.S. the Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits private employers from requiring lie detector tests, but there are a few exceptions. Policies dictating methods for marking and safeguarding company-sensitive information (e.g. "IBM Confidential") are common and some companies have more than one level. Such information is protected under trade secret laws. New product development teams are often sequestered and forbidden to share information about their efforts with un-cleared fellow employees, the original Apple Macintosh project being a famous example. Other activities, such as mergers and financial report preparation generally involve similar restrictions. However, corporate security generally lacks the elaborate hierarchical clearance and sensitivity structures and the harsh criminal sanctions that give government classification systems their particular tone.

==Traffic Light Protocol==

The Traffic Light Protocol[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/10/40761118.pdf |title=Development of Policies for Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures |publisher=Cecd.ord |accessdate=2012-11-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=122754275122010&w=2 |title='Re: OpenSSH security advisory: cbc.adv' - MARC |publisher=Marc.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12[/tpl] was developed by the G8 countries to enable the sharing of sensitive information between government agencies and corporations. This protocol has now been accepted as a model for trusted information exchange by over 30 other countries. The protocol provides for four "information sharing levels" for the handling of sensitive information.
