 Johann Georg Christian, Fürst von Lobkowitz (or Lobkowicz), (August 10, 1686 – Wien October 4, 1755) was an Austrian Generalfeldmarschall.
He was descended from the old Bohemian aristocratic family of Lobkowicz, and was the fourth son of Philipp Hyazinth Josef, who was the Prince of Lobkowicz, and Duke of Sagan (1680–1737) and Eleonore Katharina Charlotte Popel von Lobkowicz (1685–1712). 
Johan Georg Chritian was married on November 11, 1718, in Prague, to Caroline Henriette von Waldstein (1702–1780) and they had 10 children. Two of their sons were killed in battle and two other sons became Knights in the Order of the Golden Fleece.
Johann Georg Christian was the founder of the (Hořín)/Mělník branch in the Lobkowitz-family. 
He later fought under Eugene of Savoy against the Turks. 
In 1732 he became Governor of Sicily, and on November 28, 1739 was made a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. 
In 1741 he attained the rank of Field Marshal.
During the War of the Austrian Succession, he first fought the French and Bavarians between Prague and Munich, and was later Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1743 and 1745, and  Imperial army commander in Italy, where he lost the Battle of Velletri (1744).
In 1745 Christoph Willibald Gluck accepted an invitation to become house composer at London's King's Theatre, travelling to England in the company of Georg Christian. Either Gluck or Lobkowitz bought a copy of Handel's Messiah.This copy was used around 1789 by Mozart for his adaption of this oratorio (K. 572).
