==History==

240px|left|Andretti WineryBegun as a "hobby" in 1996, the winery grew steadily.  Mario Andretti's interest in the wine business arose from a commemorative bottling of wine he marketed to celebrate his retirement from auto racing in 1994.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.winebusiness.com/html/PrinterVersion.cfm?dataId=42347|publisher=Wine Business Monthly|date=2006-02-15|title=The Hottest Small Brands of 2005|url=http://www.winebusiness.com/html/MonthlyArticle.cfm?dataid=42347[/tpl]  Two years later Andretti and longtime friend Joe Antonini, former CEO of Kmart (which had sponsored Andretti's racing team) purchased a [tpl]convert|53|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] vineyard and winery in the far north part of Napa, California, where they built a Tuscan-themed winery, tasting room, and guesthouse.  The property was under development as a winery at the time, with wine under production by the former owners.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Philadelphia City Paper|author=A.D.

In 2001 the company conducted a financial transaction in which it sold the [tpl]convert|53|acre|m2[/tpl] to a Napa farming group. The winery then leased back the tasting room and events center. The company has no ownership stake in the nearby vineyards.
The winery is operated by a public company, Andretti Wine Group, that the founders formed in a "reverse public shell merger" in 1995.  It raised $3 million via a public offering in 1998, and remains publicly traded.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Press Democrat|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SA&p_theme=sa&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFEDDD2A40FD48&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Ted Appel|date=1998-01-20|title=Andretti Winery Looking to Stocks for Cash to Grow[/tpl]
