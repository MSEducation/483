==Controversy==

In September 2011, in his official role as a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, Perry likened contestant Alissandra Moone's body to "fat" or "chubby". This was recognised by media commentators as an inference that the underweight teenager was fat. After widespread condemnation, Perry defended himself saying he "did nothing wrong" and claiming his comment related to her posing.[tpl]cite news|title=Top model judge Perry stands by 'fat' comments|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/8294233/top-model-judge-perry-stands-by-fat-comments|accessdate=14 September 2011|newspaper=NineMSN|date=5 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Duck|first=Siobhan|title=Australia's next top controversy - size 8 model bullied for being too fat |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/australias-next-top-controversy-size-8-model-bullied-for-being-too-fat/story-e6frfmyi-1226129310943|accessdate=14 September 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=The Perrygate saga thickens, as Alex Perry says fresh claims he's 'fattist' are 'utterly false'|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/catwalk-fat-fight-boils-over/story-e6frf96o-1226134332636|accessdate=14 September 2011|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=12 September 2011[/tpl]
