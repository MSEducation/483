==Interpretation by Confederate State Courts==

Although the Confederate State Supreme Court was never constituted, the supreme courts of the Confederate States issued numerous decisions interpreting the Confederate Constitution.

The jurisprudence of the Marshall Court, thus, influenced the interpretation of the Confederate Constitution.  The state courts repeatedly upheld robust powers of the Confederate Congress, especially on matters of military necessity.Alfred L.
