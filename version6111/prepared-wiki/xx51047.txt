==Life==

Eggers was born in Boston, Massachusetts, one of four siblings. His father was John K. Eggers (1936–1991), an attorney. His mother, Heidi McSweeney Eggers (1940–1992), was a school teacher. When Eggers was still a child, the family moved to the upscale suburb of Lake Forest, near Chicago. He attended high school there and was a classmate of the actor Vince Vaughn. Eggers attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, intending to get a degree in journalism,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.uiuc.edu/news/07/0123authors.html|date=2007-01-23|accessdate=2007-02-16|title= "Four prize-winning authors taking part in U. of I. series that begins Feb. 8" by Andrea Lynn|work=News Bureau, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign[/tpl] but his studies were interrupted by the deaths of both of his parents in 1991–1992—his father in 1991 from brain and lung cancer, and his mother in January 1992 from stomach cancer. Both were in their 50s.
These events were chronicled in his first book, the fictionalized A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. At the time, Eggers was 21, and his younger brother, Christopher ("Toph"), was 8 years old. The two eldest siblings, Bill and Beth, were unable to commit to care for Toph; his older brother had a full-time job and his sister was enrolled in law school. As a result, Dave Eggers took the responsibility. He left the University of Illinois and moved to Berkeley, California, with his girlfriend Kirsten and his brother. They initially moved in with Eggers's sister, Beth, and her roommate, but eventually found a place in another part of town, which they paid for with money left to them by their parents. Toph attended a small private school, and Eggers did temp work and freelance graphic design for a local newspaper. Eventually, with his friend David Moodie, he took over a local free newspaper called Cups. This gradually evolved into the satirical magazine Might.
Eggers lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and is married to Vendela Vida, also a writer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/08/27/DD126631.DTL|date=2003-08-27|accessdate=2007-02-22|title="Vendela Vida floats amid S.F. literati but keeps feet, attitude firmly planted" by Joshunda Sanders|work=San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl] The couple has two children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/living-0/117074735842110.xml&coll=1|date=2007-02-06|accessdate=2007-02-22|title="Different worlds: The many lives — novelist, social activist, literary innovator, teacher — of Dave Eggers" by Susan Larson|work=The Times-Picayune[/tpl]

The book quickly became a bestseller and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. The memoir was praised for its originality, idiosyncratic self-referencing, and for several innovative stylistic elements. Early printings of the 2001 trade-paperback edition were published with a lengthy postscript entitled, Mistakes We Knew We Were Making. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
In 2002, Eggers published his first novel, You Shall Know Our Velocity, a story about a frustrating attempt to give away money to deserving people while haphazardly traveling the globe. An expanded and revised version was released as Sacrament in 2003.

He has since published a collection of short stories, How We Are Hungry, and three politically themed serials for Salon.com.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/books/eggers/index.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-02-21|title=Introducing (again) Dave Eggers|work=Salon.com[/tpl]

[/ref]  The story is of a Syrian immigrant, Abdulrahman Zeitoun, in New Orleans who was helping neighbors after Hurricane Katrina when he was arrested, imprisoned and suffered abuse. Zeitoun has been optioned by Jonathan Demme, who is working on a screenplay for an animated film-rendition of the work. To Demme, it "felt like the first in-depth immersion I’d ever had through literature or film into the Muslim-American family. ... The moral was that they are like people of any other faith, and I hope our film, if we can get it made, will also be like that." Demme, quoted in early 2011, expressed confidence that when the script is finished, he will be able to find financing, perhaps even from a major studio.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/movies/in-a-better-world-and-other-films-on-islam.html?hpw |title=Rohter, Larry, "Hollywood Ignores East-West Exchange" |date=March 18, 2011 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=March 20, 2011 [/tpl] "It’s a wonderful, gripping story," he said, "and we can have a very, very competitive commercial picture that won’t cost an enormous amount," since animation provides an alternative to expensive re-creations of the hurricane.
Eggers published his novel of the Great Recession and late 2000s financial crisis,A Hologram for the King, in July 2012. In October of that year, the novel was announced as a finalist for the National Book Award .http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2012.html#.UHWre_mlpRg Eggers followed this with 2013's The Circle, which depicts the life of a young worker at a fictional San Francisco based technology company in the near future as she faces doubts about her vocation due to the company's seemingly well-intentioned innovations revealing a more sinister underlying agenda.

And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever?, is scheduled for publication in July 2014.http://www.randomhouse.com/book/246238/your-fathers-where-are-they-and-the-prophets-do-they-live-forever-by-dave-eggers
