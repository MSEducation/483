===Classification===

HIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[tpl]cite web | author=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses | publisher=National Institutes of Health | year=2002 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/61060000.htm | title=61.0.6. Lentivirus | accessdate=February 28, 2006[/tpl] part of the family Retroviridae.[tpl]cite web | author=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses | publisher=National Institutes of Health | year=2002 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/61000000.htm | title=61. Retroviridae | accessdate=February 28, 2006[/tpl] Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[tpl]cite journal | author=Lévy, J. A. | title=HIV pathogenesis and long-term survival | journal=AIDS | year=1993 | pages=1401–10 | volume=7 | issue=11 | pmid=8280406 | doi=10.1097/00002030-199311000-00001[/tpl] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smith JA, Daniel R |title= Following the path of the virus: the exploitation of host DNA repair mechanisms by retroviruses |journal=ACS Chem Biol |volume=1|issue=4 |pages= 217–26 | year= 2006 |pmid= 17163676 |doi=10.1021/cb600131q   |url= [/tpl] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.
Two types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective,[tpl]cite journal | title=Comparison of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity from a prospective cohort study in Senegal | last=Gilbert | first=PB |journal=Statistics in Medicine | date=February 28, 2003| volume=22 | issue=4 | pages=573–593 | pmid=12590415 |doi=10.1002/sim.1342 | last2=McKeague | first2=IW | last3=Eisen | first3=G | last4=Mullins | first4=C | last5=Guéye-Ndiaye| first5=A | last6=Mboup | first6=S | last7=Kanki | first7=PJ[/tpl] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[tpl]cite journal | author=Reeves JD, Doms RW | title=Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 | journal=Journal of General Virology | year=2002 | pages=1253–65 | volume=83 | issue=Pt 6 | pmid=12029140 | doi=10.1099/vir.0.18253-0| doi_brokendate=2014-03-25 [/tpl]

===Structure and genome===

HIV is different in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical[tpl]cite journal | author=McGovern SL, Caselli E, Grigorieff N, Shoichet BK | title=A common mechanism underlying promiscuous inhibitors from virtual and high-throughput screening | journal=Journal of Medical Chemistry | year=2002 | pages=1712–22 | volume=45 | issue=8 | pmid=11931626 | doi=10.1021/jm010533y [/tpl] with a diameter of about 120 nm, around 60 times smaller than a red blood cell, yet large for a virus.Compared with overview in: [tpl]cite book |author=Fisher, Bruce; Harvey, Richard P.; Champe, Pamela C. |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=0-7817-8215-5 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl] Page 3 It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed for the development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.
This is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope that is composed of two layers of fatty molecules called phospholipids taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. Embedded in the viral envelope are proteins from the host cell and about 70 copies of a complex HIV protein that protrudes through the surface of the virus particle. This protein, known as Env, consists of a cap made of three molecules called glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope. This glycoprotein complex enables the virus to attach to and fuse with target cells to initiate the infectious cycle.
Both these surface proteins, especially gp120, have been considered as targets of future treatments or vaccines against HIV.[tpl]cite press release | author=National Institute of Health | title=Crystal structure of key HIV protein reveals new prevention, treatment targets | date=June 17, 1998 |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1998/hivprotein.htm | accessdate = September 14, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219112450/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1998/hivprotein.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2006[/tpl]
The RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is broken down by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.
The two Tat proteins (p16 and p14) are transcriptional transactivators for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR may also be processed into microRNAs that regulate the apoptosis genes ERCC1 and IER3.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ouellet DL, Plante I, Landry P, et al. |title=Identification of functional microRNAs released through asymmetrical processing of HIV-1 TAR element |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=2353–65 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18299284 |pmc=2367715 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn076 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/2353[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Klase Z, Winograd R, Davis J, et al. |title=HIV-1 TAR miRNA protects against apoptosis by altering cellular gene expression |journal=Retrovirology |volume=6 |issue= 1|page=18 |year=2009 |pmid=19220914 |pmc=2654423 |doi=10.1186/1742-4690-6-18 |url=http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/18 [/tpl]  The Rev protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the RRE RNA element. The Vif protein (p23) prevents the action of APOBEC3G (a cell protein that deaminates DNA:RNA hybrids and/or interferes with the Pol protein).  The Vpr protein (p14) arrests cell division at G2/M.  The Nef protein (p27) down-regulates CD4 (the major viral receptor), as well as the MHC class I and class II molecules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Garcia JV, Miller AD |title=Serine phosphorylation-independent downregulation of cell-surface CD4 by nef |journal=Nature |volume=350|issue=6318 |pages=508–11 |date=April 1991 |pmid=2014052 |doi=10.1038/350508a0|url=|bibcode = 1991Natur.350..508G |last2=Miller [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Schwartz O, Maréchal V, Le Gall S, Lemonnier F, Heard JM |title=Endocytosis of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules is induced by the HIV-1 Nef protein |journal=Nat.

Nef also interacts with SH3 domains.  The Vpu protein (p16) influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells. The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called the long terminal repeat (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell. The Psi element is involved in viral genome packaging and recognized by Gag and Rev proteins. The SLIP element (TTTTTT) is involved in the frameshift in the Gag-Pol reading frame required to make functional Pol.

===Tropism===

The term viral tropism refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.
Macrophage (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-syncitia-inducing strains (NSI; now called R5 viruses[tpl]cite pmid|9440686[/tpl] ) use the β-chemokine receptor CCR5 for entry and are, thus, able to replicate in macrophages and CD4+ T cells. This CCR5 coreceptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4+ cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus.
T-tropic isolates, or syncitia-inducing (SI; now called X4 viruses ) strains replicate in primary CD4+ T cells as well as in macrophages and use the α-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal |author=Deng H, Liu R, Ellmeier W, Choe S, Unutmaz D, Burkhart M, Di Marzio P, Marmon S, Sutton RE, Hill CM, Davis CB, Peiper SC, Schall TJ, Littman DR, Landau NR |title=Identification of a major co-receptor for primary isolates of HIV-1 | journal=Nature | year=1996 | pages=661–6 | volume=381 | issue=6584 | pmid=8649511 | doi=10.1038/381661a0 |bibcode = 1996Natur.381..661D |last2=Liu |last3=Ellmeier |last4=Choe |last5=Unutmaz |last6=Burkhart |last7=Marzio |last8=Marmon |last9=Sutton |last10=Hill |last11=Davis |last12=Peiper |last13=Schall |last14=Littman |last15=Landau [/tpl][/ref] Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of HIV-1 and thus are able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for viral entry.
The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.
Some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tang J, Kaslow RA | title=The impact of host genetics on HIV infection and disease progression in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy | journal=AIDS | year=2003 | pages=S51–S60 | volume=17 | issue=Suppl 4 | pmid=15080180 | doi=10.1097/00002030-200317004-00006[/tpl] For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation are resistant to infection with R5 virus, as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.
Sexual intercourse is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway.[tpl]cite journal | author=Zhu T, Mo H, Wang N, Nam DS, Cao Y, Koup RA, Ho DD | title=Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 patients with primary infection | journal=Science | year=1993 | pages=1179–81 | volume=261 | issue=5125 | pmid=8356453 | doi=10.1126/science.8356453|bibcode = 1993Sci...261.1179Z | last2=Mo | last3=Wang | last4=Nam | last5=Cao | last6=Koup | last7=Ho [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=van’t Wout AB, Kootstra NA, Mulder-Kampinga GA, Albrecht-van Lent N, Scherpbier HJ, Veenstra J, Boer K, Coutinho RA, Miedema F, Schuitemaker H. | title=Macrophage-tropic variants initiate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection after sexual, parenteral, and vertical transmission | journal=J Clin Invest | year=1994 | pages=2060–7 | volume=94 | issue=5 | pmid=7962552 | doi=10.1172/JCI117560 | pmc=294642 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Zhu T, Wang N, Carr A, Nam DS, Moor-Jankowski R, Cooper DA, Ho DD | title=Genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in blood and genital secretions: evidence for viral compartmentalization and selection during sexual transmission | journal=J Virol | year=1996 | pages=3098–107 | volume=70 | issue=5 | pmid=8627789 | pmc=190172 [/tpl] How this selective process works is still under investigation, but one model is that spermatozoa may selectively carry R5 HIV as they possess both CCR3 and CCR5 but not CXCR4 on their surface[tpl]cite journal| author=Muciaccia B, Padula F, Vicini E, Gandini L, Lenzi A, Stefanini M | title=Beta-chemokine receptors 5 and 3 are expressed on the head region of human spermatozoon | journal=FASEB J | year=2005 | pages=2048–50 | volume=19 | issue=14 | pmid=16174786 | doi=10.1096/fj.05-3962fje [/tpl] and that genital epithelial cells preferentially sequester X4 virus.[tpl]cite journal | author=Berlier W, Bourlet T, Lawrence P, Hamzeh H, Lambert C, Genin C, Verrier B, Dieu-Nosjean MC, Pozzetto B, Delezay O | title=Selective sequestration of X4 isolates by human genital epithelial cells: Implication for virus tropism selection process during sexual transmission of HIV | journal=J Med Virol. | year=2005 | pages=465–74 | volume=77 | issue=4 | pmid=16254974 | doi=10.1002/jmv.20478 [/tpl] In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4.[tpl]cite journal |author=Clevestig P, Maljkovic I, Casper C, Carlenor E, Lindgren S, Naver L, Bohlin AB, Fenyo EM, Leitner T, Ehrnst A | title=The X4 phenotype of HIV type 1 evolves from R5 in two children of mothers, carrying X4, and is not linked to transmission | journal=AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses | year=2005 | pages=371–8 | volume=5 | issue=21 | pmid=15929699 | doi=10.1089/aid.2005.21.371 [/tpl] These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS.[tpl]cite journal | author=Moore JP | title=Coreceptors: implications for HIV pathogenesis and therapy |journal=Science | year=1997 | pages=51–2 | volume=276 | issue=5309 | pmid=9122710 | doi=10.1126/science.276.5309.51 [/tpl] Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.[tpl]cite journal | author=Karlsson A, Parsmyr K, Aperia K, Sandstrom E, Fenyo EM, Albert J.| title=MT-2 cell tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates as a marker for response to treatment and development of drug resistance | journal=J Infect Dis. | year=1994 | pages=1367–75 | volume=170 | issue=6 | pmid=7995974 | doi=10.1093/infdis/170.6.1367 [/tpl]
HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution. The adoption of "accessory genes" by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of coreceptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host but ultimately become a commensal organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants more successful at transmission will be selected.[tpl]cite book |author= Cheney K, McKnight A |chapter=HIV-2 Tropism and Disease | year=2010 |title=Lentiviruses and Macrophages: Molecular and Cellular Interactions | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn=978-1-904455-60-8 [/tpl]
