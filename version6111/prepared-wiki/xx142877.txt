The New Hampshire Gay Men's Chorus (NHGMC) is an American choral organization in Manchester, New Hampshire. Established in 1998, and member of the Manchester Performing Arts Association,  the stated mission of the NHGMC is to present quality entertainment, provide an opportunity for wholesome social interaction for its members, and present a positive image of the gay community in New Hampshire.
The chorus produces two concert series each year; the winter concert in early December, and the spring concert in early May. The chorus also accepts requests for public and private performances  from community organizations year-round.
Membership is open to all men, 18 years and older, who are gay or gay-friendly, and enjoy the camaraderie and satisfaction of singing in a vocal group. New members are welcomed to join the chorus at the beginning of each season.
The chorus is currently under the direction of Luc Andre Roberge. Its accompanist is pianist Gary Finger. As of their Winter 2011 season, there are 26 singing members in the group.http://nhgmc.com/bios.php
