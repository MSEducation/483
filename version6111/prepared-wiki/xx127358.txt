Mülligen is a municipality in the district of Brugg in canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==History==

The earliest known settlement was in the Early Middle Ages, though the only traces of the settlement are two groups of graves.  Mülligen is first mentioned in the 12th Century as Mülinon.  Until the 17th Century it was known as Mülinen.
The rights to high and low justice were held by the Habsburgs through Königsfelden Abbey.  After the secularization of the Abbey, those rights were held by Bern.
Originally the major economic activity in Mülligen was agriculture and viticulture.  After 1730, small scale textile production provided another source of income.  Then in 1849 a Gypsum processing plant opened in the village.  Starting about 1830, the residents of Mülligen worked in the spinning mill in Windisch, and the first industrial plant in Mülligen opened in 1909.  In 1924, a gravel plant opened in the village, and it was expanded in 1955.  In 1964 the bovine artificial insemination center of the Swiss Association for Artificial Insemination opened.
The passenger ferry on the river Reuss was replaced in 1940 by a bridge.  Benefiting from the village's proximity to the junction of the A1 and A3 motorways, A1-A3, Mülligen has become a residential village with many commuters to Brugg, Baden and Zurich.
