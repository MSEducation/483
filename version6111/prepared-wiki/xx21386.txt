As of the 2010 census, the population was 242,803;[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51710.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2014[/tpl] in 2013, the population was estimated to be 246,392http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics. Virginia State 2013 Population Estimates Retrieved February 2, 2013 making it the second-most populous city in Virginia, behind neighboring Virginia Beach.
Norfolk is located at the core of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, named for the large natural harbor of the same name located at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area, officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA. The city is bordered to the west by the Elizabeth River and to the north by the Chesapeake Bay. It also shares land borders with the independent cities of Chesapeake to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. One of the oldest of the cities in Hampton Roads, Norfolk is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region.
The city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest Navy base in the world, Naval Station Norfolk, is located in Norfolk along with one of NATO's two Strategic Command headquarters. The city also has the corporate headquarters of Norfolk Southern Railway, one of North America's principal Class I railroads, and Maersk Line, Limited, who manages the world's largest fleet of US-flag vessels. As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water, Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property, including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of Interstate highways, bridges, tunnels, and three bridge-tunnel complexes—the only bridge-tunnels in the United States.

==History==

In 1619, the Governor for the Virginia Colony, Sir George Yeardley established four incorporations, termed citties, for the developed portion of the colony. These formed the basis for colonial representative government in the newly minted House of Burgesses. What would become Norfolk was put under the Elizabeth Cittie incorporation.
In 1634 King Charles I reorganized the colony into a system of shires. The former Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, Adam Thoroughgood (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King's Lynn, Norfolk, England) was granted a large land holding along the Lynnhaven River in 1636. When the South Hampton Roads portion of the shire was partitioned off, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed New Norfolk County. One year later, it split into two counties, Upper Norfolk County and Lower Norfolk County (present day Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgood’s recommendation.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html| title = The Origins of Norfolk's Name| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

Norfolk was incorporated in 1705, and in 1736  George II granted Norfolk a royal charter as a borough.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html| title = Norfolk Becomes a Borough| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society[/tpl]
By 1775, Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued was the most prosperous city in Virginia. It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond. In part because of its merchants' numerous trading ties with other parts of the British Empire, Norfolk served as a strong base of Loyalist support during the early part of the American Revolution. After fleeing the colonial capitol of Williamsburg, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was forced into exile by the American rebels, commanded by Colonel Woodford. His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.history.org/Almanack/resources/dateline/polcron.cfm#seeds| title = Cultural & Political Chronology (1750-1783)| accessdate = 2007-09-30| publisher = Colonial Williamsburg[/tpl]
On New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for over eight hours. The damage from the shells, and fires started by the British and spread by the patriots, destroyed over 800 buildings, almost two-thirds of the city.  The patriots destroyed the remaining buildings for strategic reasons in February.Guy, Louis L. jr.Norfolk's Worst Nightmare, Norfolk Historical Society Courier (Spring 2001)- accessed 2008-01-03 Only the walls of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church survived the bombardment and subsequent fires.

Following recovery from the Revolutionary War's burning, the 19th century began inauspiciously for Norfolk and her citizens.  In 1804, another serious fire along the city’s waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city experienced a serious economic setback.
During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the American South suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the Piedmont, or into Kentucky and Tennessee.  Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to tobacco cultivation in the Tidewater.  Virginia made various attempts to phase out slavery, either through law (see Thomas Jefferson Randolph's 1832 resolution) or through "repatriation" of blacks to Africa.  Many emigrants to Africa from Virginia and North Carolina embarked from the port of Norfolk.  Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a native of Norfolk, was an emigrant who became the first president of Liberia.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President| title =  Joseph Roberts, Liberia's first President!| accessdate = 2008-02-19| publisher = The African-American Registry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071123023225/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President  |archivedate = 2007-11-23[/tpl]
On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin put into Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indes where an outbreak of Yellow Fever had struck, so the port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of Yellow Fever were discovered and a machinist died from the condition on July 8. By August several people were dying per day and a third of the city population had fled. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. This was soon followed by bans from neighboring cities. The outbreak spread through the city, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead.[tpl]citation | first = Lon | last = Wagner | title = The Fever, a Story in 14 Parts | work = The Virginian-Pilot | date = July 10–23, 2005 | url = http://www.portsmouthva.gov/history/fever/thefever.pdf | accessdate = 2013-05-18 | postscript = .

In early 1861, Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for ratification of the ordinance of secession. Virginia voted to secede from the Union. In the spring of 1862, the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city's Sewell's Point Peninsula, marking the first fight between two ironclads, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The battle ended in a stalemate, but forever changed the course of naval warfare; from then on, warships were fortified with metal.[tpl]cite web| url = http://americancivilwar.com/monitor.html| title = Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Americancivilwar.com[/tpl]  In May 1862, Norfolk Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city to General John E. Wool and Union forces.  They held the city under martial law for the duration of the Civil War.  Thousands of slaves escaped to Union lines to gain their freedom and set up schools in Norfolk so they could start learning before the end of the war.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/46.html| title = Lincoln Plans the Recapture of Norfolk| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society [/tpl]
1907 brought both the Virginian Railway and the Jamestown Exposition to Sewell's Point. The large Naval Review at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location and laid the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition featured many prominent officials, including President Theodore Roosevelt, members of Congress, and diplomats from 21 countries. By 1917, as the US built up to enter World War I, the Naval Air Station Hampton Roads had been constructed on the former exposition grounds.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.twainquotes.com/TwainRogersVA.html| title = Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = http://www.twainquotes.com[/tpl]
In the first half of the 20th century, Norfolk expanded its borders through annexation. In 1906, the city annexed the incorporated town of Berkley, which stretched the city limits across the Elizabeth River.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1906.asp| title = Norfolk: 1906 Annexation| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = City of Norfolk |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127123719/http://norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1906.asp  |archivedate = 2007-11-27[/tpl] In 1923, the city expanded to include Sewell's Point, Willoughby Spit, the town of Campostella, and the Ocean View area.

With the dawn of the Interstate Highway System, new highways opened in the region. A series of bridges and tunnels constructed during fifteen years linked Norfolk with the Peninsula, Portsmouth, and Virginia Beach. In 1952, the Downtown Tunnel opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. In 1991, the new Downtown Tunnel/Berkley Bridge complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/HR_Interstates_Freeways.html| title = Hampton Roads Area Interstates and Freeways| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future[/tpl] Additional bridges and tunnels included the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1957,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I64_VA_HRBT.html| title = Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future[/tpl] the Midtown Tunnel in 1962,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Mid_Tunn_Port_Norf_MLK.html| title = Midtown Tunnel Parallel Tube Project| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future[/tpl] and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway (Interstate 264 and State Route 44) in 1967.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I264_VA_Desc.html| title = Interstate 264 in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future[/tpl]
In reaction to the Supreme Court ruling in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and ordered integration, Virginia pursued a policy of "massive resistance". The Virginia General Assembly prohibited state funding for integrated public schools. Norfolk's private schools had voluntarily integrated by choosing to comply with the Brown decision. In 1958, United States district courts in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, Governor James Lindsay Almond, Jr. ordered the schools closed. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals declared the state law to be in conflict with the state constitution and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. About 10 days later, Almond capitulated and asked the General Assembly to rescind several "massive resistance" laws.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| title = Massive Resistance - The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Virginia Historical Society[/tpl] In September 1959, 17 black children entered six previously segregated Norfolk public schools.

After desegregation, and with new suburban developments beckoning, many white middle-class residents moved out of the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population fell. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.janafshopping.com/aboutjanaf.php| title = History of JANAF Shopping Center| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = JANAF Shopping Center[/tpl]
Norfolk's city leaders began a long push to revive its urban core. While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline were erected. The city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace in 1983 to attract people to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/| title = Waterside Marketplace| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = Waterside[/tpl] Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park baseball stadium, home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team.

Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/About/| title = About Norfolk| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = City of Norfolk[/tpl]

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|96|sqmi|km2[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|54|sqmi|km2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|42|sqmi|km2[/tpl]  (43.9%) is water.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl] Norfolk is located at [tpl]Coord|36|55|N|76|12|W|type:city[/tpl] (36.8857° N, 76.2599° W)
The city is located at the southeastern corner of Virginia at the junction of the Elizabeth River and Chesapeake Bay. The Hampton Roads Metropolitan Statistical Area (officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA) is the 37th largest in the United States, with a total population of 1,699,925 in 2012. The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Williamsburg, and the counties of Gloucester, Isle of Wight, James City, Mathews, and York, as well as the North Carolina counties of Currituck and Gates. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and Williamsburg are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb.
In addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the Willoughby Spit and Ocean View communities.

===Cityscape===

When Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and frame construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide chimneys and thatch roofs. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style, which was popular in the South at the time, was used. Brick was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes.  By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.
Norfolk was burned down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like New World homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had simple construction.
In the early 19th century, Neoclassical architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.thumb|right|175px|Taylor-Whittle House (c. 1790), now occupied by the Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach and the Norfolk Historical Society[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jlnvb.org/?nd=house |title=Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach |publisher=Jlnvb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14[/tpl]
Greek-style homes gave way to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which emphasized pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.
High-rise buildings were first built in the late 19th century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the 20th century. Bungalows and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.
As the Great Depression wore on, Art Deco emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta, and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles.

===Neighborhoods===

Norfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods.  Some neighborhoods, such as Berkley, were formerly cities and towns.  Others, such as Willoughby Spit and Ocean View, have a long history tied to the Chesapeake Bay.  Today neighborhoods such as Downtown and Ghent and Fairmount Park Neighborhood have transformed with the revitalization that the city has undergone.

===Climate===

Norfolk has a humid subtropical climate with moderate changes of seasons. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summer temperatures can be unpleasantly hot, often topping 90 °F (32 °C) with high humidity. On average, July is the warmest month of the year, with the maximum average precipitation. Hurricanes and tropical storms usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally  make landfalls in the area. Fall is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights. Winter is usually mild in Norfolk, with the coldest days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper 40s to mid 50s (8 to 13 °C). On average, the coldest month of the year is January. Norfolk's record high was [tpl]convert|105|°F|0[/tpl] on August 7, 1918 and July 24 and 25, 2010, and record low was [tpl]convert|−3|°F|0[/tpl] recorded on January 21, 1985.Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation Information from The Weather Channel."

==Demographics==

As of the census[tpl]GR|8[/tpl] of 2010, there were 242,803 people, 86,210 households, and 51,898 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,362.8 people per square mile (1,684.4/km²). There were 94,416 housing units at an average density of 1,757.3 per square mile (678.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 47.1% White, 43.1% African American, 0.5% Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 2.2% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 6.6% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 44.3% of the population in 2010,[tpl]cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51710.html |title=Norfolk city, Virginia |work=State & County QuickFacts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=May 4, 2012[/tpl] down from 68.5% in 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=Virginia - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=May 4, 2012[/tpl]
There were 86,210 households out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.9% were married couples living together, 18.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.8% were non-families. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

==Economy==

Since Norfolk serves as the commercial and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it can be difficult to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole.
The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region play an important part in the local economy. As a strategic location at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, its protected deep-water channels serve as a major trade artery for the import and export of goods from across the Mid-Atlantic, Mid-West, and internationally.
In addition to commercial activities, Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the United States Navy, and Norfolk serves as the home for the most important of these regional installations, Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval station. Located on Sewell's Point Peninsula, in the northwest corner of the city, the installation is the current headquarters of the United States Fleet Forces Command (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), as well as being home port for the Second Fleet, which compromises approximately 62,000 active duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft. The base also serves as the headquarters to the Allied Command Transformation (NATO) and the United States Joint Forces Command.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.globalSecurity.org| title = NATO official information via GlobalSecurity.org| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl]
The region also plays an important role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.[tpl]cite web| url = http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml| title = State of the Region 2004| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = Old Dominion University[/tpl]
After the military, the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and is home to the world's largest and fastest container cranes.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm| title = Norfolk International Terminals| accessdate = 2007-08-06| publisher = Virginia Port Authority |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070803150402/http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm  |archivedate = 2007-08-03[/tpl] Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.[tpl]cite web| url = http://hreda.com/publicImages/downloadFiles/The%20Port%20of%20Hampton%20Roads.pdf|format=PDF| title = The Port of Hampton Roads| accessdate = 2007-08-06| publisher = Hampton Roads Economic Development Authority[/tpl]

Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier.[tpl]cite news|last=Richards|first=Gregory|title=Sleek new cruise terminal set to welcome travelers|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/247981|accessdate=29 September 2010|newspaper=Virginian Pilot|date=7 April 2007[/tpl] Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.cruisenorfolk.org/| title = Cruise Norfolk| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Norfolk Cruise Terminal[/tpl]
