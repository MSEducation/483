to the strict residential criteria of the time. He then returned to the Rabbitohs and played in the back-to-back premiership-winning Souths sides of 1931 and 1932. In 1935 he was signed by St. George and played in the record-breaking 91-6 win over competition newcomers Canterbury-Bankstown before later becoming the club's captain-coach.
