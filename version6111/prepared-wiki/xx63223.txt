Maryland's [tpl]convert|164|mi|adj=on[/tpl] spine route of the East Coast Greenway takes a jagged S-shaped course across urbanized Central Maryland.  It travels from Delaware due west to the Northern Central Rail Trail, turns south to pass through Baltimore and then southeast to Annapolis, and then turns west and winds toward Washington, D.C.  There is also a branch of the East Coast Greenway across the Chesapeake Bay on the Eastern Shore: it starts just past the Delaware state line and travels south across the Delmarva Peninsula to reach the Cross Island Trail, then crosses the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to rejoin the spine route in Annapolis.
Maryland is the only state on the East Coast Greenway where motorist assistance is required on the spine route: the Thomas J. Hatem Bridge over the Susquehanna River has no bicycle or pedestrian accommodations.  A crossing service was once provided by Biller's Bikes in Havre de Grace. In 2012, Howard Transit began regular bus service across the bridge with buses equipped with two-bike racks. On the Eastern Shore Route, bicycles are prohibited on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and there is no crossing service here at all.
Two future trails are expected to become parts of the East Coast Greenway:  the South Shore Trail between Odenton and Annapolis and the connection of the two pieces of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail (WB&A).  The WB&A's segments are separated by the Patuxent River and a property dispute.
