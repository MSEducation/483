[[Demographics of Burma]]

CATEGORIES: Burmese society, Demographics of Burma, Demographics by country

The following is an overview of the demographics of Burma (or Myanmar), including statistics such as population, ethnicity, language, education level and religious affiliation.

==Population==

At the time of the last official census in Burma, 31 March 1983, the population was 35,442,972. [tpl]As of|2012|alt=As of July 2012[/tpl], this was estimated by the CIA World Factbook to have increased to 60,584,650. Other estimates put place the total population at around 60 million. China's People Daily reported that Burma had a census in 2007, and at the end of 2009 has 59.2 million people, and growing at 2% annually.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/7049436.html|title=Myanmar population hits over 59 mln in 2009|date=1 July 2010|work=People's Daily|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] with exception for Cyclone Nargis in 2008.
Britain-based human rights agencies place the population as high as 70 million. Estimates for the country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS. This can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected.
No trustworthy census has occurred since the 1930s. In the 1940s, the detailed census results were destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1942. Census results after that time have been flawed by civil wars and a series of military governments. The last official census in 1983 occurred at a time when parts of the country were controlled by insurgent groups and inaccessible to the government.
The 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey found that the average household size was 4.72 (urban 4.87, rural 4.67), and that the average per capita household expenditure was K 20,581.71 (urban K 23269.10, rural K. 19407.25)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csostat.gov.mm/survey.asp|title=Household Income and Expenditure Survey|work=Central Statistical Organization|publisher=Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development|accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl]

==Fertility statistics==

Burma has a low fertility rate (2.23 in 2011), slightly above replacement level, especially as compared to other Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing, like Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41), representing a significant decline from 4.7 in 1983 to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national population policy.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Gavin W. |year=2007 |title=Delayed Marriage and Very Low Fertility in Pacific Asia |journal=Population and Development Review |publisher=The Population Council, Inc. |volume=33 |issue=33 |pages=453–478 |url=http://dahuang.dhxy.info/population/Delayed_Marriage_Fertility09.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2007.00180.x [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Myat Mon |year=2008 |title=The Economic Position of Women in Burma |journal=Asian Studies Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=243–255 |doi=10.1111/1467-8403.00076 [/tpl] 
The fertility rate is much pronouncedly lower in urban areas. This is attributed to extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled in the region, with the exception of developed countries), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of single, unmarried women of reproductive age (with 25.9% of women aged 30–34 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25–34 single).http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldmarriage/worldmarriagepatterns2000.pdf
These patterns stem from several cultural and economic dynamics. The first is economic hardship, which results in the delay of marriage and family-building (the average age of marriage in Burma is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women).http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldmarriage/worldmarriagepatterns2000.pdf The second is the social acceptability of celibacy among the Burmese, who are predominantly Buddhist and value celibacy as a means of spiritual development.[tpl]Cite thesis |degree=Master's |chapter=V: Conclusion and Recommendation |title=The Determinants of Age at First Marriage in Myanmar |url=http://mulinet10.li.mahidol.ac.th/e-thesis/4738657.pdf |author=Nyi Nyi |year=2005 |publisher=Mahidol University |accessdate=20 September 2010 |docket= |oclc= [/tpl]

==Ethnic groups==

===Government classifications===

The Burmese government identifies eight major national ethnic races (which comprise 135 "distinct" ethnic groups), which include the Bamar (68%), Shan (9%), Kayin (7%), Rakhine (4%), Mon (2%), Kayah, and Kachin. However, the government classification system is flawed, because it groups ethnic groups under ethnic races by geography, rather than by linguistic or genetic similarity (e.g. the Kokang are under the Shan ethnic race, although they are ethnic Chinese). 
Unrecognised ethnic groups include Burmese Indians and Burmese Chinese, who form 2% and 3% of the population respectively. The remaining 5% of the population belong to small ethnic groups such as the remnants of the Anglo-Burmese and Anglo-Indian communities, as well as the Lisu, Rawang, Naga, Padaung, Moken, and many minorities across Shan State.

==Language==

The official language and primary medium of instruction of Burma is Burmese (65%). Multiple languages are spoken in Burma, and include Shan (6.4%), Karen (5.2%), Kachin (1.8%), Chin (1.6%), Mon (1.5%), and Rakhine (1.5%). English is also spoken, particularly by the educated urban elite, and is the secondary language learnt in government schools.
