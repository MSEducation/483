The report, "The Degree Dividend" was issued in November, 2010. 

==Whitewater==

In February 1992, Lyons was engaged by the Clintons to investigate their involvement in the real estate investment later known as Whitewater.  Within a month, Lyons issued a report which concluded that the Clintons had not been involved in the management of the Whitewater real estate venture or the failure or Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.  He also concluded that the Clintons had invested and lost substantial funds in connection with the Whitewater venture.
Two subsequent investigations resulted in  reports,  including the Final Report of the Independent Counsel.  These two reports confirmed the conclusions of the so-called Lyons report.  The Final Report of the Independent Counsel stated "all three investigative entities Lyons, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, and Independent Counsel reached substantially the same conclusions" regarding the Clintons' financial contributions and involvement in Whitewater.

==Nomination to the Tenth Circuit==

On September 22, 1999, President Clinton nominated Lyons to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that had opened up when Tenth Circuit Judge John Porfilio assumed senior status.http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55859190.html  Although Lyons was given the highest rating ("well qualified") by the nonpartisan American Bar Association and supported by Colorado's senior senator at the time, Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Colorado's other senator, Wayne Allard, used his home-state senator prerogative to block Lyons' nomination because of his ties to  President Clinton. At Lyons request, the White House withdrew his nomination in December, 1999. The seat remained vacant until after the election of George W Bush who nominated Timothy Tymkovich in 2003. He was confirmed later that year.
