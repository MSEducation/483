During the 1948 Palestine War, around 85% (720,000 people) of the Palestinian Arab population of what has become Israel left their homes, either driven by force, by fear, or by instruction of Arab leadership. They fled to the West Bank and Gaza, and to the contiguous countries of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.Michael Dumper, 'Introduction,' p. 2. They, and their descendants, who are also entitled to registration, are assisted by UNWRA in 58 registered camps, 10 of which were established in the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967 to cope with new Palestinian refugees.UNWRA, Palestine refugees Including unregistered, displaced persons and refugee descendants, the Palestinian Arab refugee and displaced population is the largest in the world.Dumper, 'Introduction,'p.6  They are also the worlds oldest unsettled refugee population, having been under the ongoing governance of Arab states following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the refugee populations of Gaza and the West Bank under Israeli governance since the Six Day War. Their conditions of life are precarious. Citizenship or legal residency in host countries is denied in Lebanon where the absorption of Palestinians would upset a delicate confessional balance, but available in Jordan where approximately 40% of UNWRA-registered Palestinian refugees have acquired full citizenship rights.Rex Brynen, 'Perspectives on Palestinian repatriation,' in (ed.) Palestinian Refugee Repatriation: Global Perspectives, Taylor & Francis, 2006, pp. 63–86 p. 80.Menachem Klein, 'The Palestinian refugees of 1948: models of allowed and denied return,' in Dumper, 2006 pp. 87–106, p. 93. Resolution 194 was adopted by the General Assembly on 11 December 1948, calling for the return of refugees from the ongoing Arab-Israeli hostilities. It forms one basis for the Palestinian Arab claim for a 'right of return'.
Though the 1948 refugees and their descendants are broadly defined as "refugees" (laji'un), Palestinian Arabs make several distinctions. The PLO, especially those who have returned and form part of the PNA, but also Palestinian refugee camp residents in Lebanon, repudiate this term, since it implies being a passive victim, and prefer the autonym of 'returnees' (a'idun).Helena Lindholm Schulz, with Juliane Hammer, The Palestinian Diaspora: Formation of Identities and Politics of Homeland, Psychology Press reprint 2003 p. 130. Those who left since 1967, and their descendants, are called nazihun or 'displaced persons', though many descend from the 1948 group.Michael Chiller-Glaus, Tackling the Intractable: Palestinian Refugees and the Search for Middle East Peace, Peter Lang, 2007 p. 82, as opposed to muwatinun (citizens).
An independent poll conducted in 2003 with the Palestinian populations of Gaza, West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon showed that the majority (54%) would accept a financial compensation and a place to live in West Bank or Gaza in place of returning to the exact place in modern-day Israel where they or their ancestors lived (this possibility of settlement is contemplated in the Resolution 194). Only 10% said they would live in Israel if given the option.The Palestinian ‘Right of Return’: Abbas Wades into the Morass, Time Magazine, November 6, 2012

==Definitions==

===UNRWA===

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) defines a Palestine refugee as a person "whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict". The patrilineal descendants of the original Palestine refugees "are also eligible for registration." UNRWA aids all "those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance" and those who first became refugees as a result of the Six-Day War, regardless whether they reside in areas designated as Palestine refugee camps or in other permanent communities. A Palestine refugee camp is "a plot of land placed at the disposal of UNRWA by the host government to accommodate Palestine refugees and to set up facilities to cater to their needs". Only around 1.4 million of registered Palestine refugees, approximately one-third, live in the 58 UNRWA-recognised refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The UNRWA definition does not cover final status.[tpl]cite web|title=Who are Palestine refugees?|url=http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=86|work=Palestine refugees|publisher=United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees|accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=87|title=UNRWA's Frequently Asked Questions under "Who is a Palestine refugee?"|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl] In many cases UNHCR provides support for the children of Palestine refugees too.
Registered descendants of UNRWA Palestine refugees, like “Nansen passport” and “Certificate of Eligibility” holders (the documents issued to those displaced by World War II) or like UNHCR refugees,http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3314.pdf “Thus, a holder of a so-called “Nansen Passport”4 or a “Certificate of Eligibility” issued by the International Refugee Organization must be considered a refugee under the 1951 Convention unless one of the cessation clauses has become applicable to his case or he is excluded from the application of the Convention by one of the exclusion clauses. This also applies to a surviving child of a statutory refugee.” inherit the same Palestine refugee status as their male parent.
The UNRWA is an organ of the United Nations created exclusively for the purpose of aiding those displaced by the Arab-Israeli wars, with an annual budget of approximately $600 million."Today, UNRWA’s annual budget stands at approximately $600 million, of which $250 million is contributed by the United States. Overall, America has contributed $4.4 billion to the UN agency since its establishment in 1949."US Senate dramatically scales down definition of Palestinian ‘refugees’

==Origin of the Palestine refugees==

Most Palestinian refugees have retained their refugee status and continue to reside in refugee camps, including within the State of Palestine in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. Their descendants form a sizable portion of the Palestinian diaspora.

===Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Palestine War===

During the 1948 Palestine War, 711,000 out of around 900,000 Palestine Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories that became the State of Israel. The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict.Shlaim, Avi, "The War of the Israeli Historians." Center for Arab Studies, 1 December 2003 (retrieved 17 February 2009)
Whereas historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war by Jewish leaders or was an unintended consequence of the war.Benny Morris, 1989, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949, Cambridge University Press; Benny Morris, 1991, 1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians, Clarendon Press, Oxford; Walid Khalidi, 1992, All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948, Institute for Palestine Studies; Nur Masalha, 1992, Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of "Transfer" in Zionist Political Thought, Institute for Palestine Studies; Efraim Karsh, 1997, Fabricating Israeli History: The "New Historians", Cass; Benny Morris, 2004, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press; Yoav Gelber, 2006, Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem, Oxford University Press; Ilan Pappé, 2006, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, OneWorld
In a study of bias in Palestinian and Zionist sources dealing with the nakba, Steven Glazer lists a number of early Zionist historians and writers, notably Joseph Schechtman, Leo Kohn, Jon Kimche and Maria Syrkin, who considered that:
 "...the Arabs in Palestine were asked to stay and live as citizens in the Jewish state. Instead, they chose to leave, either because they were unwilling to live with the Jews, or because they expected an Arab military victory which would annihilate the Zionists. They thought they could leave temporarily and return at their leisure. Later, an additional claim was put forth, namely that the Palestinians were ordered to leave, with radio broadcasts instructing them to quit their homes".Steven Glazer, 1980, 'The Palestinian Exodus in 1948', J. Palestine Studies 9(4), p. 96-118.  
The implication of this position is that the Palestinians chose to leave, and thus forfeited their rights to their land, and must accept their own responsibilities for the plight they find themselves in.Steven Glazer, 1980, 'The Palestinian Exodus in 1948', J. Palestine Studies 9(4), p.96-118, p.97.
According to Benny Morris, between December 1947 and March 1948, around 100,000 Palestine Arabs fled. Among them were many from the higher and middle classes from the cities, who left voluntarily, expecting to return when the Arab states won the war and took control of the country.Benny Morris (2003), pp.138-139. When the Haganah went on the defensive, between April and July, a further 250,000 to 300,000 Palestinian Arabs left or were expelled, mainly from the towns of Haifa, Tiberias, Beit-Shean, Safed, Jaffa and Acre, which lost more than 90 percent of their Arab inhabitants.Benny Morris (2003), p.262 Expulsions took place in many towns and villages, particularly along the Tel-Aviv-Jerusalem roadBenny Morris (2003), pp.233-240. and in Eastern Galilee.Benny Morris (2003), pp.248-252.  About 50,000-70,000 inhabitants of Lydda and Ramle were expelled towards Ramallah by the Israel Defense Forces during Operation Danny,Benny Morris (2003), pp.423-436. and most others during operations of the IDF in its rear areas.Benny Morris (2003), p.438. During Operation Dekel, the Arabs of Nazareth and South Galilee were allowed to remain in their homes.Benny Morris (2003), pp.415-423. Today they form the core of the Arab Israeli population. From October to November 1948, the IDF launched Operation Yoav to remove Egyptian forces from the Negev and Operation Hiram to remove the Arab Liberation Army from North Galilee during which at least nine events named massacres of Arabs were carried out by IDF soldiers.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p245. These events generated an exodus of 200,000 to 220,000 Palestinian Arabs. Here, Arabs fled fearing atrocities or were expelled if they had not fled.Benny Morris (2003), p.492.  After the war, from 1948 to 1950, the IDF resettled around 30,000 to 40,000 Arabs from the borderlands of the new Israeli state.Benny Morris (2003), p.538

===Palestinian refugees from Six-Day War===

As a result of the Naksa, around 280,000 to 325,000 Palestinians fledBowker, 2003, p. 81. the territories won in the Six-Day War by Israel, including the demolished Palestinian villages of Imwas, Yalo, Bayt Nuba, Surit, Beit Awwa, Beit Mirsem, Shuyukh, Jiftlik, Agarith and Huseirat, and the "emptying" of the refugee camps of ʿAqabat Jabr and ʿEin Sulṭān.Gerson, 1978, p. 162.UN Doc A/8389 of 5 October 1971.

The Special Committee has ascertained that all these villages have been completely destroyed Para 58. the village of Nebi Samwil was in fact destroyed by Israeli armed forces on March 22, 1971.

===Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)===

The Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait.[tpl]cite web|author=Shafeeq Ghabra|title=The PLO in Kuwait|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/1457|date=May 8, 1991[/tpl] After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991. Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with the dictator Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait.
Prior to the Gulf War, Palestinians numbered 400,0000 (30%) of Kuwait's population of 2.2 million. The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens.[tpl]cite web|author=Yann Le Troquer and Rozenn Hommery al-Oudat|title=From Kuwait to Jordan: The Palestinians' Third Exodus|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2538306?uid=3738400&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102826710897|work=Journal of Palestine Studies|date=Spring 1999|pages=37–51[/tpl] In 2013, there were 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin in Kuwait.[tpl]cite web|title=Jordanians of Kuwait|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=KU|work=Joshua Project|year=2013[/tpl] In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians (without Jordanian citizenship) lived in Kuwait.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/palestinians-open-kuwait-embassy.html|work=Al Monitor|title=Palestinians Open Kuwaiti Embassy|date=23 May 2013[/tpl] In total, there are 360,000 Palestinians in Kuwait as of 2012-2013.

===Palestinian refugees as part of the Syrian refugee crisis===

As a result of the Syrian civil war, 235,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Syria itself and 60,000, alongside 2.2 million Syrians, have fled the country as of October 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unrwa.org/activity/rss-syria |title=RSS in Syria |publisher=UNRWA |year=2013 |accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl]
There were reports that Jordan and Lebanon have turned away Palestinian refugees attempting to flee the humanitarian crises in Syria.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Jordan has absorbed 126,000 Syrian refugees, but Palestinians fleeing Syria are placed in a separate refugee camp, under stricter conditions and are banned from entering Jordanian cities.Times of Israel. Jordan Turns away Palestinian Refugees
Palestinian refugees from Syria are also immigrating to Europe seeking asylum, especially to Sweden, which has offered asylum to any Syrian refugees that manage to reach its territory, albeit with some conditions. Many do so by finding their way to Egypt and making the journey by sea. In October 2013, the PFLP-GC claimed that some 23,000 Palestinian refugees from the Yarmouk Camp had immigrated to Sweden alone.PFLP-GC: Thousands from Yarmouk camp have fled to Sweden - Maan News Agency

==Refugee statistics==

The number of Palestine refugees varies depending on the source. For 1948-49 refugees, for example, the Israeli government suggests a number as low as 520,000 as opposed to 850,000 by their Palestinian counterparts.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] As of January 2010, UNRWA cites 1,396,368 registered refugees in camps and 3,370,302 registered refugees not in camps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://prrn.mcgill.ca/background/index.htm|title=Palestinian Refugees: An Overview|publisher=Palestinian Refugee ResearchNet|accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl]
The number of UNRWA registered Palestine refugees by country or territory in January 2010 were as follows:

===Jordan===

1,951,603 Palestine refugees are located in Jordan, of whom 338,000 are still living in refugee camps.http://www.un.org/unrwa/publications/index.html Following Jordan's annexation and occupation of the West Bank, most Palestine refugees were granted Jordanian citizenship. The percentage of Palestinian refugees living in refugee camps to those who settled outside the camps is the lowest of all UNRWA fields of operations. Palestine refugees are allowed access to public services and healthcare, as a result, refugee camps are becoming more of poor city suburbs than refugee camps. Most Palestine refugees moved out of the camps to other parts of the country reducing the number of refugees in need of UNRWA services to only 338,000. This caused UNRWA to reduce the budget allocated to Palestine refugee camps in Jordan. Former UNRWA chief-attorney James G. Lindsay says: "In Jordan, where 2 million Palestinian refugees live, all but 167,000 have citizenship, and are fully eligible for government services including education and health care." Lindsay suggests that eliminating services to refugees whose needs are subsidized by Jordan "would reduce the refugee list by 40%", leaving 3,000,000 UNRWA Palestine refugees.http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304645372&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter 'UNRWA staff not tested for terror ties' Jposthttp://www.mepeace.org/forum/topics/fixing-unrwa-by-james-g Repairing the UN’s Troubled System of Aid to Palestinian Refugees
Palestinians who moved from the West Bank (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the "official 10 refugee camps" in Jordan. Since 1988, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Jordan's Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi said:  "Our goal is to prevent Israel from emptying the Palestinian territories of their original inhabitants," the minister explained, confirming that the kingdom had begun revoking the citizenship of Palestinians.
 "We should be thanked for taking this measure," he said. "We are fulfilling our national duty because Israel wants to expel the Palestinians from their homeland."[tpl]cite news |first=KHALED |last= ABU TOAMEH |title=Amman revoking Palestinians' citizenship |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443863400&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=20 July 2009 | accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl]Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians, by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post

100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and was not allowed to return.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE18/010/2007|title=Lebanon Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon|year=2007|work=Amnesty International|publisher=Amnesty International|language=amn|accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl] As of 2013, there are 441,543 registered refugees in Lebanon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work |title=Where We Work |publisher=UNRWA |year=2013 |accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl]
In a 2007 study, Amnesty International denounced the "appalling social and economic condition" of Palestinians in Lebanon. Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they do not have Lebanese citizenship, but this was later reduced to around 20 as of 2007 after liberalization laws. In 2010, Palestinians was granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/world/middleeast/18lebanon.html
Lebanon gave citizenship to about 50,000 Christian Palestinian refugees during the 1950s and 1960s. In the mid-1990s, about 60,000 Shiite Muslim refugees were granted citizenship. This caused a protest from Maronite authorities, leading to citizenship being given to all Christian refugees who were not already citizens.Simon Haddad, The Origins of Popular Opposition to Palestinian Resettlement in Lebanon, International Migration Review, Volume 38 Number 2 (Summer 2004):470-492. Also Peteet http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/MEPP/PRRN/papers/peteet.html.
According to writer and researcher Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, the media chose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in Lebanese refugee camps, and that the "tendency to blame Israel for everything" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries.

===India===

The first group of Palestine refugees from Iraq arrived in India in March 2006. Generally, they were unable to find work in India as they spoke only Arabic though some found employment with UNHCR's non-governmental partners. All of them were provided with free access to public hospitals. Of the 165 Palestinian refugees from Iraq in India, 137 of them found clearance for resettlement in Sweden.http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/4919b20b4.html

==Positions on the Right of Return==

On 11 December 1948 the General Assembly discussed Bernadotte's report and placed a non-binding resolve: "that refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbour should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement" This non-binding United Nations General Assembly article 11 of Resolution 194 has been annually re-affirmed but Israel refused the application of that resolution.

===Israeli views===

The Jewish Agency promised to the UN before 1948 that Palestinian Arabs would become full citizens of the State of Israel,Ilan Pappe, "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine", page 110 and the Israeli declaration of independence invited the Arab inhabitants of Israel to "full and equal citizenship".http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel In practice, Israel does not grant citizenship to the refugees, as it does to those Arabs who continue to reside in its borders. The 1947 Partition Plan determined citizenship based on residency, such that Arabs and Jews residing in Palestine but not in Jerusalem would obtain citizenship in the state in which they are resident. Professor of Law at Boston University Susan Akram, Omar Barghouti and Ilan Pappé have argued that Palestinian refugees from the envisioned Jewish State were entitled to normal Israeli citizenship based on laws of state succession.http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/2591 "Under the laws of nationality and state succession, newly-created states are obligated to grant all persons found within the territory the nationality of the new state" http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=14921 "Palestinian refugees were excluded from entitlement to citizenship in the State of Israel under the 1952 Citizenship Law. They were “denationalized” and turned into stateless refugees in violation of the law of state succession.". "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine", Ilan Pappé, page 131

===Arab states===

The Arab League has instructed its members to deny citizenship to original Palestine Arab refugees (or their descendants) "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland".[tpl]Wayback |date=20070404085820 |url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=53213&d=21&m=10&y=2004 [/tpl]
Tashbih Sayyed, a fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, criticized Arab nations of violating human rights and making the children and grandchildren of Palestinian refugees second class citizens in Lebanon, Syria, or the Gulf States, and said that the UNRWA Palestine refugees "cling to the illusion that defeating the Jews will restore their dignity".[tpl]cite news|last=SAYYED |first=TASHBIH|title=Defeat Terrorism First|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269137/defeat-terrorism-first/tashbih-sayyed|accessdate=17 June 2010|newspaper=National Review|date=June 18, 2003[/tpl]

===Palestinian views===

Palestine refugees claim a Palestinian right of return. In lack of an own country, their claim is based on Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which declares that "Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country", although it has been argued that the term only applies to citizens or nationals of that country. Although all Arab League members at the time- Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen- voted against the resolution,[tpl]cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/2dac0ed54bcd6af68525629f00718b98?OpenDocument |title=Yearbook of the United Nations 1948-49 (excerpts)| date = 31 December 1949 |format= |work=UNISPAL |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl] they also cite the non-binding article 11 of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which "Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return ...."[tpl]cite news|author=|year=1948|url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement|title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|format=PDF|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2007-11-20[/tpl]  However Resolution 194 is a nonbinding assembly resolution, and it is currently a matter of dispute whether the resolution referred only to the estimated 50,000 remaining Palestine refugees from the 1948 Palestine War, or additionally to their UNRWA registered 4,950,000 descendants.
The Palestinian National Authority supports this claim, and has been prepared to negotiate its implementation at the various peace talks. Both Fatah and Hamas hold a strong position for a claimed right of return, with Fatah being prepared to give ground on the issue while Hamas is not.R.

==The Oslo Accords==

Upon signing the Oslo Accords in 1993, Israel, the EU and the US recognized Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.  In return, Yasser Arafat recognized the State of Israel and renounced terrorism.  At the time, the accords were celebrated as a historic breakthrough.  In accordance with these agreements, the Palestinian Arab refugees began to be governed by an autonomous Palestinian Authority, and the parties agreed to negotiate the permanent status of the refugees, as early as 1996. However, events have halted the phasing process and made the likelihood of a future sovereign Palestinian state uncertain.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/key_documents/1682727.stm Oslo Accords Declaration of Principals  In another development, a rift developed between Fatah in the West-Bank and Hamas in Gaza after Hamas won the 2006 elections.  Among other differences, Fatah officially recognizes the Oslo Accords with Israel, whereas Hamas does not.

===United States===

The United States considers the original refugees and their descendants to be refugees.
In May 2012, the United States Senate Appropriations Committee approved a definition of a Palestine refugee to include only those original Palestine refugees who were actually displaced between June 1946 and May 1948, resulting in an estimated number of 30,000."According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency – the main body tasked with providing assistance to Palestinian refugees – there are more than 5 million refugees at present. However, the number of Palestinians alive who were personally displaced during Israel’s War of Independence is estimated to be around 30,000."US Senate dramatically scales down definition of Palestinian ‘refugees’
