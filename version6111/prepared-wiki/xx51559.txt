Austrobaileyales is the an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1437 | title = The plant tree of life: an overview and some points of view | author = Jeffrey D.

Perhaps the most familiar species is Illicium verum from which comes the spice star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade, which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants, and, as such, it is the extant group after the Amborellales and Nymphaeales, that is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside of the ANA grade.Angiosperm Phylogeny: A Framework for Studies of Genome Evolution, Plant Genome Diversity Volume 2, pp. 1-11, 2013, Springer, Pamela S.

==In different classifications==

Until the early 21st century, the order was only rarely recognised by systems of classification (an exception is the Reveal system).
The APG system, of 1998, did not recognize such an order. The APG II system, of 2003, does accept this order and places it among the basal angiosperms, that is: it does not belong to any further clade. APG II uses this circumscription:
Note: "+ ..." = optional seggregrate family, that may be split off from the preceding family. The Cronquist system, of 1981, also placed the  plants in families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae together, but as separate families, united at the rank of order, in the order Illiciales.
