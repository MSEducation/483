The fifth HMS ''Dreadnought'' of the Royal Navy was a turret ironclad battleship built at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales.

==Construction==

Begun as Fury in 1870, the original design was recast for heavier armour and higher speed.  The renamed ship was laid down in 1872 at Pembroke Dockyard and was subsequently launched in March 1875, with final completion at Portsmouth in 1879. She carried her four muzzle-loading guns in two twin turrets, and had a very heavily armored hull, low freeboard, and no sailing rig. Her secondary armament was very light, though it varied in detail throughout her career. Despite their obsolescence,[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] she retained her muzzle-loading big guns to the end of her days.

==Service history==

300px|left|thumbAfter completion, Dreadnought remained in reserve until 1884, when she was commissioned for service in the Mediterranean Sea. The battleship returned to British waters in 1894 and, after refit, served in 1895-1897 as a coast guard ship at Bantry Bay, Ireland.
Dreadnought was partially modernized in 1897-1899 and took part in British fleet manoeuvres in 1900 and 1901 as a second-class battleship. From 1902, she served as a tender and depot ship. She was placed out of service in 1905, and sold for scrapping in July 1908.
