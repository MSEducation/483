==History==

The Frankfurt School of Finance & Management was founded 1957 as [tpl]lang|de|Bankakademie[/tpl] (Bank Academy), initially as a training institute for the employees of German banks. These continuing education programs remained the main focus for the first three decades. In the 1990s the pace of development accelerated. In 1989 the [tpl]lang|de|Bankakademie[/tpl] created its own publishing house, followed one year later by the foundation of the [tpl]lang|de|Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft[/tpl] (HfB), an academic institution offering degree programs. A consulting arm, International Advisory Services, was added in the 1990s as well, as was a separate department for Executive Education and tailor-made training programs for companies. Efiport, a subsidiary for e-learning and IT solutions for higher education, was created in 2001.
In 2004 HfB officially became a research institution with the rank of a university and was granted the right to award doctoral degrees. In 2007 HfB and[tpl]lang|de|Bankakademie[/tpl] were merged under the new name Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.
