Fonda plays Ulee (short for Ulysses) Jackson, a Vietnam veteran, widower and grandfather.

The son implores him to look for his wife and bring her home.  Upon returning home with Helen, Ulee's granddaughters see their mother going through withdrawal, and the youngest pleads with their neighbor Connie (Richardson) to help her.
