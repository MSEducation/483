Sunrise/Back to the Future were one of the most widely publicised Acid House promoters in the UK. One commentator states "Over the course of 1989, promoters such as World Dance, Genesis, Helter Skelter and Energy succeeded in setting acid house nights free of the urban core's constructions, staging ever more elaborate Orbital parties in borrowed and rented fields, the odd warehouse, or some other similarly vacant structure".Clover, J. 1989: Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about. p. 64 
Run by Tony Colston-Hayter and Paul Staines, the organisation was occasionally front-page news. In 1989, Colston-Hayter evaded imprisonment for organising an unlicensed party (Sunrise Midsummer Party at White Waltham Airfield aka "Ecstasy Airport" ) by claiming that he issued membership cards for Sunrise and it was a private party.Collin, M. ' Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House. p.108. 
Sunrise were instrumental in organising the Freedom to Party demonstrations and the free parties that followed alongside Genesis '88, Biology and Weekend World.
On 21 September 2013, BBC News reported that Colston-Hayter had been charged with conspiracy to steal £1.3m from Barclays Bank in London.
