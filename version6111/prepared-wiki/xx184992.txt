==Football career==

In January 2008, 20-year-old Grassi arrived in Portugal and signed with C.S. Marítimo from Sport Club Internacional, along with team-mate João Guilherme. He acted as third-choice during his early years, also playing with the B-team in the third division. On 7 December 2008 he made his main squad – and top flight – debut, conceding all six goals in a 0–6 home loss against S.L. Benfica after starter Marcos (his compatriot) was sent off in the 18th minute.
For the 2009–10 campaign Grassi was loaned to G.D. Tourizense, also in the third level, being released by the Madeira side at the season's end and resuming his career in his country's lower leagues.
