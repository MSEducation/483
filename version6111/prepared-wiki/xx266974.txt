The city of Mobile held out another eight months, with the upper portion of Mobile Bay remaining in Confederate hands.  She, along with the CSS Huntsville, was scuttled in the Spanish River below where it splits off from the Mobile River on the north side of Blakeley Island, just north of Mobile, on April 12, 1865 to prevent her capture following the surrender of the city.  Her crew and material were put aboard CCS Nashville.  The wreck was located in the river in 1985.
