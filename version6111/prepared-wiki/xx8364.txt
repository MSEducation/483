The Northwest Territories (NWT; French: les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, TNO) is a territory of Canada. With a population of 41,462 in 2011 and an estimated population of 43,537 in 2013, the Northwest Territories is the most populous territory in Northern Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&T=101&S=50&O=A|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2011 and 2006 censuses |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-02-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130926/dq130926a-eng.pdf|title=Canada's total population estimates, 2013|publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2014[/tpl] Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission.
The Northwest Territories entered the Canadian Confederation July 15, 1870, but the current borders were formed April 1, 1999, when the territory was subdivided to create Nunavut via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act.[tpl]cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.6/index.html |title=Nunavut Act |author=Justice Canada |authorlink =Department of Justice (Canada) |year=1993 |accessdate=April 26, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/N-28.7//20070517/en?command=searchadvanced&caller=AD&search_type=bool&shorttitle=%20Nunavut%20Land%20Claims%20Agreement%20Act&day=17&month=5&year=2007&search_domain=cs&showall=L&statuteyear=all&lengthannual=50&length=50 |title=Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act |author=Justice Canada |year=1993 |accessdate=April 26, 2007[/tpl] While neighbouring Nunavut is mostly Arctic tundra, the Northwest Territories has a slightly warmer climate and is mostly boreal forest (taiga), although portions of the territory lie north of the tree line, and its most northern regions form part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

==Etymology==

The name is descriptive, adopted by the British government during the colonial era to indicate where it lay in relation to Rupert's Land. It is shortened from North-Western Territory (see History). In Inuktitut, the Northwest Territories are referred to as ᓄᓇᑦᓯᐊᖅ (Nunatsiaq), "beautiful land."[ref]

There was some discussion of changing the name of the Northwest Territories after the splitting off of Nunavut, possibly to a term from an Aboriginal language. One proposal was "Denendeh" (an Athabaskan language word meaning "our land"), as advocated by the former premier Stephen Kakfwi, among others. One of the most popular proposals for a new name – one to name the territory "Bob" – began as a prank, but for a while it was at or near the top in the public-opinion polls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/01/11/nwt020111.html |title=Northwest Territories looking for new name – "Bob" need not apply |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=January 11, 2002 |accessdate=February 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2008/06/25/nwt-change.html |title=Western Arctic to Northwest Territories: MP calls for riding name change |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2011[/tpl]
In the end a poll conducted prior to division showed that strong support remained to keep the name "Northwest Territories". This name arguably became more appropriate following division than it had been when the territories actually extended far into Canada's north-central and northeastern areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://caldercup.com/CNEWSNunavut/feature11.html |title=Tundra for two: dividing Canada's far-north is no small task |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050405201955/http://caldercup.com/CNEWSNunavut/feature11.html |archivedate=April 5, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Jon Willing |url=http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/112699/4Features/Features2.shtml |title=What about Bob, Water-Lou? |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030118152558/http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/112699/4Features/Features2.shtml |archivedate=January 18, 2003[/tpl]

===Climate===

The Northwest Territories reaches for over [tpl]convert|1300000|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] so there is a large climate variant from south to north. The southern part of the territory (most of the mainland portion) has a subarctic climate while the islands and northern coast have a polar climate.
Summers in the north are short and cool, with daytime highs in the mid teens, and lows in the single degrees. Winters are long and harsh, daytime highs in the mid [tpl]convert|-20|C[/tpl] and lows around [tpl]convert|-40|C[/tpl]. Extremes are common with summer highs in the south reaching [tpl]convert|36|C[/tpl] and lows reaching into the negatives. In winter in the south it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach [tpl]convert|-40|C[/tpl], but can also reach the low teens during the day. In the north, temperatures can reach highs of [tpl]convert|30|C[/tpl], and lows can reach into the low negatives.
In winter in the north it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach [tpl]convert|-50|C[/tpl] but can also reach the single digits during the day. Thunderstorms are not rare in the south. In the north they are very rare, but do occur.[ref]
