After several short spells with General Díaz, and Brazilian clubs Gaúcho and Passo Fundo, Cohene moved to Europe to play in Portugal for second division side S.C. Olhanense, where he would remain for two seasons before moving back to South America to play for River Plate and Sportivo Luqueño.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=311375|title=Javier Cohene presta provas|trans_title=Javier Cohene presta provas|work=Record|language=Portuguese|date=11 July 2007|accessdate=21 December 2013[/tpl]

The arrival of Paulo Fonseca at the Mata Real for the 2012–13 season saw Cohene feature less than previous seasons. He was primarily used as a back up to Ricardo and Tiago Valente, and would only feature regularly in domestic cup competitions. Despite Paços de Ferreira's historic third place league finish which granted qualification to the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League play-off round, Cohene left Paços in the summer of 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/pacos_ferreira//interior.aspx?content_id=830705|title=Regresso ao trabalho com várias ausências|trans_title=Return to work with various absentees|work=Record|language=Portuguese|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=21 December 2013[/tpl]
