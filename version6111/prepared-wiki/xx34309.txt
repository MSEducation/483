==Disc jockey career==

During his career Westwood has DJed for many radio stations, including the newly formed radio stations Kiss FM (which he co-owned) and LWR in the 1980s, followed by mainstream station Capital FM (from 1987). In December 1994, following a shake up of Radio 1 by the then chief executive Matthew Bannister, he was given the new and somewhat innovative national Radio 1 Rap Show. He was the Radio 1 Rap Show's first presenter and has been its only permanent presenter; he is now one of Radio 1's longest-serving broadcasters.
His first broadcast on a legal station appears to have been on 23 March 1985, when he was already working as a pirate DJ.[tpl]OR|date=April 2009[/tpl] He was a guest on a BBC World Service programme called Meridian where he discussed early hip-hop culture in London. After appearing in the 1987 BBC Open Space documentary Bad Meaning Good, which was an early work of his own company Justice Entertainment, he achieved TV exposure in the late 1980s on the ITV programme Night Network, produced by London Weekend Television.
More recently, he presented a series of his own television programme on UKTV channel UK Play, which has since ceased broadcasting. His Radio 1 show is produced by his independent company Justice Entertainment, which also produces Chris Goldfinger's dancehall show for Radio 1.
In the late 1980s, his name was often mentioned in British rap records, as he was the only well-known DJ playing hip hop on legal radio in Britain. He was named Best UK Radio DJ in the MOBO (Music of Black Origin) Awards in 2000, 2003 and 2005. He is a patron of the internal radio station at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution in west London.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/prisons/story/0,7369,1358172,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Live from Feltham | first=Erwin | last=James | date=24 November 2004 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]
Westwood was injured in a drive-by shooting in Kennington, South London, on 18 July 1999, after he had been playing at the Lambeth Country Show in Brockwell Park. According to police reports, gunmen on a motorbike pulled up alongside his Range Rover and shot him and his assistant.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/398989.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gangster probe after DJ shooting | date=20 July 1999 | accessdate=9 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/398123.stm |title=Thank God I'm alive - shot DJ |publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 1999 |accessdate=13 December 2010[/tpl]

==Criticisms==

===Criticism by David Cameron===

On 6 June 2006, BBC Radio 1 and Westwood's show in particular was accused of encouraging knife and gun crime by the Leader of the Conservative Party and then Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5055724.stm |title=Cameron attacks Radio 1's hip-hop |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2010[/tpl] who was speaking at a British Society of Magazine Editors event. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/radio1/andyparfitt.shtml |title= BBC - Press Office - Andy Parfitt biography |author= |date = January 2010|work= BBC.co.uk|publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl] responded in a Press Association news agency article: "There's been a debate about this particular genre of music for many years. Hip-hop is of great interest to many people in our audience. I strongly refute that any of our programmes condone violence, gun crime or knife crime."

===Vocal style and upbringing===

Critics have also derided Westwood's apparent emulation of Black British pronunciation and dialect, which is claimed to be at odds with his middle class British origins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nosacredcows.co.uk/mail_on_sunday_column/427/the_word_on_the_street_is_people_prefer_posh.html |title= The word on the street is people prefer posh |work= Mail on Sunday |last= Young |first= Toby |authorlink= Toby Young |date= 23 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl] In response to this Westwood stated "Honestly, baby, I get love out there, pure and simple".[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/09/urban.radio | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Tim Westwood | first=Hannah | last=Pool | date=9 October 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl] His father, Bill Westwood, was the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough until 1996, and a regular contributor to BBC Radio, particularly Thought for the Day on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
In interviews, Sacha Baron Cohen has stated that Westwood, including his supposed fake Caribbean accent, was an inspiration for his fictional Ali G character.[tpl]cite web|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20061227193251/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks/page/5|title= Sacha Baron Cohen -- the Real Borat -- Finally Speaks : Rolling Stone |last= Strauss|first= Neil|authorlink= Neil Strauss|date= 14 November 2006|work= Rolling Stone|publisher= RealNetworks, Inc.|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]
