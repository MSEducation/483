The hjärta & smärta EP is an EP made by Swedish rock band Kent, released in 2005. The production of the EP was kept secret and it was announced just one month before its release.  The CD and cover slip, in contrast to Kent's previous release Du & jag döden, are both almost completely white.
The title The hjärta & smärta EP, meaning The Heart and Pain EP, refers to stereotyped rhymes in dansband lyrics.
