[[Flaser bed]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary structures

Flaser beds are a sedimentary bedding pattern created when a sediment is exposed to intermittent flows, leading to alternating sand and mud layers.  While flaser beds typically form in tidal environments, they can (rarely) form in fluvial conditions - on point bars or in ephemeral streams. Individual sand ripples are created, which are later infilled by mud during quieter flow periods. These mud drapes are typically a minor constituent of the deposit; they can consolidate within three hours, protecting the underlying layer from erosion. Flaser bedding typically forms in high-energy environments.[tpl]cite web|title=Tidal deposits|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Course/geosci697/tidal/tidal-deposits.html|author=Tom Bellile |date=2003-10-23[/tpl] (with photograph)
