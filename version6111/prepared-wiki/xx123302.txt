[tpl]nihongo|Mount Haguro|羽黒山|Haguro-san[/tpl] is one of the  Three Mountains of Dewa in the ancient province of Dewa (modern-day Yamagata Prefecture), Japan. As the lowest of the three mountains, standing at [tpl]Convert|414|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it is the only one that is accessible throughout the year.
A path of 2,466 stone steps leads to its summit amidst 600-year-old sugi trees, past the famous Gojū-tō (五重塔) five story pagoda and numerous shrines. The steps and the pagoda are listed as National Treasures. The Sanzan-Gosai-den temple (三山合祭殿) at the summit venerates the spirits of all three mountains.
The summit can also be reached by a limited bus service.  In addition to religious pilgrims, travellers often stay at the Saikan temple lodgings.
