Donkervoort Automobielen BV is a  manufacturer of authentic hand-built and ultra light weight sports cars based in Lelystad in The Netherlands. This car brand was founded in 1978 by Joop Donkervoort.
In 1996, Donkervoort's Ford engines were replaced by Audi engines. Donkervoorts motto - "No Compromise" - means driving without any electronic aids such as ABS (Anti-lock braking system), Electronic stability program (ESP) or power steering.

The first Donkervoort - the S7 - was introduced in 1978. These cars have a Ford Crossflow 1.6 liter OHV engine with [tpl]convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a four-speed manual transmission. Top speed was [tpl]convert|170|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | ref = TAM85 | year = 1985 | page = 261 | language = Italian | location = Milano | isbn = 88-7212-012-8 [/tpl]
Introduced in late 1983, the S8 and later S8A were the first Donkervoorts of notice, with the "Eight" implying an improvement over the Lotus Seven. Of exactly the same dimensions as the Donkervoort Super Seven, these cars originally used a two-liter inline-four engine from Ford of Europe.
Responding to the need for more power, a turbocharged version of the S8 soon appeared; this car is identifiable by a profusion of various vents and openings to cool the engine.
This sleek, minimalist version was built in a very limited series of ten to celebrate Donkervoort's tenth anniversary in 1988. The cars lacked a spare wheel as well as a windshield, but benefitted from an enlarged (2,160 cc) version of the Ford engine with a bigger Garrett T3 turbocharger, producing [tpl]convert|190|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The last car was only built in 1994, with some of the later examples receiving Cosworth engines with up to [tpl]convert|300|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url = http://members.home.nl/wfvogd/Donkervoort/frames/D10.htm | title = D10-page | publisher = Donkervoort Automobilia | accessdate = 2011-11-11 [/tpl]
Since 2003, the Donkervoort is equipped with the Audi 1.8T 20V E-gas turbocharged engine. In the D8, the engine is available with 150 bhp, 180 bhp, 210 bhp and 270 bhp. Thanks to its total weight of 630 kilograms, this results in an acceleration time from 0 to 100 km/h  between 3,8 and 5,2 seconds depending on the type.
The Donkervoort D8 270 is available since the summer of 2008. This version of the D8 series became the successor of the D8 270 RS, the limited edition that was introduced in 2005. The D8 270 has a restyled nose and grill that refer directly to the D8 GT and accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 3,6 seconds.
This car was as of 2011 one of the ten fastest production cars on the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife at 7m14.9s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bridgetogantry.com/2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=178&Itemid=300060|title=Fastest Production Car Lap of the Nurburgring| date=2011-03-18|publisher=Bridgetogantry.com[/tpl]
The Donkervoort D8 GT - introduced in 2007 - is the first closed Donkervoort. Compared to the open version of the D8, the D8 GT has entirely new front and rear wheel suspension, increased in track width by 8 centimer, larger brakes are applied for maximum delay and 17-inch aluminum wheels are fitted. With a total weight of 650 kg, the D8GT is the lightest GT in the world. This is mainly thanks to the use of carbon fiber: the entire roof, the entire rear and the doors and fenders of the car are made of this material.

==Current models==

The Donkervoort D8 GTO is a complete new creation. The engine, from now on a 2,5l TFSI 5-cylinder turbocharged Audi engine, has a power output of 250-280 kW (340-380PS) and 450Nm of torque at 1600rpm with a car weight of only
