This station has two high-level side platforms, each the length of 12 cars. The Main Line has two tracks here. The north platform, next to Track 1, is generally used by westbound or New York City-bound trains. The south platform, next to Track 2, is generally used by eastbound trains.  About a mile east of the station the mainline merges into one track at FARM interlocking. The Mainline is single-tracked east of this point, with the exception of a few passing sidings.  To add capacity along the branch, some trains terminate or originate at Farmingdale, since it is the last station in double-tracked territory.
