Natasha Jessica Stott Despoja AM (born 9 September 1969) is an Australian former politician and former leader of the Australian Democrats. She was a Democrats senator for South Australia from 1995 to 2008. She was appointed to the Senate at the age of 26, and until Sarah Hanson-Young was elected in 2007, was the youngest woman ever to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.Rob Lundie & Martin Lumb "Research Note 13 1998-99 Update on Selected Australian Political Records" (Parliament of Australia). Access date: 20 August 2013. She was also the first leader of a political party to visit an immigration detention centre.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Early life==

Stott Despoja was born in Adelaide, the daughter of Shirley Stott Despoja, an Australian-born journalist with English heritage, and Mario Despoja, an immigrant from Croatia (then Yugoslavia). She was educated at Stradbroke Primary and Pembroke School and, later, the University of Adelaide where she graduated B.A.. She was active in student politics, becoming president of the Students' Association of the University of Adelaide (SAUA) and serving as state women's officer for the National Union of Students in South Australia. She then worked as a political advisor to Democrat senators John Coulter (SA) and Cheryl Kernot (Qld).

==Career==

On 29 November 1995, Stott Despoja was appointed to the casual vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Coulter due to ill-health. She completed the remainder of Coulter's term, was returned at the 1996 election and re-elected in 2001.
Stott Despoja was elected to the party's deputy leadership in 1997, under Meg Lees. At the time, she was party spokesperson for parliamentary portfolios including Science and Technology, Attorney General, Higher Education, IT, Employment and Youth Affairs.
During the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) legislation in 1999, Stott Despoja, along with Andrew Bartlett, split from the party's other senators by opposing the package, which had been negotiated by Lees and prime minister John Howard. She said that she refused to break promises made by the party during the election. The party had gone to the election stating that they would work with whichever party formed government to improve their tax package. The Australian Democrats traditionally permitted parliamentary representatives to cast a conscience vote on any issue but, on this occasion, close numbers in the Senate placed greater pressure than usual on the dissenters.
In 1999, she was appointed a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum (WEF).[tpl]cite web|title=Natasha Stott Despoja|url=http://www.leadershipforwomen.com.au/empowerment/glass-ceiling-research/glass-ceiling-interviews/item/natasha-stott-despoja|publisher=Australian Centre for Leadership for Women|accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]

===Parliamentary leadership and deposition===

Stott Despoja was elected leader on 6 April 2001, replacing Meg Lees, who resigned from the party in July 2002. Further public criticism and disputes between Democrat senators resulted in Stott Despoja's resignation as leader on 21 August 2002, following presentation by four of her six colleagues (those who had earlier enabled the passage of the GST) with a ten-point 'reform' agenda proposed by John Cherry.[tpl]Cite news| title=Senator Cherry speaks about Natasha Stott Despoja | date=21 August 2002 | accessdate=2006-12-08 | publisher=ABC News Online | url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s655263.htm[/tpl][tpl]quote|After 16 months in the job, Senator Stott Despoja finally decided she couldn't heal the rifts which had divided her seven-member party room. Her colleagues were apparently stunned by the resignation, but shouldn't have been.

===Retirement from Parliament===

She was the Australian Democrats' longest-serving senator.
