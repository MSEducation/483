The Yuelu Academy (also as known as the Yuelu Academy of Classical Learning, [tpl]zh|t=嶽麓書院|s=岳麓书院|p=Yuèlǔ Shūyuàn[/tpl]) is on the east side of Yuelu Mountain in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, China, on the west bank of the Xiang River. As one of the four most prestigious academies over the last 1000 years in China, Yuelu Academy has been a famous institution of higher learning as well as a centre of academic activities and cultures since it was formally set up during the Northern Song Dynasty. The academy was converted into Hunan Institute of Higher Learning in 1903. It was later renamed Hunan Normal College, Hunan Public Polytechnic School, and finally Hunan University in 1926. 

==History==

The Academy was founded in 976, the 9th year of the Song Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Kaibao, and was one of four most renowned shuyuan (academies of higher learning). 
The renowned Confucian scholars Zhu Xi and Zhang Shi lectured at the academy.
During the Qing dynasty, the Academy inculcated an ascetic philosophy of self-examination and dedication to rescuing the world from the decadence of recent times. The Academy remained loyal to the Neo-Confucian school of the Song dynasty which emphasized moral self-cultivation, community solidarity, and social hierarchy. Among the prominent alumni were the early Qing scholar, Wang Fuzhi. But by the early 19th century, Academy scholars saw no contradiction in devoting serious study also to practical subjects such as martial engineering, political economy, waterworks, and management of bureaucracy. They called these studies jingshi (statecraft), made up of the character jing (manage) and shi (things, or "the world"). Early 19th century graduates formed what one historian called a "network of messianic alumni."  These included Tao Zhu, who reformed the grain transportation system and salt monopoly; Wei Yuan, compiler of works on western geography, the exploits of the Qing expansionist campaigns, and the basic collection of statecraft essays; Bao Shichen; and most prominent, Zeng Guofan, architect of the Tongzhi Restoration.

In 1903 the academy became a university, and in 1926 it was officially named Hunan University.
The academy is the only one of the ancient Chinese academies of classical learning to have evolved into a modern institution of higher learning.

As a part of Hunan University, today the academy is a center of publication and research.
