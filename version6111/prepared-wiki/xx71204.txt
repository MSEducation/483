Jiří Menzel ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈjɪr̝iː ˈmɛntsl̩|lang|Cs-jiri menzel.ogg[/tpl]) (born February 23, 1938, Prague) is a Czech film director, theatre director, actor, and screenwriter. His films often combine a humanistic view of the world with sarcasm and provocative cinematography. Some of these films are adapted from works by Czech writers such as Bohumil Hrabal and Vladislav Vančura.
Menzel, a member of the Czech New Wave, became internationally famous in 1967, when his first feature film, Closely Watched Trains, won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/40th-winners.html |title=The 40th Academy Awards (1968) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-12|work=oscars.org[/tpl] His controversial film Larks on a String was filmed in 1969, but was initially banned by the Czechoslovakia government. It was finally released in 1990 after the fall of the Communist regime. The film won the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/03_preistr_ger_1990/03_Preistraeger_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-03-20 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl]
