Langley Park School for Girls (also known as Langley Park Girls' School, or just Langley Girls) is a girls' secondary academy school in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley, England, with a mixed-sex sixth form.
The school motto is "Ad Rem Mox Nox", which roughly translates as "Time is short, get to work" or more specifically "Get it done before nightfall". In the 1960s, the official translation of the motto was "Work, for the night cometh".

==Houses==

The school is split into four houses in which each girl will be assigned before they officially join.  The houses are: Gamma, Sigma, Lambda and Kappa. The houses compete in a variety of event such as the inter-form Hockey/Dance/Netball/Badminton tournaments throughout the year. The houses also go against each other on sports day, which is held annually at Norman Park, although a larger emphasis is on the eight forms per year, and years themselves.

==History==

The building at the school's first location (on Lennard Road, Beckenham) was completed in 1914. It was however used as a military hospital during World War I. 
The school itself opened on September 28, 1919, as Beckenham County School for Girls, with 153 pupils aged from 8 years, and 10 teachers. The first headmistress was Miss E.M. Fox. A few years later, an association for ex-pupils was formed, called the Adremian Association. 
In 1945, the name of the school was changed to The County Grammar School for Girls, and in 1955 to Beckenham Grammar School for Girls.  In 1959, the school moved to new buildings in a parkland setting, in Langley Park. The current name "Langley Park School for Girls" was adopted in 1968.
In 1976 the school went comprehensive. In 1996 it became a technology college, and in 2000 it became part of the South East England Virtual Education Action Zone.
In July 2009, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary during the last week of school in the summer. This included music, dancing and a commemorative event - bringing the Olympic torch into the school.
On 1 August 2011, the school officially gained academy status.
