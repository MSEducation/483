In April 1780 Mason claimed [tpl]convert|18700|acre|km2[/tpl] in two plats along a tributary of the Green River.  In October of the same year he restated and clarified his claim with the surveyor.  In April 1783 Wilson entered a claim and survey for [tpl]convert|40926|acre|km2[/tpl] which included Mason's [tpl]convert|8400|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] plat.  The survey of Mason's land was conducted in the Fall of 1783.  Changes were made to the claim during the survey.  Wilson filed suit to prevent the title to the land they both claimed transferring to Mason.  He claimed that Mason's claim was too vague and that the survey was not conducted properly.[ref]

==The decision==

The essential issue before the court was one of when the claim was properly made.  By the time the Supreme Court heard the case, the land was no longer in Virginia, but was now part of Kentucky.  Also, the statutes at issue were passed by the Virginia Legislature prior to the ratification of the United States Constitution.  Nevertheless, the court felt bound to interpret the law as it was in 1780. The time-line was thus as follows:
The court ruled that it was the claim and not the survey that was dispositive.  Thus, Mason's claim should have been the valid one.  However, the Court concluded that the Mason's survey was performed contrary to the claim.  Therefore, for Mason's title to be valid, the survey and not the claim must be dispositive.
The Court ruled for Wilson and gave him title over the land in question.
