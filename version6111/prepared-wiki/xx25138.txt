After arriving in New York City at age 24 on October 26, 1892, and being inspected at Ellis Island,The Statue of Liberty — Ellis Island Foundation, Inc. Astaire's father, hoping to find work in his brewing trade, moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and landed a job with the Storz Brewing Company. Astaire's mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by virtue of her children's talents, after Astaire's sister, Adele Astaire, early on revealed herself to be an instinctive dancer and singer. She planned a "brother-and-sister act," which was common in vaudeville at the time. Although Astaire refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister's steps and took up piano, accordion and clarinet.
When their father suddenly lost his job, the family moved to New York City in 1905 to launch the show business career of the children, who began training at the Alviene Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts.[tpl]cite news |last=Bentley |first=Toni |title=Two-Step: ‘The Astaires,’ by Kathleen Riley |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/the-astaires-by-kathleen-riley.html?_r=1&nl=books&emc=booksupdateema4_20120601&pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times Book Review |date=June 3, 2012 |page=BR32[/tpl]
Despite Adele and Fred's teasing rivalry, they quickly acknowledged their individual strengths, his durability and her greater talent. Fred and Adele's mother suggested they change their name to "Astaire," as she felt "Austerlitz" sounded reminiscent of the name of a battle.  Family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed "L'Astaire".Thomas p. 17  They were taught dance, speaking, and singing in preparation for developing an act.  Their first act was called Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty. Fred wore a top hat and tails in the first half and a lobster outfit in the second. In an interview, Astaire's daughter, Ava Astaire McKenzie, observed that they often put Fred in a top hat to make him look taller.A Couple of Song and Dance Men, 1975 The goofy act debuted in Keyport, New Jersey, in a "tryout theater." The local paper wrote, "the Astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville."Bill Adler, Fred Astaire: A Wonderful Life, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1987, p. 13, ISBN 0-88184-376-8
As a result of their father's salesmanship, Fred and Adele rapidly landed a major contract and played the famed Orpheum Circuit not only in Omaha but throughout the United States. Soon Adele grew to at least three inches taller than Fred and the pair began to look incongruous. The family decided to take a two-year break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the Gerry Society and the child labor laws of the time.  In 1912, Fred became an  Episcopalian.[ref]
