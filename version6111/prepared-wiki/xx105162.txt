Kamasins (Камасинцы (also Камашинцы) in Russian; self designation: калмажи, or kalmazhi) were a tribe of Samoyedic people in the Sayan Mountains numbering approximately 500 persons, who lived along the Kan River and Mana River in the 17th century (southern part of today's Krasnoyarsk Krai). In the 18th - 19th century, there were two groups of the Kamasins: the Taiga Kamasins, engaged in hunting, reindeer breeding and fishing, and Steppe Kamasins, engaged in cattle breeding, horse breeding, farming, and hunting. Almost all of the Kamasins had assimilated with the Russian peasantry by the early 20th century.
