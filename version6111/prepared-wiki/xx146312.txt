==History==

The Institute was created by Ricardo Brennand, a Brazilian collector and businessman of English ancestry, born in Cabo de Santo Agostinho in 1927. Brennand established several factories in the Northeast Region of the country, acting in the segments of cement, tiles, glass, porcelain and sugar production. He started collecting armory, specially melee weapons, in the 1940s. In the following decades, his collection would grow in size and importance, becoming one of the largest such ensembles in the world.
In 1990, Brennand decided to sell some of his factories, gathering the financial resources needed to establish a museum with the aim of preserving and exhibiting his holdings. Prior to the Institute opening, he also became interested in acquiring works of art, beside objects related to Brazilian history. He chose to focus his new acquisitions on the 17th century period of the Dutch occupation of Brazilian Northeast. In five years, Brennand acquired a large group of canvases by Frans Post, as well as 17th-century Dutch landscape and portrait paintings, maps, tapestries, objects, coins, documents and rare books, all of which acquainted to the Dutch rule in Brazil.[tpl]cite book|last=Lago |first=Bia Corrêa|authorlink=|title=Frans Post e o Brasil holandês na coleção do Instituto Ricardo Brennand|year=2003|publisher=IRB|location=Recife|page=9|ISBN=[/tpl]

Post's original drawings are currently housed in the British Museum. The prints depict the main sites and the topography of Brazilian lands under Dutch rule.[tpl]cite book|last=Lago |first=Bia Corrêa|authorlink=|title=Frans Post e o Brasil holandês na coleção do Instituto Ricardo Brennand|year=2003|publisher=IRB|location=Recife|pages=55–57|ISBN=[/tpl]  Also of cartographic importance is the ensemble of 17th-century Brazilian maps made by Hessel Gerritsz, Claes Visscher, Georg Marcgrave, Izaac Commelyn and others.[tpl]cite book|last=Lago |first=Bia Corrêa|authorlink=|title=Frans Post e o Brasil holandês na coleção do Instituto Ricardo Brennand|year=2003|publisher=IRB|location=Recife|pages=77–83|ISBN=[/tpl]
Of great historical importance is the very rare collection of Dutch emergency coins (known as Obsidianas), produced between 1645 and 1654 to overcome the lack of local currency caused by the Portuguese besieging.[tpl]cite book|last=Lago |first=Bia Corrêa|authorlink=|title=Frans Post e o Brasil holandês na coleção do Instituto Ricardo Brennand|year=2003|publisher=IRBlocation=Recife|pages=84–85|ISBN=[/tpl]  The collection of manuscripts is composed by reports, directions, memoranda and other documents related to the historical events and figures of the time.
