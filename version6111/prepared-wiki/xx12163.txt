Whale (origin Old English hwæl from Proto-Germanic *hwalaz) is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacea.[tpl]cite book |title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |editor=Brown, Lesley|publisher=Oxford University press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |edition=Sixth |volume=II |page=3611[/tpl] The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it excludes dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales). This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale. The other Cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), comprises filter feeders that eat small organisms caught by straining seawater through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen. This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes) on top of the head.
Whales range in size from the blue whale, the largest animal known to have ever existed[tpl]cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question687.htm |title=What is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth? |publisher=How Stuff Works |accessdate=2007-05-29[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|180|t[/tpl], to  pygmy species such as the pygmy sperm whale at [tpl]convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Whales inhabit all the world's oceans and number in the millions, with annual population growth rate estimates for various species ranging from 3% to 13%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/estimate.htm#table |title=Whale Population Estimates |date=March 2010 |accessdate=March 2010 |publisher=International Whaling Commission[/tpl] Whales are long-lived, humpback whales living for up to 77 years, while bowhead whales may live for over a century.
Human hunting of whales from the 17th century until 1986 radically reduced the populations of some whale species. Whales have appeared in literature since the time of the Old Testament, play a role in Inuit creation myths, and are revered by coastal people in Ghana and Vietnam.

==Taxonomy==

Cetaceans are divided into two suborders:
Cetaceans and artiodactyls are now classified under the super-order Cetartiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotami. Whales are the hippopotamus's closest living relatives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news2806.html|title=Scientists find missing link between the whale and its closest relative, the hippo|last=Anon|date=25 January 2005|work=PhysOrg.com|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]

==Evolution==

All cetaceans, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the Artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). Both are related to the Indohyus, an extinct semi-aquatic deer-like ungulate, from which they split around 54 million years ago.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm |title=Whales Descended From Tiny Deer-like Ancestors |accessdate=2007-12-21 |author=Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy |publisher=ScienceDaily [/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale, A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |year=2004 | isbn=0-618-00583-8 [/tpl]
These primitive cetaceans first took to the sea about 50 million years ago and became fully aquatic about 5–10 million years later.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1974869.stm |title=How whales learned to swim |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=2006-08-20[/tpl] Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include streamlining of the body, the migration of the nasal openings towards the top of the cranium, the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs, the modification of the forelimbs into flippers, and the growth of flukes on the tail.

==Anatomy==

Like all mammals, whales breathe air, are warm-blooded, nurse their young with milk from mammary glands, and have body hair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/whales/|title=Whales|accessdate=2012-05-17[/tpl]
Beneath the skin lies a layer of fat called blubber, which stores energy and insulates the body. Whales have a spinal column, a vestigial pelvic bone, and a four-chambered heart. The neck vertebrae are typically fused, trading flexibility for stability during swimming.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl]

===Blowhole(s)===

Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one. These are located on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain almost completely submerged while breathing. Breathing involves expelling stale air (which is warm and moist), as well as some mucus and excess water from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs.Whales Don’t Spray Water Out of Their Blowholes Spout shapes differ among species and help with identification.

===Appendages===

The body shape is fusiform and the modified forelimbs, or fins, are paddle-shaped. The end of the tail is composed of two flukes, which propel the animal by vertical movement, as opposed to the horizontal movement of a fish tail. Although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some (such as sperm whales and baleen whales) possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may have feet and digits. Most species have a dorsal fin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whaletimes.org/whales.htm |title=Whales |publisher=Whaletimes.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl]Amazing Facts
In March 2014 in Japan a bottle-nosed dolphin with hind fins about as big as a man's hands, was captured.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/76345012.html http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15581204/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/dolphin-reveals-extra-set-legs

===Dentition===

Toothed whales, such as the sperm whale, possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show."Common Characteristics of Whale Teeth"
Instead of teeth, baleen whales have a row of baleen plates on the upper side of their jaws that resemble the teeth of a comb.

===Ears===

The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance matcher between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. However, in aquatic mammals, such as whales, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.[tpl]cite web |title=How is that whale listening? |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/iop-hit020108.php |accessdate=4 February 2008[/tpl] The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nummela, Sirpa. |title=Sound transmission in archaic and modern whales: Anatomical adaptations for underwater hearing |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=290 |issue=6 |pages=716–733 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ar.20528 |last2=Thewissen |first2=J.G.M |last3=Bajpai |first3=Sunil |last4= Hussain |first4= Taseer |last5=Kumar |first5=Kishor |pmid=17516434[/tpl]

==Life history and behavior==

===Reproduction===

Males are called 'bulls', females, 'cows' and newborns, 'calves'. Most species do not maintain fixed partnerships and females have several mates each season.[tpl]cite episode |series=Modern Marvels |title=Milk |url=http://www.history.com/minisites/modernmarvels |season=14 |network=The History Channel |airdate=2008-01-07[/tpl]
The female usually delivers a single calf, which is birthed tail-first to minimize the risk of drowning. Whale cows nurse by actively squirting milk into the mouths of their young. This milk is so rich in fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. In many species, nursing continues for more than a year and is associated with a strong bond between mother and calf. Reproductive maturity typically occurs at seven to ten years. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one.

===Socialization===

Whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and even grieve.[tpl]cite news |last=Siebert |first=Charles |title=Watching Whales Watching Us |work=New York Times Magazine |date=8 July 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html?pagewanted=all[/tpl] The neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Watson, K.K. |title=Dendritic architecture of the Von Economo neurons |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 141 |issue=3 |pages= 1107–1112 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.084 |last2=Jones |first2=T.K. |last3=Allman |first3=J.M. |pmid=16797136[/tpl] In humans these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind.[tpl]cite journal |author=Allman, John M. |title=Intuition and autism: a possible role for Von Economo neurons |journal= Trends Cogn Sci |volume= 9 |issue=8 |pages= 367–373 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.06.008 |last2=Watson |first2=Karli K. |last3=Tetreault |first3=Nicole A. |last4=Hakeem |first4=Atiya Y. |pmid=16002323[/tpl] Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hof, Patrick R. |title=Structure of the cerebral cortex of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Balaenopteridae) |journal= The Anatomical Record |volume= 290 |issue=1 |pages=1–31 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ar.20407 |last2=Van Der Gucht |first2=Estel |pmid=17441195[/tpl]

===Sleep===

Unlike most animals, whales are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown.  While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, toothed cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, ostensibly so that they may swim, breathe consciously, avoid predators and social contact during their period of rest. It is thought that only one hemisphere of the whale's brain sleeps at a time, so that they rest but are never completely asleep.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/question643.htm|title=Do whales and dolphins sleep?|last=Anon|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl] 
A 2008 study found that wild sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) sleep in vertical postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.003[/tpl]

===Surfacing behavior===

Many whales exhibit behaviors that expose large parts of their bodies to the air, such as breaching and tail slapping.

===Sounding===

Sounding is a term used for whales diving.  It is typically only used for longer dives.  Whales typically stay close to the surface for a series of short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves.  They then have a sounding dive.

===Lifespan===

Whale lifespans vary among species and are not well characterized. Whaling left few older individuals to observe directly. R.M. Nowak of Johns Hopkins University estimated that humpback whales may live as long as 77 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/cetacean/meganova.htm#Maximum_age|title=Humpback Whale|last=Anon|year=2005|work=Animal Infor|publisher=Animal Info|accessdate=25 February 2010[/tpl] In 2007, a 19th-century lance fragment was found in a bowhead whale off Alaska, suggesting the individual could be between 115 and 130 years old.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19195624/ |title=Netted whale hit by lance a century ago |agency=Associated Press |last=Conroy |first=Erin |date=June 2007 |accessdate=2009-10-05[/tpl] Aspartic acid racemization in the whale eye, combined with a harpoon fragment, indicated an age of 211 years for another male, which, if true, would make bowheads the longest-lived extant mammal species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF15/1529.html |title=Bowhead Whales May Be the World's Oldest Mammals |accessdate=2008-03-25 |date=15 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=George, J.C. |title=Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) via aspartic acid racemization |journal= Can.

Zool. |volume= 77 |issue=4 |pages= 571–580 |year=1999 |doi=10.1139/cjz-77-4-571 |last2=Bada |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Zeh |first3=Judith |last4=Scott |first4=Laura |last5=Brown |first5=Stephen E. |last6=O'Hara |first6=Todd |last7=Suydam |first7=Robert[/tpl]
The accuracy of this technique has been questioned because racemization does not correlate well with other dating methods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/10/i02/html/02brignole.html|title=Amino Acid Racemization|last=Brignole|first=Edward|author2=McDowell, Julie|work=Today's chemist at work|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=25 February 2010[/tpl]

===Vocalization===

[tpl]Listen|filename=Humpbackwhale2.ogg|title=Humpback Whale "Song"|description=Recording of Humpback Whales singing and Clicking.|format=Ogg[/tpl] Some species, such as the humpback whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds can be extremely loud, depending on the species. Sperm whales have only been heard making clicks, while toothed whales (Odontoceti) use echolocation that can generate about 20,000 watts of sound (+73 dBm or +43 dBwdBm – dBw Watts conversion chart, Radio-Electronics.com) and be heard for many miles. Whale vocalization is likely to serve many purposes, including echolocation, mating, and identification.[tpl]cite web |url=http://acsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACS-Cetacean-Curriculum.pdf |chapter= Sound (page 12) |title=Cetacean Curriculum – A teacher’s guide to introducing and using whales, dolphins, & porpoises in the classroom |author= |date=28 November 2004 |website=acsonline.org |publisher=American Cetacean Society |format=PDF |accessdate=20 December 2013 |quote=Sound production in cetaceans is a complex phenomenon not fully understood by scientists.[/tpl]
Captive whales have occasionally been known to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of the whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so producing human speech likely takes considerable effort.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9625687/Whale-learns-to-mimic-human-speech.html |title= Whale learns to mimic human speech |publisher= The Daily Telegraph |author= Nick Collins |date = 2012-10-22 |accessdate=2012-10-22 |location=London[/tpl]

==Ecology==

===Feeding===

Whales are generally classed as predators, but their food ranges from microscopic plankton to very large animals.
Toothed whales eat fish and squid, which they hunt by the use of echolocation. Killer whales sometimes eat other marine mammals, including whales.
Baleen whales, such as humpbacks and blues, mainly eat krill when feeding in the higher latitudes (such as the Southern Ocean). They imbibe enormous amounts of seawater, which they expel through their baleen plates; the krill is retained on the plates and then swallowed.[tpl]cite episode |publisher=Discovery Channel Blue Ocean |title=Blue Whale |accessdate=5 October 2009[/tpl] Whales do not drink seawater but indirectly extract water from their food by metabolizing fat.

===Whale pump===

A 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a "whale pump." Whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. This functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier assumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. This nitrogen input in the Gulf of Maine is "more than the input of all rivers combined", some 23,000 metric tons each year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101012101255.htm |title=Whale poop pumps up ocean health |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Roman J, McCarthy JJ |year=2010|title= The Whale Pump: Marine Mammals Enhance Primary Productivity in a Coastal Basin|journal= PLoS ONE |volume=5|issue=10|page=e13255|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013255|editor1-last=Roopnarine|editor1-first=Peter[/tpl]

==Relation to humans==

===Whaling===

Some species of large whales are listed as endangered by multinational organizations, such as CITES, as well as governments and advocacy groups; this is primarily due to the impact of whaling. Whales have been hunted commercially for whale oil, meat, baleen and ambergris (a perfume ingredient from the intestine of sperm whales) since the 17th century.Japan Whaling Assoc. -History of Whaling. Whaling.jp. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.  More than 2 million were taken in the 20th century,[tpl]Cite book |last=Desonie |first=Dana |title=Polar Regions: Human Impacts |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7dJ4eYkOWIoC&pg=PA154 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008 |page=154 |isbn=0-8160-6218-8[/tpl] and by the middle of the century, many populations were severely depleted.
The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/rms.htm|title=Revised Management Scheme Information on the background and progress of the Revised Management Scheme (RMS)|last=Anon|work=International Whaling Commission|accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] The ban is not absolute, however, and some whaling continues under the auspices of scientific research (sometimes not provedWhaling on trial: Vindication!. Greenpeace.org (23 December 2010). Retrieved on 2011-11-18.) or aboriginal rights; current whaling nations are Norway, Iceland and Japan and the aboriginal communities of Siberia, Alaska and northern Canada.

===Bycatch===

Several species of small whales are caught as bycatch in fisheries for other species. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna fishery, thousands of dolphins drowned in purse-seine nets, until preventive measures were introduced. Gear and deployment modifications, and eco-labelling (dolphin-safe or dolphin-friendly brands of tuna), have contributed to a reduction in dolphin mortality by tuna vessels.The Tuna-Dolphin Issue - SWFSC

===Naval sonar===

Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some cetaceans, including whales. In 2003, British and Spanish scientists suggested in Nature that the effects of sonar trigger whale beachings and to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3173942.stm |title=Sonar may cause Whale deaths |publisher=BBC News |date=8 October 2003 |accessdate=2006-09-14 |first=Alex |last=Kirby[/tpl] Responses in Nature the following year discounted the explanation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Piantadosi CA, Thalmann ED |journal=Nature |title=Pathology: whales, sonar and decompression sickness |date=15 April 2004 |volume=428 |issue=6894|doi=10.1038/nature02527a |pmid=15085881 |pages=716–718[/tpl]
Mass beachings occur in many species, mostly beaked whales that use echolocation for deep diving. The frequency and size of beachings around the world, recorded over the last 1,000 years in religious tracts and more recently in scientific surveys, have been used to estimate the population of various whale species by assuming that the proportion of the total whale population beaching in any one year is constant. Beached whales can give other clues about population conditions, especially health problems. For example, bleeding around ears, internal lesions, and nitrogen bubbles in organ tissue suggest decompression sickness.
Following public concern, the U.S. Defense department was ordered by the 9th Circuit Court to strictly limit use of its Low Frequency Active Sonar during peacetime. Attempts by the UK-based Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society to obtain a public inquiry into the possible dangers of the Royal Navy's equivalent (the "2087" sonar launched in December 2004) failed as of 2008. The European Parliament has requested that EU members refrain from using the powerful sonar system until an environmental impact study has been carried out.

===In culture===

Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/spermwhales.htm|title=Sperm Wales: The deep rivers of the ocean|last=Bird|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bird |work=The Wonders of the Seas|publisher=Ocean Research Group |accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl] Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.

The Sanctus and Benedictus portion uses a four note motif derived from humpback whale song to open and close that segment of the work.Living Music Missa Gaia – Creation of Earth Mass
