Jones describes his grandmother, Maggie, as "the most racist person I have ever known", thus forcing him to develop his own independent thinking. His grandmother was of Cherokee, Choctaw, and black ancestry."James Earl Jones on his 'racist grandmother'", interview with Stephen Sackur, BBC News, December 7, 2011.
He moved to his grandparents' farm in Jackson, Michigan, when he was five, but the transition was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan, in later years, a teacher at the Brethren schools helped him overcome his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years, until he entered high school. He credits his English teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him end his silence. Crouch believed forced public speaking would help Jones gain confidence and insisted he recite a poem in class every day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage-visual-arts/the-daddy-of-them-all-1.1007614|title=The daddy of them all|publisher=heraldscotland.com|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] "I was a stutterer.

===Education===

After being educated at the Browning School for boys in his high school years and graduating from Brethren High School in Brethren, Michigan, Jones attended the University of Michigan where he was a pre-med major. He joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and excelled. He felt comfortable within the structure of the military environment, and enjoyed the camaraderie of his fellow cadets in the Pershing Rifles Drill Team and Scabbard and Blade Honor Society.Ensian (Yearbook of the University of Michigan), p. 156 (1952). During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War. After four years of college, Jones graduated from the university in 1955.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vpcomm.umich.edu/aboutum/home/famousalumni.php |title=Notable Alumni |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl]

===Military===

With the war intensifying in Korea, Jones expected to be sent to the war as soon as he received his commission as a second lieutenant. As he waited for his orders, he worked as a part-time stage crew hand at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan, where he had earlier performed. Jones was commissioned in mid 1953 and reported to Fort Benning to attend Infantry Officers Basic Course. He then attended Ranger School and received his Ranger Tab (although he stated during an interview on the BBC's The One Show, screened on November 11, 2009, that he "washed out" of Ranger training). He was initially to report to Fort Leonard Wood, but his unit was instead sent to establish a cold weather training command at the Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado. His battalion became a training unit in the rugged terrain of the Rocky Mountains. Jones was promoted to first lieutenant prior to his discharge.[tpl]Cite web|title=Soldiers to Celebrities: James Earl Jones – U.S. Army|url=http://www.hiredguns.biz/profiles/jamesearljones.htm|work=Hollywood Hired Guns|publisher=Hired Guns Productions|date=January 20, 2008|accessdate=February 20, 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081227164746/http://www.hiredguns.biz/profiles/jamesearljones.htm | archivedate= December 27, 2008[/tpl] He then moved to New York, where he studied at the American Theatre Wing, working as a janitor to support himself.

[tpl]quote|When Linda Blair did the girl in The Exorcist, they hired Mercedes McCambridge to do the voice of the devil coming out of her. And there was controversy as to whether Mercedes should get credit. I was one who thought no, she was just special effects. So when it came to Darth Vader, I said, no I'm just special effects. But it became so identified that by the third one, I thought, OK I've been denying it, I've been saying it sounds like the uncola nut guy Holder. Geoffrey Holder! ... But for the third one, I said OK, I'll let them put my name on it.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/fast-chat-james-earl-jones-1.883740 | title= Fast Chat: James Earl Jones |work=Newsday |location=New York |date=March 12, 2008 | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first= Frank | last= Lovece| accessdate=March 1, 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/69UOnwfCN | archivedate = July 28, 2012 | deadurl=no[/tpl][/tpl]

As cited by production notes included in the DVD release Sesame Street: Old School 1969–1974, the short that had the greatest impact with test audiences was one showing bald-headed Jones counting slowly to ten. This and other segments featuring Jones were eventually aired as part of the Sesame Street series itself when it debuted later in 1969 and Jones is often cited as the first celebrity guest on that series, although a segment with Carol Burnett was the first to actually be broadcast.
