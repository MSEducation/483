==History==

Yuxarı-Aylis was first mentioned in historical sources in the eleventh century under the Armenian name "Argulik.'" Its Armenian population specialized in the production of handicraft and sericulture. Numerous sixteenth century-era sources spoke of it as a thriving town that maintained strong commercial links with India, Russia, Safavid Persia and Western Europe.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Barkhudaryan, Sedrak. «Ագուլիս» Agulis. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1974, vol. 1, p. 61.
In the eighteenth century, Agulis had its own schools, a library, a silkworm factory, a large market. The town was enclosed by walls and surrounded by orchards and vineyards. Its Armenian population at the time was recorded at 8,000 households. In 1752, it was captured and subjected to a heavy sack by the armies of Azat Khan, the ruler of Āzarbāijān. The town was incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1828, following the Russo-Persian War. By 1897, when a census was carried out by the Russian government, Agulis' population had dropped to 1,670.
In the nineteenth century, Verin ("Upper") Agulis, together with the adjoining Nerkin ("Lower") Agulis, was a major Armenian settlement in the Nakhichevan uyezd, with twelve churches and monasteries. The most important church was the St. Thomas the Apostle Monastery, whose date has not been recorded, although inscriptions mention that it was restored in 1694. The monastery was an important center of learning, producing such luminaries as the merchant and traveler Zak'aria Aguletsi, A. Araskhanyan, animal breeder Avetis H. K'alant'ar, and L. Manvelyan. The community also spoke in an especially unique dialect of Armenian called Zok.See Bert Vaux, "Zok: The Armenian Dialect of Agulis," in Between Paris and Fresno: Armenian Studies in Honor of Dickran Kouymjian, ed.

===Destruction===

In the spring of 1919, the First Republic of Armenia extended administrative control over the region of Sharur-Nakhichevan, with Agulis being made the center for the subregion of Goghtan. But in the summer of the year, a Muslim insurgency broke out against Armenian rule, and in August the region came under the control of the newly appointed commissar of Ordubad, Abbas Guli Bey Tairov.[ref]
