Solyndra was a manufacturer of cylindrical panels of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film solar cells based in Fremont, California. Although the company was once touted for its unusual technology, plummeting silicon prices led to the company's being unable to compete with more conventional solar panels.[tpl]cite web|title=Solyndra — Illuminating Energy Funding Flaws?|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/2011/09/27/solyndra-illuminating-energy-funding-flaws/|work=Scientific American|author=Melissa C.

==Technology==

Solyndra designed, manufactured, and sold solar photovoltaic (PV) systems composed of panels and mounting hardware for large, low-slope commercial rooftops. The panels perform optimally when mounted horizontally and packed closely together, the company claimed, covering significantly more of the typically available roof area and producing more electricity per rooftop on an annual basis than a conventional panel installation.[tpl]cite web|title=New Shape of Solar|url=http://www.solyndra.com/technology-products/cylindrical-module/|work=Solyndra Cylindrical Module|publisher=Solyndra,LLC|accessdate=13 June 2012|year=2008[/tpl]
The solar panels developed by the company were claimed to be unlike any other product ever tried in the industry. The panels were made of racks of cylindrical tubes (also called tubular solar panels), as opposed to traditional flat panels. Solyndra rolled its CIGS thin films into a cylindrical shape and placed 40 of them in each 1-meter-by-2-meter panel. Solyndra designers thought the cylindrical solar panels absorbed energy from any direction (direct, indirect, and reflected light).[tpl]cite web|title=Cylindrical Solar Cells Give a Whole New Meaning to Sunroof|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=cylindrical-solar-cells-give-new-meaning-to-sunroof|work=Scientific American|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=David Biello|date=7 October 2008[/tpl]
Each Solyndra cylinder, one inch in diameter, is made up of two tubes. The company used equipment it had developed to deposit CIGS on the outside of the inner tube, which includes up to 200 CIGS cells. On top of the CIGS material, it added an "optical coupling agent", which concentrates the sunlight that shines through the outer tube. After inserting the inner tube into the outer tube, each cylinder is filled with a silicone oil,[tpl]cite web|title=Solyndra Photovoltaic 4 Watt CIGS Cylindrical Solar Tube|url=http://www.halted.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=27718[/tpl]then sealed with glass and metal to exclude moisture, which erodes CIGS's performance. The hermetic sealing technology is commonly used in fluorescent lamps.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/solyndra-rolls-out-tube-shaped-thin-film-1542.html |first=Ucilia |last=Wang |date=7 October 2008 |title=Solyndra Rolls Out Tube-Shaped Thin Film |publisher=Greentech Media[/tpl]
When combined with a white roof (the fastest growing segment of the commercial roof industry with over 1 billion square feet installed in 2008 and required for any new commercial construction in California), the company claimed that systems that employ the panels on a given rooftop could produce significantly more electricity in a given year. It was thought that on a white roof, the panels can capture up to 20% more light than a black roof.[tpl]cite web|title=DDC, Cool and Green Roofing Manual.pdf|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/ddc/downloads/pdf/cool_green_roof_man.pdf|publisher=New York City Department of Design and Construction|accessdate=13 June 2012|page=14|date=June 2005[/tpl] (Note: it is difficult to cite a specific reference for this because the exact gain depends on the latitude of the installation (i.e. sun angle). Solyndra's on-line energy modeling tool allowed designers to specify the roof albedo, and energy output varied as a function of albedo. Twenty percent is cited as typical figure and was validated by careful testing and modeling by the Fraunhofer Institute, among others. However, this report is not available on-line.)
The other advantage claimed by the company was that the panels did not have to move to track the Sun. The panels are always presenting some of their face directly perpendicular to the Sun.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2187/83/ |title=Tubular Solar Panels Slash Costs, Boost Efficiency |work=EcoGeek |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2011 |first=Hank |last=Green |authorlink=Hank Green[/tpl]  The daily production of flat solar panels has an output curve that has a clear peak while Solyndra claimed their system produced more power throughout the day.
The Solyndra panels allow wind to blow through them. According to the company, these factors enable the installation of PV on a broader range of rooftops without anchoring or ballast, which are inherently problematic.  Solyndra claimed that wind and snow loads are negligible and that its panels are lighter in weight per area.
The company claimed the cells themselves convert 12 to 14 percent of sunlight into electricity, an efficiency better than competing CIGS thin-film technologies. However, these efficiencies are for the cells laid flat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solyndra-works-on-1m-sq.-ft.-project-in-socal/|title=Solyndra Works on 1M Sq. Ft. Project in SoCal|publisher=Greentech Media|author=Ucilia Wang|date=16 July 2009[/tpl] The company did not post any numbers about performance when the cells are rolled up. The Solyndra 100/200 spec sheet doesn't mention the cells or the panel efficiencies directly. However, calculating from the data provided shows the high-end 210 panel has a field efficiency of about 8.5%.[tpl]cite web|url=https://na6.salesforce.com/sfc/p/80000000Jxojk0hWZ3pLBkRRGwHHx9AXV5lFbSQ=|title=Solyndra 200 Spec sheet|work=Solyndra.com|publisher=Solyndra LLC|year=2008[/tpl]
In 2006, Solyndra began deploying demonstration systems globally. The company stated the total count was 14 systems and that these systems were each instrumented with sensitive radiation, wind speed, temperature, and humidity measurement devices to aid in the development of energy yield forecasting software tools. The company's website claimed there were more than 1,000 Solyndra systems installed around the world, representing 100 megawatts of power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.solyndra.com/technology-products|title=Technology/Performance, Proven Performance|work=Solyndra.com|publisher=Solyndra LLC|accessdate=20 April 2012[/tpl]

==Government support and politics==

Solyndra received a $536 million U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee before going bankrupt.  Under the Solyndra restructuring plan, the government is projected to recoup 19 percent on $142.8 million of the loan and nothing on the remaining $385 million.Solyndra Lenders Ahead of Government Won't Recover Fully Additionally, Solyndra received a $25.1 million tax break from California's Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority.James Nash, Solyndra Case May Cause Scrutiny of Companies Seeking Tax Break Bloomberg Businessweek 7 October 2011
The majority of Solyndra funding was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.[tpl]cite web|title=Obama's Solyndra Problem - Annenberg Public Policy Center | publisher=factcheck.org | url=http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/obamas-solyndra-problem/[/tpl]

==Production==

The company manufactured its products in its second fabrication plant, Fab 2, a new $733 million state-of-the-art robotic facility in Fremont, California, which opened in September 2010. Fab 2 was built with the support of a $535 million federal loan guarantee along with at least $198 million from private investors. According to an initial public offering by the company, the combined annual production capacity of the plants was projected to be 610 megawatts by 2013. After expanding production in 2008,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/solyndra-rolls-out-tube-shaped-thin-film-1542.html |title=Solyndra Rolls Out Tube-Shaped Thin Film |publisher=Greentech Media |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2011[/tpl] the company announced on 3 November 2010 that it was mothballing its older plant, Fab 1, and postponing expansion of recently opened Fab 2, giving it an annual production capacity of about 300 megawatts. Market conditions were cited, with conventional solar modules manufactured in China by low-cost producers such as Suntech and Yingli offering stiff competition.[tpl]cite news |title=Solar-Panel Maker to Close a Factory and Delay Expansion|first=Todd|last=Woody|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/business/energy-environment/03solar.html|accessdate=3 November 2010[/tpl]

On 3 November 2010, Solyndra said it would lay off around 40 employees and not renew contracts for about 150 temporary workers as a result of the consolidation.

==Shutdown and investigation==

On 31 August 2011, Solyndra announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, laying off 1,100 employees, and shutting down all operations and manufacturing.[tpl]cite web|last=McGrew |first=Scott |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Solyndra-Shutting-Down-128802718.html |title=Solyndra to Declare Bankruptcy |publisher=NBC Bay Area |date= |accessdate=2 September 2011[/tpl] In Solyndra's quarterly employee meetings, employees were told that the company was losing money, and that production costs, while declining, were still higher than the also-declining market prices for solar panels. The decision to lay off employees and cease operations came about as the result of a board meeting on 30 August in which terms for the injection of additional capital could not be agreed upon. This left Solyndra with virtually no cash.
On 8 September 2011, Solyndra was raided by the FBI investigating the company.[tpl]cite news|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|authorlink=Carol D.

On 7 October 2011, newly revealed emails showed that the Obama administration had concerns about the legality of the Department of Energy's loan restructuring plan and warned OMB director Jeffrey D. Zients that the plan should be cleared with the Department of Justice first, which the Department of Energy had not done. The emails also revealed that as early as August 2009, an aide to then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had asked a Department of Energy official if he could discuss any concerns among the investment community about Solyndra but that the official dismissed the idea that Solyndra had financial problems.Solyndra loan deal: Warning about legality came from within Obama administration, Washington Post, 7 October 2011
