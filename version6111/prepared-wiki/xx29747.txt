is a collaborative discussion website.  Articles are created and submitted by Kuro5hin's users and submitted to a queue for evaluation.  Site members can vote for or against publishing an article and, once the article has reached a certain number of votes, it is then published to the site or deleted from the queue.[tpl]cite news | title=Google's ad network spreads the wealth: here's how Google's AdSense program can make money for your Web site.

Kuro5hin is powered by the Scoop collaborative system. Its motto is "Technology and Culture, from the Trenches". It was founded by Rusty Foster in December 1999, being inspired by Slashdot. Kuro5hin's membership used to number in the tens of thousands, but its popularity has declined significantly from its peak in the early 2000s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://k5.trolltrack.com/stats.php |title=Statistics |publisher=k5.trolltrack.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14[/tpl]

==Overview==

All content is generated and selected by the users themselves with the exception of site news, that are written by the site administrators. Registered users can submit stories to the submissions queue. In the queue, users vote +1 FP (front page), +1, 0, or -1. If the story reaches a predetermined threshold score, it is posted to the front page or to the relevant section depending on the proportion of FP votes. If it fails to make the threshold, other factors (such as number of comments, type of comments, and their ratings) can still cause the story to be posted to section or front page. Otherwise, it is dropped.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/07/27/script_kiddies_fell_kuro5hin/ | title=Script kiddies fell Kuro5hin | work=The Register | date=27 July 2000 | accessdate=30 August 2012 | author=Orlowski, Andrew[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/060831miller/ | title=Five rules for building a successful online community | work=OJR: The Online Journalism Review[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Trust in E-Services: Technologies, Practices, and Challenges | publisher=Idea Group Publishing | author=Song, Ronggong; Yee, George; Korba, Larry | year=2007 | page=65 | isbn=159904207X |isbn= 9781599042077[/tpl]
One feature of the story queue is edit mode, in which a story is protected from voting for a period of time and the author can make changes. Comments can still be made on the story to suggest changes before voting begins. They are distinguished as being editorial or topical comments. The edit queue is now rarely used.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
A further section is known as the diaries. They have no editing or moderation vetting and are essentially weblogs.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dotcomscoop.com/article.php?sid=163 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20031204002943/http://www.dotcomscoop.com/article.php?sid=163 | archivedate = 2003-12-04 | title = Interview with Rusty Foster of Kuro5hin.org | work = Dotcom Scoop | date = January 28, 2002[/tpl] They are the source of most of Kuro5hin's content by volume, though unlike the edited article sections, they are not widely syndicated. Other users may also comment on these diaries, similar to stories, however without the "Editorial" or "Topical" stipulation.
The diary section is known as "The Ghetto" to the users there. It is often used by trolls to troll each other because they cannot get a story voted up. Some say this is what caused the downfall of Kuro5hin. Rusty once put a three diary a day limit to discourage abuse of the diary section. He has since lifted it recently. Kuro5hin is full of curse words and slang and insults. It is no longer a Slashdot clone, once it added the fiction section and other sections. The main activity is in the diary area.

==History==

Rusty Foster named Kuro5hin — which is, as noted, pronounced corrosion — as a pun on his first name.
In January 2002, OSDN ended the advertising affiliate agreement with Kuro5hin.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/va_drops_linux_name_boots/ | title=VA drops Linux name, boots out Kuro5hin | work=The Register | date=31 October 2001 | accessdate=30 August 2012 | author=Orlowski, Andrew[/tpl]

===Outages===

In July 2000, the site was temporarily closed due to comment spam and denial of service attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/news/kuro5hin-closes-its-doors-for-good-565486/|title=Kuro5hin closes its doors — for good?|date=2000-07-27|author=admin|work=geek.com|quote=...  spam (unwanted content) and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, flooding the server with commands and fake information. The attacks led the volunteer staff to finally call it a day.[/tpl]
The whois record for the kuro5hin.org domain was changed on October 18, 2013 and again on October 24.

===Financial difficulties===

In June 2002 Foster suggested that he might be forced to sell or shut down Kuro5hin due to lack of funds, and he solicited donations to support the site. Since then, some users have been critical of a perceived lack of active management and functional improvements to the site. As of 2008, the CMF was not legally incorporated, and the site was running on bandwidth provided by its sponsor voxel dot net.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

===Subscription===

On March 25, 2004, Foster closed off new user accounts because a photoshopped pornographic image of his wife had been posted.[ref]
</ref>[tpl]primary-source-inline|date=August 2012[/tpl] On July 13, Foster reopened new user accounts and informed the community that he was abandoning the idea of user sponsorship.<ref>
</ref>[tpl]primary-source-inline|date=August 2012[/tpl] This user sponsorship initiative never came to pass.
