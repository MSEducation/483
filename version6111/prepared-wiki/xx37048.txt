CATEGORIES: Brand name confectionery

Raffaello is a spherical coconut-almond confection that manufacturer Ferrero SpAhttp://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/1131338/DE brought to the market in 1990. The total almond content accounts for 8% of the weight, and the total coconut content is 23.5%.
The praline comprises a spherical wafer which is filled with a white milk cream and white blanched almonds. It is surrounded by a coconut layer. Raffaello contains no chocolate, but does contain lactose making Raffaello incompatible for lactose intolerant consumers. Likewise, almonds instead of hazelnuts are included, which is relevant for hazelnut allergy.
