[tpl]nihongo|R-Type|アール・タイプ|Āru Taipu[/tpl] is a side scrolling shoot-em-up arcade game produced by Irem in 1987. The player controls a space fighter named R-9a "Arrowhead" to defend humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the "Bydo".

==Gameplay==

R-Type is set in the 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a "Arrowhead", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the 'R' series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The R- in the series title originally stood for "ray", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type.[tpl]cite journal | title = R-type developer interview | journal=Gamest | volume=13 | year=1987[/tpl]  This was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the "Round Canopy".
The original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN's Top 10 most difficult games to beat.Top 10 Tuesday: Toughest Games to Beat
The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot 'em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a 'correct' way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level.
The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable 'force' pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).

==Critical response==

The ZX Spectrum version of R-Type was awarded 9/10 in the January 1989 issue of Your SinclairR-Type and was placed at number 6 in the Your Sinclair official top 100. The Games Machine praised the "incredible use of colour" and that it "blows away almost every other shoot'em up on the Spectrum". Crash congratulated Electric Dreams for "retaining the frenetic arcade feel and producing such a brilliant game". Sinclair User praised the weapons system and difficulty curve. C+VG concluded their review by saying "an excellent shoot'em up that's both challenging and addictive. An absolute must for Spectrum blasting fanatics".
The game was runner-up in the category of Best Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind Operation Wolf.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue092/Pages/CVG09200062.jpg

==Ports==

A fairly accurate port of R-Type was released for the PC Engine and TurboGrafx 16 consoles, although both versions suffered from a slightly lower resolution, reduced colour palette, sprite flickering and slow down - due to the slightly reduced resolution, the playfield also scrolls slightly in the vertical axis whenever the player's ship approaches the top or bottom of the screen. The Japanese release for the PC Engine was split across two game cards (HuCards) titled [tpl]nihongo|R-Type I|アール・タイプI|Āru Taipu Wan[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|R-Type II|アール・タイプII|Āru Taipu Tsū[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.videogameden.com/hucard.htm?rt1 |title=Video Game Den |publisher=Video Game Den |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_list_of_PC_Engine_games |title=List of PC Engine games - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] and the later North American release for the TurboGrafx-16 contained the entire game on a single card.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/rtype/rtype.htm |title=R-Type |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] The PC Engine version of R-Type is notable for having a boss at the end of Stage 6, rather than a prolonged wave of enemies as in all other versions.
An R-Type port was produced in China as an unlicensed Famicom cartridge by "Magic Series Corp" under the name Magic Dragon. The level design and music are the same as the original game, but the graphics have been largely redone from scratch (for example, the R-9 more closely resembles a fighter jet, and the first enemies encountered have been changed to birds.)
The Xbox Live Arcade game R-Type Dimensions was released on February 4, 2009. It is a port of the original R-Type and the sequel R-Type II. It can be played either with the original 2D graphics or with new 3D graphics, and has added co-op gameplay functionality.
The PC Engine version of R-Type was one of the first games confirmed for Nintendo's Virtual Console. The Japanese release is split between two downloads while the North American and European versions include all eight levels, mirroring the original release formats for each region respectively. A Sega Master System version became available for Japan on May 19, 2009, for North America on November 2, 2009 and for Europe on September 25, 2009; however, due to licensing issues, this version has been delisted on September 30, 2011 in North America and EuropeLast Chance To Grab R-TYPE for Virtual Console and October 18, 2011 in Japan.
In 2010, DotEmu developed an iOS port of R-Type, published by Electronic Arts, released also for Android in September 2011.

==Sequels and legacy==

Irem has developed a number of sequels and related games, including R-Type II and Armed Police Unit Gallop. Their XMultiply, although not part of the series, has similar themes and gameplay, and was released around the same time as R-Type II.
However, before any of these games was Katakis, a 1988 clone produced by Factor 5 for the Commodore 64 and the Amiga. It was considered by many C-64 players to be technically better to that computer's R-Type port, due to the C-64 version of R-Type being a rushed production. Katakis featured a rather unusual two-player mode, where the second player controlled the Force, creating a dual-role challenge - one of assault and one of protecting the vulnerable main ship. Due to legal challenges from Irem, the clone was soon remade and rereleased in 1989 as Denaris.
In 1991, Konami released Xexex, a game heavily influenced by R-Type and XMultiply. The game used similar weapons and concepts, such as the "Flint" being a combination of R-Type Force and X Multiply tentacle equipment. The Flintlock's ship design is very similar to that of R-Type[tpl]'[/tpl]s R-9 fighter.
Another game similar to R-Type is Rezon, released by Allumer in 1991.Rezon Videogame by Taito/Allumer (1991) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOVrezon at arcade-history: video games, pinballs, slot machines, etcShmups!
Pulstar for the Neo Geo bear a great similarity to R-Type, right down to the use of a Force-like device; a common theory is that ex-Irem employees left to start the game's developer, Aicom. A sequel of sorts, Blazing Star, was developed and released by the same staff (though they had become a company called Yumekobo before then).
At the end of the second level of Turrican II, the player can see the Force in the hangar where the player goes on a ship. Also, the whole third level is made of a ship similar to R-Type.
The third boss of the game Radiant Silvergun, was designed as an homage to the Arrowhead: it has an indestructible force, two bits, a wave cannon, and all three laser types (counter air, rebound, counter ground).

===Humor===

Irem has used R-Type and its Bydo villains for more than a few of their trademark elaborate April Fool's Day pranks.
Dobkeratops, the R-Type level 1 boss can be seen in Irem's Undercover Cops, on a television screen, which can be picked up for points.
R-Type was later represented in the Japan-only Game Boy title, Shuyaku Sentai Irem Fighter along with three other Irem franchises: Mr. Heli, Ninja Spirit and Hammerin' Harry.
2000 saw them selling "traditional Japanese sweets" containing "Force". When asked in the phony order form on which one was your favorite, the three choices were "R9 (Standard Force)", "RX (Tentacle Force)", and "R13 (Anchor Force)". All three were the ship designation and Force names in R-Type Delta.
In 2003, they put up a website that was selling various versions of the R-9 fighter much in the same manner as a car. Three choices were offered: the standard model, the sport model, and the convertible model.
Irem set up "Irem Burger" as their 2004 prank. R-Type played a supporting role here, with three "Bydo Burgers": The Living Body Burger, the Machine Burger, and the Harmony Burger. As well, some of the other "burgers" were filled with game discs, the one for R-Type Final proudly on display right below the top bun.
2005 saw Irem debuting a phony console, the "EXIDNA". One of the "games" available at launch: R-Type Final 2. As if that weren't enough, they also had a triple-wide "Bydo Monitor" as a peripheral, that of course R-Type Final 2 would support.
