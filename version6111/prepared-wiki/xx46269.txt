The College of William & Mary in Virginia (also known as The College,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] William & Mary, or W&M) is a public research university located in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States. Privately founded in 1693 by letters patent issued by King William III and Queen Mary II, it is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States after Harvard University. William & Mary is considered one of the original "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.[tpl]cite book|last=Moll |first=Richard |title=Public Ivys: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities |year=1985[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Greene, Howard and Matthew |title=The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities |year=2001[/tpl]
William & Mary educated U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler as well as other key figures important to the development of the nation, including U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and 16 signers of the Declaration of Independence. W&M founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 make it one of the first universities in the United States.
In addition to its undergraduate program (which includes a joint degree program with the University of St Andrews and a joint engineering program with Columbia University), W&M is home to several graduate and professional schools, including law, business, public policy, education, marine science and colonial history.

==History==

===Colonial era: 1693–1776===

A school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Virginia Colony. The College was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to "make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming."[tpl]cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the College is the second oldest college in America. The original plans for the College date back to 1618, decades before Harvard. In 1695 before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the Sir Christopher Wren Building, then known only as the College Building, and is the oldest college building in America. The College is one of the country's nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. The Charter named James Blair as the College's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William & Mary was founded as an Anglican institution; students were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles.Webster, Homer J. (1902) "Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times," The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly, v. XXVII, p. 374, Google Books entry
The school's charter called for a center of higher education consisting of three schools. The Philosophy School instructed students in the advanced study of moral philosophy (logic, rhetoric, ethics) as well as natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics); upon completion of this coursework, the Divinity School prepared these young men for ordination in the Church of England. This curriculum made William & Mary the first American college with a full faculty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
In 1693, the College was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and it was determined that the College would be supported by tobacco taxes and export duties on furs and animal skins. The College acquired a [tpl]convert|330|acre|km2[/tpl] parcel for the new school,williamsburg hotel virginia busch garden at williamsburgpostcards.com [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.
Williamsburg was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by the Crown and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the College served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The College has been called “the Alma Mater of a Nation” because of its close ties to America’s founding fathers. A 17-year-old George Washington received his surveyor's license through the College and would return as its first American chancellor. William & Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a Royal Charter, the first Greek-letter society (Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776), the first student honor code and the first law school in America. The College became a state-supported school in 1906 and went coed in 1918. In 1928, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. chose the Wren as the first building to be returned to its 18th-century appearance as part of the iconic Colonial Williamsburg restoration.William & Mary - History & Traditions.

===Revolution and transition===

During the period of the American Revolution, freedom of religion was established in Virginia and the separation of church and state achieved, notably with the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Right Reverend James Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped The College of William & Mary to make the transition as well. The college became the first American university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine. As its President, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |title=Virginia Vignettes » What Was the Brafferton School? |publisher=Virginiavignettes.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]
The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first collegiate secret society, the F.H.C. Society, popularly known as the Flat Hat Club, founded November 11, 1750.  On December 5, 1776, students John Heath and William Short (Class of 1779) founded Phi Beta Kappa as a secret literary and philosophical society.  Other secret societies known to currently exist at the College include: The 7 Society, 13 Club, Alpha Club, Bishop James Madison Society, The Society, The Spades, W Society, and Wren Society.Shhh!

Thomas Roderick Dew, who was a professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, became president of the college in 1836. He served until his death in 1846. Nathaniel Beverley Tucker was also a prominent faculty member at this time.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 1842, alumni of the College formed the Society of the Alumni[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.wm.edu/history/index.shtml |title=William & Mary Alumni > History |publisher=Alumni.wm.edu |author=F. James Barnes, II |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College. The Alumni House is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, and the Brafferton.

===Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century===

At the outset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), enlistments in the Confederate Army depleted the student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the College for the duration of the conflict. The College Building was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The Battle of Williamsburg was fought nearby during the Peninsula Campaign on May 5, 1862, and the city fell to the Union the next day. The Brafferton building of the College was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |title=1850–1899 | Historical Facts |work=Historical Chronology of William and Mary |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.
Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The College's 16th president, Benjamin Stoddert Ewell, finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds but the College closed in 1882 due to lack of funds. In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act[tpl]cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] appropriating $10,000 to support the College as a state teacher-training institution. Lyon Gardiner Tyler (son of US President and alumnus John Tyler) became the 17th president of the College following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with 18th president J.A.C. Chandler, expanded the College into a modern institution. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William & Mary preceded the University of Virginia to be one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become coeducational.Women at UVa: Graduate and Professional Schools. .lib.virginia.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-09. During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.
Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, the Sir Christopher Wren Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (the President's office) were restored to their 18th century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of Colonial Williamsburg.

===1930–present===

In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in Norfolk, Virginia. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as Old Dominion University.
Significant campus construction continued under the College's nineteenth president, John Stewart Bryan. President Franklin D. Roosevelt received an honorary degree from the College on October 20, 1934.Roosevelt's Address at William and Mary - Article - NYTimes.com. Select.nytimes.com (1934-10-21). Retrieved on 2013-08-09. In 1935, the Sunken Garden was constructed, just west of the Wren Building. The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at Chelsea Hospital in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.
The College has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s. In 1945, for example, the College administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in The Flat Hat supporting the end of racist policies of segregation, anti-miscegenation and white supremacy.Education: Jefferson's Heirs, TIME Magazine, February 26, 1945 According to Time Magazine, in response, over one-thousand William & Mary students held "a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson." She was pardoned by the college Board of Visitors decades later.Marilyn Kaemmerle entry at the Special Collections Research Center Wiki of the College of William & Mary website
In 1960, the Colleges of William & Mary, a short-lived five campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William & Mary, the Richmond Professional Institute, the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary, Christopher Newport College, and Richard Bland College.[tpl]cite book|last=Godson, et al.|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X[/tpl] It was dissolved in 1962.
In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed Ash Lawn-Highland, the [tpl]convert|535|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] historic Albemarle County, Virginia estate of alumnus and U.S. President James Monroe, to the College.

==Campus==

The College is located on a [tpl]convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] campus in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 2011, Travel+Leisure named the college as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States."America's most beautiful college campuses", Travel+Leisure (September 2011)
The Sir Christopher Wren Building is both the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&ResourceType=Building |title=Wren Building, College of William and Mary |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl] The building, colloquially referred to as the "Wren Building", was so named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect Sir Christopher Wren. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated that the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The College's Alumni Association recently published an article suggesting that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.Alumni Magazine: Wren Building  A follow-up letter clarified the apocryphal nature of the Wren connection.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known as "Ancient Campus": the Brafferton (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732).  In addition to the "Ancient Campus," which dates to the 18th century, the College also consists of "Old Campus" and "New Campus."
"Old Campus" consists of academic buildings and dormitories built in close proximity to the Wren Building and match the Georgian and Anglo-Dutch architecture of the colonial buildings of "Ancient Campus" and Colonial Williamsburg.  Located directly to the west of the Wren Building, the majority of "Old Campus" was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s and is dominated by the Sunken Gardens and the College's football stadium, Zable Stadium.  Also located within "Old Campus" are Sorority Court, the majority of upperclassmen dormitories, and the offices and classrooms of the History, Philosophy, Religion, Music, Modern Language, and English Departments.
Adjoining "Old Campus" to the north and west is "New Campus." It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as "Old Campus," fit into the vernacular of modern architecture.  Beginning with the College's tercentenary in 1993, the College has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of "Old Campus," while incorporating energy-efficient technologies.  Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been LEED certified.  Additionally, as the buildings of "New Campus" are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements in an effort to unify the appearance of the entire College campus. "New Campus" is dominated by William and Mary Hall, Earl Gregg Swem Library, and Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall.  It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, and the majority of the College's athletic fields. The newest addition to "New Campus" is Alan B. Miller Hall, the headquarters of the College's Mason School of Business.
The recent wave of construction at William and Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, located not far from William and Mary Hall.  Additionally, new facilities have freed up space in existing structures.  The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments, which currently share a building on "New Campus" (Morton Hall), could potentially be separated and some relocated to vacant buildings recently renovated within the "Old Campus".
The vast majority of William and Mary's [tpl]convert|1200|acre|km2[/tpl] consists of woodlands and Lake Matoaka, an artificial lake.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |title=Facts about Lake Matoaka |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=May 16, 2011 [/tpl]  The College has shown a dedication to the stewardship and preservation of these natural elements, which are accessible via the trails running throughout the campus.
The College also has property and buildings not contiguous to campus, including the William and Mary School of Law and the McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center, both located on a piece of property approximately four blocks southeast of the Wren Building.  Additionally, approximately a mile northwest of "New Campus" is the Dillard Complex (located across from the modern campus of Virginia's Eastern State Hospital), which is home to several offices, two former dormitories, and Plumeri Park, the College's baseball stadium.

==Organization and administration==

The Board of Visitors is a corporation established by the General Assembly of Virginia to govern and supervise the operation of the College of William & Mary and of Richard Bland College.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/documents/facultyhandbookAugust2008.pdf |format=PDF|title=Faculty Handbook |year=2008 |accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl] The corporation is composed of 17 members appointed by the Governor of Virginia, based upon the recommendations made by the Society of the Alumni, to a maximum of two-successive four-year terms. The Board elects a Rector, Vice Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually. The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the College's property and finances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/bov/members/index.php |title=Members of the Board |publisher=Board of Visitors, The College of William & Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl]
The Chancellor of the College of William and Mary is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, who served as the College’s advocate to the crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President John Tyler held the post. The College has recently had a number of distinguished chancellors: former Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger (1986–1993), former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1993–2000), former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (2005-2012).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |title=Duties and History, Chancellor |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl] Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, himself an alumnus of the College, succeeded O'Connor in February 2012.
The Board of Visitors delegates to a president the operating responsibility and accountability for the administrative, fiscal, and academic performance of the College as well as representing the College on public occasions such as conferral of degrees. In September 2008, W. Taylor Reveley III became the 27th President of the College, succeeding Gene Nichol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/president/biography/index.php |title=W. Taylor Reveley, President |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl] The president is assisted by a provost, the senior academic officer of the university, and several vice presidents.
Faculty members are organized into separate faculties of the Faculty of Arts and Science as well as those for the respective schools of Business, Education, Law, and Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Each faculty is presided over by a dean, who reports to the provost, and governs itself through separate by-laws approved by the Board of Visitors. The faculty are also represented by a faculty assembly that serves to advise the president and provost.
The Royal Hospital School, an independent boarding school in the United Kingdom, is a sister institution.[tpl]cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =   | coauthors = | title = Greenwich Hospital School: A Brief History of The Royal Hospital School | work =  | publisher = Mariners | date = March 5, 2003 | url = http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/GreenwichRoyal.html| doi = | accessdate = February 9, 2009[/tpl]

===Honor system===

William & Mary's honor system was first established by alumnus Thomas Jefferson in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html?scp=1&sq=college%20of%20william%20and%20mary&st=nyt |title=And Out of the Corner of My Eye... – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |author=Patricia R. Olsen |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]  During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the Wren Building pledging:
The basis of W&M's Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alumnus and law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000398 |title=Tucker, Henry St. George, (1780–1848) |publisher=Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress |accessdate=December 12, 2008[/tpl]  While teaching law at the University of Virginia, Tucker proposed that students attach a pledge to all exams confirming that on their honor they did not receive any assistance.[tpl]cite journal  | last = Barefoot  | first = Coy  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Evolution of Honor: Enduring Principle, Changing Times  | journal = The University of Virginia Magazine  | volume = 97  | issue = 1  | pages = 22–27  | publisher = University of Virginia Alumni Assn.   | location = Charlottesville, VA  | date = Spring 2008  | url = http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/  | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = March 4, 2008  | format =  – Scholar search[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |last= Smith| first= C.

The College's Honor System is codified such that students found guilty of cheating, stealing or lying are subject to sanctions ranging anywhere from a verbal warning up to expulsion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/deanofstudents/judicial/Honor_System.php |title=Judicial Affairs | |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]

===Traditions===

William & Mary has a number of traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as Santa Claus and reads a rendition of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads "Twas the Night Before Finals," and The Gentlemen of the College sing the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |title=12/1/2004 - Holiday Traditions Fill The Season In Williamsburg - Travel - Chattanoogan.com |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]  Christmas is a grand celebration at the College; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus.  This popular tradition in fact started when German immigrant Charles Minnegerode, a humanities professor at the College in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St. George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.Minnigerode, Charles (1814–1894). Encyclopedia Virginia. Retrieved on 2013-08-09.
Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the College. Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the President of the College at his home with the Alma Mater song. The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their "departure" from the College. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.
One unofficial tradition is the Triathlon, a set of three tasks completed by many students prior to graduation. These include jumping the wall of the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg after hours (and if so inclined, running through the Boxwood Maze to the Palace itself), streaking through the Sunken Garden, and swimming in the Crim Dell pond.
William and Mary also takes pride in their connections to their colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the Julian Calendar) that the Reverend James Blair, first President of The College received the charter from the Court of William and Mary at Kensington Palace in 1693.  Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President John Tyler, Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, and Robert Gates.
A unique tradition at William and Mary is the annual Raft Debate. Described by The College as "...a 'delicate balance of comedy and lecture,' the annual Raft Debate features four W&M faculty members from diverse disciplines, stranded on a desolate island with only a one-person life raft for escape to civilization. Based on the volume of applause, the audience chooses the sole survivor as the professors cajole, plead, pontificate, and resort shamelessly to props and costumes. The quirky event originated in the mid-1900s and was revived during the 2000s by the Graduate Center, the A&S Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the A&S Graduate Student Association.  Faculty participants represent the Humanities, the Social Sciences, or the Natural and Computational Sciences.  The Devil’s Advocate, who argues sarcastically that none of the academic disciplines are worth saving, has on rare occasion emerged victoriously."
Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William & Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony.  The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William & Mary sings the William & Mary Hymn.

===Fraternities and sororities===

William & Mary has a long history of fraternities and sororities dating back to Phi Beta Kappa, the first "Greek-letter" organization, which was founded there in 1776 . Today, Greek organizations play an important role in the College community, along with other social organizations (e.g. theatre and club sports organizations). Overall, about one-third of its undergraduates are active members of 18 national fraternities and 12 sororities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/greeks/ |title=Greek Life Home | Greeks |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]  William & Mary is also home to several unique non-Greek social fraternities, notably the Nu Kappa Epsilon music sorority[ref]

==Athletics==

Formerly known as the "Indians," William & Mary's athletic teams are now known as the "Tribe". The College fields NCAA Division I teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. In addition, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five Colonial Athletic Association titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles. In that same year, several teams competed in the NCAA Championships, with the football team appearing in the Division I-AA national semifinals. The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th at the Division I NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William & Mary men's basketball team is one of five original Division I schools that has never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.
There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe. On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper Adin Brown was a back-to-back NCAA First Team All-American in 1998 and 1999. The track program has produced several All-Americans, including Brian Hyde, an Olympian and collegiate record holder in the 1500-meter run, and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the 5000-meter run at the 2007 Pan American Games. The baseball program boasts a handful of current MLB players, including relief pitcher Bill Bray with the Cleveland Indians organization, 11 year MLB career Curtis Pride Montreal Expos, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Detroit Tigers, and Colorado Rockies utility infielder Brendan Harris. The football program has also produced numerous NFL players and coaches: All-Pro safety Darren Sharper, current Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, cornerback Derek Cox, kicker Steve Christie, long snapper Mike Leach, Walter Payton Award-winning quarterback Lang Campbell, wide receiver Dominique Thompson, Pro Football Hall of Fame coaches Marv Levy and Lou Holtz, and Jacksonville Jaguars linebackers coach Mark Duffner.
In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the American Indian community. The College's appeal regarding the use of the institution’s athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The "Tribe" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |title=‘Tribe’ refers to community Nichol states in a report sent to the NCAA | University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] The College stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |title=William and Mary to change athletic logo before Fall 2007 | University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl] Some students[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] have vowed to display the prior logo on their own at NCAA post-season games. A new design was unveiled in December 2007.
For a short time, the College's unofficial mascot was a green and gold frog (though it was commonly referred to on campus simply as an 'amorphous green blob') called "Colonel Ebirt" ("Tribe" backwards), which was discontinued in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.wm.edu/news/archive/index.php?id=5246 |title=Eulogy for Ebirt: Lessons from one of the Tribe’s great fans | University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]  Prior to that, two students, one male, one female, dressed in buckskins. The female was referred to as Pocohontas, while the male was usually referred to as "tribe guy." The practice ended around 1991.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Subsequently, a selection process was conducted to select the College's new mascot. In December 2009, five finalists – including a Griffin, King and Queen, the Phoenix, a Pug and the Wren – were announced from more than 800 submissions.William & Mary - Mascot Committee unveils five finalists  On April 6, 2010, President Taylor Reveley announced that the College has selected the Griffin as its new mascot.William & Mary - 'Get me the Griffin': William & Mary Announces New Mascot
