[[Nucleariid]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleariids, Amoeboids

The nucleariids are a group of amoebae[tpl]cite pmid|11411837[/tpl] with filose pseudopods, known mostly from soils and freshwater. They are distinguished from the superficially similar vampyrellids mainly by having mitochondria with discoid cristae. 

==Classification==

Nucleariids are opisthokonts,[tpl]cite journal |author=Yoshida M, Nakayama T, Inouye I |title=Nuclearia thermophila sp. nov. (Nucleariidae), a new nucleariid species isolated from Yunoko Lake in Nikko (Japan) |journal=European journal of protistology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=147–155 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19157810 |doi=10.1016/j.ejop.2008.09.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0932-4739(08)00080-1[/tpl] the group which includes animals, fungi and several smaller groups. Several studies place the nucleariids as a sister group to the fungi.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge MA, Espelund M, et al | title = Multigene phylogeny of choanozoa and the origin of animals | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = e2098 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18461162 | pmc = 2346548 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002098 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002098 | postscript =  | editor1-last = Aramayo | editor1-first = Rodolfo [/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Nucleariids are usually small, up to about 50 μm in size. 
According to a 2009 paper, Fonticula, a cellular slime mold, is an opisthokont and more closely related to Nuclearia than to fungi.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Phylogeny of the "Forgotten" Cellular Slime Mold, Fonticula alba, Reveals a Key Evolutionary Branch within Opisthokonta | author = Matthew W.
