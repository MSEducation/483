NaK, or sodium-potassium alloy, an alloy of potassium (K) and sodium (Na), is usually liquid at room temperature. Various commercial grades are available. NaK is highly reactive with water and may catch fire when exposed to air, so must be handled with special precautions.

==Physical properties==

NaK containing 40% to 90% potassium by weight is liquid at room temperature. The eutectic mixture consists of 77% potassium and 23% sodium, is liquid from −12.6 to 785 °C, and has a density of 866 kg/m3 at 21 °C and 855 kg/m3 at 100 °C, making it less dense than water.[tpl]cite web | publisher = BASF | title=Sodium-Potassium Alloy (NaK) |url=http://www.basf.com/inorganics/pdfs/tech_datasheet/NaK.pdf | accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] It is highly reactive with water and is stored under dry nitrogen (or, even better, dry argon) for safety reasons.[tpl]cite web|last=Strem Chemical|title=MSDS|url=http://www.strem.com/catalog/v/19-1910/54/potassium_11135-81-2|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl] 
When stored in air, it forms a yellow potassium superoxide coating and may ignite.  This superoxide reacts explosively with organics.  NaK is not dense enough to sink in most hydrocarbons, but will sink in lighter mineral oil.  It is unsafe to store in this manner if the superoxide has formed.  A large explosion took place at the Oak Ridge Y-12 facility on December 8, 1999, when NaK cleaned up after an accidental spill and inappropriately treated with mineral oil was scratched with a metal tool.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/csa/csp/aip/accidents/typea/9912y12/ |title=Y-12 NaK Accident Investigation |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=February 2000 |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100528034133/http://www.hss.energy.gov/csa/csp/aip/accidents/typea/9912y12/ |archivedate=2010-05-28 [/tpl] The liquid alloy also attacks PTFE ("Teflon").[tpl]cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]
NaK has a very high surface tension, which makes large amounts of it pull into a bun-like shape. Its specific heat capacity is [tpl]nowrap|982 J/(kg.K)[/tpl], which is roughly one-fourth of that for water, but heat transfer is higher over a temperature gradient due to higher thermal conductivity.[tpl]cite web|title=Danamics LM10 - Liquid metal put to the test|url=http://www.nordichardware.com/en/component/content/article/181-danamics-lm10-liquid-metal-put-to-the-test-.html?start=2|publisher=NordicHardware[/tpl] 2010-01-10 nordichardware.com

==Usage==

===Coolant===

NaK has been used as the coolant in experimental fast neutron nuclear reactors. Unlike commercial plants, these are frequently shut down and defuelled. Use of lead or pure sodium, the other materials used in practical reactors, would require continual heating to maintain the coolant as a liquid. Use of NaK overcomes this.

The Danamics LMX Superleggera CPU cooler uses NaK to transport heat from the CPU to its cooling fins.

===Desiccant===

Both sodium and potassium are used as desiccants in drying solvents prior to distillation.

==Synthesis and production==

Industrially, NaK is produced in a reactive distillation.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1021/ba-1957-0019.ch018|volume=19|isbn=978-0-8412-0020-3|isbn=9780841221666|chapter=18|pages=169–173|journal=Advances in Chemistry|last2=Werner|first2=R. C.|last1=Jackson|first1=C. B.|date=1957-01-01 |title=The Manufacture of Potassium and NaK[/tpl] In this continuous process, a distillation column is fed with potassium chloride and sodium. In the reaction zone, potassium chloride reacts with sodium to form sodium chloride and potassium. The lighter, boiling potassium is enriched in an upper fractionating zone and drawn at the column head while molten sodium chloride is withdrawn from the bottom.
