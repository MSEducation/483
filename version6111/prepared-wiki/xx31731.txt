He was the most prominent of the Gigantes who led a major rebellion against the Olympian Gods and was said to be immortal in his homeland, Pallene.
Alcyoneus was in possession of the Isthmus of Corinth at the time when Heracles drove away the oxen of Geryon. The giant attacked him, crushed twelve wagons and twenty-four of the men of Heracles with a huge block of stone. Heracles himself warded off the stone with his club and slew Alcyoneus. The block with which the giant had attacked Heracles was shown on the isthmus down to a very late period.Pindar, Nemean Odes iv. 44, with the Scholiast In another passage Pindar calls Alcyoneus a Thracian shepherd, and places the struggle with him in the Phlegraean plains.Pindar, Isthmian Odes vi. 45, &c.
According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, Heracles sneaked up on Alcyoneus and wounded him, although the giant did not die until Heracles dragged him out of his homeland, Pallene.Pseudo-Apollodorus, 1. 34
