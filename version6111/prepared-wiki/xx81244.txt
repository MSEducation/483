[[Niagara campaign]]

CATEGORIES: Campaigns of the War of 1812

The Niagara campaign occurred in 1814 and was the final campaign launched by the United States to invade Canada during the War of 1812.  
The American forces, commanded by General Jacob Brown and General Winfield Scott, began the campaign with the Capture of Fort Erie on the Niagara Peninsula.  
Next, they decisively defeated the British at the Battle of Chippawa.
At the Battle of Lundy's Lane, both sides claimed victory, but because U.S. forces had suffered so many casualties, they pulled back to Fort Erie.  
Following their return to the fort, the British, under Gordon Drummond, attempted to capture the fort and the Siege of Fort Erie followed.  
The Americans were able to hold out, and the British eventually lifted the siege after suffering severe losses.  After a small engagement at Cook's Mills, American forces, commanded by General George Izard, abandoned Fort Erie and returned to the U.S. territory.
