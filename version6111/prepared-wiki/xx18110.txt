===England===

The dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century.
(Charles Dickens mentions a "fried fish warehouse" in Oliver Twist, first published in 1838), while in the north of England a trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes developed. The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market.[tpl]cite book|last1=Chaloner|first1=W. H.|last2=Henderson|first2=W. O.|title=Industry and Innovation: Selected Essays|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1990|isbn=0-7146-3335-6[/tpl] It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish-and-chip shop industry we know. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin opened the first recorded combined fish-and-chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England, in Mossley, in 1863.[tpl]cite web|author=Historic uk - the heritage accommodation guide |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/FishandChips.htm |title=Tradition Historic UK, Fish and Chips |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl]
The concept of a fish restaurant was introduced by Samuel Isaacs (born 1856 in Whitechapel, London; died 1939 in Brighton, Sussex) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century. Isaacs' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips, bread and butter, and tea for nine pence,England Eats Out by John Burnett - Published by Pearson Education, 2004 ISBN 0-582-47266-0 and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain.
The restaurants were carpeted, had waited service, tablecloths, flowers, china and cutlery, and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time. They were located in Tottenham Court Road, St Pancras, The Strand, Hoxton, Shoreditch, Brixton and other London districts, as well as Clacton, Brighton, Ramsgate, Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England. Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants. Sam Isaacs' trademark was the phrase "This is the Plaice" combined with a picture of the punned-upon fish in question. A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No.1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom's 1955 film One Good Turn just as Norman/Pitkin runs onto the seafront; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden's fish and chips restaurant. A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in Britain in 1860, and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries in Britain.The Portuguese gave us fried fish, the Belgians invented chips but 150 years ago an East End boy united them to create The World's Greatest Double Act Mail Online.

===Scotland===

Dundee City Council claims that "...in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy - the chip - was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city’s Greenmarket."[tpl]cite web|title = Dundee Fact File|publisher = Dundee City Council|url = http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/departments/fact.htm|accessdate = 20 March 2007[/tpl]
In Edinburgh, a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar, known as "sauce", or more specifically as "chippy sauce", has great popularity.[tpl]cite web|author=SiteWise - Content Management System - www.pureenergymultimedia.com/sitewise/ |url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/81.htm |title=Did You Know? |publisher=Federation of Fish Friers |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl]

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant, Giuseppe Cervi, who mistakenly stepped off an America-bound ship at Cobh (then called Queenstown) in County Cork and walked all the way to Dublin.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/food-drink/national-fish-and-chips-day-thank-cod-for-giuseppe-2656484.html |title=National Fish and Chips Day: Thank cod for Giuseppe - Food & Drink, Lifestyle - Independent.ie |work= Irish Independent|accessdate=[/tpl] He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart. He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street). His wife Palma would ask customers "Uno di questa, uno di quella?" This phrase (meaning "one of this, one of the other") entered the vernacular in Dublin as "one and one", which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city.

===United States===

In the United States, the dish is most commonly sold as "fish and chips," except in Wisconsin and other parts of the Upper Midwest, where this meal would be called a fish fry. The name "fish and chips" remains despite the fact that the word "chips" in the US generally refers to what are called "crisps" in the UK. (Americans typically refer to fried, sliced potatoes as fries).

==Composition==

===Cooking===

Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard; however, vegetable oils, such as peanut oil (used because of its relatively high smoke point) [tpl]As of|2007|alt= now[/tpl] predominate. A minority of vendors in the north of England and Scotland and the majority of vendors in Northern Ireland still use dripping or lard, as it imparts a different flavour to the dish, but it has the side effect of making the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths. Lard is used in some living industrial history museums, such as the Black Country Living Museum.

===Thickness===

British chips are usually thicker than American-style French fries sold by major multinational fast food chains, resulting in a lower fat content per portion. In their homes or in non-chain restaurants, people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip, more similar to the British variant, sometimes referred to as steak fries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_31517,00.html |title=Online recipes |publisher=Foodnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_36305,00.html |title=More online recipes |publisher=Foodnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl]
How much cooking fat soaks into the potato depends on the surface area and how long they are cooked. Chips have a smaller surface area per unit weight than French fries, which means absorbing less oil in a given time. On the other hand, chips, being thicker, take longer to cook than fries.

===Batter===

UK chippies traditionally use a simple water and flour batter, adding a little sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and a little vinegar to create lightness, as they create  bubbles in the batter. Other recipes may use beer or milk batter, where these liquids are often substitutes for water.  The carbon dioxide in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter.  Beer also results in an orange-brown colour. A simple beer batter might consist of a 2:3 ratio of flour to beer by volume. The type of beer makes the batter taste different: some prefer lager[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/deepfriedfishinbeerb_67776.shtml|title=Deep fried fish in beer|date=|accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/gurnard-in-beer-batter-772989.html|title=Gurnard in beer batter|date=26 January 2008|accessdate=2009-03-23 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Mark | last=Hix[/tpl] whereas others use stout or bitter.

===Choice of fish===

In Britain and Ireland, cod and haddock appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips,[tpl]cite web|author=Alan Masterson, tictoc design |url=http://www.seafish.org/plate/fishandchips.asp |title="Seafish. On Plate. Fish & chips" (UK Sea Fish Industry Authority website) |publisher=Seafish.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock or coley, plaice, skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear most commonly in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish & Northern Irish chip-shop slang for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall regularly offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock due to their regular availability in a common catch.
In Australia, reef cod and rock cod (a different variety from that used in the United Kingdom), barramundi or flake (a type of shark meat), or snapper are commonly used. From the early 21st century, farmed basa imported from Vietnam and hoki have become common in Australian fish and chip shops. Other types of fish are also used based on regional availability.
In New Zealand, snapper was originally the preferred species for battered fillets in the North Island. As catches for this fish declined, it was replaced by hoki, shark (marketed as lemon fish) and tarakihi. Bluefin gurnard and blue cod predominate in South Island fish and chips.
In the United States, the type of fish used depends on availability in a given region. Some common types are cod, halibut, flounder, tilapia or, in New England, Atlantic cod or haddock. Salmon is growing common on the West Coast, while freshwater catfish is most commonly used in the Southeast.

===Accompaniments===

In chip shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland, salt and vinegar is traditionally sprinkled over fish and chips at the time it is served. Suppliers use malt vinegar, onion vinegar (used for pickling onions), or the cheaper non-brewed condiment. In Britain a portion of mushy peas is a popular side dish [tpl]cite web|author=BBC |url=http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3411/crispy-fish-and-chips-with-mushy-peas |title=Crispy fish & chips with mushy peas recipe - Recipes - BBC Good Food |date= |accessdate=2010-03-07[/tpl] as are a range of pickles that typically include gherkins, onions and eggs.[tpl]cite web|author=Neil |url=http://britishfoodhistory.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/pickled-eggs/ |title=Pickled Eggs | British Food: A History |publisher=Britishfoodhistory.wordpress.com |date=2012-09-23 |accessdate=2013-07-16[/tpl] In table-service restaurants and pubs, the dish is usually served with a slice of lemon for squeezing over the fish and without any sauces or condiments, with salt, vinegar and sauces available at the customer's leisure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/how-eat-fish-chips-like-british-1640767.html |title=How to Eat Fish and Chips like the British - Yahoo!

In Ireland, Wales and Northern England, most takeaways serve warm portions of side-sauces such as curry sauce, gravy or mushy peas. The sauces are usually poured over the chips. In some areas, this dish without fish is referred to as 'wet chips'. Other fried products include 'scraps' (also known as 'bits' in Southern England), originally a by-product of fish frying. Still popular in Northern England, they were given as treats to the children of customers. Portions prepared and sold today consist of loose blobs of batter, deep fried to a crunchy golden crisp in the cooking-fat. The very popular potato scallop or potato cake consists of slices of potato dipped in fish batter and deep fried until golden brown. These are often accompanied for dipping by the warm sauces listed above.[tpl]cite news|author=guardian.co.uk |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/jul/13/doyouknowwhatscrapsarean |title=Do you know what scraps are? And why they should be free |date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-24 |location=London |work=The Guardian[/tpl]
In Edinburgh and the Lothians salt and sauce (or saut an sauce) is the normal accompaniment traditionally sprinkled over fish and chips or almost anything else bought from the fish-and-chips shops. The watery "sauce" is a mixture of malt vinegar or non-brewed condiment and/or water and Rowat's or Gold Star brand brown sauce, and it is mixed and bottled—often in an old glass fizzy drink bottle with a hole pierced in the screw cap—by each fish-and-chip shop to their own secret recipe.
In Australia and New Zealand, plain salt is usually sprinkled over fish and chips just before serving. Some customers may choose to salt food themselves, given current public health concerns about salt intake. Another popular condiment is tomato sauce. Tartar sauce is also very popular for the fish. Both tomato and tartar sauce are usually sold in small plastic tubs on the shop counter. Complementary slices of lemon are sometimes served with the dish or takeaway pack, although many New Zealanders grow lemons at home. Less commonly, following British and Irish traditions, malt vinegar is the condiment of choice of some Australasian fish and chip lovers. In New Zealand, most fish and chip shops now offer a choice between battered and crumbed fish, and battered hotdogs, battered potato fritters and other deep fried novelties are also usually available.
In Canada, fish and chips may be served with the traditional salt and vinegar, but a lemon wedge and tartar sauce is often the accompaniment found in table service restaurants. Coleslaw of both the vinegared or creamy variety is often interchangeably served as a side.
In the United States, most restaurants serve fish and chips with tartar sauce, ketchup, and coleslaw, although malt vinegar also is sometimes offered, especially at UK-themed pubs.

==Vendors==

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, fish and chips usually sell through independent restaurants and take-aways known as fish and chip shops. Outlets range from small affairs to chain restaurants. Locally-owned seafood restaurants are also popular in many local markets. Mobile "chip vans" serve to cater for temporary occasions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mobilecateringuk.co.uk/how-to-start-up-mobile-catering-business.htm |title=Starting a Mobile Catering Business in UK |publisher=Mobilecateringuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16[/tpl] In Canada, the outlets may be referred to as chip wagons.

Fish-and-chip shops traditionally wrapped their product in newspaper, or with an inner layer of white paper (for hygiene) and an outer layer of newspaper or blank newsprint (for insulation and to absorb grease), though the use of newspaper for wrapping has almost ceased on grounds of hygiene. [tpl]As of|2007|alt= Nowadays[/tpl], establishments usually use food-quality wrapping paper, occasionally printed on the outside to emulate newspaper.
The British National Federation of Fish Friers was founded in 1913. It promotes fish and chips and offers training courses.

==Cultural impact==

The long-standing Roman Catholic tradition of not eating meat on Fridays - especially during Lent - and of substituting fish for other types of meat on that day - continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, Anglican, semi-secular and secular societies. Friday night remains a traditional occasion for eating fish-and-chips; and many cafeterias and similar establishments, while varying their menus on other days of the week, habitually offer fish and chips every Friday.[tpl]cite book | title = Frying tonight: the saga of fish & chips | author = Gerald Priestland |publisher = Gentry Books |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=VsDfAAAAMAAJ | year = 1972  | pages =   | isbn = 0-85614-014-7 | page = 28 [/tpl]
In Australia and New Zealand, the words "fish and chips" are often used to highlight the difference in each country's short-i vowel sound [tpl]IPA|ɪ[/tpl]. Australian English has a higher forward sound [tpl]IPA|i[/tpl], close to the y in happy and city, while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound [tpl]IPA|ɘ[/tpl], a slightly higher version of the a in about and comma. Hence many people from other dialects hear an Australian say "feesh and cheeps" and a New Zealander say "fush and chups" for fish and chips.[tpl]citation |last=Crystal |first=David |year=2003 |title=The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page= 354[/tpl][tpl]citation |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |last2=Hannah |first2=Jean |year=2002 |title=International English: A Guide to the Varieties of Standard English |edition=4th |publication-place=London |publisher=Arnold |pages = 23–24[/tpl]
