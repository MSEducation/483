The Pushkin State Russian Language Institute in Moscow (Государственный Институт русского языка им. А.С. Пушкина ) claims to be Russia’s centre for Russian as a foreign language teaching and offers a range of language courses on all levels.

==History==

The Pushkin Institute was founded in 1966 as a part of the MGU, i.e Lomonosov University. In 1973, it obtained its independence and in 1999 a Philological Department was established so that Russian native speakers can do bachelor’s (4 years), Master’s (2 years) and Ph.D. (3 years) programmes in teaching Russian as a foreign language.

==Location==

The Institute’s address is ulitsa Akademika Volgina 6 (улица Академика Волгина 6).
The nearest underground station is Byelyayevo (Беляево). To get to the city (Cremlin, i.e. underground station плошадь Революция) it takes 20 minutes to walk to the underground station and then some 50 minutes by the Moscow Metro. Misleadingly, the Pushkin Institute itself says it takes 25 minutes by the underground to the city.See http://www1.pushkin.edu.ru/publ/english/pushkin_institute_info/53-1-0-188.

==Courses==

The Pushkin Institute offers one month summer courses and one year or one term courses. Most of the participants are recruited through bilateral exchange programmes dating back to the Soviet era.
The Russian Embassy in Berlin reckons the Pushkin Institute among the officially recommended institutions for Russian language courses. http://www.russische-botschaft.de/index.php?id=114.

The Institute promotes its courses with extremely inexpensive fees. For instance, in summer 2013 a one month summer course (24 hours a week) including accommodation and excursions costed only 28.200 roubles (850 USD) and in addition various reductions and special fees apply for a lot of applicants.
