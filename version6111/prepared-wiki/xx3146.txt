The orbit of a planet is not centered on the star but on their common center of mass (see diagram on right). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the distance between the planet and the center of mass of the system. For elliptical orbits, the planet–star distance varies over the course of the orbit, in which case the semi-major axis is the average of the largest and smallest distances between the planet and the center of mass of the system. If the sizes of the star and planet are relatively small compared to the size of the orbit and the orbit is nearly circular and the center of mass is not too far from the star's center, such as in the Earth-Sun system, then the distance from any point on the star to any point on the planet is approximately the same as the semi-major axis. However, when a star's radius expands when it turns into a red giant, then the distance between the planet and the star's surface can become close to zero, or even less than zero if the planet has been engulfed by the expanding red giant, whereas the center of mass from which the semi-major axis is measured will still be near the center of the red giant.
Orbital period is the time taken to complete one orbit. For any given star, the shorter the semi-major axis of a planet, the shorter the orbital period. Also comparing planets around different stars but with the same semi-major axis, the more massive the star, the shorter the orbital period.
There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88 days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.
Over the lifetime of a star, the semi-major axes of its planets changes. This planetary migration happens especially during the formation of the planetary system when planets interact with the protoplanetary disk and each other until a relatively stable position is reached, and later in the red-giant and asymptotic-giant-branch phases when the star expands and engulfs the nearest planets that can cause them to move inwards, and when the giant phases lose mass as the outer layers dissipate causing planets to move outwards as a result of the star's reduced gravitational field.
The radial-velocity and transit methods are most sensitive to planets with small orbits. The earliest discoveries such as 51 Peg b were gas giants with orbits of a few days. These "hot Jupiters" likely formed further out and migrated inwards. The Kepler spacecraft has found planets with even shorter orbits of only a few hours, which places them within the star's upper atmosphere or corona, and these planets are Earth-sized or smaller and are probably the left-over solid cores of giant planets that have evaporated due to being so close to the star,Time Really Flies on These Kepler Planets or even being engulfed by the star in its red giant phase in the case of Kepler-70b. As well as evaporation, other reasons why larger planets are unlikely to survive orbits only a few hours long include orbital decay caused by tidal force, tidal-inflation instability, and Roche-lobe overflow.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1307.4080 |author1=Saul Rappaport |author2=Roberto Sanchis-Ojeda |last3=Rogers |first3=Leslie A. |author4=Alan Levine |last5=Winn |first5=Joshua N. |title=The Roche limit for close-orbiting planets: Minimum density, composition   constraints, and application to the 4.2-hour planet KOI 1843.03 |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2013[/tpl] The Roche limit implies that small planets with orbits of a few hours are likely made mostly of iron.
The direct imaging method is most sensitive to planets with large orbits, and has discovered some planets that have planet–star separations of hundreds of AU. However, protoplanetary disks are usually only around 100 AU in radius, and core accretion models predict giant planet formation to be within 10 AU, where the planets can coalesce quickly enough before the disk evaporates.
Very long-period giant planets may have been free floating planets that were captured, or formed close-in and gravitationally scattered outwards, or the planet and star could be a mass-imbalanced wide binary system with the planet being the primary object of its own separate protoplanetary disk. Gravitational instability models might produce planets at multi-hundred AU separations but this would require unusually large disks.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/693/2/L113 |title=Long-Period Exoplanets from Dynamical Relaxation |year=2009 |last1=Scharf |first1=Caleb |last2=Menou |first2=Kristen |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=693 |issue=2 |pages=L113|arxiv = 0811.1981 |bibcode = 2009ApJ...693L.113S [/tpl]
For planets with very wide orbits up to several hundred thousand AU it may be difficult to observationally determine whether the planet is gravitationally bound to the star.
Most planets that have been discovered are within a couple of AU of their star because the most used methods (radial-velocity and transit) require observation of several orbits to confirm that the planet exists and there has only been enough time since these methods were first used to cover small separations. Some planets with larger orbits have been discovered by direct imaging but there is a middle range of distances, roughly equivalent to the Solar System's gas giant region, which is largely unexplored. Direct imaging equipment for exploring that region is being installed on the world's largest telescopes and should begin operation in 2014. e.g. Gemini Planet Imager and VLT-SPHERE. The microlensing method has detected a few planets in the 1-10AU range.The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia — Catalog Listing
It appears plausible that in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least around Sun-like stars.
The distance of the habitable zone from a star depends on the type of star and this distance changes during the star's lifetime as the size and temperature of the star changes.

===Eccentricity===

The eccentricity of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical (elongated) it is. All the planets of the Solar System except for Mercury have near-circular orbits (e0.2) of giant planets are not an observational selection effect, because a planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit. The prevalence of elliptical orbits for giant planets is a major puzzle, because current theories of planetary formation strongly suggest planets should form with circular (that is, non-eccentric) orbits.
However, for weak Doppler signals near the limits of the current detection ability the eccentricity becomes poorly constrained and biased towards higher values. It is suggested that some of the high eccentricities reported for low-mass exoplanets may be overestimates, because simulations show that many observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% chance of being a pair of planets. This misinterpretation is especially likely if the two planets orbit with a 2:1 resonance. With the exoplanet sample known in 2009, a group of astronomers has concluded that "(1) around 35% of the published eccentric one-planet solutions are statistically indistinguishable from planetary systems in 2:1 orbital resonance, (2) another 40% cannot be statistically distinguished from a circular orbital solution" and "(3) planets with masses comparable to Earth could be hidden in known orbital solutions of eccentric super-Earths and Neptune mass planets".
Radial velocity surveys found exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, particularly for large planets. Kepler spacecraft transit data is consistent with the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.

====Eccentricity dynamics====

===Inclination vs spin-orbit angle===

Orbital inclination is the angle between a planet's orbital plane and another plane of reference. For exoplanets the inclination is usually stated with respect to an observer on Earth: the angle used is that between the normal to the planet's orbital plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star. Therefore most planets observed by the transit method are close to 90 degrees.Page 2, Exoplanets: Detection, Formation, Properties, Habitability, John Mason, Springer, 2008 Since the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin-orbit angle or spin-orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. The Kepler spacecraft has found a few hundred multi-planet systems and in most of these systems the planets all orbit in nearly the same plane, much like the Solar System. However, a combination of astrometric and radial-velocity measurements has shown that some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly tilted relative to each other.Out of Flatland: Orbits Are Askew in a Nearby Planetary System, www.scientificamerican.com, 24 May 2010. More than half of hot Jupiters have orbital planes substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial fraction of hot-Jupiters even have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction from the star's rotation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/pr10.php |title=Turning planetary theory upside down |publisher=Astro.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-02-28[/tpl] Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disc.Tilting stars may explain backwards planets, New Scientist, 1 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.

==Rotation rate, axial tilt and tidal effects==

In April 2014 the first measurement of a planet's rotation period was announced: Beta Pictoris b rotates in 8 hrs.The fast spin-rotation of a young extra-solar planet, Ignas A. G. Snellen, Bernhard R. Brandl, Remco J. de Kok, Matteo Brogi, Jayne Birkby, and Henriette Schwarz, April 2014, http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7506Newly Clocked Exoplanet Spins a Whole Day in 8 Hours, discovery.com Apr 30, 2014 01:00 PM ET // by Irene Klotz This spin is faster than the gas giants of the solar system in line with expectation that more massive planets spin faster. Beta Pictoris b's distance from its star is 9AU. At such distances the rotation of Jovian planets is not slowed by tidal effects.Tidal Evolution of Exoplanets, Alexandre C. M. Correia, Jacques Laskar, Chapter in Exoplanets, ed. S. Seager, published by University of Arizona Press, 2010 Beta Pictoris b is still warm and young and over the next hundreds of millions of years, it will cool down and shrink to about the size of Jupiter, and as it shrinks its equatorial rotation velocity will speed up to about 40km per second from its current 25 km per second. The images of Beta Pictoris b do not have high enough resolution to directly see details but doppler spectroscopy techniques can be used to reconstruct a rough map of the surface of a rotating body.Exoplanet Rotation Detected for the First Time, www.scientificamerican.com, Apr 30, 2014 |By Ron Cowen and Nature magazineImaging of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs, Ian J. M. Crossfield, (Submitted on 30 Apr 2014)
For most planets the rotation period and axial tilt (also called obliquity) are not known, but a large number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) and will probably have reached an equilibrium rotation that can be predicted.
Tidal effects are the result of forces acting on a body differing from one part of the body to another. For example the gravitational effect of a star varies with distance from one side of a planet to another. Also heat from a star creates a temperature gradient between the day and nightsides which is another source of tides. For example, on Earth, air pressure variations on the ground are affected more by temperature differences than gravitational ones.
Tides modify the rotation and orbit of planets until an equilibrium is reached. Whenever the rotation rate is slowed, there is an increase of the orbit semi-major axis due to the conservation of angular momentum. Most of the large moons in the Solar System, including the Moon, are tidally locked to their host planet; the same side of the moon is always facing the planet. This means the moons' rotation periods are synchronous with their orbital period. However when an orbit is eccentric, as is the case with many exoplanets' orbits of their host stars, there are equilibrium states such as spin-orbit resonances that are far more likely than synchronous rotation. A spin–orbit resonance is when the rotation period and the orbital period are in an integer ratio - this is called a commensurability. Non-resonant equilibriums such as the retrograde rotation of Venus can also occur when both gravitational and thermal atmospheric tides are both significant.
A synchronous tidal lock isn't necessarily particularly slow - there are planets with orbits that take only a few hours. 
Gravitational tides tend to reduce the axial tilt to zero but over a longer time-scale than the rotation rate reaches equilibrium. However, the presence of multiple planets in a system can cause axial tilt to be captured in a resonance called a Cassini state. There are small oscillations around this state and in the case of Mars these axial tilt variations are chaotic.
Hot Jupiters' close proximity to their host star means that their spin-orbit evolution is mostly due to the star's gravity and not the other effects. Hot Jupiters rotation rate is not thought to be captured into spin-orbit resonance due to way fluid-body reacts to tides, and therefore slows down to synchronous rotation if it is on a circular orbit or slows to a non-synchronous rotation if on an eccentric orbit. Hot Jupiters are likely to evolve towards zero axial tilt even if they had been in a Cassini state during planetary migration when they were further from their star. Hot Jupiters' orbits will become more circular over time, however the presence of other planets in the system on eccentric orbits, even ones as small as Earth and as far away as the habitable zone, can continue to maintain the eccentricity of the Hot Jupiter so that the length of time for tidal circularization can be billions instead of millions of years.
The rotation rate of planet HD 80606 b is predicted to be about 1.9 days. HD 80606 b avoids spin-orbit resonance because it is a gas giant. The eccentricity of its orbit means that it avoids becoming tidally locked.
The super-Earth Gliese 581 d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, performing two rotations about its axis during each orbit of its parent star. Therefore the day on Gliese 581 d should approximately be 67 Earth’s days long. The second likeliest resonant state for that planet is 3:2.

==Physical parameters==

===Mass===

When a planet is found by the radial-velocity method, its orbital inclination i is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to determine the true mass (M) of the planet, but rather gives a lower limit for its mass, M sini. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more-massive object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However, the probability of a small value of i (say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least double the observed lower limit) is relatively low (1−(√3)/2 ≈ 13%) and hence most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower limit.
If a planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of vision (i.e. i close to 90°), a planet can be detected through the transit method. The inclination will then be known, and the inclination combined with M sini from radial-velocity will give the  planet's true mass.
Also, astrometric observations and dynamical considerations in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's true mass. 
The mass of a transiting exoplanet can also be determined from the transmission spectrum of its atmosphere, as it can be used to constrain independently the atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and scale height.[tpl]cite journal|last=de Wit|first=Julien|author2=Seager, S.|title=Constraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy|journal=Science|date=19 December 2013|volume=342|issue=6165|pages=1473–1477|arxiv=1401.6181|doi=10.1126/science.1245450|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1473|pmid=24357312[/tpl]
Transit-timing variation can also be used to find planets' masses.Mass and Orbit Determination from Transit Timing Variations of Exoplanets, FREE ISSUE,  The Astrophysical Journal Volume 688 Number 1, David Nesvorný and Alessandro Morbidelli, 2008, ApJ 688 636, doi:10.1086/592230

===Radius, density and bulk composition===

Prior to recent results from the Kepler spacecraft most confirmed planets were gas giants comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they are most easily detected. However, the planets detected by Kepler are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.
If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be found. The planet's density can then be calculated. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, whereas planets of intermediate density are inferred to have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is inferred to be rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System.
Gaseous planets that are hot because they are close to their star or because they are still hot from their formation are expanded by the heat. For colder gas planets there is a maximum radius which is slightly larger than Jupiter which occurs when the mass reaches a few Jupiter-masses. Adding mass beyond this point causes the radius to shrink.Introduction to Exoplanets, Seager and Lissauer, Chapter in Exoplanets, edited by Sara Seager, University of Arizona Press, 2010Fundamental Planetary Science: Physics, Chemistry and Habitability, Jack J. Lissauer, Imke de Pater, Cambridge University Press, 16 Sep 2013, page 74
Even when taking heating from the star into account, many transiting exoplanets are much larger than expected given their mass, meaning that they have surprisingly low density.
See the magnetic field section for one possible explanation.

====Super-Earths vs mini-Neptunes====

If a planet has a radius and/or mass between that of Earth and Neptune then there is a question about whether the planet is rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune.
Above a certain radius planets seem to be gaseous. A radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1311.0329 |last1=Lopez |first1=E. D. |last2=Fortney |first2=J. J. |title=Understanding the Mass-Radius Relation for Sub-Neptunes: Radius as a  Proxy for Composition |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2013[/tpl]
Radii above a certain point are unlikely for rocky planets because adding more rocky material at this point causes the planet to compress under the weight instead of increasing the radius.
The discovery of the low-density Earth-mass planet KOI-314c shows that there is an overlapping range of masses in which both rocky planets and low-density planets occur.Earth-mass exoplanet is no Earth twin, Nature News, Ron Cowen, 06 January 2014 Low-mass low-density planets could be ocean planets or super-Earths with a remnant hydrogen atmosphere, or hot planets with a steam atmosphere, or mini-Neptunes with a hydrogen-helium atmosphere.http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/session/15518
Other possibilities for low-mass low-density planets are large atmospheres of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrogen.How to Distinguish between Cloudy Mini-Neptunes and Water/Volatile-Dominated Super-Earths, Björn Benneke, Sara Seager, 26 Jun 2013

====Massive solid planets====

It was thought there could not be rocky planets above 10–15 Earth masses because the amount of heavy elements in the protoplanetary disk is only about 1% that of hydrogen and helium so more massive objects would gather a lot of gas. However, the discovery of the Saturn-mass planet HD 149026 b with only two-thirds of Saturn's radius puts this expectation in doubt (it may have a rock–ice core of 60 Earth masses or more).Planetesimals To Brown Dwarfs: What is a Planet?, Gibor Basri, Michael E. Brown, (Submitted on 20 Aug 2006)
Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the protoplanetary disk would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high UV radiation and winds that could photoevaporate the gas in the disk leaving just the heavy elements.MASS-RADIUS RELATIONSHIPS FOR SOLID EXOPLANETS, S. Seager, M. Kuchner, C. A. Hier-Majumder, B. Militzer, February 1, 2008
For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU's working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.
Another way of forming massive solid planets is when a white dwarf in a close binary system loses material to a companion neutron star. The white dwarf can be reduced to planetary-mass, leaving just its crystallised carbon–oxygen core. A likely example of this is PSR J1719-1438 b.

===Shape===

When the size of a planet is described using its radius this is approximating the shape by a sphere. However the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles so that the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius making it closer to an oblate spheroid. The oblateness of transiting exoplanets will affect the transit light curves. At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that HD 189733b is less oblate than Saturn.Empirical Constraints on the Oblateness of an Exoplanet, Joshua A. Carter, Joshua N. Winn, (Submitted on 8 Dec 2009 (v1), last revised 30 Dec 2009 (this version, v2))
If the planet is close to its star, then gravitational tides will elongate the planet in the direction of the star, so that the planet will be closer to a triaxial ellipsoid.Distorted, non-spherical transiting planets: impact on the transit depth and on the radius determination, Jérémy Leconte, Dong Lai, Gilles Chabrier,(Submitted on 14 Jan 2011 (v1), last revised 10 Oct 2011 (this version, v2)) Because tidal deformation is along a line between the planet and the star, it is difficult to detect from transit photometry—it will have an order of magnitude less effect on the transit light curves than that caused by rotational deformation even in cases where the tidal deformation is larger than rotational deformation (such as is the case for tidally locked hot Jupiters). Material rigidity of rocky planets and rocky cores of gas planets will cause further deviations from the aforementioned shapes. Thermal tides caused by unevenly irradiated surfaces are another factor.Thermal Tides in Short Period Exoplanets, Phil Arras, Aristotle Socrates, (Submitted on 7 Jan 2009)

==Atmosphere==

As of February 2014, more than fifty transiting and five directly imaged exoplanet atmospheres have been observed,Exoplanetary Atmospheres, Nikku Madhusudhan (Cambridge), Heather Knutson (Caltech), Jonathan Fortney (UCSC), Travis Barman (U. Arizona), (Submitted on 5 Feb 2014) resulting in detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day–night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1005.4037 |last1=Seager |first1=S. |last2=Deming |first2=D. |title=Exoplanet Atmospheres |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2010[/tpl] Also, an atmosphere has been detected on the non-transiting hot Jupiter Tau Boötis b.[tpl]cite journal | title=Weighing the Non-transiting Hot Jupiter τ Boo b | url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/753/1/L25/fulltext/ | last1=Rodler | first1=F. | last2=Lopez-Morales | first2=M. | last3=Riba | first3=I. | display-authors=1 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume=753 | issue=1 | at=L25 | year=2012 | arxiv=1206.6197 | bibcode=2012ApJ...753L..25R | doi=10.1088/2041-8205/753/1/L25 [/tpl]
Spectroscopic measurements can be used to study a transiting planet's atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and scale height, and hence can be used to determine its mass.
Stellar light is polarized by atmospheric molecules; this could be detected with a polarimeter. HD 189733 b has been studied by polarimetry.
Extrasolar planets have phases similar to the phases of the Moon. By observing the exact variation of brightness with phase, astronomers can calculate atmospheric-particle sizes.

===Abiotic oxygen===

The processes of life result in a mixture of chemicals that are not in chemical equilibrium but there are also abiotic disequilibrium processes that need to be considered. The most robust atmospheric biosignature is often considered to be molecular oxygen O2 and its photochemical byproduct ozone O3. The photolysis of water H2O by UV rays followed by hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen can lead to a build-up of oxygen in planets close to their star undergoing runaway greenhouse effect. For planets in the habitable zone it was believed that water photolysis would be strongly limited by cold-trapping of water vapour in the lower atmosphere. However the extent of H2O cold-trapping depends strongly on the amount of non-condensible gases in the atmosphere such as nitrogen N2 and argon. In the absence of such gases the likelihood of build-up of oxygen also depends in complex ways on the planet’s accretion history, internal chemistry, atmospheric dynamics and orbital state. Therefore, oxygen on its own cannot be considered a robust biosignature.Abiotic oxygen-dominated atmospheres on terrestrial habitable zone planets, Robin Wordsworth, Raymond Pierrehumbert, (Submitted on 11 Mar 2014) The ratio of nitrogen and argon to oxygen could be detected by studying thermal phase curvesThermal phase curves of nontransiting terrestrial exoplanets 1.

==Climate and weather==

===Meteorology===

==Surface==

===Surface composition===

Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with transmission spectroscopy. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.Theoretical Spectra of Terrestrial Exoplanet Surfaces, Renyu Hu, Bethany L. Ehlmann, Sara Seager, (Submitted on 6 Apr 2012)

===Surface temperature===

One can estimate the temperature of an exoplanet based on the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220 °C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown albedo, and because factors such as the greenhouse effect may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet HD 189733b has been found to have an average temperature of 1205±9 K (932±9 °C) on its dayside and 973±33 K (700±33 °C) on its nightside.

Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.Super-Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal, Charles Q. Choi, SPACE.com, November 22, 2012 02:01pm ET,
Hot Jupiters have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and the planet's magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.Stellar Magnetic Fields as a Heating Source for Extrasolar Giant Planets, D. Buzasi, (Submitted on 6 Feb 2013)

===Plate tectonics===

On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water; however, in 2007 two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger super-earths[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.015|title=Convection scaling and subduction on Earth and super-Earths|year=2009|last1=Valencia|first1=Diana|last2=O'Connell|first2=Richard J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=286|issue=3–4|page=492|bibcode = 2009E&PSL.286..492V [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.07.029|title=Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth|year=2011|last1=Van Heck|first1=H.J.|last2=Tackley|first2=P.J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=310|issue=3–4|page=252|bibcode = 2011E&PSL.310..252V [/tpl] with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1029/2007GL030598 |title=Geological consequences of super-sized Earths |year=2007 |last1=O'Neill |first1=C. |last2=Lenardic |first2=A. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=19|bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3419204O [/tpl] and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.[tpl]Cite journal |first1=Diana |last1=Valencia |first2=Richard J. |last2=O'Connell |first3=Dimitar D |last3=Sasselov |date=November 2007 |title=Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=670 |issue=1 |pages=L45–L48 |doi=10.1086/524012 |arxiv=0710.0699 |ref=CITEREFValenciaO'ConnellSasselov2007 |bibcode=2007ApJ...670L..45V[/tpl]
If super-earths have more than 80 times as much water as Earth then they become ocean planets with all land completely submerged. However, if there is less water than this limit, then the deep water cycle will move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to exist.Super Earths Likely To Have Both Oceans and Continents, astrobiology.com, Source: Northwestern University, Posted January 7, 2014 11:55 AMWater Cycling Between Ocean and Mantle: Super-Earths Need Not be Waterworlds, Nicolas B.

===Rings===

The star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 is orbited by an object that is circled by a ring system much larger than Saturn's rings. However, the mass of the object is not known; it could be a brown dwarf or low-mass star instead of a planet.Scientists Discover a Saturn-like Ring System Eclipsing a Sun-like Star, Space Daily, Jan 13, 2012
The brightness of optical images of Fomalhaut b could be due to starlight reflecting off a circumplanetary ring system with a radius between 20 to 40 times that of Jupiter's radius, about the size of the orbits of the Galilean moons.
The rings of the Solar System's gas giants are aligned with their planet's equator. However for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet's orbital plane around the star. A planet's innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet's equator so that if the planet has a tilted rotational axis, then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets that Reside Inside the Ice Line, Hilke E.

==Habitability==

===Habitable zone===

The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet. Not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star so that the habitable zone can be at different distances. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.Alien Life More Likely on 'Dune' Planets, 09/01/11, Charles Q. Choi, Astrobiology MagazineHabitable Zone Limits for Dry Planets, Yutaka Abe, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Norman H. Sleep, and Kevin J. Zahnle. Astrobiology. June 2011, 11(5): 443–460.

Abbot, Eric R. Switzer, (Submitted on 5 Feb 2011 (v1), last revised 2 Jun 2011 (this version, v2)) In an earlier era of the universe the temperature of the cosmic microwave background would allow any rocky planets that existed to have liquid water on their surface regardless of their distance from a star.The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe, Abraham Loeb (Harvard), (Submitted on 2 Dec 2013) Jupiter-like planets might not be habitable, but they could have habitable moons.

===Ice ages and snowball states===

The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets will be completely frozen but even planets well inside the HZ can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling then this creates more ice but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen this stops carbon dioxide weathering resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a greenhouse effect which unfreezes the planet again. Planets with a large axial tilt[ref]

===Tidal heating===

If a planet has an eccentric orbit then tidal heating can provide another source of energy besides stellar irradiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water (Tidal Venus). Tides also circularize orbits over time so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits.Tidal Venuses: Triggering a Climate Catastrophe via Tidal Heating, Rory Barnes, Kristina Mullins, Colin Goldblatt, Victoria S. Meadows, James F. Kasting, Rene Heller, (Submitted on 22 Mar 2012 (v1), last revised 27 Nov 2012 (this version, v2)) Eccentric planets further out than the radiative habitable zone would still have frozen surfaces but the tidal heating could create a subsurface ocean similar to Europa's.Superhabitable Worlds, René Heller (1), John Armstrong (2) ((1) McMaster University, Dept. of Physics & Astronomy, Hamilton (ON), Canada, (2) Weber State University, Dept. of Physics, Ogden (UT), USA), (Submitted on 10 Jan 2014) In some planetary systems, such as in the Upsilon Andromedae system, the eccentricity of orbits is maintained or even periodically varied by perturbations from other planets in the system.

===Potentially habitable planets===

Data from the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC) suggests that, of the 859 exoplanets which have been confirmed as of [tpl]nowrap|3 January 2013[/tpl], nine potentially habitable planets have been found, and the same source predicts that there may be 30 habitable extrasolar moons around confirmed planets.[tpl]cite web|title=Habitable Exoplanets Catalog|url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog|work=Planetary Habitabiliy Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo[/tpl] The HEC also states that of the 15,874 transit threshold crossing events (TCE) which have recurred more than three times (thus making them more likely to be actual planets), discovered by the Kepler probe up until 3 January 2013, that 262 planets (1.65%) have the potential to be habitable, with an additional 35 "warm jovian" planets which may have habitable natural satellites.[tpl]cite press_release | url=http://phl.upr.edu/press-releases/mygoditsfullofplanetstheyshouldhavesentapoet | title=My God, it's full of planets!

===Earth-size planets===

In November 2013 it was announced that 22±8% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone.
Kepler-186f is the first Earth-sized planet in a habitable zone to have been discovered, a 1.1 Earth radius planet in the habitable zone of a red dwarf, announced in April 2014.
In February 2013, researchers calculated that up to 6% of small red dwarfs may have planets with Earth-like properties. This suggests that the closest "alien Earth" to the Solar System could be 13 light-years away. The estimated distance increases to 21 light-years when a 95 percent confidence interval is used.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.space.com/19667-closest-alien-earth-exoplanets.html | title=Closest 'Alien Earth' May Be 13 Light-Years Away | work=Space.com | date=6 February 2013 | agency=TechMediaNetwork | accessdate=7 February 2013 | author=Howell, Elizabeth[/tpl] In March 2013 a revised estimate based on a more accurate consideration of the size of the habitable zone around red dwarfs gave an occurrence rate of 50% for Earth-size planets in the HZ of red dwarfs.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kopparapu |first=Ravi kumar |title=A revised estimate of the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones around kepler m-dwarfs |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=March 2013 |year=2013 |arxiv=1303.2649 |bibcode=2013ApJ...767L...8K|volume=767|pages=L8|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/767/1/L8[/tpl]

===Life===

Various estimates have been made as to how many planets might support simple or even intelligent life. However, these estimates have large uncertainties, because the complexity of cellular life may make biogenesis highly improbable. For example, Dr. Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Science estimates there may be a "hundred billion" terrestrial planets in the Milky Way, many with simple life forms. He further believes there could be thousands of civilizations in the Milky Way. Recent work by Duncan Forgan of Edinburgh University has also tried to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. The research suggested there could be thousands of them, although presently there is little scientific evidence for extraterrestrial life. These estimates do not account for the unknown probability of the origins of life, but if life originates, it may spread among habitable planets by natural or directed panspermia.

==Planetary systems==

===Orbital dynamics===

Planetary systems can be categorized according to their orbital dynamics as resonant, non-resonant-interacting, hierarchical, or some combination of these. In resonant systems the orbital periods of the planets are in integer ratios. The Kepler-223 system contains four planets in a 8:6:4:3 orbital resonance.[tpl]cite web|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|title=Kepler Finds Bizarre Systems|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/117984/20110302/kepler-finds-strange-worlds-fastest-planet.htm|work=International Business Times|publisher=International Business Times Inc.|accessdate=2 March 2011[/tpl]
In interacting systems the planets orbits are close enough together that they perturb the orbital parameters. The Solar System could be described as weakly interacting. In strongly interacting systems Kepler's laws do not hold.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1006.3834 |last1=Fabrycky |first1=Daniel C. |title=Non-Keplerian Dynamics |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2010[/tpl]
In hierarchical systems the planets are arranged so that the system can be gravitationally considered as a nested system of two-bodies, e.g. in a star with a close-in hot jupiter with another gas giant much further out, the star and hot jupiter form a pair that appears as a single object to another planet that is far enough out.
A system can contain bodies of different dynamical types, e.g. the Galilean moons of Jupiter where Io, Europa, and Ganymede are in resonance but Callisto is too distant to be part of this resonance.
Other, as yet unobserved, orbital possibilities include:
