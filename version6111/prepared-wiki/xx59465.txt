Another important site, which lies in the Christian neighborhood, is the tomb of Rabbi Joshua of Sakhnin.Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, Richard Bauckham He is buried in gigantic stone coffin. In the past, the local people were scared whenever they passed this grave during the night, while others used to kiss its walls and ask the dead Rabbi to heal them and their relatives because it was believed that the Rabbi used to heal people from certain diseases.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Another famous shrine is al Sheik Obeid's shrine, which is very close to the Shaknin's guesthouse.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] This shrine was dedicated to al Sheik Abdalla Ibrahim Khalaili.

Another important site, which lies in the southeast of the town, is called The Spring which served as the main source of drinking water for the people of Sakhnin decades ago.

==History==

Settlement at Sakhnin dates back 3,500 years to its first mention in 1479 BCE by Thutmose II, whose ancient Egyptian records mention it as a centre for production of indigo dye. Sargon II also makes mention of it as Suginin.
It was mentioned as Sogane, a town fortified in 66, by Josephus.[tpl]cite book | author = Yoram Tsafrir, Leah Di Segni and Judith Green | title = Tabula Imperii Romani: Judaea, Palaestina | publisher = Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities | location = Jerusalem | year = 1994 | page = 235[/tpl]
Known as Sikhnin or Sikhni, meaning "home of the labourers" in Aramaic, and Sukhsikha, meaning "produces oil" in Hebrew, the town was known for Jewish scholars like the rabbi Joshua of Sakhnin in the periods of the Mishna and Gemara. His grave is known in Arabic as Nabi as-Sideiq, and was a focus of pilgrimage from the Middle Ages through the present. The town continued to flourish as Hellenist Sogne into the period of Roman conquest.
Annexed to the Ummayad Caliphate after the Battle of Yarmouk, it came under brief crusader rule as Zakkanin until retaken by Saladin and the Ayyubid Dynasty following the Battle of Hattin where it remained in Muslim hands under the Mamluks, Dhaher al-Omar, and the Ottomans, until Ottoman Syria was occupied by the British Empire after World War I.
In 1596, Sakhnin appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Akka of the Liwa of Tabariyya.  It had a population of 66 Muslim households and 8 bachelors.  It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, cotton, and a water mill.[tpl]cite book | author = Wolf-Dieter Hütteroth and Kamal Abdulfattah | title = Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century | year = 1977 | publisher = Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5.

In the late 1870s, Conder and Kitchener described Sakhnin as follows. "A large village of stone and mud, amid fine olive-groves, with a small mosque. The water supply is from a large pool about half a mile to the south-east. The inhabitants are Moslems and Christians, and in 1859 numbered 1,100, and cultivated 100 feddans, according to Consul Rogers." [tpl]cite book | author = C. R. Conder and H. H.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Sakhnin surrendered to Israeli forces on July 18, 1948, during Operation Dekel, but was re-captured by Arab forces shortly afterwards. It finally fell without battle during Operation Hiram, 29–31 October 1948. Many of the inhabitants fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers.Morris, Benny (1987) The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947-1949. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-33028-9. p.226 The town remained under Martial Law until 1966.
