Andrew Swallow (born 2 June 1987) is an Australian Rules footballer and the current captain of the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

==AFL career==

===Recruitment===

He was North Melbourne's third round draft selection in the 2005 AFL Draft, number 43 overall, from the East Fremantle Football Club in the WAFL.

===2006: Debut===

He received a nomination for the NAB Rising Star for his performance against Geelong in Round 17, 2006 when he managed 25 possessions and a goal.

===2007===

Swallow's form improved during the 2007 season, consistently gaining high numbers of disposals each week. This culminated in the spectacular 1-point win over Melbourne in Round 9 in which he scored the winning goal.Fantasy goal gives Roos a dream win

===2008===

Swallow played the first 3 games in 2008, before being sent back to the VFL to work on his outside run and spread from the stoppages. After some positives performances at North Ballarat Roosters, he injured his ankle during a game and missed 7 weeks. On his return to the VFL he went onto become a crucial member of the Roosters premiership team.

===2009: Syd Barker Medallist===

But he was back to his best in 2009 returning to the side to be one of North's finest throughout the season. His disposal has notably improved, and he has worked on all aspects of his game to play every game, and is now recognised as one of the best tacklers and clearance players in the North Melbourne side, and the AFL. On October 2, 2009, Swallow was awarded the Syd Barker Medal by North Melbourne for being the club's best and fairest player for the year.Swallow named best in AFL for Kangaroos

He had another terrific season in 2010 playing all 22 games for the second consecutive season and finishing just one vote behind Brent Harvey and Brady Rawlings for the Syd Barker Medal.
