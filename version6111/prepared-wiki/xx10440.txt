The game belongs to the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was released to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross.[tpl]cite web | date=1999-07-24 | title=Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=1 July 2006 [/tpl] It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda.
Radical Dreamers and other Satellaview titles were planned to be released at the Akihabara electronics district of Tokyo. Square also tried to integrate it into the Japanese PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger as an Easter egg.[tpl]cite web |date=November 1999 | title=Procyon Studio: Interview with Masato Kato | url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/friends/kato.html | work=Cocoebiz.com | accessdate=3 June 2007 [/tpl] Writer and director Masato Kato halted both releases, unhappy with the quality of his work. Though the game was never officially released abroad, ROM hackers completed an English fan translation in 2003.[tpl]cite web | author=Home of the Underdogs staff | title=Entry: Radical Dreamers | url=http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=4893 | work=Home of the Underdogs | accessdate=25 January 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070115213847/http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=4893| archivedate = January 15, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=2003-04-15 | title=Chrono Trigger 2: Radical Dreamers | url=http://radicaldreamers.sourceforge.net/ | work=Demiforce | accessdate=2 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060429004050/http://demiforce.parodius.com/home.html |archivedate = April 29, 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after a certain number of play-throughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay consists of text-based scenarios presented to the player through the narration of the main character, Serge. As the narrative progresses, the game presents a list of possible actions and the player must choose his or her course. Depending on the choices made, the player may enter a new area, be presented with a new situation or character, or have to choose again if the previous selection was incorrect. In combat with enemies, the player must select from options such as "Fight", "Magic", "Run", and often more complex situational commands like "Run my knife into the goblin's chest!" or "Quickly slash at its hand!".[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: Not a single moment after I leap back, the iron ball smashes into the stone floor! I can't rely on this little knife to parry those huge morning stars. There's no way I'll survive, fighting like that! / Run my knife into the goblin's chest! / Quickly slash at its hand![/tpl] Some decisions must be made before an invisible timer runs out; in combat, hesitation results in injury or death. Serge's health is tracked by an invisible point count, restored by various events (such as finding a potion). The game also tracks Kid's affection for Serge, influenced by battles and scripted events.[tpl]cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Radical Dreamers Love / Point System | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Radical_Dreamers_Love_/_Point_System.html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=25 January 2008 [/tpl] Her feelings determine whether Serge survives the story's climactic fight.
Radical Dreamers features minimal graphics and animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and sounds. Like other Chrono games, Radical Dreamers contains a variant of New Game + mode. Only one scenario is available on the first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to Chrono Trigger.

==Characters and story==

Radical Dreamers features three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who seek out treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance three years ago in a remote town.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: It's been something like three years since Kid and I met. Back then I was a drifter, wandering wherever my music led me. During my stay in the remote town of Regiorra, I ended up running into a girl who later joined me, leading to the beginning of all this.[/tpl] Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: I take a good look at myself and wonder if I've got any of that adventurer's spirit still left in me. I sit and look at my trusty knife collecting dust on the mantle above my fireplace, and think to myself, my days of traveling can't be over just yet. That old, familiar feeling of wonderment ensnares me as I vow to pack my bags tomorrow and set out for some new, exotic land, letting fate once again guide me wherever it wishes.[/tpl] Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: Not even seventeen years old, already she's widely renowned as a top professional. To make matters worse, she's cute, devilishly stylish, and has a sparkling  personality. And boy, can she cook... if you ask her, that is. Well, to be completely honest, she has her share of problems as well. She likes to think of herself as a kind of Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but that's just not the case.[/tpl] Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: The top half of his face is covered with a mask at all times. I've never even seen what he really looks like. At times, it seems as though I'm hanging around someone from another world—traveling with this pack is definitely an interesting experience. Kid's quiet about her past too, but it's like I know her entire life story compared to how little I know about Magil.[/tpl] Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: This is the first time I've ever seen his true face. Even for a guy like me, I'm taken aback by his looks. His hair sways in the moonlight, as his piercing blue eyes survey the environment below. His beauty is different than a woman's... there's some sort of a fierce, intrepid quality about him.[/tpl] They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Serge: Tonight, our goal is Lord Lynx's most prized possession, a scarlet jewel known as the Frozen Flame. Besides being priceless, some say this beautiful stone harbors some sort of mystical power. They say many people have sought after the Flame, but none have been victorious in stealing it. Viper Manor has claimed many lives...[/tpl] It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Magil: The Acacia Dragoons. They were once an elite force serving General Viper, a powerful man who used to rule the western territory of Gerzbuehle. They were defeated more than ten years ago, by the very hands of Lord Lynx. By the looks of things, we have apparently found their resting place.[/tpl]
Following Kid, the group infiltrates Viper Manor on the night of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while unraveling the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Magil: The Frozen Flame is more than just an object. It's not of this world. It descended from the heavens long ago, part of a huge meteorite. Once, there lived a people who sought to harness its power, hoping to tap into their yet unknown potential. And so, it became a treasure of great importance and dreams.[/tpl] The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality.[tpl]cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote=Magus: Behold. Everything's at the bottom of the sea. Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people. I once lived there... But I was another person then. ... / Magus: Unimaginable is the power of Lavos. Anyone who dares to oppose...it...meets certain doom.[/tpl] Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.
The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains the upper hand after trapping Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Lynx: Surely you remember, the one you received from your sister, all those years ago... the priceless keepsake you carry with you dearly, even now...The Chrono Trigger![/tpl] With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power.[tpl]cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote=QUEEN: Schala, raise the power of the Mammon Machine to its limit! / SCHALA: ...... / QUEEN: Schala! You dare to disobey me?! / SCHALA: All right, mother...[/tpl] As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt for her role in the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Kid: Long ago, in a far off kingdom, lived a girl. Because of her power, the kingdom had come to an end, crumbling under its own weight. Many became engulfed in the temporal vortex that was created, never to be heard from again......But not the girl. She lived on, enduring a much sadder fate... Running from her past and fearing her future, she wanted nothing more than to be swallowed up in the surging waves of the vortex of time...Hating what she'd done, refusing what she'd said or heard, to simply continue living was her curse. But the stone, It had other plans for her...Turning back the hands of her clock, scattering her memories, she was granted another chance. Since the precious stone was in her possession, she carried with her all its will and power. And so, she was born into this era, returning to reality as a mere infant...[/tpl] It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger.[tpl]cite web | date=2000-10-17 | title=GamePro: Interview with Chrono Cross Developers | url=http://gamepro.org/sony/psx/games/features/7033.shtml | work=Gamepro | accessdate=8 February 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/GamePro_Interview.html | archivedate=2005[/tpl] Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen.[tpl]cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=Square Co. | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | year=2005 | platform =Satellaview  |quote=Kid: Lucca's Chrono Trigger was lost... we couldn't even get our hand on the Frozen Flame... but, it's okay... it's all okay, because tonight, in my heart, a shiny new treasure was born, Serge... the single most valuable unstealable treasure in the entire world." / "Knowing who I am... It's bigger than all this... bigger than Lynx, bigger than the Frozen Flame... and, nothing can take that away... not as long as I'm alive..."[/tpl] She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.
Other scenarios are available after players complete the first. These include both humorous and serious variations of the main plot.[tpl]cite web | year=2006 | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Radical Dreamers Condensed Plot Summary | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Radical_Dreamers_Condensed_Plot_Summary.html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=2 July 2006 [/tpl]

==Music==

The music of Radical Dreamers was written by composer Yasunori Mitsuda, the artist who scored Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. The soundtrack includes several ambient pieces, including the sound of water running in a fountain and wind accompanied by strings. Players can listen to the game's songs by accessing a hidden menu in the "Gil: Caught Between Love and Adventure" scenario.[tpl]cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Easter Eggs (Radical Dreamers) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Easter_Eggs_%28Radical_Dreamers%29.html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=25 January 2008 [/tpl] The tracks were never officially named by Square, though Demiforce provided names for the Radical Dreamers fan translation. They include:
 
 
Several themes and musical patterns were later adapted for Chrono Cross on the suggestion of director Masato Kato; many appear unchanged except for new instrumentation. Appearing in Chrono Cross are "Gale", "Frozen Flame", "Viper Manor", "Far Promise ~ Dream Shore" (as part of "On the Beach of Dreams ~ Another World", "The Dream that Time Dreams"), "The Girl who Stole the Stars", and "Epilogue ~ Dream Shore" (as part of "Jellyfish Sea"). Mitsuda also titled the game's ending song "Radical Dreamers -Le Trésor Interdit-".

==Development==

Masato Kato wrote Radical Dreamers after Chrono Triggers release, feeling that Trigger concluded with "unfinished business".[tpl]cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Ultimania_Developer_Interviews.html | pages=476–477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-925075-73-X[/tpl] He composed the main story and drafted the concepts for the sub-scenarios, leaving them to be completed by his peers. He allowed Makoto Shimamoto to write the entire "Kid and the Sunflower" segment, later joking that he "avoided having any part in that episode," while Miwa Shoda was in charge of the "Shadow Realm and the Goddess of Death" segment.[tpl]cite web | title=自己紹介文 | url=http://shoda-miwa.cocolog-nifty.com/about.html | work=LevelScript - Shoda Miwa Official Site | accessdate=1 June 2010 | language=Japanese[/tpl] Kato remarked that his "savage feelings" from Chrono Triggers hectic development manifested in Kid's "unusually nihilistic attitude". He explained his approach towards the project in 1999:

Kato's team completed Radical Dreamers in only three months under a rushed production schedule, prompting him to label the game "unfinished" in an interview for the Ultimania Chrono Cross guide.[tpl]cite web|date=2000-12-18|first=Yasunori|last=Mitsuda|title=Chrono Cross OST Liner Notes| url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Music_(Chrono_Cross)|work=Chrono Compendium|accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl] He regretted that the schedule hampered the quality of his work, and explained that the connections to Chrono Trigger were evoked towards the end of the project:

==Fan translation and notability==

In April 2003, the ROM hacking group Demiforce released a fan translation rendering Radical Dreamers in English. The patch works by modifying the ROM image of Dreamers used for playing console-based video games on personal computers through emulation. The ability to save games was not enabled with the first patch, and some minor typos were left in, later remedied by successive releases. On Christmas Day 2005, Demiforce and Radical R released the final version (1.4) of the translation, which fixed remaining minor bugs.[tpl]cite web | year=2006 | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Patches (Radical Dreamers) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Patches_(Radical_Dreamers).html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=2 July 2006 [/tpl] The French team Terminus Traduction made a French translation patch soon after.[tpl]cite web | date=2004-09-06 | author=Terminus Traduction | title=French Translation | url=http://terminus.romhack.net/index.php?page=jv&projet=radical | work=Terminus Traduction | accessdate=2 July 2006 [/tpl] Masato Kato did not perceive significant demand to include Radical Dreamers as a bonus with the release of Chrono Trigger DS, and omitted it to preserve continuity between Trigger and Cross.[tpl]cite book | year=2009 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Trigger Ultimania | page=581 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Ultimania | isbn=978-4-7575-2469-9[/tpl] He expressed concern in 2009 over re-releasing Radical Dreamers "as-is", citing a need to revise the work.
A reviewer for Home of the Underdogs lauded the game's excellent writing and the "superb" English translation patch, noting that the "interesting plot" would appeal to fantasy fans if they could stomach the limited interactivity. Having never played a Chrono game prior, the reviewer stated, "I was still able to follow the story and be drawn into the world of colorful characters." While praising the replay value afforded by the extra scenarios, the critic derided the random battles of Radical Dreamers, writing that "RPG-style random combat doesn't translate well to a text-only medium." The website awarded Dreamers "Top Dog" status, and the game maintains a voter score of 8.95 out of 10.
Radical Dreamers preceded Chrono Cross, a full role-playing video game sequel to Chrono Trigger. Masato Kato cited the desire to "redo Radical Dreamers properly" as the genesis of Cross, attributing the latter's serious atmosphere to the influence of Dreamers. Kato's desire to finish the story of the characters Kid and Serge principally shaped the plot of Cross. Chrono Cross borrowed certain thematic elements, story points, characters, music, and objects introduced in Radical Dreamers—including the infiltration of Viper Manor, the Frozen Flame, the name Radical Dreamers for Kid's thievery, and the characters of Kid, Lynx, and Serge (who became a non-speaking protagonist).[tpl]cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Serge | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Serge.html | work=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=17 January 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=1999-07-20 | author=Yukiyoshi Ike Sato | title=Radical Dreamers - The Real Chrono Trigger 2? | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/chronocross/news.html?sid=2450838 | work=Gamespot | accessdate=17 January 2008 [/tpl] Though these characters and items were not presented in the same context, their general traits survived the transition. Gil, confirmed by Kato to be Magus, was also going to be featured in Chrono Cross. This idea was scrapped due to difficulties in representing the story of Magus among the game's numerous other characters; the unrelated, enigmatic magician Guile was created instead. Since the release of Chrono Cross, Radical Dreamers is considered an alternate continuity of the Chrono series. Chrono Cross addressed this through an easter egg hinting that Radical Dreamers took place in a different dimension. In the English version of Chrono Cross, this easter egg refers to Gil as "Magil".[tpl]cite video game | title =Chrono Cross | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Electronic Arts | date=2000-08-15 | platform =PlayStation  |quote=Kid: Radical Dreamers...!? And me name's on here, too! What the bloody hell is goin' on? ... / Kid: ......This seems to be an archive from a different time than our own. Aside from the two worlds we already know about...there may be other worlds and times which exist...[/tpl] Kato intended Dreamers and Cross to prompt players to pursue their personal dreams in life. A new Chrono series game has not been made due to the difficulty of reuniting the splintered Cross development team, some of which continue to work on Final Fantasy XI[tpl]cite web | date=2002-01-31 | title=Interview vidéo Final Fantasy III | url=http://www.jeux-france.com/news18999.html | work=Jeux-France.com | accessdate=2007-02-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Adam Riley | date=2002-02-01 | title=No FFXI on Wii, FF Anniversary Projects on Nintendo Systems, Chrono Update & Much More! | url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/6729/1/ | work=Cubed3.com | accessdate=2007-02-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=2003-05-14 | author=Jeremy Dunham | title=E3 2003: Final Fantasy XI Developer Interview | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/402/402807p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=23 December 2006 [/tpl] and Final Fantasy XIV, while others left Square Enix (then Square) after the completion of Chrono Cross to form Monolith Soft. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda stressed that "there are a lot of politics involved" in the creation of a new game, and that Masato Kato should participate in development.[tpl]cite web | author=Yasunori Mitsuda | date=2008-01-28 | title=Radical Dreamer: Yasunori Mitsuda Interview from 1UP.com | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3162780 | work=1UP.com | accessdate=2008-02-08[/tpl]
