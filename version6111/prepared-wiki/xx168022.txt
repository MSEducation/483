Kooragang is the northernmost and largest suburb of the city of Newcastle, in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. Dominated by Kooragang Island, the eastern part of the suburb is primarily industrial, while the western part of the suburb consists of nature reserves.[tpl]DoL suburb image|name=Kooragang|codename=same|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] Covering an area of [tpl]convert|35.4|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on[/tpl], it has a tiny permanent population. At the 2011 census, the population of Kooragang and industrial areas in neighbouring [tpl]NSWcity|Mayfield North[/tpl] and [tpl]NSWcity|Carrington[/tpl] was only 18.

==Geography==

Kooragang extends from [tpl]NSWcity|Stockton[/tpl] in the southeast, to the eastern bridge at [tpl]NSWcity|Hexham[/tpl]Although known as the "Hexham bridge", there are actually two bridges crossing the Hunter River. Both are in the suburb of [tpl]NSWcity|Tarro[/tpl] with the north and south ends of the bridges in [tpl]NSWcity|Tomago[/tpl] and Hexham respectively. in the northwest, a distance of [tpl]convert|12.4|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Except for a small portion of land in Hexham, the north and south arms of the Hunter River forms Kooragang's borders. At its greatest, the suburb is approximately [tpl]convert|3.8|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] from southwest – northeast. Vehicular access to Kooragang is via three bridges. From [tpl]NSWcity|Mayfield West[/tpl] the Tourle St bridge is the primary access to Kooragang, Stockton and Port Stephens from [tpl]NSWcity|Newcastle[/tpl] suburbs. In the east of the suburb, the "Stockton Bridge" connects Kooragang to Stockton. Access to the western part of the suburb is via the Ash Island bridge at Hexham.
Kooragang is generally low and flat, with some build-up in the industrial area in the eastern part of the suburb, on Kooragang Island.

==History==

Kooragang is dominated by Kooragang Island, which was created by reclaiming land, combining a number of smaller islands in the Hunter River estuary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/A-history-of-Ash-Island|title=A history of Ash Island|first=Fran|last=Dorey|work=australianmuseum.net.au|publisher=Australian Museum|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] The original islands were separated by mud flats and various channels and were first explored and surveyed by Europeans in 1801. Larger islands included Ash Island, Upper Moscheto, Moscheto Island, Dempsey Island, and Spit Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coalriver.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/kooragang-island-in-1871|title=Kooragang Island in 1871|work=coalriver.wordpress.com|publisher=Coal River Working Party|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl]
Ash Island was the largest of the islands, named because of the Ash trees that grew upon it. By 1821, much of Ash and other timber on the island had been harvested. In 1827 Alexander Scott was granted [tpl]convert|1036|ha|acre|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of land there. After settling on the island in 1831, it grew as a community with many visitors. The original wooden bridge linking the island to the mainland was eventually replaced with a concrete bridge that is still used today. Fifty families lived on the island until it was devastated by the 1955 Hunter Valley floods. By the 1960s, industrial development closer to Newcastle resulted in a land reclamation scheme that combined the smaller islands into what is now Kooragang Island. The western part of Kooragang island, which is now home to the Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project, is still known as Ash Island.

===Coal exports===

The eastern and more well-known part of Kooragang Island is primarily a coal export port.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/about_newcastle/city_and_suburbs/suburbs/kooragang_island|title=Kooragang Island|work=Newcastle City Council website|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] It was established in 1984 with a capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwcs.com.au/pages/terminals/kooragang.php|title=Kooragang Coal Terminal|publisher=Port Waratah Coal Services|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] By 2013 the capacity had been increased to 120 million tonnes per annum. In July 2013 a record high of 10.3 million tonnes of coal was processed through the port of Newcastle, with 83 of the 114 ships being loaded at the Kooragang terminal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1680562/coal-exports-at-a-record-high|title=Coal exports at a record high|first=Matt|last=Carr|newspaper=The Newcastle Herald|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl]
Transport of coal to Kooragang Island from Hunter valley coal mines is achieved via the Sandgate Flyover, with coal trains being moved through the port by a balloon loop.

===Other industries===

In addition to coal exports, many other industries exist on Kooragang Island, some having existed there since before the coal export port was established. Industries include Mountain Industries, which operates a bitumen plant, Blue Circle Southern Cement, SimsMetal recyclers and Orica Kooragang, which manufactures agricultural fertiliser and explosives for the mining industry. Orica Kooragang opened in 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orica.com/Locations/Asia-Pacific/Australia/Kooragang-Island/Operations/History#.UptESid35PY|title=History – Orica Kooragang Island|work=orica.com|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl]

===Electricity generation===

A single 600 kW wind turbine was installed on the island between Cormorant Road and the Hunter River in 1997, generating enough power for 150 homes per year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergy.energyaustralia.com.au/renewableenergy_eaownedoperated.html|title=Renewable energy generation (EA owned/operated)|work=EnergyAustralia website|publisher=EnergyAustralia|accessdate=23 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210073540/http://www.renewableenergy.energyaustralia.com.au/renewableenergy_eaownedoperated.html|archivedate=10 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1539563/kooragang-wind-turbine-future-in-spin|title=Kooragang wind turbine future in spin|first=Matthew|last=Kelly|newspaper=The Newcastle Herald|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] However, its future is in question because it sits on land that may be needed for a future ship turning basin.
