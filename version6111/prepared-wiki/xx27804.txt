===Posthumous honours===

In December 2009, Robson was posthumously awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award, for the "gentlemanly qualities he showed throughout his career as a player and coach".  All English football league matches held a one minute's applause in his memory at the beginning of the 2009–10 season.
The Football League gave Newcastle United and Ipswich Town special dispensation to wear special commemorative kits for their Championship match on 26 September 2009 at Portman Road, in aid of Sir Bobby's Foundation.  At half-time during this match, the North Stand of Portman Road was renamed the Sir Bobby Robson Stand.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1207417/Ipswich-unveil-Sir-Bobby-Robson-Stand-Town-beloved-Newcastle-United.html |work=Daily Mail | location = London | accessdate =20 October 2011 | date = 18 August 2009 | title = Ipswich to unveil 'Sir Bobby Robson Stand' when Town take on his beloved Newcastle United[/tpl]
The first anniversary of Robson's death on 31 July 2010 was marked with a ceremony and pre-season friendly match at Newcastle's St James' Park, between two of his former clubs Newcastle United and PSV Eindhoven, involving Robson's PSV captain Stan Valckx presenting a PSV shirt to the club.
In July 2010, plans were unveiled for a memorial garden to Robson to be built in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on Gallowgate street close to the Newcastle United stadium St James' Park. Work began on the site in November 2010, with an expected completion of Spring 2011. The garden is to cover 400 square meters, and feature a tiered seating area and sculpted stone plinths reflecting aspects of his life and work. The area is also to host a 400 square metre memorial garden to Sir Bobby Robson, with work beginning in November 2010, to be opened in Spring 2011.
With a keen interest in cricket as well as football, Robson was to have replaced Mike Gatting as President of the Lord's Taverners charity and cricket club in 2007, but this was prevented by his ill-health. After his death, the club held a dinner in his honour, as the "The best President we never had".
In March 2011, the East Coast train operating company named one of its Class 91 electric locomotives Sir Bobby Robson, unveiled at Newcastle Central Station by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer. Similarly, in December 2011, the Port of Tyne Authority named its new work boat the Sir Bobby Robson.  On 6 May 2012, a statue of Robson created by sculptor Tom Maley was unveiled at St James' Park before a 2–0 defeat to eventual champions Manchester City.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united/9228429/Bobby-Robson-statue-to-be-unveiled-by-Newcastle-United-at-St-James-Park.html |work=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate =6 May 2012 | date = 26 April 2012 | title = Bobby Robson statue to be unveiled by Newcastle United at St James' Park | location=London[/tpl]  On 16 July 2013, marking the 150th anniversary celebrations of the FA, the FA designated 10 August as the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, celebrated as a day to celebrate the national game.[tpl]cite web| title = National Football Day| | quote = The Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day will take place on 10 August 2013 | publisher = FA.com | date = 16 July 2013 | url = http://www.thefa.com/News/2013/jan/fa-150-national-football-day| accessdate = 16 July 2013 | archiveurl =  | archivedate = [/tpl]
