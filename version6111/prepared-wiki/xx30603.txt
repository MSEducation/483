==Geography==

The Global South refers to the less socially and economically developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports."[tpl]cite book |last=Mimiko |first=Oluwafemi |title=Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business |year=2012 |publisher=Carolina Academic |page=47[/tpl]
The South may also refer to the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States by the Mason–Dixon line. Alternatively, it may refer to the South of England, which is politically and economically unmatched with the North of England.
