Father Charles M. Pandosy, a French Roman Catholic Oblate missionary, arriving in 1859 was the first European to settle at Kelowna, a place named "L'anse au sable" (Bay of Sand) in reference to the sandy shoreline. Kelowna was officially incorporated in May 4, 1905.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/resmgmt/sf/agoverviews_2006census/Kelowna_Ag_Ov.pdf |format=PDF |title=City of Kelowna |publisher=Government of British Columbia |year=2006 |accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]
In May 2005, Kelowna celebrated its Centennial. In the same year, new five lane William R. Bennett Bridge began construction to replace the three lane Okanagan Lake Bridge. It was part of a plan to alleviate traffic problems experienced during the summer tourist season, when the influx of tourists adds to the commuters between West Kelowna and Kelowna. The new bridge was completed in 2008.

===Climate===

The climate of Kelowna is humid continental (Köppen climate classification Dfb),[tpl]cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html#1981 |publisher=Environment Canada |title=Canadian Climate Normals or Averages 1981-2010 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl]  with dry, sunny summers, cold, cloudy winters and four seasons.[tpl]cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.| coauthors =J.

Okanagan Lake as well as the blocking barriers of the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia Mountains to the northeast tend to moderate the winter climate, but Arctic air masses do occasionally penetrate the valley during winter, usually for very short periods. The coldest recorded temperature in the city was [tpl]convert|-36.1|C|1[/tpl] recorded on December 30, 1968.
Summers are hot and sunny, with daytime temperatures often exceeding [tpl]convert|35|C|1[/tpl]. The hottest recorded temperature at the airport was [tpl]convert|39.5|C|1|[/tpl] on July 24, 1994, and the highest temperature ever recorded in the city was [tpl]convert|41.0|C|1[/tpl] in August 1998 near but not at the airport.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=BC&StationID=10976&mlyRange=1994-01-01%7C2007-02-01&cmdB1=Go&Month=8&Year=1998&cmdB1=Go |title=Daily Data Report for August 1998 |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=February 13, 2013[/tpl] During summer clear, dry air allows night-time temperatures to fall rapidly. The city averages about [tpl]convert|380|mm|in|0[/tpl] of precipitation per year, with about 1/3 of the precipitation falling as snow, the bulk in December and January; however, June is the wettest month of the year. The inherent dryness of Kelowna's climate is a factor in the forest fire risk as, for example, during the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire of 2003, a large residential evacuation (over 30,000 residents) was ordered.
Although Kelowna averages 300.5 hours of bright sunshine in July (61% of daylight hours), the winter months are mostly overcast due to the presence of valley cloud as a result of a temperature inversion with the heavy cold air sinking into the valley while the warm air passes above; thus, Kelowna averages only 40.3 hours of bright sunshine in January (for comparison, consider 120 hours at Winnipeg, Manitoba and Miramichi, New Brunswick, which both have much colder winter temperatures).
While some smaller communities such as Blue River and Golden get less wind, Kelowna has the greatest percentage of "calm" wind observations for any major city in Canada (39% of the time).1981 to 2010 Canadian Climate Normals http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.htmlPhillips, D. 1990.

===Sectors and neighbourhoods===

Kelowna consists of ten sectors with multiple neighbourhoods within the sector boundariesSector Boundaries, Open Data Catalogue - City of Kelowna

====Central City====

Central City is the sector near the Harvey Avenue from the Okanagan Lake to Highway 33, comprising the city's major business and commercial centres, such as Downtown, Capri, Landmark and Midtown.

=====Downtown=====

Downtown is located by the Okanagan Lake. Multiple beaches, parks, restaurants and stores are located near the waterfront and Bernard Avenue. The cultural district within downtown is home to art galleries, museums, sports arenas and several government offices including the law courts and city hall.

=====Midtown=====

The Midtown area bordered by Enterprise Way on the north, and Springfield and Baron Road at the south is the popular shopping destination for the locals. The largest shopping centre in the interior, Orchard Park, is also located in this area.
Since most of Midtown area consists of car-oriented big-box stores, Midtown is often being criticized for its plainness, urban sprawl and the decline of pedestrian-oriented Downtown.

==Economy==

The service industry employs the most people in Kelowna, the largest city in the tourist-oriented Okanagan Valley. In summer, boating, golf, hiking and biking are popular, and in winter, both Alpine skiing and Nordic skiing are favourite activities at the nearby Big White and Silver Star ski resorts.
Kelowna produces wines that have received international recognition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calonavineyards.ca/artist/switch.cfm?public=awards |title=Example: Calona Vineyards – Awards – Artist Series Reserve VQA |publisher=Calonavineyards.ca |date=1990-01-06 |accessdate=2011-05-05[/tpl]Calona Private Reserve.

Notable vineyards in the area include the Mission Hill Winery (in West Kelowna), specifically for its unique architectural design. At least two major wineries were damaged or destroyed (now rebuilt) in 2003 due to the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire. Kelowna is also the home of Sun-Rype, a popular manufacturer of fruit bars and juices.
Okanagan College and University of British Columbia are the predominant centres for post-secondary education. Over 5000 full-time students attend Okanagan College. In addition to vocational training and adult basic education, the college offers a highly regarded university transfer program. University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus has a student population of over 8000 full-time students, enrolled in diverse undergraduate and graduate programs.University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus (October 23, 2012).

Kelowna is the seat of the Regional District of the Central Okanagan, the third-largest metropolitan area in British Columbia after Vancouver and Victoria, and the largest in the British Columbia Interior. With scenic lake vistas and a dry, mild climate, Kelowna has become one of the fastest growing cities in North America. The appropriate management of such rapid development (and its attendant consequences) is a source of significant debate within the community. Kelowna is the fourth least affordable housing market in Canada, currently maintaining the classification of "Severely Unaffordable".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf |title=6th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-05[/tpl] Because of the Okanagan's climate and vineyard-filled scenery, it is often compared to Napa Valley, California.The Okanagan, a Napa of the North, New York Times, 6 October 2006

===Tourism and consequences===

Some claim to believe that a lake monster named Ogopogo lives in Lake Okanagan. In the past, naysayers have pointed out the similarities between the so-called monster and a beaver, a log and other less monstrous lake denizens. Nevertheless, local tourism makes use of the Ogopogo legend, and a children's park features an imaginative statue of the fictional creature.
In both 1986 and 1988, alcohol-fueled riots erupted during summer Regatta festivities.
In July 2007 general rowdiness during the annual "Wakefest" wakeboarding competition and music festival led to the decision by Kelowna City Council to ban the event for the following year.  Expected to return for the summer 2009 tour after organizers/promoters agreed to changes in the festival (including renaming it, introducing restricted beer garden hours and moving the date to later in the summer), conflicting dates with the national tour forced the festival to be withheld for another year.Wakefest 2009 not happening, Kelowna News, Castanet.net

In January 2011, Kelowna hosted the 2011 International Children's Winter Games and in July 2011 Kelowna's City Park was home to the largest Sport and Music Festival in Western Canada, Center of Gravity. The event drew in 25,000+ attendees and brought an approximate 4-5 million dollars in tourism revenue.http://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/126362503.html

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

For years, only one major highway passed through the city of Kelowna: Highway 97. The road itself is good, but its connections to all points east and west in the province were only managed by using the slow, curving Trans Canada Highway and the Crowsnest Highway.
In 1986, in time for the opening of Expo 86, a new freeway was built into the BC interior, eliminating over two hours of travel time between the Coast and the interior. This freeway, starting in Hope, is known as the Coquihalla Highway (Hwy 5), and terminates in Kamloops.  At Merritt another newer (1989) highway, the Okanagan Connector, BC Highway 97C, heads eastward to Highway 97, which it joins at the West Kelowna-Peachland boundary. This new freeway system allows one to drive the 395 kilometres from Vancouver to Kelowna in less than four hours.
Kelowna is connected to West Kelowna by the new five lane William R. Bennett Bridge which officially opened May 25, 2008.  This new bridge links Highway 97 to the southern Okanagan and to the Coquihalla Highway via Hwy 97C. The old floating bridge has been dismantled as it has outlived its usefulness and was incapable of supporting the current traffic levels.  A small park area on the Kelowna side of the bridge has a dedication to the old bridge, and artwork made of pieces of it.
Highway 33, which connects with Highway 97 in Rutland, provides an alternate way to enter and exit the city, towards the southeast; it also is the route to the Big White Ski area.
Kelowna's road network has sometimes been a source of criticism especially regarding Highway 97 and its high traffic volumes. Highway 97 runs right through the centre of the city along Harvey Avenue, which has 6 lanes and is the busiest road in the BC interior. There are many big box stores and shopping centers along Harvey, including Orchard Park Shopping Centre. Plans have been in place for several decades for a limited access bypass to run through the North End and across Okanagan Lake via a second bridge. So far, only a 3 kilometer section of this future roadway has been constructed alongside the rail line.

===Public transport===

Kelowna Regional Transit System is operated by FirstGroup, providing public bus transportation services in Kelowna and its vicinity. Funding for the transit system is shared between the City of Kelowna, Central Okanagan Regional District, District of Lake Country and BC Transit.Central Okanagan i-go, Transit]

Kelowna International Airport (IATA: YLW), north of the city core, is one of the busiest airports in Canada. There are regular flights to and from Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Cranbrook, Whitehorse, Seattle and Los Angeles, as well as seasonal service to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Mexico.
