Methyl fluorosulfonate, (also known as magic methyl, a name coined by George Olah) has the chemical formula F-SO2-OCH3. It is prepared by distillation of an equimolar mixture of fluorosulfonic acid and dimethyl sulfate, and used as a powerful methylating reagent (about four orders of magnitude more reactive than methyl iodide). Since it will just as readily methylate biological tissues,[tpl]cite journal | author = Hite, M. | coauthors = Rinehart, W.; Braun, W.; Peck, H. | year = 1979 | title = Acute toxicity of methyl fluorosulfonate (Magic Methyl) | journal = AIHA Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 600â€“603 | pmid = 484483 | doi = 10.1080/00028897708984416[/tpl] it is acutely toxic (LC50 (rat) ~ 5 ppm), causing irritation of the airways and pulmonary edema, presumably by methylation of lipids in the cell membranes. Its use as a methylating reagent is banned by many organisations as a result.
