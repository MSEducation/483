A closed platform, walled garden or closed ecosystem[tpl]cite news|journal=Tech-FAQ.com|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/escaping-the-walled-gardens.html|accessdate=7 October 2012|title=Escaping the Walled Gardens in the Clouds|author=Daniel Memetic[/tpl][tpl]cite news |accessdate=7 October 2012 |title=Interview With Rosabeth Moss Kanter, author of SuperCorp (2009): No Matter How Big You Are, Diversify or Die |year=2009 |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:qDC020M2JUcJ:www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/publications/business-review/2012/issue2/no_matter_how_big_you_are-diversify_or_die.pdf+walled+garden+closed+ecosystem&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjS_b9ue9XY9v0uolPIP5YYXRqBMXVeHto80_d1oGdvvPQJHEyGpOozVi6S9ij4bs5J1e-w_3QqgkT0Y1ZB8uYCLCeWfiXTO3qPBtxgaj69muA8jqvcVMnWhV-Uf1v5FtBq3ppl&sig=AHIEtbRNCHLT2316S0n_5_vTRYmuqzsnig |author=Nicholas Smith |journal=Ericsson.com Company Docs[/tpl] is a software system where the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applications or content. This is in contrast to an open platform, where consumers have unrestricted access to applications, content, and much more. 
For example in telecommunications, the services and applications accessible on a cell phone on any given wireless network used to be tightly controlled by the mobile operators. The mobile operators limited the applications and developers that were available on users' home portals and home pages.
For example, a service provider might have restricted user access to users with no pre-paid money left on their account. This has long been a central issue constraining the telecommunications sector, as developers face huge hurdles in making their applications available to end-users.
In a more extreme example, with the pre-regulated 1970s American telephone system, Bell owned all the hardware (including all phones) and all the signals, and virtually even the words (information) on their wires. A landmark case was Hush-A-Phone v. United States, wherein Bell sued a company producing plastic telephone attachments. In the case of Bell, it was an openly government sanctioned and regulated monopoly by the Communications Act of 1934.
More generally, a walled garden can refer to a closed or exclusive set of information services provided for users.  Similar to a real walled garden, a user in a walled garden is unable to escape this area unless it is through the designated entry/exit points or the walls are removed.[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of: walled garden|url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=walled+garden&i=54187,00.asp|publisher=PCmag.com|accessdate=13 June 2012[/tpl]
