[[Konkordiaplatz]]

CATEGORIES: Alps

The Konkordiaplatz or Concordia (French: Place de la Concorde), is a large flat area of snow and ice lying just to the south of the Jungfrau in the Bernese Alps in the Swiss canton of Valais. Its notable feature is that it is the junction of four large glaciers coming down from the Aletschfirn, the Jungfraufirn, the Ewigschneefäld and the Grüneggfirn. The main Aletsch Glacier originates from Konkordiaplatz. The Konkordiaplatz Charter was signed by the municipalities located in the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area UNESCO World Heritage site, vowing to retain the aesthetic beauty of the region.

==Naming==

Concordia is the latin word for harmony, literally "with (one) heart". It was the name of the Roman goddess of agreement, understanding, and marital harmony. A British mountaineer, John Frederick
Hardy, gave to the convergence of the several glaciers, the name Place de la Concorde of Nature.Some famous alpine ascents page 266
The name Concordia was then given to other places where two or more glaciers meet or large glaciated areas, such as Concordia  in the Karakoram William Martin Conway: Climbing and Exploration in the Karakoram Himalayas, S. 317. (Google-Books) or Concordia Station in Antarctica.

==Geography==

According to measurement made by the ETHZ the thickness of snow and ice is more than 900 metres.Glacier d'Aletsch pronatura.ch (French) It is surrounded by the Dreieckhorn (south), the Fiescher Gabelhorn (east), the Grünhorn (north-east) and the Kranzberg (subpeak of the Jungfrau) and Trugberg (north).
