===Fauna===

Iran's wildlife is composed of several animal species including bears, gazelles, wild pigs, wolves, jackals, panthers, Eurasian Lynx, and foxes. Domestic animals include, sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, eagles and falcon are also native to Iran.
One of the most famous members of Iranian wildlife is the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah, also known as the Iranian Cheetah, whose numbers were greatly reduced after the Iranian Revolution. Today there are ongoing efforts to increase its population and introduce it back in India. Iran had lost all its Asiatic Lion and the now extinct Caspian Tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century.[tpl]cite book | author=Guggisberg, C.A.W. |year=1961 |title= Simba: The Life of the Lion | publisher=Howard Timmins, Cape Town[/tpl]

===Provinces and cities===

Iran is divided into thirty one provinces (ostān), each governed by an appointed governor (استاندار, ostāndār). The provinces are divided into counties (shahrestān), and subdivided into districts (bakhsh) and sub-districts (dehestān).
Iran has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world. From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased from 27% to 60%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/03/nov/1135.html|title=Iran: Focus on reverse migration|author=Payvand|accessdate=17 April 2006[/tpl] The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20071110154704/http://www.sci.org.ir/portal/faces/public/census85/census85.natayej/census85.abadipage |title=Islamic Azad University".

Another major Iranian city is Isfahan (population 1,583,609), which is the capital of Isfahan Province. The Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The city contains a wide variety of Islamic architectural sites ranging from the 11th to the 19th century. The growth of the suburban area around the city has turned Isfahan into Iran's second most populous metropolitan area (3,430,353).Iran – Statistical Centre. Retrieved 27 February 2008.

The fourth major city of Iran is Tabriz (population 1,378,935), the capital of the East Azerbaijan Province. It is also the second industrial city of Iran after Tehran. Tabriz had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the Qajar dynasty. The city has proven extremely influential in the country’s recent history.
The fifth major city is Karaj (population 1,377,450), located in Alborz Province and situated 20 km west of Tehran, at the foot of the Alborz mountains; however, the city is increasingly becoming an extension of metropolitan Tehran.
The sixth major Iranian city is Shiraz (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of Fars Province. The Elamite civilization to the west greatly influenced the area, which soon came to be known as Persis. The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 9th century BCE, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BCE. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in or near Shiraz. Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire and is situated [tpl]convert|70|km|mi[/tpl] northeast of modern Shiraz.

==Government and politics==

The political system of the Islamic Republic is based on the 1979 Constitution, and comprises several intricately connected governing bodies. The Leader of the Revolution ("Supreme Leader") is responsible for delineation and supervision of the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/index.php?p=leader_law |title=Leadership in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran |publisher=Leader.ir |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]
The Supreme Leader is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations; and has sole power to declare war or peace. The heads of the judiciary, state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces and six of the twelve members of the Guardian Council are appointed by the Supreme Leader.

===Law===

The Supreme Leader appoints the head of Iran's judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court and the chief public prosecutor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/government/articles/structure_of_power.php |title=Iran Chamber Society: The Structure of Power in Iran |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl] There are several types of courts including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and revolutionary courts which deal with certain categories of offenses, including crimes against national security. The decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed. The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving lay people. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader. The Court's rulings are final and cannot be appealed. The Assembly of Experts, which meets for one week annually, comprises 86 "virtuous and learned" clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms. As with the presidential and parliamentary elections, the Guardian Council determines candidates' eligibility. The Assembly elects the Supreme Leader and has the constitutional authority to remove the Supreme Leader from power at any time. It has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader's decisions.

Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8% per year. The government’s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants and by adding hydroelectric, and nuclear power generating capacity. Iran’s first nuclear power plant at Bushehr went online in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iran.pdf |title=Iran |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=111980 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |accessdate=14 September 2011[/tpl]

===Languages===

The majority of the population speaks the Persian language, which is also the official language of the country, as well as other Iranian languages or dialects. Turkic languages and dialects, most importantly Azerbaijani language, are spoken in different areas in Iran. In southwestern and southern Iran, the Luri language and Lari language are spoken. In Khuzestan, many distinct Persian dialects are spoken. Arabic is also spoken in Khuzestan.

===Ethnic groups===

The exact ethnic composition of Iran is unknown, as there is no official data. The CIA World Factbook has estimated that Persians constitute 61% of the population, & Azerbaijanis at 16%, Kurds 10%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Balochs 2%, Turkmens and Turkic tribes 2%, and others 1%. It found Persian to be first language of 53% of the population, & Azeri and other Turkic dialect being spoken by 18%, & Kurdish by 10%, Gilaki and Mazandarani by 7%, Luri by 6%, Balochi by 2%, Arabic by 2%, and other languages at 2%.
The Library of Congress issued slightly different estimates: Persians (65%), Azerbaijanis (16%), Kurds (7%), Lurs (6%), Arabs (2%), Baluchi (2%), Turkmens (1%), Turkic tribal groups such as the Qashqai (1%), and non-Iranian, non-Turkic groups such as Armenians, Assyrians and Georgians (less than 1%).

===Arts and literature===

Iran is home to one of the richest artistic traditions in world history and encompasses many disciplines, including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and stonemasonry. Carpet-weaving is one of the most distinguished manifestations of Persian culture and art, and dates back to ancient Persia. Persians were among the first to use mathematics, geometry, and astronomy in architecture and also have extraordinary skills in making massive domes which can be seen frequently in the structure of bazaars and mosques. This greatly inspired the architecture of Iran's neighbors as well. The main building types of classical Iranian architecture are the mosque and the palace. Besides being home to a large number of art houses and galleries, Iran also holds one of the largest and most valuable jewel collections in the world.
Iran ranks seventh among countries in the world with the most archeological architectural ruins and attractions from antiquity as recognized by UNESCO.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20101124090123/http://www1.american.edu/ted/iran-tour.htm |title=Virtual Conference |publisher=American.edu |accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl] Fifteen of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites are creations of Iranian architecture.
Poetry is used in many Persian classical works, whether from literature, science, or metaphysics. Persian literature has been considered by such thinkers as Goethe as one of the four main bodies of world literature.[tpl]cite book|author1=David Levinson|author2=Karen Christensen|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia: Iaido to Malay|year=2002|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-80617-4|page=48[/tpl] The Persian language has produced a number of famous poets; however, only a few poets as Rumi and Omar Khayyám have surfaced among western popular readership, even though the likes of Hafiz, Saadi, Nizami,[tpl]cite book|author=François de Blois|title=Persian Literature: A Bio-bibliographical Survey|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F-lH8aQ9-HsC&pg=363|accessdate=21 June 2013|volume=5|date=April 2004|publisher=Routledge|quote=Nizami Ganja’i, whose personal name was Ilyas, is the most celebrated native poet of the Persians after Firdausi.|isbn=978-0-947593-47-6|page=363[/tpl] Attar, Sanai, Nasir Khusraw and Jami are considered by many Iranians to be just as influential.

===Popular culture and cinema===

The musical culture of Persia, while distinct, is closely related to other musical systems of the West and Central Asia. It has also affinities to the music cultures of the Indian subcontinent, to a certain degree even to those of Africa, and, in the period after 1850 particularly, to that of Europe. Its history can be traced to some extent through these relationships. Like that of most of the world’s cultures, the music of Persia has depended on oral/aural transmission and learning.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-xi-persian-music |title=Iran: Music |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]
Iranian cinema has thrived in modern Iran, and many Iranian directors have garnered worldwide recognition for their work. Iranian movies have won over three hundred awards in the past twenty-five years including Oscars. One of the best-known directors is Abbas Kiarostami.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Iran is diverse, with each province featuring dishes, as well as culinary traditions and styles, distinct to their regions. The main Persian cuisines are combinations of rice with meat, chicken or fish and some onion, vegetables, nuts, and herbs. Herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. Iranians also usually eat plain yogurt ([tpl]lang-fa|ماست, māst[/tpl]) with lunch and dinner; it is a staple of the diet in Iran. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavourings such as saffron, dried limes, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form. Iranian cuisine has also greatly inspired its neighbors. Iran is also famous for its caviar.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20050716074736/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2228/html/focus.htm |title=Sturgeon Stocks Slump |publisher=Iran-daily.com |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]
