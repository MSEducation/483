Yakima is situated in the Yakima Valley, an extremely productive agricultural region noted for apple, wine and hop production. As of 2011, the Yakima Valley produces 77% of all hops grown in the United States. The name Yakima originates from the Yakama Nation, located south of the city.

==History==

The Yakama people were the first known inhabitants of the Yakima Valley. In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition came to the area and discovered abundant wildlife and rich soil, prompting the settlement of homesteaders.[tpl]cite web | title = City of Yakima History | publisher = City of Yakima | url = http://www.ci.yakima.wa.us/tour/history/ | accessdate = 2006-12-28[/tpl] A Catholic Mission was established in Ahtanum, southwest of present-day Yakima, in 1847.[tpl]cite web | title = St. Joseph's Mission, Ahtanum Valley, Tampico vicinity, Yakima County, WA | publisher = Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record | url = http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&fileName=wa/wa0100/wa0127/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=1&itemLink=D?hh:24:./temp/~pp_uYcR:: | accessdate = 2007-01-11[/tpl] The arrival of settlers and their conflicts with the natives resulted in the Yakima War. The U.S. Army established Fort Simcoe in 1856 near present-day White Swan as a response to the uprising. The Yakamas were defeated and forced to relocate to the Yakama Indian Reservation.
Yakima County was created in 1865. When bypassed by the Northern Pacific Railroad in December 1884, over 100 buildings were moved with rollers and horse teams to the nearby site of the depot. The new city was dubbed North Yakima and was officially incorporated and named the county seat on January 27, 1886. The name was changed to Yakima in 1918. Union Gap was the new name given to the original site of Yakima.
On October 2, 2006 a large fire in a warehouse operated by S.S. Steiner Inc, destroyed most of the building and about 10,000 bales of hops, which represented about 4% of the total US production.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|27.69|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|27.18|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.51|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl] Yakima is 344.392 meters above mean sea level.

===Yakima region===

The city of Yakima is located in the Upper Valley of Yakima County. The county is geographically divided by Ahtanum Ridge and Rattlesnake Ridge into two regions: the Upper (northern) and Lower (southern) valleys. Yakima is located in the more urbanized Upper Valley, and is the central city of the Yakima Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The cities of Selah and Union Gap lie immediately to the north and south of Yakima. In addition, the unincorporated suburban areas of West Valley and Terrace Heights are considered a part of greater Yakima. With these cities included in the immediate area, population within 20 miles of the city is over 123,000. Other nearby cities include Moxee, Tieton, Cowiche, Wiley City, Tampico, Gleed, and Naches in the Upper Valley, as well as Wapato, Toppenish, Zillah, Harrah, White Swan, Parker, Buena, Outlook, Granger, Mabton, Sunnyside, and Grandview in the Lower Valley. As of 2006, the estimated population of the metropolitan area is 233,105.

===Bodies of water===

The primary irrigation source for the Yakima Valley, the Yakima River, runs through Yakima from its source at Lake Keechelus in the Cascade Range to the Columbia River at Richland. In Yakima, the river is used for both fishing and recreation. A [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] walking and cycling trail, a park, and a wildlife sanctuary are located at the river's edge.
The Naches River forms the northern border of the city. Several small lakes flank the northern edge of the city, including Myron Lake, Lake Aspen, Bergland Lake (private) and Rotary Lake (also known as Freeway Lake). These lakes are popular with fishermen and swimmers during the summer.

===Airport===

The airport is home to numerous private aircraft, and is a popular test site for military jets and Boeing test flights. Several businesses are located at the airport including  Hertz Car Rental, Budget Rent a Car, Airporter Shuttle, Cub Crafters and several freight companies.

==Economy==

Yakima's growth in the 20th century was fueled primarily by agriculture. The Yakima Valley produces many fruit crops, including apples, peaches, pears, cherries, and melons. Many vegetables are also produced, including peppers, corn and beans. Most of the nation's hops, a key ingredient in the production of beer, are also grown in the Yakima Valley.  Many of the city's residents have come to the Valley out of economic necessity and to participate in the picking, processing, marketing and support services for the agricultural economy.
Downtown Yakima, long the retail hub of the region, has undergone many changes since the late 1990s. Three major department stores, and an entire shopping mall that is now closed for business, have been replaced with Whirlpool Corporation and Adaptis call-centers and several hotels.
The retail core of the region has since shifted to the city of Union Gap, where a renovated shopping mall and other new retail businesses are flourishing. While some see big-box retail leaving the downtown area as a loss, others see it as an opportunity to recast the downtown area as a center for events, services, entertainment, and smaller, more personal shopping experiences. One part of this effort has been the Downtown Futures Initiative.[tpl]cite web | title = Downtown Futures Initiative | url = http://www.yakimafutures.com | accessdate = 2009-03-05[/tpl] The DFI has provided for a street-to-storefront remodel along Yakima Avenue throughout the entire downtown core, and includes new pedestrian-friendly lighting, water fountains, planters, banner poles, new trees and hanging baskets, all of which complement the new paver-inlaid sidewalks.
Events held downtown include Yakima Downtown New Year's Eve, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, Yakima Live music festival, Yakima Summer Kickoff Party, Fresh Hop Ale Fest,[tpl]cite web | title = Fresh Hop Ale Fest | url = http://www.freshhopalefestival.com/ | accessdate = 2009-03-05[/tpl] a weekly Farmers' Market,[tpl]cite web | title = Farmers' Market | url = http://www.yakimafarmersmarket.org/index.php | accessdate = 2009-03-05[/tpl] and the Hot Shots 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament.[tpl]cite web | title = Hot Shots 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament | url = http://www.yakimahotshots.org/ | accessdate = 2009-03-05[/tpl]
A bright spot in the economy of the Yakima Valley is the burgeoning wine industry, due in part to the Yakima Valley soil, which is very similar to the soil conditions of France. Over fifty wineries dot the Yakima Valley, covering more than [tpl]convert|11,000|acre|km2[/tpl].
The Yakima Training Center between Yakima and Ellensburg, is a United States Army training center, used for maneuver training, land warrior system testing and live fire area
Artillery units from the Canadian Armed Forces based in British Columbia, as well as the Japan Ground Self Defense Force conduct annual training in Yakima. Japanese soldiers train in Yakima because it allows for large-scale live fire maneuvers not available in Japan. Similarly, it is the closest impact area for the Canadian Gunners, the next closest being in Wainwright Alberta.

==Tourism==

In the early 2000s, the city of Yakima, in conjunction with multiple city organizations, began revitalization and preservation efforts in downtown Yakima. The Downtown Yakima Futures Initiative  tasked themselves with making strategic public investments in sidewalks, lighting and landscaping to serve as economic development catalysts. As a result, local businesses featuring regional produce, wines, and beers among other products have returned to the downtown area. Many of these business are located on Front Street, Yakima Avenue and 1st Street.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
