The wall was garrisoned by auxiliary (non-legionary) units of the army (non-citizens). Their numbers fluctuated throughout the occupation but may have been around 9,000 strong in general, including infantry and cavalry. The new forts could hold garrisons of 600 men (120 cavalry and 480 infantry for example as at Segedunum), while cavalry units of 1,000 troops were stationed at either end. The total number of soldiers manning the early wall probably exceeded 10,000.
They suffered serious attacks in 180, and especially between 190 and 197 when the garrison had been seriously weakened, following which major reconstruction had to be carried out under Septimius Severus. The region near the wall remained peaceful for most of the rest of the 3rd century. It is thought that some in the garrison may have married and integrated into the local community throughout the years.

==After Hadrian==

In the years after Hadrian's death in 138, the new emperor, Antoninus Pius essentially abandoned the wall, leaving it occupied in a support role, and began building a new wall called the Antonine Wall, about [tpl]convert|160|km|mi[/tpl] north, in what later became known as the Scottish Lowlands, though the short strip running West South West to East North East from coast to coast sometimes referred to as the Central Belt or Central Lowlands. This turf wall ran 40 Roman miles (about [tpl]convert|37.8|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl]) and had significantly more forts than Hadrian's Wall. Antoninus was unable to conquer the northern tribes, so when Marcus Aurelius became emperor, he abandoned the Antonine Wall and reoccupied Hadrian's Wall as the main defensive barrier in 164. The wall remained occupied by Roman troops until their withdrawal from Britain.
In the late 4th century, barbarian invasions, economic decline, and military coups loosened the Empire's hold on Britain. By 410, the Roman administration and its legions were gone, and Britain was left to look to its own defences and government. The garrisons, by now probably made up mostly of local Britons who had nowhere else to go,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] probably lingered on in some form for generations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Archaeology is beginning to reveal that some parts of the wall remained occupied well into the 5th century. Enough also survived in the 8th century for spolia from it to find its way into the construction of Jarrow Priory, and for Bede to see and describe the wall thus in Historia Ecclesiastica 1.5, although he misidentified it as being built by Septimius Severus:
But in time the wall was abandoned and fell into ruin. Over the centuries the stone was reused in other local buildings.
The wall fascinated John Speed, who published a set of maps of England and Wales by county at the start of the 17th century. He described it as 'the Picts Wall' (or 'Pictes'; he uses both spellings). A map of Newecastle (sic), drawn in 1610 by William Matthew, described it as 'Severus' Wall', thus giving it the name ascribed by Bede. The maps for Cumberland and Northumberland not only show the wall as a major feature, but are ornamented with drawings of Roman finds, together with, in the case of the Cumberland map, a cartouche in which he sets out a description of the wall itself.

===Preservation by John Clayton===

Much of the wall has disappeared. Long sections of it were used for roadbuilding in the 18th century,Hadrian's Wall, English Lakes website especially by General Wade in the construction of a military road (most of which lies beneath the present day B6318 "Military Road") for the purpose of moving troops to crush the Jacobite insurrection.http://knol.google.com/k/colin-corlett/hadrian-s-wall/1qiwkhi1ntd3t/5#[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] Hadrian's Wall The preservation of much of what remains can be credited to John Clayton. He trained as a lawyer and became town clerk of Newcastle in the 1830s. He became enthusiastic about preserving the wall after a visit to Chesters. To prevent farmers taking stones from the wall, he began buying some of the land on which the wall stood. In 1834, he started purchasing property around Steel Rigg. Eventually, he had control of land from Brunton to Cawfields. This stretch included the sites of Chesters, Carrawburgh, Housesteads and Vindolanda. Clayton carried out excavation work at the fort at Cilurnum and at Housesteads, and he excavated some milecastles.
Clayton managed the farms he had acquired and succeeded in improving both the land and the livestock. His successful management produced a cash flow, which could be invested in future restoration work.
Workmen were employed to restore sections of the wall, generally up to a height of seven courses. The best example of the Clayton Wall is at Housesteads. After Clayton’s death, the estate passed to relatives and was soon lost at gambling. Eventually, the National Trust began the process of acquiring the land on which the wall stands.
At Wallington Hall, near Morpeth, there is a painting by William Bell Scott, which shows a centurion supervising the building of the wall. The centurion has been given the face of John Clayton.

===World Heritage Site===

Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and in 2005 it became part of the transnational "Frontiers of the Roman Empire" World Heritage Site which also includes sites in Germany.[tpl]cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=Frontiers of the Roman Empire|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430/|accessdate=26 November 2007[/tpl]

===Tourism to the Wall===

Although Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, it remains unguarded, allowing those interested in the site full advantage of going up to, and standing upon, the wall (although this is not encouraged, as it could damage the historic structure).
On 13 March 2010, a public event Illuminating Hadrian's Wall took place, which saw the route of the wall lit with 500 beacons.
On 31 August and 2 September 2012 there was a second illumination of the wall as a digital art installation called "Connecting Light" as part of London 2012 Festival.

===Hadrian's Wall Path===

In 2003, a National Trail footpath was opened that follows the line of the wall from Wallsend to Bowness-on-Solway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/HadriansWall/|author= National Trails|title=Hadrian's Wall Path|accessdate=26 November 2007[/tpl] Because of the fragile landscape, walkers are asked to follow the path only in summer months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/HadriansWall/text.asp?PageId=27|author=Hadrians Wall Path National Trail|title=Every Footstep Counts – The Trail's Country Code|accessdate=26 November 2007[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

==Roman-period names==

The only ancient source for its provenance is the Augustan History. No sources survive to confirm what the wall was called in antiquity, and no historical literary source gives it a name. However, the discovery of the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan in Staffordshire in 2003 has provided a clue. This small enamelled bronze Roman trulla, dating to the 2nd-century AD, is inscribed with a series of names of Roman forts along the western sector of the wall, together with a personal name and the phrase MAIS COGGABATA VXELODVNVM CAMBOGLANNA RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS.
Bowness (MAIS) is followed by Drumburgh-by-Sands (COGGABATA) until now known only as CONGAVATA from the late Roman document, the Notitia Dignitatum. Next comes Stanwix (VXELODVNVM), then Castlesteads (CAMBOGLANNA).
RIGORE is the ablative form of the Latin word rigor. This can mean several things, but one of its less-known meanings is 'straight line', 'course' or 'direction'. This sense was used by Roman surveyors and appears on several inscriptions to indicate a line between places. So the meaning could be 'according to the course'.
There is no known word as vali, but vallum was the Latin word for an earthen wall, rampart, or fortification;Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary today vallum is applied to the ditch and berm dug by the Roman army just south of the wall. The genitive form of vallum is valli, so one of the most likely meanings is VALLI, 'of the vallum’. Omitting one of a pair of double consonants is common on Roman inscriptions; moreover, an error in the transcription of a written note could be the reason: another similar bronze vessel, known as the Rudge Cup (found in Wiltshire in the 18th century) has VN missing from the name VXELODVNVM, for example, although the letters appear on the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan. The Rudge Cup only bears fort names.
The name AELI was Hadrian's nomen, his main family name, the gens Aelia. The Roman bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne was called Pons Aelius.
DRACONIS can be translated as 'the hand – or property of Draco'. It was normal for Roman manufacturers to give their names in the genitive (‘of'), and 'by the hand' would be understood. The form is common, for example, on Samian ware.
The translation, therefore, could be:
"Mais, Coggabata, Uxelodunum, Camboglanna, according to the line of the Aelian wall. the hand or The property of Draco."
Another possibility is that the individual's name was Aelius Draco, which would only leave us with an unspecified vallum, 'wall'.

===Forts===

The Latin and Romano-Celtic names of some of the Hadrian's Wall forts are known, from the Notitia Dignitatum and other evidence:
Turrets on the wall include:
Outpost forts beyond the wall include:
Supply forts behind the wall include:
