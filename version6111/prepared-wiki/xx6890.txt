[[Loonie]]

CATEGORIES: 1987 establishments in Canada, Coins of Canada

The Canadian one dollar coin, commonly called the loonie, is a gold-coloured one-dollar coin introduced in 1987. It bears images of a common loon, a bird which is common and well known in Canada, on the reverse, and of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse.
The coin's outline is an 11-sided curve of constant width. Its diameter of 26.5 mm and its 11-sidedness matched that of the already-circulating Susan B. Anthony dollar in the United States, and its thickness of 1.95 mm was a close match to the latter's 2.0 mm.  Its gold colour differed from the silver-coloured Anthony dollar; however, the succeeding Sacagawea and Presidential dollars matched the loonie's overall hue.  Other coins using a curve of constant width include the 7-sided British twenty pence and fifty pence coins (the latter of which has similar size and value to the loonie, but is silver in colour).
The coin has become the symbol of the Canadian dollar: media often discuss the rate at which the loonie is trading against other currencies. The nickname loonie ([tpl]lang|fr|huard[/tpl] in French) became so widely recognized that in 2006 the Royal Canadian Mint secured the rights to it.  When the Canadian two-dollar coin was introduced in 1996, it was in turn nicknamed the "toonie" (a portmanteau of "two" and "loonie").

==Background==

Canada first minted a silver dollar coin in 1935 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of George V's reign as king.[tpl]harvnb|Cross|2011|p=195[/tpl] The voyageur dollar, so named because it featured an Indian and a French voyageur paddling a canoe on the reverse, was minted in silver until 1967, after which it was composed primarily of nickel.[tpl]citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7TBgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q28NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4328,3681953 |title=Sharp announces plans for 1968 nickel coins |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1966-12-23 |accessdate=2013-04-13 |page=1[/tpl] The coins did not see wide circulation, mainly due to their size and weight; the nickel version weighed [tpl]convert|15.6|g|oz[/tpl] and was [tpl]convert|32.1|mm|in[/tpl] in diameter,[tpl]citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C_5kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TogNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1299,2337151 |title=Paper dollar not about to be replaced |work=Edmonton Journal |date=1982-07-07 |accessdate=2013-04-13 |page=A14[/tpl] and was itself smaller than the silver version.[tpl]harvnb|Cross|2011|p=206[/tpl]
By 1982, the Royal Canadian Mint had begun work on a new composition for the dollar coin that it hoped would lead to increased circulation. At the same time, vending machine operators and transit systems were lobbying the Government of Canada to replace the dollar banknotes with wider circulating coins. A Commons committee recommended in 1985 that the dollar bill be eliminated despite a lack of evidence that Canadians would support the move.[tpl]citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oKQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3220,3499172 |title=Canadian govt. may be courting disaster with dollar coin |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1985-08-19 |accessdate=2013-04-13 |page=A12[/tpl]  The government argued that it would save between $175 and $250 million over 20 years by switching from bills that had a lifespan of less than a year to coins that would last two decades.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/economy-business/banks/banks-general/introducing-the-loonie.html |title=1987: Introducing the Loonie |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl]

==Introduction==

The government announced on March 25, 1986, that the new dollar coin would be launched the following year as a replacement for the dollar bill, which would be phased out.[tpl]citation |last=Lee |first=Robert |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w78yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5946,2073094 |title=New coin to replace dollar bill |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1986-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |page=A1[/tpl]  It was expected to cost $31.8 million to produce the first 300 million coins, but through seigniorage (the difference between the cost of production and the coin's value), expected to make up to $40 million a year on the coins.  From the proceeds, a total of $60 million over five years was dedicated toward funding the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.[tpl]cite news |last=Lee |first=Robert |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xL8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1264,2475709 |title=Govt. hopes to cash in on dollar coin |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1986-03-26 |accessdate=2013-05-11 |page=A3[/tpl]
The failure of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin in the United States had been considered and it was believed Americans refused to support the coin due to its similarity to their quarter coin and its lack of esthetic appeal. In announcing the new Canadian dollar coin, the government stated it would be the same overall size as the Susan B. Anthony coin – slightly larger than a quarter – to allow for compatibility with American manufactured vending machines, but would be eleven sided and gold coloured.
It was planned that the coin would continue using the voyageur theme of its predecessor, however the master dies that had been struck in Ottawa were lost in transit en route to the Mint's facility at Winnipeg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/the-loonie-a-canadian-touchstone-is-turning-20-1.246599 |title=The loonie, a Canadian touchstone, is turning 20 |publisher=CTV News |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2013-05-11[/tpl]  A Commons committee struck to investigate the loss discovered that the Mint had no documented procedures for transport of master dies and that it had shipped them via a local courier in a bid to save $43.50.  It was also found to be the third time that the Mint had lost master dies within five years.[tpl]cite news |last=Weston |first=Greg |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GK8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ku8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5221,1949029 |title=Dollar fiasco third time mint lost moulds |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1987-02-05 |accessdate=2013-05-11 |page=A1[/tpl] An internal review by the Royal Canadian Mint argued that while a policy existed to ship the obverse and reverse dies separately, the new coins dies were packaged separately but were part of the same shipment.  The Mint also disagreed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's contention that the dies were simply lost in transit, believing instead that they were stolen.[tpl]cite news |title=Vanished dollar coin dies likely stolen, review finds |work=Toronto Star |date=1990-04-19 |page=D12[/tpl] The dies were never recovered.
Fearing the possibility of counterfeiting, the government approved a new design for the reverse, replacing the voyageur with a Robert-Ralph Carmichael design of a common loon floating in water. The coin was immediately nicknamed the "loonie" across English Canada, and became known as a "huard", French for "loon", in Quebec.  The loonie entered circulation on June 30, 1987, as 40 million coins were introduced into major cities across the country, though an error by the banks resulted in some Calgary residents receiving the coins one week earlier.[tpl]cite news |last=McIntosh |first=Andrew |title=Canadians will call for the Loon when they know it, Mint predicts |work=The Globe and Mail |date=1987-06-30 |page=A1[/tpl] Over 800 million loonies had been struck by the coin's 20th anniversary.[tpl]cite news |last=Goldman |first=Suzanne |title=Loonie's two decades cause for celebration |work=Calgary Herald |date=2007-06-30 |page=A1[/tpl]
Two years after the loonie's introduction, the Bank of Canada ceased production of the dollar banknote. The final dollar bills were printed on June 30, 1989.[tpl]cite news |last=Dawson |first=Chris |title=Paper dollar's demise begins bronzed bird's solo flight |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-06-30 |page=A1[/tpl] Initial support for the coin was mixed,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3adJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IA4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4365,3952253 |title=The 'loonie' divides Canada |work=Bangor Daily News |date=1990-02-12 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |page=27[/tpl] but withdrawing the banknote forced acceptance of the coin.[tpl]cite news |last=Rochette |first=Ed |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fKpJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4oQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1380,216339 |title=Canada uses its mint to make dollars and sense |work=The Vindicator |date=1995-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |page=A17[/tpl]

==Lucky loonie==

Officials for the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics invited the National Hockey League's ice making consultant, Dan Craig, to oversee the city's E Center arena, where the ice hockey tournament was being held. Craig invited a couple of members from the ice crew in his hometown of Edmonton to assist. One of them, Trent Evans, secretly placed a loonie at centre ice. He originally placed a dime, but added the loonie after the smaller coin quickly vanished as the ice surface was built up.[tpl]cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Canada's Olympic Hockey History 1920–2010 |publisher=Fenn Publishing |location=Toronto |page=201 |isbn=1-55168-323-7[/tpl] He placed the coins after realizing there was no target at centre ice for referees to aim for when dropping the puck for a faceoff. A thin yellow dot was painted on the ice surface over the coins, though the loonie was barely visible to those who knew to look for it.
Keeping the coin a secret, Evans told only a few people of its placement and swore them to secrecy. Among those told were the players of the men's and women's teams.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/sports/olympics/story.html?id={51C80F3B-CF41-4C46-87C5-354C2F90AA97} |title=Lucky loonie golden for Canada |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2004-11-16 |accessdate=2013-08-24[/tpl] Both Canadian teams went on to win gold medals. Several members of the women's team kissed the spot where the coin was buried following their victory. After the men won their final, the coin was dug up and given to Wayne Gretzky, the team's executive-director, who revealed the existence of the "lucky loonie" at a post-game press conference.[tpl]cite news |last=Vecsey |first=Laura |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83322694.html |title=Canadians go absolutely loonie over hockey gold |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2002-02-25 |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]

Capitalizing on the tradition, the Royal Canadian Mint has released a commemorative edition "lucky loonie" for each Olympic Games since 2004.

==Composition==

The weight of the coin was originally specified as 108 grains, equivalent to 6.998 grams.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=11159&image_id_nbr=560252&f=p |title=Canada Gazette, 33-34-35 ELIZABETH II, Chapter 30, p. 256[/tpl]
When introduced, loonie coins were made of Aureate, a bronze-electroplated nickel combination.  Beginning in 2007, some loonie blanks also began to be produced with a cyanide-free brass plating process.  In the spring of 2012, the composition switched to multi-ply brass-plated steel.  As a result, the weight dropped from 7.00 to 6.27 grams.  This has resulted in the 2012 loonie not being accepted in some vending machines.http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/lighter-loonies-toonies-causing-headaches-vending-parking-machines-202448810.html  The Toronto Parking Authority estimates that at about $345 per machine, it will cost about $1 million to upgrade almost 3,000 machines to accept the new coins. The Mint states that multi-ply plated steel technology, already used in Canada's smaller coinage, produces an electromagnetic signature that is harder to counterfeit than that for regular alloy coins; also, using steel provides cost savings and avoids fluctuations in price or supply of nickel.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/money/Material+change+store+loonies+toonies/5992375/story.html |title=Material change in store for loonies, toonies |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |agency=Postmedia News |date=January 14, 2012[/tpl]
On April 10, 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint announced design changes to the loonie and toonie, which include new security features.[tpl]cite web|last=Royal Canadian Mint|title=The Loonie and Toonie have evolved|url=http://www.mint.ca/store/mint/learn/new-1-and-2-6800002|publisher=Royal Canadian Mint|accessdate=22 April 2012[/tpl]http://www.mint.ca/store/mint/learn/the-new-1-coin-6800004 Royal Canadian Mint.
