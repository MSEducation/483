==Features==

The temple's façade, a 19th-century addition, is painted blue. After one enters through the façade, there is courtyard in the middle, which has cloisters surrounding it. The cloisters are filled with images of deities from the Hindu epics. The changes made inside the temple have hidden any evidence of older structures. The sanctum sanctorum has the central image of a fierce form of the goddess Durga, multi-armed (eight shoulders), riding a tiger and killing a demon. It is believed that the [tpl]Convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] image was retrieved from a pond on the road to Hanagal. The temple has very special paintings of murals in Kavi Art, an art form which was popular in the coastal Konkan region of Karnataka. In this art form, now extinct, the top plastered layer of the mural was first dyed with a red pigment, which when removed revealed a lower white layer of plaster over which the murals were created.[tpl]cite book|title=SouthIndia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sEhJBfbhTAAC&pg=PA262|accessdate=12 August 2013|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-103-6|pages=262–[/tpl]

A he-buffalo was specially bred for offering as a sacrifice to the deity during the annual Rathayatra. Following the protest by Gandhi, there was a social movement in the town not only to abolish animal sacrifice but also to allow Dalits entry into the temple. This movement was spearheaded by Keshwain, chief trustee of the temple, in association with Vitthal Rao Hodike, a teacher and dedicated Gandhian of the town. Both objectives of the movement were fulfilled.

==Rathayatra==

The Marikamba Rathayatra (chariot procession) of the deity is held every alternate year in the month of February and taken through the town. It is attended by a very large number of devotees.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
