Bull Creek is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located within the local government area of City of Melville.

==History==

The name was adopted by the City of Melville Council in December 1968. The creek was named after an early settler, Lt Henry Bull[tpl]LandInfo WA|m|B|2013-05-27[/tpl] to whom a grant of 1.20 km² of nearby land was made in 1830.  A larger grant of 5.20 km² later in that year was made to Thomas Middleton; it is this land that today makes up the largest part of the suburb. The name, Bull Creek is also often, but incorrectly, written as the single word 'Bullcreek'.
