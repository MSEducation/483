[[Pika]]

CATEGORIES: Pikas, Monogeneric animal families

The pika ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aɪ|k|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|PY|kə[/tpl]; archaically spelled pica) is a small mammal, with short limbs, rounded ears, and no external tail. The name pika is used for any member of the Ochotonidae, a family within the order of lagomorphs, which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). One genus, Ochotona, is recognised within the family, and it includes 30 species. It is also known as the "whistling hare" due to its high-pitched alarm call when diving into its burrow. The name "pika" appears to be derived from the Tungus piika.

==Habitat==

Pikas are native to cold climates, mostly in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. Most species live on rocky mountain sides, where there are numerous crevices in which to shelter, although some pika also construct crude burrows. A few burrowing species are native to open steppe land. In the mountains of Eurasia, pikas often share their burrows with snowfinches, which build their nests there.[tpl]cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Kawamichi, Takeo|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 726–727|isbn= 0-87196-871-1[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Pikas are small mammals, with short limbs and small rounded ears. They are about [tpl]convert|15|to|23|cm[/tpl] in body length and weigh between [tpl]convert|120|and|350|g[/tpl], depending on species. Like rabbits, after eating they initially produce soft green feces, which they eat again to take in further nutrition, before producing the final, solid, fecal pellets. Some pikas, such as the collared pika, have been known to store dead birds in their burrows, for food during winter.http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ochotona_collaris/
These animals are herbivores, and feed on a wide variety of plant matter, including forbs, grasses, sedges, shrub twigs, moss, and lichen. As with other lagomorphs, pikas have gnawing incisors and no canines, although they have fewer molars than rabbits, giving them a dental formula of: [tpl]DentalFormula|upper=2.0.3.2|lower=1.0.2.3[/tpl]
Rock-dwelling pikas have small litters of fewer than five young, while the burrowing species tend to give birth to more young, and to breed more frequently, possibly due to a greater availability of resources in their native habitats. The young are born after a gestation period of between 25 and 30 days.

==Activity==

Pikas are diurnal or crepuscular, with higher-elevation species generally being more active during the daytime. They show their peak activity just before the winter season. Pikas do not hibernate, so they generally spend time during the summer collecting and storing food they will eat over the winter. Each rock-dwelling pika stores its own "haypile" of dried vegetation, while burrowing species often share food stores with their burrow mates. Haying behavior is more prominent at higher elevations. Many of the vocalizations and social behaviors that pikas exhibit are related to haypile defense.
Eurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. At least some species are territorial. North American pikas (O. princeps and O. collaris) are asocial, leading solitary lives outside the breeding season.

==Species==

There are 30 species listed.

==Extinct pikas==

There are many known fossil forms of Ochotona described in the literature.
The "pusilla" group of pikas is characterized by archaic (plesiomorphic) cheek teeth and small size.
The North American species migrated from Eurasia. They invaded the New World twice:
Ochotona cf. whartoni and small pikas of the O. pusilla group are also known from Siberia. The extant, endemic North American species appeared in the Pleistocene. It has been suggested that the North American collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).
