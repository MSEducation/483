Manchester High School is a public high school located in Manchester, Connecticut, United States.

==Campus==

Manchester High School is located in central Manchester, Connecticut, surrounded by Brookfield Street, Summit Street, East Middle Turnpike, and East Center Street. It is nearby Arthur H. Illing Middle School. On campus are baseball and softball fields, a track, and a soccer/football field. There are parking lots on Brookfield Street, Summit Street, and East Middle Turnpike. The building is two floors that are approximately a quarter-mile around, with most of the school consisting of a building dubbed the "quadrangle", which is shaped like a simple square.  The quadrangle is the original primary building and includes the most of the classrooms and the library. The main office and guidance "suites" are also located in the quadrangle. Each hallway in the quadrangle is color-coded to help students navigate the building, and to group subjects by hallways. The freshman wing further expanded Manchester High School and was opened in 2007. It extends off of one side of the quadrangle and consists of science labs, classrooms, an administrative "suite" (guidance and office areas, a computer lab, and a lobby). Also completed in 2007 was the Bailey Auditorium renovation. This renovation brought a new stage, re-upholstered seats, and a new state-of-the-art sound system to Bailey Auditorium.

==Schedule==

The daily schedule for Manchester High School students changed at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year. http://mhsredline.com/showcase/2013/08/12/new-schedule-features-four-day-rotation/ Originally, Manchester High School was following a two-day rotation block schedule, where classes 1,3,5, and 7 met on A Days and classes 2,4,6 and 8 met on B Days. However, the schedule changed to a four day rotation in which there are 5 classes everyday, and the first three are 55 minutes long and the last two are 90 minutes. The three short blocks rotate so that you see every class 3 out of the 4 days in the rotation. The afternoon classes rotate every other day. The educational benefits of meeting with classes more frequently remain to be seen, as the schedule is a pilot program. 
Juniors in good academic standing have the option of late arrival and early release in place of a study hall at the beginning or end of the day. Seniors in good academic standing have the privilege of open campus, and can swipe out of the building for lunch, or anytime of day that they do not have a class.

A big event for Manchester High School every year is the Homecoming Spirit Week, in which every day has a different theme, leading up to a themed Homecoming Parade on Friday that many members of the community attend, followed by the Homecoming football game, and the Homecoming dance the next day. It is a weekend that many alumni often come home and enjoy.

==Swipe==

Starting in 2012, Manchester High School became a "Swipe school", meaning that students have to swipe their IDs in a machine every morning to track attendance. Swipe cost $47,355 to implement and costs about $6,000 a year to maintain. The purpose of the system is to cut down the number of students skipping classes. "'Classroom teachers will be able to identify students who come to school but do not attend classes', principal Matthew Geary said. Teachers also will know if a student is in the library, nurse's office and other locations equipped with swiping stations."[tpl]cite web|last=Leavenworth|first=Jesse|title=New Attendance Tracking Technology for Manchester High School|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-07-10/community/hc-manchester-boe-advance-0709-20120706_1_swipe-system-school-board-school-day|publisher=The Hartford Courant|accessdate=July 10, 2012[/tpl]

==Chromebooks==

At the beginning of the 2013 school year, Manchester High School officially became a "Google school" and every student and staff member at received a Google Chromebook. http://mhsredline.com/showcase/2013/08/28/chromebook-era-begins-at-mhs/ A wireless internet system was installed around the building so that students would be able to access the internet everywhere inside of Manchester High School. This was made possible by the Nellie Mae Grant, along with various other grants. The purpose of this was to integrate students into a 21st-century learning environment. Response to the Chromebooks has been overwhelmingly positive, one minor issue has been the sensitive screen, but overall, the transition to a more digital way of learning has been smooth. http://mhsredline.com/harbinger/2013/09/25/chromebooks-moving-past-poster-projects/
