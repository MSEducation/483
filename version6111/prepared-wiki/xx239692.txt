==Production==

The tracks on Landmass were recorded on May 20, 2007,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soniccuriosity.com/sc372.htm|title=Steve Roach: Landmass (CD on Timeroom Editions)|last=Howarth|first=Matt|publisher=Sonic Curiosity|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl] live on the Star's End radio program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Only a few hours after Steve Roach had given a concert at the Episcopal Church at Penn, his equipment was moved to the WXPN studio where, beginning a little after two in the morning, Roach performed and created each track.  The sounds, themes, and sonic "sub-structures" were prepared ahead of time, and the tracks were later edited for length prior to their release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=TIM00020|title=Roach, Steve: Landmass|publisher=Projekt|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]
