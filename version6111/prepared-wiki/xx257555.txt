===Other Katsushika Stationed Cops===

The "traffic safety" instructor for the division. He usually goes way overboard in his training and safety regulation, which basically involve that cars drive slower than walking pace, as well as giving ridiculous nicknames (all associated with traffic regulation) to his colleagues.

===Other recurring characters===

===Chou Kanda Sushi===

The newborn sister of the Giboshi family. 
The eldest son of the family. He is a tall, handsome youth who is the main chef at a famous Kyoto restaurant and an almost-professional-level baseball player, as well as a railfan. The main flaw of this seemingly perfect person is that he is rather obsessive with himself and thinks that any beautiful young women who looks him in the eye is in love with him. He is hard on himself for letting Matoi have a tomboy-like personality (because he started teaching her baseball) and always cries when he starts drinking.

===Special Detective Squad===

===Notable family members===

Ryotsu's grandfather who is 100. He used to live in Tsukudanijima, but he made the venture company named Ryotsu Game Company (RGC) with his friends and earns much money. His hobby is playing tennis.
Maria's father. He is well known for his mustache and his toilet-seat-like hairdo. He runs a martial arts school that he hopes to pass on to his children, but they refuse because the martial arts techniques are nothing but childish pranks.
Maria's younger twin sister who looks exactly like her brother. The main difference between them is that she is more aggressive than Maria. She is a successful martial arts actress in the film industry in Hong Kong and, like her brother, shows no interest in inheriting the family's martial arts business. 
Jodie's father. As a colonel in the United States Army, he fought a lot of wars, so he has a lot of scratches. He is constantly hoping for his daughter to find the perfect husband.
