Presto Studios was a computer game development company of the 1990s, especially famous for its award-winning The Journeyman Project series and the 2001 sequel to Cyan's hit Myst series, Myst III: Exile.
In August 2002, Presto Studios shut down new development after the release of an Xbox title Whacked!. In a statement, Greg Uhler (executive producer) announced the closing of the company:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=6142|title=Presto Studios Closing Down|date=2002-08-28|author=Andy Largent|work=Inside Mac Games[/tpl]
 "Due to business, financial, and personal reasons, Presto Studios is discontinuing software development. Whacked! for the Xbox will be the last product that we ship. The company will remain as a corporate entity for many years, but will not be developing products. A minimal staff, including Michel and myself, will be here until the end of October." 

==Closure of the company==

Whacked! for Xbox was Presto Studios' final title before closing its doors shortly afterward. Though still in decent financial shape, Presto was facing an uphill challenge in the transition from the PC to console game market. The directors of the company anticipated a rapidly shrinking PC game market and decided to close the company while it was ahead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20020831-9999_1b31presto.html|title=Local video game-maker Presto closes despite being debt-free and rich in talent|date=2002-08-28|author=Kim Peterson|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune[/tpl] A significant number of the creative staff moved on to high-profile roles in motion picture and animation production.
