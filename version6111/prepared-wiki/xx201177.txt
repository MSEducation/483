After considering a number of other entrepreuneurial ventures from opening a McDonald's franchise, to reproducing antique furniture, she settled on fashion after a buyer at Bloomingdale's suggested she lengthen some peasant blouses sent to her from her native Philippines.  The altered garments were sold as nightshirts.[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1664382,00.html| title = Josie Natori Turns Dressing Inside Out| publisher=Time| accessdate = 2008-05-15 | date=2007-09-21[/tpl]

==The Natori Company today==

The company celebrated its 30th anniversary in November, 2007, with a dinner that was attended by CEO's and top executives of the company's main vendors, including Saks, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's.  Natori has expanded its product offerings, and in May 2008, signed a global fragrance licensing deal with Parlux Fragrances.  The perfume debuted in the US in September, 2009, with international distribution to follow.  The company also launched Natorious, a new ready-to-wear line in the fall of 2008, expanding the company's apparel footprint beyond its traditional lingerie, loungewear, sleepwear, and underwear.  The collection is being rebranded Josie Natori in the fall of 2010.
