</ref> to be stored in a blue container to avoid it being confused with the much more flammable [[gasoline]], which is typically kept in a red container.  In other jurisdictions, like many in Europe, there are no specific requirements for the storage of kerosene other than the container has to be closed and marked with its contents.

==Properties==

Kerosene, a thin, clear liquid formed from hydrocarbons, with a density of 0.78–0.81 g/cm3, is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between 150 °C and 275 °C, resulting in a mixture of carbon chains that typically contain between 6 and 16 carbon atoms per molecule.[tpl]cite journal|first=Chris|last=Collins|year=2007|title=Implementing Phytoremediation of Petroleum Hydrocarbons|journal=Methods in Biotechnology|issue=23|pages=99–108|publisher=Humana Press|ISBN=1-58829-541-9[/tpl]
Regardless of the crude oil source or processing history, the major components of all kerosenes are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons in this boiling range, such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring) do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.[tpl]cite web|title=Kerosene/Jet Fuel Assessment Document|url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/kerjetfc/c15020ad2.pdf|work=EPA|accessdate=2010|author=American Institute of Petroleum|page=8|month=September|year=2010[/tpl]
