==History==

===1972–1975: Early years in New Zealand===

Dragon formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 with a line-up that featured Todd Hunter on bass guitar, guitarist Ray Goodwin, drummer Neil Reynolds and singer/pianist Graeme Collins. All had been in various short-lived bands in Auckland, Collins is credited with using I Ching to provide the name Dragon. Their first major gig was an appearance at The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival in early January 1973. By 1974 several personnel changes had occurred, with Todd Hunter's younger brother Marc Hunter joining on vocals and Neil Storey on drums. The band recorded two progressive rock albums in their native New Zealand, Universal Radio in 1974 and Scented Gardens for the Blind in 1975 both on Vertigo Records.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20120727-0512/www.howlspace.com.au/en/dragon/dragon.htm |url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en/dragon/dragon.htm |title=Dragon |publisher=Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music |editor=Ed Nimmervoll |archivedate=27 July 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2014 [/tpl] Despite being New Zealand's top live attraction by late 1974, neither albums nor related singles had any local chart success, and they recruited Robert Taylor (ex-Mammal) on guitar as they searched for a raunchier pop sound. By early 1975, manager Graeme Nesbitt (ex-Mammal), who had obtained regular gigs and organised their first New Zealand tours, felt they should tackle the larger Australian market. Nesbitt was unable to travel with them to Australia - he had been arrested for selling drugs.

===1975–1979: Initial stardom===

Dragon relocated to Sydney in May 1975, they toured Australia as support act to Status Quo in October. The band sent for keyboard player Paul Hewson who had a reputation, in New Zealand, as a pop songwriter. Hewson had been scouted by Nesbitt when Dragon were still in New Zealand but had declined to join at that time. In 1976 they secured a residency at the Bondi Lifesaver club, and landed a contract with CBS Records after being seen by record producer Peter Dawkins. Often courting or creating controversy, the band was rocked by the heroin overdose death of drummer Neil Storey in September 1976, aged 22. By then, founding member Goodwin had left the group, and their single "This Time" had begun charting.
After considering disbanding, Todd Hunter consulted with Nesbitt who advised him to continue and organised for Kerry Jacobson (ex-Mammal) to join on drums. Between 1977 and 1979, the line-up of the Hunter brothers, Taylor, Hewson and Jacobson had a string of major hits on the Australian National charts with singles "April Sun in Cuba", "Are You Old Enough?" and "Still In Love with You" and albums Sunshine, Running Free and O Zambezi. These releases made them one of Australia's most popular rock acts. They attempted a breakthrough into the American market with a tour supporting Johnny Winter, starting in November 1978, but this was foiled after a disastrous show in Dallas Texas, at which Marc Hunter incited a crowd by suggesting all Texans were "faggots": band members had to dodge flying beer bottles.
In 1994, Marc Hunter related his version of the Texas show to rock journalist Glenn A. Baker:
[tpl]quote|"I remember seeing someone standing holding a pistol and shouting 'Im gonna kill you, you son of a bitch'... I didn't know it but by this point the rest of the band had left the stage. I was still singing because I could still hear the music in my head. It took ages to clear the pile of debris on the stage - broken glass, bottles, chairs, half a table - but I was totally unaware of this, I thought I was going over really well and I'm standing there in a crucifixion pose with my arms out, really gone, with heaps of eye make-up on, looking like some sort of twisted priest. And apparently Johnny Winter was taking bets on the side of the stage as to how long it would take before somebody shot me. Then I turned around and saw no one was on stage so I realised I wasn't going over too well after all and I went back to the dressing room and everyone was just standing there... I said 'We went great, weren't we terrific?' At that stage of the band I was really a shocking sod. And all the record company people were just staring at me like I was an insectoid from Mars. And so that was it for us for that trip to America."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hotshotdigital.com/WellAlwaysRemember.4/MarcHunterBio.html |last=Baker |first=Glenn A. |title=Marc Hunter biography |publisher=Hotdigital |accessdate=2008-05-24 [/tpl]|Marc Hunter |1994 [/tpl]
Upon returning to Sydney, Marc Hunter was sacked from Dragon in February 1979 due to drug problems which were seriously affecting both his vocal performances and his general health. According to Todd Hunter:
Jane Clifton - who also played Margo Gaffney in Prisoner - relates a time when she saw them live:
Singer Billy Rogers formerly of Perth group Last Chance Cafe and violinist Richard Lee from Melbourne band Sidewinder were recruited and Dragon recorded the commercially unsuccessful Power Play LP before breaking up in December 1979.

===1979–1982: First split===

Marc Hunter cleaned up in the post-Dragon years and released two successful solo singles, "Island Nights" (1979) from Fiji Bitter and "Big City Talk" (1981) from Big City Talk. "Big City Talk"'s video was filmed in the Broadway Tunnel, a long and dreary pedestrian walkway linking Sydney's Central Station with Broadway. It captured the seedy and unsettling atmosphere of the tunnel, adding extra mood to the song's words.
Todd Hunter had meanwhile teamed up with his partner (and later second wife) Johanna Pigott, formerly of indie punk group XL Capris, and together they became a successful songwriting team. XL Capris were not commercially successful, although their memorable re-working of crooner Tommy Leonetti's "My City Of Sydney" became a minor cult classic. Todd Hunter produced both their albums Where's Hank? (March 1981) and Weeds (October 1981), and was a member of the band for the second.
Paul Hewson moved back to Auckland and joined The Pink Flamingos, who became one of New Zealand's top musical acts in the early 1980s. They were led by Dave McArtney ex-Hello Sailor, which had toured with Dragon but had also split.

===1982–1997: Reformation===

Dragon reformed in August 1982 to pay off outstanding debts, not long after Jacobson left the band for health reasons and was replaced by British drummer Terry Chambers (ex-XTC), with the band then staying together when their second comeback single, "Rain", proved to be a #2 hit in 1983,[tpl]cite web |title= The best of 1983 |publisher= Oz Net Music Chart |url= http://www.onmc.iinet.net.au/AUST/83.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070908153842/http://www.onmc.iinet.net.au/AUST/83.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-08[/tpl] American keyboard player and Dragon's producer Alan Mansfield also joined. Mansfield had worked for Robert Palmer (including guitar for the "Johnny and Mary" single from Palmer's album Clues) and Bette Midler in the late 1970s,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Alan_Mansfield.html |title=The Independent Major: Alan Mansfield |publisher=peermusic |accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080328052425/http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Alan_Mansfield.html  |archivedate = 2008-03-28[/tpl] by 1982 Mansfield was living in Sydney and produced tracks for Marc Hunter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sergent.com.au/marchunter.html |title=Marc Hunter |publisher=Bruce Sergent |accessdate=2008-05-25 [/tpl] Marc Hunter convinced Mansfield to also produce Dragon's single "Rain".
Dragon's 1984 album Body and the Beat became one of the biggest-selling albums in Australia and New Zealand; they were restored to something close to their late 1970s glory. Their public profile was further raised by Marc Hunter's solo album, Communication. Its title track became a moderate hit in Australia and featured a loosely cabaret-oriented video-clip filmed in Amsterdam in which Marc — resplendent in a bright red cowboy hat — was flanked by two women who also danced away under red Stetsons. Body and the Beat yielded further successful Australasian singles, notably "Magic" and "Cry". Mansfield and New Zealand-born singer-songwriter Sharon O'Neill met on Dragon's Body And The Beat tour: they later became domestic and professional partners.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.times.co.nz/cms/news/interview/2006/08/art100012925.php |title=The Times interview, Sharon O'Neill explain yourself to PJ Taylor |publisher=The Times (Auckland, New Zealand) |last=Taylor |first=P J |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-25 [/tpl]
Paul Hewson left Dragon and died of a drug overdose in New Zealand on 9 January 1985;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meanjin.unimelb.edu.au/supplements.htm |title="wave to wave" - goodbye to my friend Paul Hewson, piano player in Dragon (25 October 1952 - 9 January 1985) |last=Jewel Brown |first=Jen |publisher=University of Melbourne |accessdate=2008-05-23 [/tpl] fellow members Terry Chambers and Robert Taylor left some time after. Dragon performed three songs for 13 July 1985 Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) - "Speak No Evil", "Rain" and "Are You Old Enough?"; which was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.[tpl]cite web |url=http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/ozforafrika-uk.html |title=Oz for Africa |publisher=liveaid.free.fr |accessdate=2008-03-12 [/tpl] American drummer Doane Perry replaced Chambers, and Taylor was eventually succeeded by local Sydney guitar ace Tommy Emmanuel. This line-up recorded the Todd Rundgren-produced Dreams of Ordinary Men album in 1986 and toured Europe with Tina Turner under the name Hunter in 1987. By this time Mansfield was writing with O'Neill; they wrote "Western Girls" for Dreams of Ordinary Men and then three tracks for her 1987 solo album Danced in the Fire.
Dragon briefly split up in 1988 but the Hunter brothers and Mansfield had regrouped with guitarist Randall Waller and drummer Barton Price (ex-Models) for the Bondi Road album released in April 1989 on RCA, it also featured Emmanuel's guitar work. Bondi Road reached #18 on the Australian albums charts and the single "Young Years" written by Mansfield and O'Neill[tpl]cite web | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | title = "Young Years" at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Young%20Years | accessdate = 15 November 2010 [/tpl] also reach #18. The pair had written two other tracks: "Ice in this Town" and "Good Time Girl". Dragon continued to record and tour with varying line-ups centered around the Hunter brothers and Mansfield. They also supported Elton John for his 1990 Australian tour. Todd Hunter worked on Heartbreak High (TV series) from 1994 for six years as Music Composer[tpl]cite web |title=Heartbreak High (1994) |publisher=Internet Movie Database (IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108800/fullcredits#cast |accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl] he retired from Dragon in 1995 after the release of Incarnations.
Dragon continued on without Todd Hunter. Then, in November 1997, Marc Hunter was diagnosed with severe oesophageal cancer and died on 17 July 1998. A memorial service for him was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney; and, a compilation CD Forever Young was released on Raven Records, highlighting his solo career.

===1997–2006: Second split===

Dragon broke up a second time after Marc Hunter's illness had been diagnosed. Todd Hunter continued composing music for TV and film with Heartbreak High to 1999, Walk the Talk (2000 film), Out There (2003 TV series) and Out of the Blue (2008 BBC-TV series).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403071/ |title=Todd Hunter entry at Internet Movie Database (IMDb) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=2008-05-25 [/tpl] Mansfield and O'Neill continued songwriting including "True Love" co-written with Robert Palmer[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=500704741&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=10&start=1 | title = ASCAP ACE Title Search for "True Love" | publisher = American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) | accessdate = 15 November 2010 [/tpl] for his 1999 album Rhythm and Blues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/robert_palmer/rhythm_and_blues/ |title=Rhythm & Blues by Robert Palmer |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=2008-05-25 [/tpl] They both performed with Leo Sayer during his tours in 2006 and 2007, O'Neill would sing "Young Years" in honour of Marc Hunter.

===2006–present: Reformation===

Todd Hunter (bass) reformed Dragon in 2006 with a line-up of Mark Williams (vocals, guitar), Bruce Reid (guitar), and Pete Drummond (drums). The new line-up released Sunshine to Rain on the Liberation Blue label.
On 1 July 2008, Dragon were inducted by Richard Wilkins into the ARIA Hall of Fame, Dragon were joined on-stage by James Reyne and Ian Moss to perform "April Sun in Cuba" and "Rain":[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ariahalloffame.com.au/document/No5_2008%20ARIA_HOF_announces_all_star_cast_to_induct_and_present.pdf |title=ARIA announced all-star cast to induct and perform |format=PDF |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) |accessdate=2008-07-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080719211321/http://www.ariahalloffame.com.au/document/No5_2008+ARIA_HOF_announces_all_star_cast_to_induct_and_present.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-07-19[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|Dragon's performance featured Ian Moss and James Reyne on vocals, alongside founding member Todd Hunter. During a fiery version of "April Sun in Cuba", the late Dragon singer Marc Hunter was incorporated into the chorus via a stirring performance video shown on a huge screen behind the band. Reyne said: "I used to go and see Dragon play in the mid to late 1970s before I even had a proper band, so it's great to be able to do this. I'm a big Dragon fan, and did tours with them when Marc was alive, and I knew him quite well. He'd think this is a blast." According to Todd Hunter, Dragon has had, at last count, 35 members and umpteen reincarnations. "Well, Wikipedia says 35 members so far," he said. "We had a long break as a band, but we started doing acoustic shows a couple of years ago. But we couldn't be heard above the crowd because they were singing so loud, so now we're back doing electric shows."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/rockers-hail-rolf-in-hall-of-fame/2008/07/01/1214678042660.html |title=Rockers hail Rolf in Hall of Fame |last=Murfett |first=Andrew |publisher=The Age |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-05 [/tpl]|coauthors=Andrew Murfett, James Reyne, Todd Hunter |2 July 2008[/tpl]
