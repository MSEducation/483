==History and development==

The Type 91 10 cm howitzer was an orthodox design howitzer, based largely on contemporary French Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider howitzers ordered during the late 1920s by the Japanese Army Technical Bureau for evaluation purposes. It was intended to supplement, and eventually supersede the largely obsolete Type 38 15 cm howitzer, which had been in service since the end of the Russo-Japanese War.  Over one thousand units were produced beginning in 1931. 

==Design==

For a weapon of modern design the Model 91 (1931) 105-mm howitzer is by U. S. standards an extremely crude-looking piece. It is much smaller and lighter than the German and U. S. howitzers of the same caliber, weighing even less than the standard 75-mm guns used in Europe in World War I. Despite its lightness and its appearance of not having been quite finished, it is capable of throwing a 35-pound shell very nearly as far as can the heavier and far more formidable looking German 105-mm howitzer.
The Type 91 10 cm howitzer  was a standard 105-mm artillery piece of extremely light construction relative to range and weight of projector. Identification Demountable spade plates, long cradle extending almost to muzzle end of tube, a hydropneumatic recoil mechanism, split trail, and interrupted screw breech mechanism. It was designed to be towed by a team of six horses.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces
The Type 91 fired a 15kg standard high-explosive shell, up to 10,500 metres and could also fire chemical, armor-piercing, and shrapnel shells.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces Japanese charge-system numbering is

==Combat record==

Type 91 10 cm howitzer was used in large numbers in from line combat service from the time of the invasion of Manchuria through the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars, the Second Sino-Japanese War and in most fronts during the Pacific War. The Type 91 was typically assigned to field artillery regiments together with 75mm field guns.http://www3.plala.or.jp/takihome/91-10.htm Taki's Imperial Japanese Army page
Weapons captured by the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, or abandoned in China at the time of the surrender of Japan, were placed into service by both the National Revolutionary Army of the Nationalist government and the People's Liberation Army of the Chinese communist government through the Chinese Civil War.
