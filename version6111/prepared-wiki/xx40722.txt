Seven Beauties ([tpl]lang-it|Pasqualino Settebellezze[/tpl]) is a 1975 Italian language film written and directed by Lina Wertmüller and starring Giancarlo Giannini, Fernando Rey, and Shirley Stoler. Written by Wertmüller, the film is about an Italian everyman who deserts the army during World War II and is captured by the Germans and sent to a prison camp, where he does anything to survive. Through flashbacks, we learn about his family of seven unattractive sisters, his accidental murder of one sister's lover, his imprisonment in an insane asylum, his rape of a patient, and his volunteering to be a soldier to escape confinement.[tpl]cite web|title=Seven Beauties |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075040/ |accessdate=8 March 2012[/tpl] The production design and costume design were by the director's late husband, Enrico Job.

==Plot==

The picaresque  story follows its protagonist, Pasqualino (Giannini) who, as a dandy and small-time hood in Naples, to save the family honour, is sent to prison for  killing a pimp (and then dissecting the victim and placing the body in suitcases) who had turned Pasqualino's sister into a prostitute.  Convicted and sent to prison,  Pasqualino succeeds in being transferred to a psychiatric ward.  Desperate to get out, he volunteers for the Italian Army, but then somewhere in Germany he deserts with a comrade.  They are captured and sent to a concentration camp.  There, in a bid to save his own life, Pasqualino decides to survive by providing sexual favors to the obese and ugly female commandant (Stoler). His plan succeeds, except for the fact that he is then put in charge of the barracks as a kapo, and is obliged to select six men to be killed under the threat that if he doesn't do so, they will all be killed. Pasqualino ends up executing the soldier with whom he was captured and being responsible for the death of another fellow prisoner, a Spanish  anarchist.  At the war's end, upon his return to Naples, Pasqualino discovers that his seven sisters, his fiancée and even his mother have all survived through prostitution.

In the opening sequence of Seven Beauties, spoken over World War II archival footage showing the destruction of cities and men, Wertmüller defines the object of her critique—a "particular petty bourgeois social type".[tpl]cite news|last=Astle |first=Richard |title=Seven Beauties Survival, Lina-style |publisher=Jump Cut |year=1977 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/7Beauties.html |accessdate=9 March 2012[/tpl]

==Critical response==

The subject of the film is survival. It was controversial at the time for its graphic depiction of Nazi concentration camps. In his 1976 essay "Surviving", Bruno Bettelheim, while admiring the film's artistry, severely criticizes the impression it makes of the experience of concentration camp survivors.Bettelheim, Bruno. Surviving and Other Essays. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979.
