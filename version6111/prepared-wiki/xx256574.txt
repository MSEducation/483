The [tpl]nihongo|Okinawa Yanbaru Seawater Pumped Storage Power Station|沖縄やんばる海水揚水発電所|Okinawa Yanbaru Kaisui Yōsui Hatsudensho[/tpl] is a hydroelectric power station located in Kunigami, Okinawa, Japan and operated by the Electric Power Development Company. It is the world’s first pumped-storage to use seawater for storing energy. Its maximum output is 30 MW.

==Facility==

The power station is a pure pumped-storage, using the Philippine Sea as its lower reservoir, with effective drop of 136 m and maximum flow of 26 m³/s. Its pipelines and pump turbine are installed underground. Its maximum output is approximately 2.1% of the maximum power demand in the Okinawa Island recorded on August 3, 2009.
The upper reservoir, artificially excavated, lies approximately 600 m away from the seashore and approximately 150 m above the sea level. It has an octagonal planar shape with its maximum width of 252 m. Its maximum depth is 25 m and its effective storage capacity is 564,000 m³. The entire inner surface of the reservoir is covered with an impermeable liner to prevent seawater from leaking and damaging the surrounding vegetation.
Fiber-reinforced plastic tubes instead of steel tubes were adopted for the penstock and the tailrace in order to avoid seawater corrosion and adhesion of barnacles. The pump turbine is partially made of stainless steel resistant to seawater.
A 66 kV line connects the power station with the power grid of The Okinawa Electric Power Company.

==History==

The power station was a pilot plant funded by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy and constructed by the Electric Power Development Company. A five-year verification operation was conducted since May 16, 1999. The Japan Society of Civil Engineers presented the company an Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award on May 26, 2000 for its construction of the plant. It is now under commercial operation.
