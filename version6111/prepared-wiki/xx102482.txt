Greenway has stated his nickname "Barney" came from a time when he used to drink alcohol. He stated he would get so drunk that when he went anywhere, he would bump into everything. From this behaviour, he would be called "Rubble", which changed to "Barney Rubble" and then just "Barney".[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss11_138.php?sid=&osCsid= |title=Interview with Napalm Death |publisher=Maelstrom magazine |issue=11 |first=Roberto |last=Martinelli |date=December 2002[/tpl]
