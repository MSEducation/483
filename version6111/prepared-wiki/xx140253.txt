==Biography==

Born into a poor family in Prachinburi Province, eastern Thailand, he studied philology at Chulalongkorn  University in Bangkok. It was as a student that Chit first became exposed to Marxism; in 1953 he was hired by the U.S. embassy to help assist William J. Gedney, an American linguist working in Thailand, to translate The Communist Manifesto into Thai (in an attempt to scare the Thai government into taking a tougher stance against communism).[tpl]cite book|title=Thai Radical Discourse: The Real Face of Thai Feudalism Today|author=Craig J. Reynolds|publisher=Cornell University[/tpl]
His writings were anti-nationalist and progressive and were viewed as a threat to the state by the harshly anti-communist government of Sarit Thanarat. He was arrested in 1957, branded a communist, and after six years in jail was declared not guilty by a court and set free.
In 1965, he joined the Communist Party of Thailand, headquartered in the jungles of the Phu Phan mountains, in Sakhon Nakhon Province. On May 5, 1966 he was shot dead by villagers near the village Nong Kung in Waritchaphum district. His body was burned and no proper ceremony for his death occurred until 1989, when his remains were finally placed in a stupa at the nearby Wat Prasittisangwon.
There is a small dispute over his death. Paul M. Handley, the author of "The King Never Smiles" states that Chit was executed by government officials near Phu Phan mountains shortly after he was released from jail.Handley, Paul M. (2006),The King Never Smiles. Yale University Press
