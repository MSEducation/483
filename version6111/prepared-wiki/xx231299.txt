[[True Realm]]

CATEGORIES: Multigenre conventions, Role-playing conventions

True Realm is a gaming convention showcasing the True Dungeon event which has been held previously and in conjunction with Gen Con game convention (from 2003 to present).
True Realm is a unique event in the gaming world. Open on only two days a year (April 3–4, 2009), the event is an indoor, 40,000 sq. ft. “theme park” for gamer geeks who want to immerse themselves in a world of medieval fantasy gaming.
The main attraction area is a 12,000 sq. ft. medieval fantasy city-scape where gamers can spend the day exploring True Realm and enjoying many immerse live-action events.  They can find the entrances to two HUGE Dungeons and Dragons type events with each being a two-hour adventure inside a vast walk-through D&D dungeon. They can also find themselves joining an assault to re-take a tower that has been occupied by three challenging monsters — or they might decide to prove their worth to join the Rogues’ Guild by trying to steal a chalice from a temple.  There are even surprise events that can only be found by careful exploration.
And, of course, there is an Inn that offers food and drink (as well as a good place to pick up a tabletop game), a Tavern where more boisterous gamers can enjoy a beer or two while reliving their latest dungeon exploits, a Courtyard that features street performances, interactive experiences and several contests
