A four-stroke engine (also known as four-cycle) is an internal combustion engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes which comprise a single thermodynamic cycle. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. While risqué slang among some automotive enthusiasts names these respectively the "suck," "squeeze," "bang" and "blow" strokes.http://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/suck-squeeze-bang-blow.html, SUCK-SQUEEZE-BANG-BLOW they are more commonly termed

==History==

===Otto cycle===

Nikolaus August Otto as a young man was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern.  In his travels he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir.  In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18 litre Lenoir Engine produced only 2 horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by Philip Lebon.http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15, NA Otto Museum.
In testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861 Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine.  He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition,but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction.  Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.
In 1864, Otto and Eugen Langen founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company).  Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.
The factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of Deutz, Germany in 1869 where the company was renamed to Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company).  In 1872, Gottlieb Daimler was technical director and Wilhelm Maybach was the head of engine design.  Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.
By 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.
Daimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883.  In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine.  The Daimler Reitwagen used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle  powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design.  The following year Karl Benz produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car. Ralph Stein (1967).

In 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft. Today, that company is Daimler-Benz.

===Diesel cycle===

The diesel engine is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto Cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, Rudolph Diesel wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel.  The Lenoir, Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on Illuminating Gas (coal gas).  With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial concerns their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply.  Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder.  Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.
During initial development, one of the engines burst nearly killing him.  He persisted and finally created an engine in 1893.  The high compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression is now called the Diesel engine whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.
The four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy duty applications for many decades. Chief among the reasons for this is that it uses a heavy fuel that contains more energy, requires less refinement, and is cheaper to make (although in some areas of the world diesel fuel costs more than gasoline).  The most efficient Otto Cycle engines run near 30% efficiency.
Both Audi and Peugeot compete in the endurance races of the Le Mans Series with cars having diesel engines. These are four-stroke turbocharged diesels that dominate largely due to fuel economy and having to make fewer stops.
