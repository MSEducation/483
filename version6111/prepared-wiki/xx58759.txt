</ref> The Team Australia assault on the race, and the fortunes of the other Aussies including [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans|1983]] winner [[Vern Schuppan]], [tpl]f1|1980[/tpl] [[Formula One]] World Champion [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], and [[Allan Grice]], was covered extensively in the Peter Mckay/Barry Naismith book "LeMans The Australian Assault"
While in Europe in 1984, Brock was in the unusual situation (for him) of being the second billing in his driver pairing with Perkins. From 1974 until 1977 Larry Perkins had made 11 starts in Formula One and, to the large number of European motoring press covering the two World Endurance Championship races, ex-F1 driver Larry 'Larrikins' Perkins was the star driver with Brock seen as nothing more than a saloon car driver. According to Perkins, "The Porsche exercise at Le Mans was great although PB (Brock) struggled with the 'Euro media' because no one knew who he was!"
Brock also drove a Vauxhall Magnum with British driver Gerry Marshall to a surprise second place in the 1977 Spa 24 Hours. He also won the 1979 Repco Round Australia Trial driving for the HDT in a 6cyl Holden VB Commodore along with co-drivers Noel Richards and Matthew Philip. The Repco was a long-distance endurance rally that drove clockwise around Australia featuring some dirt road sections completely different to the circuit racing where he made his name. The Round Australia Trial was revived in 1995 (sponsored by Brock's long time backer Mobil) with Brock again racing for Holden in Holden Racing Team prepared VR Commodore. Brock finished 3rd in the trial which was won by team mate (and former Australian Rally Champion) Ed Ordynski.

===Motor Safety Campaign===

Brock also worked with the Victorian authorities promoting the campaign against drink driving. The most obvious sign of this association was the race car number 05 which related to the 0.05% blood alcohol limit in Victoria, which he utilized constantly from the mid-1970s. Most cars he raced in, regardless of the motor racing division, bore this number, including the car in which he died.

===Other activities===

Brock began publicly supporting and, eventually, began to fit to all Holden Dealer Team specials a device called the "Energy Polariser" containing crystals and magnets in an epoxy resin that, it was claimed, improved the performance and handling of vehicles through "aligning the molecules".[tpl]cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 February 1987|title=Holden's, Brock fall out over energy box|author=David Robertson|page=3[/tpl] The device was based on the principles of orgone pseudoscience.[tpl]cite news|work=The Sun-Herald|date=1 March 1987|title=Brock shaping up for a fightback|author=Phil Scott|page=71[/tpl] The "Polariser" is being sold once more in an official HDT, Brock tribute upgrade pack.[tpl]cite web|author=Steve Colquhoun |url=http://brisbanetimes.drive.com.au/motor-news/polariser-hdt-drawn-together-again-20111014-1lnx0.html |title=Polariser, HDT drawn together again |publisher=Brisbanetimes.drive.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]
The overwhelming majority of the Australian motoring community regarded the device as pseudoscience, and Brock's promotion of it drove away HDT drivers like John Harvey, Allan Moffat and Larry Perkins. Brock also recommended tyre pressures of 22psi (150kPa) for his polariser-equipped vehicles, a level which many regarded as near-dangerously low. Holden, fearing the consequences of being associated with the device and a resulting breakdown in communications over Brock's plans for new models, cut ties with Brock and set up an alternative racing/modification operation, Holden Special Vehicles.  During this period, Brock also became involved in the importation and even the modification of the Lada Samara, a cheap Soviet-built hatchback a world away from the high-performance V8-powered Commodores he was famous for.
After his work with Lada, Brock, during the period 1988-1990 sold around 200 personally modified EA-series Ford Falcons, Fairmont Ghias, Fairlanes and Mavericks through Austech Automotive Developments.
While Brock was always typecast in a Holden, he did have 'brief flirtations' with other makes in touring car racing. After his 1987 Holden split, he campaigned a BMW M3 (1988), and a Ford Sierra RS500 (1989–90). During 1988 Brock also campaigned a Ford Falcon in the Calder Park based AUSCAR series.
With the increasing costs of running two Sierras, and with the teams technical support from the UK based Andy Rouse also stopping thanks to Rouse moving to drive for Toyota, Brock returned to driving a Holden in 1991, teaming with former HDT co-driver Perkins (who had left the HDT in mid-1985) to run a pair of VN SS Group A Commodores. The association with Perkins only lasted for one year, though Brock continued to run the ATCC driving in Commodores.
A further flirtation away from Holden was in 1994 when he raced a Volvo 850 in the one-off Eastern Creek 12-Hour. He also competed for Volvo in the Australian Super Touring Championship in 1996, finishing 6th in the championship with a best finish of 2nd in Round 7 at Lakeside in Brisbane.

===Retirement activities===

After 1991 when teamed with Perkins, Brock continued to race in his own privately supported Commodores in 1992 and 1993, but returned to the factory Holden Racing Team in 1994. Brock retired from full-time driving following the 1997 Australian Touring Car season.
He announced to a packed race track he was forming 'The Peter Brock Foundation' A philanthropic organisation funded by corporate sponsors and donations from the public. Aimed at disadvantaged youth and others experiencing difficulties in Australia. As of 2013 the Foundation still continues operating and has financed many activities and people.
After his nominal 'retirement' he made two returns to Bathurst. In 2002 he paired with Team Brock lead driver Craig Baird to a 23rd place finish in the teams . He then returned to the Holden Racing team for the 2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000, teaming with Englishman Jason Plato in a VY Commodore. The pair failed to finish after Plato was involved in a spectacular accident with the Ozemail Falcon of fellow BTCC regular (and Brock's 1993 Bathurst co-driver) John Cleland while Cleland was lapping the Commodore on lap 29. The clash caused the Falcon to roll and enough damage to the HRT car to be out on the spot with Brock failing to get a drive in his last Bathurst race after Plato had started the car and was due to hand over to Brock a few laps after the crash.
Brock also drove a Holden Monaro for Garry Rogers Motorsport (GRM), winning four from four races in what was thought to be a one off appearance in the support races for the 2003 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. This led to him driving a 2nd Monaro built and run by GRM in the Australian Nations Cup Championship, a GT-type championship for highly modified and exotic road cars in 2003 before setting up his own team for himself and son James in 2004 (with Monaros supplied by GRM). He achieved a tenth Bathurst endurance win in 2003 at the Bathurst 24 Hour, when he won, with Greg Murphy, Jason Bright and Todd Kelly in a his GRM Monaro, controversially powered by a 7.0L 427 cui V8 engine rather than the 5.7L Gen III as used by the production Monaro CV8 (the controversy came from no other car in Nations Cup being able to run a different size engine from the production model it was based on).
In 2002, he returned to top-level touring car racing as a team patron with Rod Nash Racing in V8 Supercar Commodore and drove in that year's Bathurst 1000 with the team was renamed 'Team Brock' as a branding exercise. The 'Team Brock' branding exercise was revived for 2003 this time with Paul Weel Racing but this time Brock's role was as a mentor rather than a driver. Frustrated with the lack of control he held over a team bearing his name, Brock and the team parted company at the end of the season.
He occasionally competed in various enthusiast-level motorsport events such as the Targa Tasmania with the Monaros he drove actually constructed by Holden Special Vehicles. His smooth on-camera persona and familiarity to older Australians continued to sell products, including Mobil Oils (including a 2000 United States television commercial) and Bridgestone tyres, as the controversy of the Energy Polarizer had been largely forgotten.

==Career results==

===Complete Bathurst 500/1000 results===

Peter Brock finished in the top 5 at Bathurst 16 times in his 32 starts in The Great Race. This included his record nine wins, one second place, two third, two fourth and two fifth place finishes.
* In 1983 the Brock/Perkins #05 car was a DNF due to engine failure on lap 8. He and Larry Perkins then moved into the HDT's #25 Commodore (their winning car from 1982) and won the race with John Harvey. Although he was the third fastest behind his younger brother Peter and John Harvey in qualifying (faster than Perkins), Phil Brock missed out on a drive in the race, despite the race rules at the time allowing four drivers per car. **In 1987 the Brock/Parsons #05 car was a DNF due to engine failure on lap 34. The pair then joined Peter McLeod in the teams 2nd car and finished 3rd on the road. They were awarded the win after the Eggenberger Ford Sierra's were disqualified in January 1988 for illegal wheel arches. Bathurst rookie (and 1986 Australian Formula 2 champion) Jon Crooke missed driving in the race as a result of Brock/Parsons moving into his car. It was the only time Crooke was an entrant at Bathurst. *** 1997 saw two Bathurst 1000 races held. The traditional October race was held for Super Touring cars while the November race was run for V8 Supercars. Brock teamed with former Formula One driver Derek Warwick in a Vauxhall Vectra in the Super Touring race (and had his biggest ever accident at Bathurst when he rolled the car at the Caltex Chase), before driving his HRT Commodore with Mark Skaife in the V8 Race.

==Media work==

Due to his extraordinary success on the racing track Brock became the Australian racing driver with the highest-profile as he undertook several media commitments. When not racing he often appeared on New Zealand television screens as a presenter; hosting motoring shows such as TV3's Police Stop (1996–1998) and TVNZ's Love that Car (2000).
He was also due to star in a racing film King of the Mountain in early 2007.[tpl]cite news |author = Staff author |title = Pete in a panorama |work = Herald Sun - Carsguide |publisher = News Ltd |pages = G19 |date = 21 July 2006 |accessdate = 2006-09-08 [/tpl] [tpl]update|date=November 2010[/tpl]

Brock next entered into a relationship with Bev McIntosh, the wife of a member of his motor racing team. After two failed marriages Brock was hesitant to marry McIntosh  and although the couple never married, Peter always called Bev his "wife", and she changed her surname to Brock by deed poll.  They had two children together, Robert and Alexandra. Her oldest, James, is Bev's son from a previous marriage. Bev wrote Peter's biography[tpl]cite book | last = Brock | first = Bev | title = Peter Brock: Living with a Legend | year = 2004 | publisher = Macmillan Australia | location = Sydney  [/tpl] herself in 2004 after finding most potential authors had incorrect preconceived notions about him.

===Lifestyle===

Brock, who lived hard in his early years, changed his lifestyle considerably after the failed 1984 Le Mans attempt left him physically and emotionally drained.
After his return from Le Mans, Brock began to consult Melbourne based health practitioner Eric Dowker. He gave up alcohol and cigarettes, and became a vegan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1417325.htm | title=Interview transcript | publisher=Enough Rope with Andrew Denton | date=18 July 2005[/tpl]
