Crown Burgers is a small hamburger fast food restaurant chain based in Salt Lake City, Utah started in 1978 by John & Rula Katzourakis and Nick Katsanevas (Rulaâ€™s brother).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slweekly.com/article.cfm/greeksbearingburgers|title=Greeks Bearing Burgers|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Salt Lake City Weekly|year=1995|author=Ted McDonough|archiveurl=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/article-2479-greeks-bearing-burgers.html|archivedate=11 June 2007[/tpl]  
The chain's signature burger is the "Crown Burger," a cheeseburger which, in addition to the char-broiled patty, is piled high with hot pastrami.  Crown Burgers' pastrami burger has been widely imitated and has become a staple of restaurant cuisine in Salt Lake City.[tpl]cite news|author=John T. Edge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/dining/29united.html?hpw|title=Pastrami Meets the Patty in Utah|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 July 2009[/tpl]  In 2004, Carl's Jr. released a very similar burger called the "Pastrami Burger." Crown Burgers offers other fast food fare as well, such as beef burritos, hot pastrami sandwiches, steak sandwiches, gyros, fishburgers, fries, onion rings, and other burgers. Crown Burgers also carries its own version of the regional condiment fry sauce, a combination of ketchup, mayonnaise and spices. 
Their primary location is decorated like a European hunting lodge, complete with a large fireplace, inviting fireside chats. Other locations have a medieval theme complete with tapestries and heavy iron chandeliers. Like most other fast-food restaurants, customers place orders at a counter and pick up paper-wrapped food when their numbers are called. From the counter, customers can see pastrami being freshly sliced.
Crown Burgers has seven Salt Lake City locations.
In 2010, Crown was featured in an episode of Travel Channel's Man v. Food and named as serving The Official Best Burgers of Utah in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Watch Crown Burgers videos: Man v.

Co-founder Nick Katsanevas died peacefully in his sleep on June 29, 2012 at the age of seventy-one.[tpl]cite web|title=Nick Katsanevas: Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/saltlaketribune/obituary.aspx?pid=158291758|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl]
