Spanish ([tpl]lang|es|español[/tpl]), also called CastilianNote that in English, "Castilian" or "Castilian Spanish" may be understood as referring to European Spanish ("Spanish Spanish") to the exclusion of dialects in the New World or to Castilian Spanish to the exclusion of any other dialect, rather than as a synonym for the entire language. ([tpl]lang|es|castellano[/tpl] [tpl]audio|es_castellano_001.ogg|listen[/tpl]), is a Romance language that originated in Castile, a region of Spain. Approximately 406 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. It also has 60 million speakers as a second language, and 20 million students as a foreign language.Instituto Cervantes (elpais.com) Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and is used as an official language by the European Union and Mercosur.
Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of common Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. It was first documented in central-northern Iberia in the ninth century and gradually spread with the expansion of the Kingdom of Castile into central and southern Iberia.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/07/castillayleon/1289123856.html | title = La RAE avala que Burgos acoge las primeras palabras escritas en castellano | language = Castilian | publisher = El mundo | place = ES | date = 2010-11-07[/tpl] From its beginnings, Spanish vocabulary was influenced by its contact with Basque and by other related Ibero-Romance languages and later absorbed many Arabic words during the Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula.[tpl]cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|title=A History of the Spanish Lexicon: A Linguistic Perspective|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199541140|page=83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V4f8ZpJAhgIC&pg=PA83[/tpl] It also adopted many words from non-Iberian languages, particularly the Romance languages Occitan, French, Italian and Sardinian and increasingly from English in modern times, as well as adding its own new words. Spanish was taken to the colonies of the Spanish Empire in the sixteenth century, most notably to the Americas as well as territories in Africa, Oceania and the Philippines.[tpl]cite web|url= http://sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com/index.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20130118163355/http://sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com/index.html|archivedate= 2013-01-18|title=Spanish languages "Becoming the language for trade" in Spain and |publisher=sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com|date=|accessdate=2010-05-11[/tpl]

Spanish is the most widely understood language in the Western Hemisphere, with significant populations of native Spanish speakers ranging from the tip of Patagonia to as far north as Canada and since the early 21st century, it has arguably superseded French as the second-most-studied language and the second language in international communication, after English.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwlax.edu/languages/spanish.html |title=Spanish Language Studies - Department of Modern Languages UWLax |publisher=Uwlax.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=by Maegan la Mamita Mala |url=http://vivirlatino.com/2007/04/27/spanish-second-most-studied-language-worldwide.php |title=Spanish: Second most studied language worldwide |publisher=: |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2014-03-24[/tpl]
==Names of the language==

In Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called [tpl]lang|es|castellano[/tpl] (Castilian) as well as [tpl]lang|es|español[/tpl] (Spanish), that is, the language of the region of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque and Catalan. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term [tpl]lang|es|castellano[/tpl] to define the official language of the whole Spanish State, in contrast to [tpl]lang|es|las demás lenguas españolas[/tpl] (lit. the rest of the Spanish languages). Article III reads as follows:

The Spanish Royal Academy, on the other hand, currently uses the term español in its publications but from 1713 to 1923 called the language castellano.
The Diccionario panhispánico de dudas (a language guide published by the Spanish Royal Academy) states that, although the Spanish Royal Academy prefers to use the term español in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms, español and castellano, are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas, 2005, pg. 271-272.
Two etymologies for español have been suggested. The Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary derives the term from the Provençal word espaignol, and that in turn from the Medieval Latin word Hispaniolus, 'from—or pertaining to—Hispania'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/ |title=Diccionario de la lengua española |language= [tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl] Other authoritiesRamón Menéndez Pidal, Manual de gramática histórica española (Espasa-Calpe, 1968), §66.2Lloyd A. Kasten and Florian J. Cody, Tentative Dictionary of Medieval Spanish (2nd ed., Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 2001) attribute it to a supposed medieval Latin *hispaniōne, with the same meaning.

==History==

The Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin (colloquial Latin), which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)—unrelated to Latin, and some of them unrelated even to Indo-European—were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Basque (still spoken today), Iberian, and Celtiberian. Traces of these languages, especially Basque, can be found in the Spanish vocabulary today, mainly in place names.
The first documents to record what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century (see Glosas Emilianenses). Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era, by far the most important influence on Spanish (Castilian) lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages—Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Aragonese, Catalan, Portuguese, Galician, Mirandese, Occitan, Gascon, and later, French and Italian—but also from Basque, Arabic, and to a lesser extent the Germanic languages. Many words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church.
Local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish in the north of Iberia, in an area defined by Álava, Cantabria, Burgos, Soria and La Rioja. The dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.[tpl]cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20–21[/tpl] In this formative stage, Spanish (Castilian) developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect progressively spread south with the advance of the [tpl]lang|es|Reconquista[/tpl], and so gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, much of it indirectly, through the Romance Mozarabic dialects.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008[/tpl] The written standard for this new language began to be developed in the cities of Toledo, in the 13th to 16th centuries, and Madrid, from the 1570s.
The development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin [tpl]lang|la|[tpl]smallcaps|vīta[/tpl][/tpl] > Spanish [tpl]lang|es|vida[/tpl]). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short [tpl]smallcaps|e[/tpl] and [tpl]smallcaps|o[/tpl]—which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:
Spanish is marked by the palatalization of the Latin double consonants [tpl]smallcaps|nn[/tpl] and [tpl]smallcaps|ll[/tpl] (thus Latin
[tpl]lang|la|[tpl]smallcaps|annum[/tpl][/tpl] > Spanish [tpl]lang|es|año[/tpl], and Latin [tpl]lang|la|[tpl]smallcaps|anellum[/tpl][/tpl] > Spanish
[tpl]lang|es|anillo[/tpl]).
The consonant written [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]smallcaps|u[/tpl][/tpl] or [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]smallcaps|v[/tpl][/tpl] in Latin and pronounced [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] in Classical Latin had probably "fortified" to a bilabial fricative [tpl]IPA|/β/[/tpl] in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written [tpl]angle bracket|b[/tpl] (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic [tpl]angle bracket|b[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|v[/tpl].
Peculiar to Spanish (as well as to the neighboring Gascon dialect of Occitan, and sometimes attributed to a Basque substratum) was the mutation of Latin initial [tpl]smallcaps|f-[/tpl] into h- whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The h-, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects it is still aspirated in some words. This is the reason why there are modern spelling variants Fernando and Hernando (both Spanish of "Ferdinand"), ferrero and herrero (both Spanish of "smith"), fierro and hierro (both Spanish of "iron"), and fondo and hondo (both Spanish of "deep", but fondo means "bottom" while hondo means "deep"); hacer (Spanish of "to make") is the root word of satisfacer (Spanish of "to satisfy"), and hecho ("made") is the root word of satisfecho (Spanish of "satisfied").
Compare the examples in the following table:
Some consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:
In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the [tpl]lang|es|reajuste de las sibilantes[/tpl], which resulted in the distinctive velar [tpl]IPA|x[/tpl] pronunciation of the letter [tpl]angle bracket|j[/tpl] and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental [tpl]IPA|θ[/tpl] ("th-sound") for the letter [tpl]angle bracket|z[/tpl] (and for [tpl]angle bracket|c[/tpl] before [tpl]angle bracket|e[/tpl] or [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl]). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.
The [tpl]lang|es|Gramática de la lengua castellana[/tpl], written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Spanish_language.aspx#1O29-SPANISH |title=Spanish Language Facts |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl] According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire.[tpl]cite book |last=Crow |first=John A. |title=Spain: the root and the flower |page=151 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=g2NKy8QCxw4C&pg=PA151&dq=Nebrija+first+spanish+grammar+Isabel&cd=5#v=onepage&q= |year=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24496-2 [/tpl]  In his introduction to the grammar, dated August 18, 1492, Nebrija wrote that "... language was always the companion of empire."[tpl]cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |title=Rivers of Gold: the rise of the Spanish empire, from Columbus to Magellan |page=78 |year=2005 |publisher=Random House Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7055-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=b38f7b1WmOwC&pg=PA78&dq=Nebrija+first+spanish+grammar+Isabel&d=5#v=onepage&q= [/tpl]
From the sixteenth century onwards, the language was taken to America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, author of Don Quixote, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called la lengua de Cervantes ("the language of Cervantes").[tpl]cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes| language =Spanish| url = http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf| publisher =Ministerio de la Presidencia de España|format=PDF| accessdate =2008-08-24|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl]
In the twentieth century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City. For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see Influences on the Spanish language.

==Grammar==

Spanish is a relatively inflected language, with a two-gender noun system and about fifty conjugated forms per verb, but with inflection of nouns, adjectives, and determiners limited to number and gender. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.) Spanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually—though not always—places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages.
Its sentence structure is generally subject–verb–object, although variations are common. It is a "pro-drop", or "null-subject" language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a "verb-framed" language, meaning that the direction of motion is expressed in the verb while the mode of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. subir corriendo or salir volando; the respective English equivalents of these examples—'to run up' and 'to fly out'—show that English is, by contrast, "satellite-framed", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).
Subject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.

==Phonology==

===Segmental phonology===

The Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ([tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl]) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl] to glides—[tpl]IPA|j[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl], determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs [tpl]IPA|je[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|we[/tpl] respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.
The Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate [tpl]IPA|/tʃ/[/tpl]; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents—[tpl]IPA|/b/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/d/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl], and sometimes [tpl]IPA|/ʝ/[/tpl]—which alternate between fricative and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the "tapped" and "trilled" r-sounds (single [tpl]angle bracket|r[/tpl] and double [tpl]angle bracket|rr[/tpl] in orthography).
In the following table of consonant phonemes, [tpl]IPA|/θ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ʎ/[/tpl] are marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that they are preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects they have been merged, respectively, with [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ʝ/[/tpl], in the mergers called, respectively, seseo and yeísmo. The phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ʃ/[/tpl] is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes [tpl]IPA|/b/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/d/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ʝ/[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl] appears to the right of a pair of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the voiceless phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the voiced ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and fricative pronunciations.
The letters [tpl]angle bracket|v[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|b[/tpl] normally represent the same phoneme, [tpl]IPA|/b/[/tpl], which is realized as [tpl]IPA|b[/tpl] after a nasal consonant or a pause, and as [tpl]IPA|β[/tpl] elsewhere, as in ambos [tpl]IPA|ˈambos[/tpl] ('both') envío [tpl]IPA|emˈbi.o[/tpl] ('I send'), acabar [tpl]IPA|akaˈβaɾ[/tpl] ('to finish') and mover [tpl]IPA|moˈβeɾ[/tpl] ('to move'). The Royal Spanish Academy considers the [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] pronunciation for the letter [tpl]angle bracket|v[/tpl] to be incorrect and affected. However, some Spanish speakers maintain the pronunciation of the [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] sound as it is in other western European languages. The sound [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] is used for the letter [tpl]angle bracket|v[/tpl], in the Spanish language, by a few second-language speakers in Spain whose native language is Catalan, in the Balearic Islands, in the Valencian Community, and in southern Catalonia."Se da de forma espontánea en hablantes valencianos o mallorquines y en los de algunas zonas del sur de Cataluña". Diccionario panhispánico de dudas. 1st Ed. (Octobre 2005). Grapheme v. In the USA it is also common because of the proximity and influence of English phonology, and the [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] is also occasionally used in Mexico. Some parts of Central America also use [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl], which the Royal Academy attributes to the interference of local indigenous languages.
Historically, the [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] pronunciation was uncommon, but considered correct well into the twentieth century.

===Prosody===

Spanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language, meaning that each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Cressey|1978|p=152[/tpl][tpl]Harvcoltxt|Abercrombie|1967|p=98[/tpl]
Spanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect, but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.), and rising tone for yes/no questions.John B. Dabor, Spanish Pronunciation: Theory and Practice (3rd ed.: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1997), Ch. 7[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/liberal_arts/foreign/Spanish/FLSP0501/dalvofile.html |title=John B. Dalbor's Voice Files to Accompany Spanish Pronunciation |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl] There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.
Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-last or earlier syllables. The tendencies of stress assignment are as follows:[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96[/tpl]
In addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs which contrast solely on stress such as sábana ('sheet') and sabana ('savannah'), as well as límite ('boundary'), limite ('that he/she limits') and limité ('I limited'), or also líquido ('liquid'), liquido ('I sell off') and liquidó ('he/she sold off').
The spelling system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|s[/tpl], or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last syllable; if and only if the absence of an accent mark would give the wrong stress information, an acute accent mark appears over the stressed syllable.
