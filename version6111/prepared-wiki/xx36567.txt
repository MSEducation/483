[[Outer core]]

CATEGORIES: Structure of the Earth, Geomagnetism

Earth's outer core is a liquid layer about [tpl]convert|2266|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] thick composed of iron and nickel that lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Its outer boundary lies [tpl]convert|2890|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately [tpl]convert|5150|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] beneath Earth's surface.

==Properties==

The temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 °C (8000 °F) in the outer regions to 6100 °C (11000 °F) near the inner core. Because of its high temperature, modeling work has shown that the outer core is a low viscosity fluid (about ten times the viscosity of liquid metals at the surface) that convects turbulently.[tpl]cite journal|title=The viscosity of liquid iron at the physical conditions of the Earth's core|doi=10.1038/33905|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfbdxa/pubblicazioni/nat.pdf| volume=392 | issue=6678|year=1998|last1=Gillan|first1=Michael J.|last2=De Wijs|first2=Gilles iA.|last3=Kresse|first3=Georg|last4=Vočadlo|first4=Lidunka|last5=Dobson|first5=David|last6=Alfè|first6=Dario|last7=Price|first7=Geoffrey D.|journal=Nature|pages=805|bibcode = 1998Natur.392..805D [/tpl] Eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the Earth's magnetic field. The average magnetic field strength in the Earth's outer core was measured to be 25 gauss, 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.First Measurement Of Magnetic Field Inside Earth's Core.

Sulfur and oxygen could also be present in the outer core.[tpl]Cite journal | first1=David | last1=Gubbins | first2=Binod | last2=Sreenivasan | first3=Jon | last3=Mound | first4=Sebastian | last4=Rost | title=Melting of the Earth's inner core | journal=Nature | volume=473 | pages=361–363 | date=May 19, 2011 | doi=10.1038/nature10068 | issue=7347 | pmid=21593868 |bibcode = 2011Natur.473..361G [/tpl] 
As heat is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid region to freeze, causing the solid inner core to grow. This growth rate is estimated to be 1 mm per year.[tpl]cite journal| title=Reconciling the hemispherical structure of Earth's inner core with its super-rotation | first1=Lauren | last1=Waszek | first2=Jessica | last2=Irving | first3=Arwen | last3=Deuss | journal=Nature Geoscience | volume=4 | pages=264–267 | doi=10.1038/ngeo1083 | year=2011| issue=4 |bibcode = 2011NatGe...4..264W [/tpl]

==Effect on life==

Without the outer core, life on Earth would be very different. Convection of liquid metals in the outer core creates the Earth's magnetic field.
