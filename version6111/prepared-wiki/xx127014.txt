CATEGORIES: Fantasy sports

Fantasy golf is a game in which the participants each assemble a team of real life golfers and then score points based on those players' performance in golf tournaments, with games typically following the US PGA Tour and the European Tour.Bolton, Rob.

A common variant sees a squad of golfers selected annually with a set budget based on prior performance, with weekly teams selected from the larger squads. Some fantasy golf formats, including that provided by the US PGA, focus solely on golf's Major Championships.The Majors Fantasy Challenge, PGA.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-28. Participating in fantasy golf can add enjoyment to golf viewing, as well as providing competition against other participants.
Wilfred Winkenbach devised fantasy golf in the latter part of the 1950s, in which each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of stokes at the end of the tournament would win. Golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, since you are concerned only with the scores of your team members without anything else to complicate it.
