The General Electric LMS100 is an aero derivative gas turbine produced by GE Aviation.

==Design and development==

The LMS100 PA produces approximately 100 MW at an efficiency of around 46% LHV in open cycle operation.  It is currently the largest and most efficient gas turbine which is able to produce full rated power in under 10 minutes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
The LMS100 comprises a low pressure compressor, an intercooler, a supercore and a power turbine.  The supercore (comprising HP compressor, compressor rear frame, high pressure turbine and intermediate pressure turbine) is a development of the LM6000, which in turn was based on the CF6-80C2.  The low pressure compressor is from the 6FA industrial gas turbine.
The first LMS100 engine entered commercial operation in July 2006.  It is owned and operated by Basin Electric and is near Groton.  Other operational LMS100 power stations are at Laredo, TX (USA), Firebaugh, CA (USA), Waterbury, CT (USA), Santiago (Chile),  Guemes (Argentina), Edmonton (Canada) and Conectiv Energy's Cumberland station in Millville, New Jersey, and ongoing projects (as of 2012) in Kwinana, Perth, Western Australia and Stratford, New Zealand.http://www.powermecltd.com/files/ww/Project%20List.pdf
The LMS100 PA gas turbines utilize water injection for NOx control.  The LMS100 PB gas turbine is being developed using dry low NOx (DLE) combustors.  The first LMS100 PB unit is expected to enter commercial operation in 2011.
