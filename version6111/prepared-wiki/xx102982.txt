V/Line is a not for profit regional passenger train and coach operator in Victoria, Australia. It was created after the split-up of VicRail in 1983. V/Line is owned by the V/Line Corporation which is a Victorian State Government statutory authority. V/Line operates to 85 railway stations and a larger number of coach stops, and operates 1,444 rail services and 592 coach services every week across regional Victoria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vline.com.au/about/news/en/12/157/article.aspx|title=V/Line Background|publisher=www.vline.com.au|accessdate=2008-03-27[/tpl]

All train lines experienced patronage increases during the year: Geelong 130,000 additional trips, Bendigo 90,000, Ballarat 110,000, Gippsland 90,000 and Seymour 80,000.  V/Line is also track manager of the Victorian intrastate rail network outside of the Australian Rail Track Corporation and Metro Trains Melbourne leases. It has a fleet of 134 carriages.

==History==

===As a government authority===

On 1 July 1983 the Transport Act 1983 took effect and the State Transport Authority was created along with a range of other transport bodies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewAgency&entityId=1038#|title=Public Record Office Victoria online catalogue|publisher=access.prov.vic.gov.au|accessdate=2008-03-16[/tpl] The new authority replaced VicRail, and established the V/Line operating brand for both country passenger and freight. The VicRail orange and silver 'teacup' livery used on passenger rolling stock was replaced in August 1983 by an orange and grey livery, the white and green V/Line logo also being launched at the same time.[tpl]cite book|author=Railmac Publications|title=Australian Fleetbooks: V/Line locomotives|publisher=Kitchner Press|page=5|year=1992|isbn=0-949817-76-7[/tpl]
This was altered when on 1 July 1989 the Transport (Amendment) Act took effect, merging the State Transport Authority with the Metropolitan Transit Authority to form the Public Transport Corporation. The relationship between the country V/Line and suburban 'The Met' brands was blurred, with the Sprinter trains delivered in the 1993-1995 period appearing in PTC colours but with both PTC and V/Line logos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vlinecars.com/sprinters.htm|title=V/LineCars.com - Sprinters|publisher=www.vlinecars.com|accessdate=2008-03-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307025049/http://www.vlinecars.com/sprinters.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07[/tpl]
In 1995 the freight and passenger rail divisions of V/Line were divided, with a new red, blue and white V/Line Passenger livery unveiled, which remains on some of the fleet today.[tpl]cite journal|year=2005|title=News|month=November|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)[/tpl] This split was finalised on 1 July 1997 when separate management was brought in.[tpl]cite journal|author=Peter Attenborough|date=June 2004|title=Freight Australia|journal=Australian Model Railway Magazine|pages=pages 24–27[/tpl]
In 1999 V/Line Passenger and V/Line Freight were franchised and privatised separately. National Express acquired V/Line Passenger and Freight Victoria acquired V/Line Freight. The V/Line Freight contract included a 45 year lease from the government of most regional track (passenger and freight), with responsibilities for track, signalling and level crossings, with access to passenger sections of track granted to V/Line Passenger.
V/Line operates under a franchise agreement entered into with the Director of Public Transport. The Director also sub leases tracks and other infrastructure which the Director holds under lease from VicTrack, the agency which owns Victoria's rail-related land and infrastructure.

===As a corporation===

On 29 August 1999 National Express took control of V/Line Passenger.[tpl]cite journal|author=Peter Attenborough|date=June 2006|title=V/Line Passenger|journal=Australian Model Railway Magazine|pages=pages 26–29[/tpl] It included all country rail operations in Victoria, with the exception of the West Coast Railway operated Warrnambool line and the Hoys Roadlines operated Shepparton line, previously franchised in 1993. In 2004 operational difficulties hit the two privately operated lines, and they came back under the control of V/Line.
In December 2002 National Express handed in its Victorian rail and tram franchises having been unable to renegotiate financial terms with the State Government.National Express walks out of Australian rail service The Telegraph (London) 17 December 2002[tpl]cite web|title=The long goodbye|author=Richard Web|work=The Age|date=14 March 2004|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/13/1078594612786.html|accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl]Nat Express pull back Down Under The Telegraph (London) 3 September 2004
Full control was taken on 1 October 2003 by changing the shareholding of V/Line, making the government the sole shareholder via a recently created statutory corporation, V/Line Passenger Corporation.
In 2000 the Regional Fast Rail project was launched to upgrade the tracks linking Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. The project, which also included new rolling stock and an expanded timetable of rail services, commenced full operations from December 2005.
In November 2006 Pacific National, who had purchased Freight Australia, entered into an agreement to sell the remainder of its Victorian rail lease of the network back to the Victorian Government for $133.8 m.[tpl]cite news|title= Toll sells rail lease|pages=17|publisher=Canberra Times|date=2 November 2006[/tpl] The sale was completed on 7 May 2007, with V/Line becoming the track manager of the Victorian intrastate network.
In May 2008 it was announced that part of the V/Line fleet would be converted to standard gauge to operate an upgraded Albury-Wodonga line service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/federal-state-co-operation-delivers-major-rail-project.html|title=Premier of Victoria, Australia - Federal-State Co-operation Delivers Major Rail Project|publisher=www.premier.vic.gov.au|accessdate=2008-05-30[/tpl] In December 2008 V/Line ended the sale of alcoholic beverages aboard long-distance trains, after almost a century of the practice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/no-more-making-a-vline-for-the-bar-20081222-73nn.html|title=No more making a V/Line for the bar|work=The Age|author=Kate Lahey|date=23 December 2008|publisher=theage.com.au|accessdate=2008-12-23[/tpl]
In 2010, the subsidy per passenger trip dropped to $18.68, down from $19.42 in 2009.http://www.vline.com.au/pdf/publications/annualreports/annualreport09-10.pdf
The Transport Integration Act renamed the V/Line Passenger Corporation as V/Line Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tia20106o2010320/s128.html|title=Transport Integration Act 2010 (No 6 of 2010) - Section 128 V/Line Corporation|publisher=www.austlii.edu.au|accessdate=2010-06-04[/tpl] The Act also gave V/Line a new statutory charter.

==Services==

V/Line operates rail services to the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Seymour and Traralgon as well as Ararat, Maryborough, Echuca, Swan Hill, Albury,  Bairnsdale, Warrnambool and Shepparton. In addition, V/Line road coaches connect with many rail services at major stations to serve towns away from the main rail network.Timetables V/Line
Rail services are grouped into two types. As part of the introduction of Myki on V/Line in 2013, and to provide consistent communication to both staff and customers, what were formerly called "Interurban" services became "Commuter" services, and what were formerly called "Intercity" services became "Long Distance" services. Commuter services operate over shorter distances and more frequently than Long Distance services, and the latter usually provide some first-class accommodation, as well as snack bar facilities.
All rail services depart from Southern Cross railway station in Melbourne on the following lines with the exception of one Traralgon service which departs/ terminates at Flinders Street Station
Rail services once extended to Dimboola, Mildura, Cobram and Leongatha but were discontinued in 1993.[tpl]cite journal|year=1997|month=March|title=Rail Passenger Service Withdrawals Since 1960|author=Chris Banger|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)|pages=pages 77–82[/tpl]
The services to Ararat and Bairnsdale were also withdrawn in 1993, but restored in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/09/1089000351659.html?from=storyrhs|title=Ararat sleepers awake to new sound - the train|work=The Age|author=Liz Gooch|date=10 July 2004|publisher=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl] In December 2008, as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, the state government announced that V/Line rail passenger services would be extended from Ballarat to Maryborough station at a cost of $50 million, commencing in July 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www4.transport.vic.gov.au/vtp/projects/maryborough.html|title=Maryborough Rail Extension Projects|work=Victorian Transport Plan|publisher=www4.transport.vic.gov.au|accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/web23/Home.nsf/AllDocs/2e119eebf81209d2ca257625001ae39c?OpenDocument|title=Maryborough Rail Services|work=Victorian Transport Plan|publisher=www.transport.vic.gov.au|accessdate=2010-07-05[/tpl] The first passenger train in 15 years arrived at Maryborough on 24 July 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Maryborough gets its train back|url=http://enews.transport.vic.gov.au/link/id/43867894c7ae52ed79c4P71790394b4a92fa6b7d2/page.html|work=Transport Projects eNews August 2010|publisher=Department of Transport|accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl]
The resumption of V/Line services to Leongatha and Cobram has been sought by communities along both of these lines, but much of the track has now been removed. A recent report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee-Rup as a key planning priority.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
V/line also runs numerous intrastate and interstate road coach services that may run wholly as a coach service or operate as a coach connecting with a rail service.
Interstate road coach service operated by V/line are:

==Ticketing==

V/Line currently uses machine printed paper tickets, issued from staffed V/Line stations, selected Metro suburban premium stations, V/Line ticket agents, online or by phone. Passengers boarding services at unmanned stations or roadside coach stops can purchase tickets from the train conductor or coach driver.
Tickets have the origin and destination printed upon them, making them point to point, but the fare itself is based on charging zones.Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual 2008: Chapter 3 - V/Line travel Metlink Changes were made to the fare system, to integrate it with the suburban Metcard system in preparation for the introduction of the Myki smartcard system to cover the entire state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vline.com.au/fares/fares/vline_metlink_integration.html|title=V/Line - V/Line & Metlink ticket integration|publisher=www.vline.com.au|accessdate=2008-03-27[/tpl]

==Fleet==

V/Line currently operates a mix of diesel multiple unit (DMUs) and locomotive hauled trains. Most are on broad gauge, however three N class locomotives have been converted to standard gauge to operate the Albury line. The carriage fleet is currently undergoing a refurbishment program, with the Sprinter fleet recently completing their own refurbishment program.
Diesel multiple units:
Locomotives:
Carriages:
Road coaches:
When initially formed, V/Line used the fleet of the Victorian Railways, including a wide variety of diesel and electric locomotives, passenger carriages, railmotors and rail cars, guards vans, and freight vehicles. A division was made between V/Line Freight and V/Line Passenger operations in 1995, with it formalised by July 1997,[tpl]cite journal|author=Peter Attenborough|date=June 2004|title=Freight Australia|journal=Australian Model Railway Magazine|pages=page 24–27[/tpl] the locomotive fleet was divided between the two new entities along with the relevant rolling stock. Only the VLocity units have been acquired since this time.

==Network access==

V/Line also manages and maintains all non-interstate rural rail track in Victoria, including lines that do not see passenger services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vline.com.au/rna/rna/introduction.html|title=Introduction to RNA|work=V/Line ~ Network Access|publisher=www.vline.com.au|accessdate=2008-10-14[/tpl] The lease was previously held by Pacific National, who entered into an agreement to sell it back to the Victorian Government for $133.8 million in November 2006, with the sale completed in May 2007 with V/Line appointed to manage it.[tpl]cite web|title=Rail Buy Back Deal Complete|work=Minister for Public Transport (Media Release)|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/b0222c68d27626e2ca256c8c001a3d2d/6f0846798c60e597ca2572d4007d9d99!OpenDocument|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=2008-02-05[/tpl]

==Branding==

The initial V/Line visual identity was unveiled in August 1983, with an orange and grey livery for locomotives and passenger rolling stock, along with a white and green V/Line logo with a "stylised capital lettered logo with the V and the L split by a deep slashing stroke".[tpl]cite book|author=Norm Bray & Peter J Vincent|title=Bogie Freight Wagons of Victoria|publisher=Brief History Books|year=2006|isbn=0-9775056-0-X|page=14[/tpl] Work on the initial V/Line identity started in May 1983, with freight wagons being released without logos pending the launch. Before that time, a stylised VR logo was carried by rolling stock that had been received the orange and silver VicRail 'teacup' livery since 1981. Carriages in the 'teacup' livery later had the logos removed and replaced by V/Line ones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vlinecars.com/liveries.htm|title=V/LineCars.com - Carriage Liveries|publisher=vlinecars.com|accessdate=2008-10-16[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
This remained until 1993 when the Sprinter trains were delivered in the teal and yellow suburban 'The Met' brand colours, but with both The Met and V/Line logos. In 1995, the freight and passenger rail divisions of V/Line were divided, with locomotives in the freight fleet retaining the orange and grey livery with 'V/Line Freight' logos, while passenger carriages and locomotive received the red blue and white 'V/Line Passenger' livery which remains on some of the fleet today. It was also at that time that the V/Line logo was altered, with serifs added to the lettering, and the "deep slashing stroke" was altered to a curved blue line. After National Express took over V/Line, the logo was again altered in 2000, with mixed-case lettering and a curving blue line underneath. In 2006, it was again altered, with the removal of the blue line underneath and addition of a purple line.
The VLocity railcars were delivered from 2005 in a totally new livery of stainless steel with purple and green highlights. In 2007, a new livery was unveiled, consisting of a grey carbody with red, white and purple stripes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vlinecars.com/fleetrefurb/launch.htm|title=V/LineCars.com - Carriage and Sprinter Refurbishment Program & New V/Line Livery - Ministerial & Media Launch|publisher=www.vlinecars.com|accessdate=2008-10-16|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080720002722/http://www.vlinecars.com/fleetrefurb/launch.htm |archivedate = 2008-07-20[/tpl] Rolling stock in different variants of the livery was released throughout that year, with a consistent version not appearing until 2008, along with a number of repainted locomotives.
