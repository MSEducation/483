[[Seniority in the United States Senate]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of United States Senators by seniority

Seniority in the United States Senate is valuable as it confers a number of perquisites and is based on length of continuous service, with ties broken by a series of factors. Customarily, the terms "senior senator" and "junior senator" are used to distinguish the two senators representing a particular state.

==Benefits of seniority==

The United States Constitution does not mandate differences in rights or power, but Senate rules give more power to senators with more seniority. Generally, senior senators will have more power, especially within their own caucuses. In addition, by custom, senior senators from the president's party control federal patronage appointments in their states. Thus, being the junior senator may be disadvantageous if the senior senator is also from the same party.
There are several perquisites, including the following:

==Determination of seniority==

A senator's seniority is primarily determined by length of continuous service: a senator who has served for 12 years is more senior than one who has served for 10 years. Because several new senators usually join at the beginning of a new Congress, there are eight tiebreakers:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senators_chronological.htm |title=A Chronological List of United States Senators 1789–present |publisher=Senate Historical Office[/tpl]
When more than one senator has served in the same previous role, length of time in that prior office is used to break the tie. For instance, Barbara Mikulski, Richard Shelby, John McCain and Harry Reid all took office on January 3, 1987, and each had previously served in the House of Representatives. Mikulski, having served 10 years, is more senior than Shelby, who served 8. They are both more senior than McCain and Reid, who each served 4 years. McCain, however, outranks Reid because Arizona's population was higher than Nevada's as of the 1980 census.

==Current seniority list==

The president pro tempore of the Senate is traditionally the most senior member of the majority party. Only relevant factors are listed below. For senators whose seniority is based on their states' respective populations, the state population ranking is given as determined by the relevant United States Census.1981 U.S Census Report Contains 1980 Census results. 1991 U.S Census Report Contains 1990 Census results.[tpl]cite web |author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title=2000 Census State Population Rankings |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=May 28, 2010[/tpl]Resident Population Data (Text Version) – 2010 Census Contains 1910 to 2010 results by state and census region.
