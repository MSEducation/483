In early 2003, Nural signed their first Record deal with Hopeless Records. They then released their first full-length album titled The Weight Of The World on August 9, 2005. In the beginning of the summer of 2005, they began touring as one of the bands on the Warped Tour, and their single "Tension" appeared as one the songs on that year's Warped Tour compilation album from Side One Dummy Records.  Nural has been between labels for quite some time now and the release of their second album, Entitlement, has been up in the air.  Nural posted a blog on their Myspace on February 3, 2009 stating that they are releasing their album on DownloadPunk.com digitally. They're still working on album and art and a book for their official release. Nural released Entitlement B-Sides on September 14, 2010 on iTunes.
Their music also appeared on the soundtrack to the Discovery Channel movie, Drift: The Sideways Craze.
Nural  unofficially broke up in 2009 after a legal battle with their management. Several of the members have moved on to different projects. Most noticeably, Kyle Castellani has released a solo album in 2011 and continues to write music for other artists.
