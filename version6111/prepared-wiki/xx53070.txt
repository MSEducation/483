==History==

The golf club dates from 1914, when public utility magnate Clarence H. Geist founded the Seaview Country Club.  The original golf course, known today as the Bay Course, was partially designed by Hugh Wilson (who also designed the two courses at Merion Golf Club) and opened in 1915.  The following year, Donald Ross completed the course by adding the sand bunkers.  In 1998, the course was restored by Bob Cupp Jr. to be close to the original design.  Today the course plays as a par 71, [tpl]convert|6247|yd[/tpl] from the back tees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://golfdigest.com/courses/critic/index.ssf?/courses/critic/seaview.html|title=Golf Digest Course Critic: Seaview Marriott Resort & Spa, Galloway Township, N.J.|last=Whitten|first=Ron|accessdate=2006-11-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061030133756/http://www.golfdigest.com/courses/critic/index.ssf?/courses/critic/seaview.html  |archivedate = 2006-10-30[/tpl]  In 2006, the hole numbers were rearranged to improve logistics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/news/travel/northeast/seaview051706.cfm|title=Mid-Course Correction|author=PGA.com news services|accessdate=2006-11-18[/tpl]
In 1929, the club opened a nine-hole course designed by William S. Flynn and Howard C. Toomey. A second nine holes were built by Flynn disciple William Gordon in 1957, and the rearranged layout became known as the Pines Course.  Three holes were removed in 1990 to make room for a practice facility, with replacements designed by Al Janis.  Today, the course is [tpl]convert|6731|yd[/tpl] from the back tees and is also a par 71.
In 1984, the Marriott Corporation bought the club, and turned it into a resort open to the public. Mariott sold the property to LaSalle Hotel Properties in 1998, but continued to manage it until 2009."Galloway Township residents worry about loss of tax revenue if nonprofit Stockton buys $16.2 million Seaview", The Press of Atlantic City, July 4, 2010. Dolce Hotels and Resorts took over management of the hotel and Troon Golf was retained to manage the golf courses."Dolce to manage historic resort Seaview", www.hotelworldnetwork.com, April 28, 2009.
In 2009, Seaview was honored by Golfweek magazine as one of the “Best Courses You Can Play” in New Jersey, and by Golf World magazine with a 2009 Readers' Choice Award.
In July 2010, it was reported that the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey was negotiating with LaSalle Hotel Properties regarding the possible purchase of the hotel. On September 1, 2010, Stockton College finalized the deal for 20 million.

===Tournaments===

The Seaview Country Club hosted the 1942 PGA Championship, then a match play event. Sam Snead won the final match at 2 & 1 over Jim Turnesa to claim the first of his seven major championships. He closed out the match by holing a [tpl]convert|60|ft|sing=on[/tpl] chip shot for birdie on the 35th hole.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pgamediaguide.com/pgachampionship.cfm|title=PGA Championship History|accessdate=2006-11-18[/tpl]  A composite course was used for the event, using the front nine of the Bay Course coupled with the nine holes designed by Flynn.
In 1986, the Bay Course hosted the inaugural Atlantic City Classic, an LPGA Tour event, and did so again the following year.  The tournament, by then named the ShopRite LPGA Classic, returned in 1998 and remained at the club through 2006, and was revived as an annual event in 2010.
