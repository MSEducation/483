==Playing career==

Bradley grew up in the rural Ottawa suburb of Stittsville, Ontario and played most of his minor hockey for the local Stittsville Rams "C" teams as well as AA for the Ottawa Valley Titans of the ODHA.
After a solid Bantam season in 1993-94 with the Titans, Bradley was drafted and signed with the Cumberland Grads of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL).  He spent the 1994-95 season with the Grads before being selected in the 2nd round (31st overall) of the 1995 OHL Priority Selection by the Kingston Frontenacs.
Bradley was drafted by the San Jose Sharks in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, in the fourth round, 102nd overall. Prior to signing with the Washington Capitals, he also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins and San Jose Sharks.
Though he is not an offensive powerhouse, Bradley effectively carved out a niche for himself as a tough, checking line winger.  In the 2007–08 season, Bradley doubled his fight total from the previous year, had a career-high 111 shots on goal, and was third among Capitals forwards in hits, even though he had the second lowest amount of ice time.  Bradley improved his plus/minus rating in every season from 2003 to 2008.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2008/04/2007-08-rink-wrap-matt-bradley.html | title = Rink Wrap Matt Bradley | publisher = japersrink.com | date = 2008-04-27 | accessdate = 2009-03-24[/tpl]

On July 3, 2011, Bradley signed a two-year, one-way contract with the Florida Panthers. In the 2011–12 season, Bradley appeared in only 45 games, his lowest since his rookie season, recording 8 points. With a limited role and dwindling future prospects in June of 2012, the Panthers placed Bradley on waivers and subsequently bought out his remaining year on his contract.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/28/panthers-to-buy-out-bradley.html#comments |  title = Panthers to buy out Bradley  | publisher = NBC Sports | date = 2012-04-06 | accessdate = 2012-04-06[/tpl]
