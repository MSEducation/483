3G, short for third Generation, is the third generation of mobile telecommunications technology.[tpl]cite web |title=IMT-2000 Project - ITU |author=ITU |url=http://www.itu.int/osg/imt-project/docs/What_is_IMT2000.ppt |date=4 July 2002 |accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl] This is based on a set of standards used for mobile devices and mobile telecommunication use services and networks that comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications by the International Telecommunication Union.Clint Smith, Daniel Collins. "3G Wireless Networks", page 136. 2000. 3G finds application in wireless voice telephony, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV.
3G telecommunication networks support services that provide an information transfer rate of at least 200 kbit/s. Later 3G releases, often denoted 3.5G and 3.75G, also provide mobile broadband access of several Mbit/s to smartphones and mobile modems in laptop computers. This ensures it can be applied to wireless voice telephony, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV technologies.
A new generation of cellular standards has appeared approximately every tenth year since 1G systems were introduced in 1981/1982. Each generation is characterized by new frequency bands, higher data rates and non–backward-compatible transmission technology. The first release of the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard does not completely fulfill the ITU 4G requirements called IMT-Advanced. First release LTE is not backward-compatible with 3G, but is a pre-4G or 3.9G technology,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] however sometimes branded 4G by the service providers. Its evolution LTE Advanced is a 4G technology. WiMAX is another technology verging on or marketed as 4G.

==Overview==

Several telecommunications companies market wireless mobile Internet services as 3G, indicating that the advertised service is provided over a 3G wireless network. Services advertised as 3G are required to meet IMT-2000 technical standards, including standards for reliability and speed (data transfer rates). To meet the IMT-2000 standards, a system is required to provide peak data rates of at least 200 kbit/s (about 0.2 Mbit/s). However, many services advertised as 3G provide higher speed than the minimum technical requirements for a 3G service. Recent 3G releases, often denoted 3.5G and 3.75G, also provide mobile broadband access of several Mbit/s to smartphones and mobile modems in laptop computers.
The following standards are typically branded 3G:
The above systems and radio interfaces are based on spread spectrum radio transmission technology. While the GSM EDGE standard ("2.9G"), DECT cordless phones and Mobile WiMAX standards formally also fulfill the IMT-2000 requirements and are approved as 3G standards by ITU, these are typically not branded 3G, and are based on completely different technologies.
The following common standards comply with the IMT2000/3G standard:
While DECT cordless phones and Mobile WiMAX standards formally also fulfill the IMT-2000 requirements, they are not usually considered due to their rarity and unsuitability for usage with mobile phones.

===Detailed breakdown of 3G systems===

The 3G (UMTS and CDMA2000) research and development projects started in 1992. In 1999, ITU approved five radio interfaces for IMT-2000 as a part of the ITU-R M.1457 Recommendation; WiMAX was added in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2007/30.html|title=ITU Radiocommunication Assembly approves new developments for its 3G standards|author=ITU|work=press release|accessdate=1 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090519050045/http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2007/30.html| archivedate= 19 May 2009 [/tpl]
There are evolutionary standards (EDGE and CDMA) that are backward-compatible extensions to pre-existing 2G networks as well as revolutionary standards that require all-new network hardware and frequency allocations. The cell phones used utilise UMTS in combination with 2G GSM standards and bandwidths, but do not support EDGE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/imt-2000/DocumentsIMT2000/What_really_3G.pdf|author=ITU|title=What really is a Third Generation (3G)(3G) Mobile Technology|accessdate=1 June 2009|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090612050908/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/imt-2000/DocumentsIMT2000/What_really_3G.pdf| archivedate= 12 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The latter group is the UMTS family, which consists of standards developed for IMT-2000, as well as the independently developed standards DECT and WiMAX, which were included because they fit the IMT-2000 definition.

While EDGE fulfills the 3G specifications, most GSM/UMTS phones report EDGE ("2.75G") and UMTS ("3G") functionality.

==History==

3G technology is the result of research and development work carried out by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the early 1980s. 3G specifications and standards were developed in fifteen years. The technical specifications were made available to the public under the name IMT-2000. The communication spectrum between 400 MHz to 3 GHz was allocated for 3G. Both the government and communication companies approved the 3G standard.[tpl]cite web|title=3G cellular standards and characteristics|url=http://tikonaplans.blogspot.in/2012/07/3g-cellular-standards-and.html[/tpl]  The first pre-commercial 3G network was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1998,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nttdocomo.com/pr/1999/001070.html |title=A Brand New Mobile Millennium Ericsson/CATT/DoCoMo jointly demonstrate pioneering W-CDMA technology at PT/Wireless | Press Center | NTT DOCOMO Global |publisher=Nttdocomo.com |date=9 November 1999 |accessdate=30 October 2012[/tpl] branded as FOMA. It was first available in May 2001 as a pre-release (test) of W-CDMA technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umtsworld.com/umts/history.htm|title=The history of UMTS and 3G development[/tpl] The first commercial launch of 3G was also by NTT DoCoMo in Japan on 1 October 2001, although it was initially somewhat limited in scope;[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.hktdc.com/imn/01100401/info14.htm|title=World's first 3G launch on 1 October severely restricted (hktdc.com)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadbandmag.co.uk/analysis/3G/3G.html|title=broadbandmag.co.uk/3G grinds to a start[/tpl] broader availability of the system was delayed by apparent concerns over its reliability.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/04/43253|title=DoCoMo Delays 3G Launch | work=Wired | date=24 April 2001[/tpl]
The first European pre-commercial network was an UMTS network on the Isle of Man by Manx Telecom, the operator then owned by British Telecom, and the first commercial network (also UMTS based W-CDMA) in Europe was opened for business by Telenor in December 2001 with no commercial handsets and thus no paying customers.
The first network to go commercially live was by SK Telecom in South Korea on the CDMA-based 1xEV-DO technology in January 2002. By May 2002 the second South Korean 3G network was by KT on EV-DO and thus the South Koreans were the first to see competition among 3G operators.
The first commercial United States 3G network was by Monet Mobile Networks, on CDMA2000 1x EV-DO technology, but this network provider later shut down operations. The second 3G network operator in the USA was Verizon Wireless in July 2002 also on CDMA2000 1x EV-DO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.vzw.com/news/2002/06/pr2002-06-28.html|title=Verizon Wireless Launching New High-Speed 3G Wireless Network[/tpl] AT&T Mobility is also a true 3G UMTS network, having completed its upgrade of the 3G network to HSUPA.
The first pre-commercial demonstration network in the southern hemisphere was built in Adelaide, South Australia by m.Net Corporation in February 2002 using UMTS on 2,100 MHz. This was a demonstration network for the 2002 IT World Congress. The first commercial 3G network was launched by Hutchison Telecommunications branded as Three or "3" in June 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hutchison.com.au/About/AboutHutchison.aspx |title=About Hutchison |publisher=Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=2012-04-07[/tpl]
Emtel launched the first 3G network in Africa.

==Adoption==

3G was relatively slow to be adopted globally. In some instances, 3G networks do not use the same radio frequencies as 2G so mobile operators must build entirely new networks and license entirely new frequencies, especially so to achieve high data transmission rates. Other delays were due to the expenses of upgrading transmission hardware, especially for UMTS, whose deployment required the replacement of most broadcast towers. Due to these issues and difficulties with deployment, many carriers were not able to or delayed acquisition of these updated capabilities.
In December 2007, 190 3G networks were operating in 40 countries and 154 HSDPA networks were operating in 71 countries, according to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA). In Asia, Europe, Canada and the USA, telecommunication companies use W-CDMA technology with the support of around 100 terminal designs to operate 3G mobile networks.
Roll-out of 3G networks was delayed in some countries by the enormous costs of additional spectrum licensing fees. (See Telecoms crash.) The license fees in some European countries were particularly high, bolstered by government auctions of a limited number of licenses and sealed bid auctions, and initial excitement over 3G's potential.
The 3G standard is perhaps well known because of a massive expansion of the mobile communications market post-2G and advances of the consumer mophone. An especially notable development during this time is the smartphone (for example, the iPhone, and the Android family), combining the abilities of a PDA with a mobile phone, leading to widespread demand for mobile internet connectivity. 3G has also introduced the term "mobile broadband" because its speed and capability make it a viable alternative for internet browsing, and USB Modems connecting to 3G networks are becoming increasingly common.

===Market penetration===

By June 2007, the 200 millionth 3G subscriber had been connected. This is only 6.7% of the 3 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide. (When counting CDMA2000 1x RTT customers—max bitrate 72% of the 200kbit/s which defines 3G—the total size of the nearly-3G subscriber base was 475 million as of June 2007, which was 15.8% of all subscribers worldwide.)  In the countries where 3G was launched first – Japan and South Korea – 3G penetration is over 70%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plus8star.com/?p=123 |title=Plus 8 Star presentation, "Is 3G a Dog or a Demon – Hints from 7 years of 3G Hype in Asia" |publisher=Plus8star.com |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl] In Europe the leading country[tpl]when|date=September 2013[/tpl] for 3G penetration is Italy with a third of its subscribers migrated to 3G. Other leading countries[tpl]when|date=September 2013[/tpl] for 3G use include UK, Austria, Australia and Singapore at the 20% migration level.
According to ITU estimates,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/a |title=Global mobile statistics 2013 Part A: Mobile subscribers; handset market share; mobile operators |publisher=mobiThinking |date=May 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl]  as of Q4 2012 there were 2096 million active mobile-broadband[tpl]vague|date=September 2013[/tpl] subscribers worldwide out of a total of 6835 million subscribers—this is just over 30%.  About half the mobile-broadband subscriptions are for subscribers in developed nations, 934 million out of 1600 million total, well over 50%. Note however that there is a distinction between a phone with mobile-broadband connectivity and a smart phone with a large display and so on—although according [tpl]cite web|url=http://mobithinking.com/blog/100-million-club |title=The 100 million club: the top 10 mobile markets by number of mobile subscriptions |publisher=mobiThinking |date=2012-12-13 |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl] to the ITU and informatandm.com the USA has 321 million mobile subscriptions, including 256 million that are 3G or 4G, which is both 80% of the subscriber base and 80% of the USA population, according  to ComScore just a year earlier in Q4 2011 only about 42% of people surveyed in the USA reported they owned a smart phone.  In Japan, 3G penetration was similar at about 81%, but smart phone ownership was lower at about 17%.

==Patents==

It has been estimated that there are almost 8,000 patents declared essential (FRAND) related to the 483 technical specifications which form the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engpaper.com/3g-cellular-standards-and-patents.html|title=3G CELLULAR STANDARDS AND PATENTS|publisher=engpaper.com|accessdate=2012-06-24| date=13 June 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nds3.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Press/sidebars_new_concept/Other_materials/wirelesscom2005.pdf|title=3G CELLULAR STANDARDS AND PATENTS|publisher=Polytechnic Institute of New York University|author=David J. Goodman|work=IEEE Wireless com|accessdate=2012-06-24| date=13 June 2005[/tpl] Twelve companies accounted in 2004 for 90% of the patents (Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola, Philips, NTT DoCoMo, Siemens, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Hitachi, InterDigital, and Matsushita).
Even then, some patents essential to 3G might have not been declared by their patent holders. It is believed that Nortel and Lucent have undisclosed patents essential to these standards.
Furthermore, the existing 3G Patent Platform Partnership pool has little impact on FRAND protection, because it excludes the four largest patents owners for 3G.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/files/standards_policy/ipr-workshop/ipr_study_final_report_en.pdf|title=Study on the Interplay between Standards and Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2012-06-24| date=18 July 2009|quote=Pools that cover only a fraction of the actual IPR for a standard are not very useful. It is essential that the large licensees sign up. Examples of pools that have little impact are the 3G Licensing pool (which excludes the four largest IPR owners for 3G) and the 802.11 pool by ViaLicensing.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4037906/Possible-showstoppers-shadow-3G-patent-pool|title=Possible 'showstoppers' shadow 3G patent pool |publisher=eetimes.com |accessdate=2012-06-24|date=21 May 1999|quote=Even so, Qualcomm (San Diego) is still a wild card in the patent-pooling effort. Qualcomm was a member of the UMTS group when it was formed in February 1998, but deactivated its membership last September.[/tpl]

==Features==

===Data rates===

ITU has not provided a clear[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]vague|date=September 2013[/tpl] definition of the data rate users can expect from 3G equipment or providers. Thus users sold 3G service may not be able to point to a standard and say that the rates it specifies are not being met.  While stating in commentary that "it is expected that IMT-2000 will provide higher transmission rates: a minimum data rate of 2 Mbit/s for stationary or walking users, and 384 kbit/s in a moving vehicle,"[ref]
