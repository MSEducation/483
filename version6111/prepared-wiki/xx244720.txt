==Ecclesiastical parishes==

The Church of Ireland parish has two places of worship within the Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The most historic building is Kilmore Cathedral and is the seat of the Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The first church was built by St. Feithlimidh in the sixth century. In 1454, Bishop Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Andrew McBrady) had this ancient church rebuilt and was given permission by Pope Nicholas V to be the bishop's cathedral. In the 17th century, Bishop Moigne had the cathedral renovated and a bishop's residence built. However, by 1858, the cathedral was described as "decayed, dilapidated and too small to accommodate the parishioners", and so a new cathedral was built in the grounds of the Bishop's Palace at a cost of £8000. It had been planned to demolish to old cathedral, but it was saved and is now used as the Parochial Hall.St. Feithlimidh's Cathedral, Kilmore. Travelmania. Retrieved on 29 May 2011.

The Rt. Rev. Dr. William Bedell (Irish: Uilliam Beidil; 1571-1642), Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Kilmore, is believed to be buried in the churchyard of Kilmore Cathedral. Bishop Bedell, a former Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, is famous for commissioning a translation of the Old Testament into Irish. Most of this translation was carried out by The Rev. Muircheartach Óg Ó Cíonga, the Anglican Rector of Templeport. Bedell was also very respected by the native Gaelic, Irish Catholic population of County Cavan.
Quite close to Kilmore Cathedral is the See House (also known as the Bishop's Palace), the former official residence of the Church of Ireland Lord Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The house was built in the late Georgian style in the 1830s and was designed by William Farrell.
