==Transportation==

Sitka is only accessible by boat or plane as it is a series of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Vehicles are usually brought to Sitka via the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system.  However, a vehicle is not an absolute necessity in Sitka, Alaska, as there are only 14 miles of road from one end of the island to another. Most everything is within walking distance from the downtown area which is where a majority of employers are situated. There is also public transportation available.
By air, Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport offers service from jet and regional carrier Alaska Airlines and charter and bush community carrier Harris Aircraft Services.
Delays in fall and winter due to Sitka's weather are frequent. The airport is located on Japonski Island, which is connected to Baranof Island by the O'Connell Bridge. The O'Connell Bridge, completed in 1972, was the first vehicular cable-stayed bridge in the United States. The Sitka Seaplane Base is seaplane landing area situated in the Sitka Channel, adjacent to the airport.
Ferry travel back and forth to Juneau, Ketchikan and other towns in Southeast Alaska is provided through the Alaska Marine Highway System. The ferry terminal is located [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] north of downtown and a ferry ticket costs about $49 per person each way to Juneau, Alaska (as of July 2013). Vehicles, pets and bicycles can also be taken on the ferry for an additional charge.
Sitka's location on the outer coast of the Alaska Panhandle is removed from routes run through Chatham Strait. This, in addition to the tides of Peril Straits that allow mainline vessels through only at slack tide combine to result in no designated service by a vessel and minimal service overall. However, the AMHS is often the mode of transportation of choice when the schedule proves convenient because of its much cheaper cost.
Alaska Marine Lines, a barge and freight company, also has the ability to move cars to other communities connected to the mainland by road systems.
A three-way partnership of non-profits Center for Community, Sitka Tribe of Alaska, and Southeast Senior Services offers public bus transit, funded by the Federal Transit Administration and the Alaska Department of Transportation.  All buses are fully accessible, with services from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
