Lake Barombi Mbo or Barombi-ma-Mbu is a lake near Kumba in the Southwest Region of Cameroon. It is located in the Cameroon volcanic chain, and is the largest volcanic lake in this region. It is one of the oldest radiocarbon-dated lakes in Africa.Past climate variability through Europe and Africa On old colonial maps the area was known as Elefanten Sea (Elephant Lake), but the elephants living in the area were extirpated due to ivory trading.Elephants and Their Interactions with People and Vegetation in the Waza-Logone Region, Cameroon, Part I Introduction and General Background, 1.1 The Problem, pg 3.
Until now, 15 species of fishes have been recorded from the lake.Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2008). Western Equatorial Crater Lakes. Among others, this includes a member of the Barbus aboinensis group, a member of the Fundulopanchax mirabilis group, and the endemic catfish Clarias maclareni. Perhaps most noteworthy are the 11 species of cichlids that are endemic to the lake (Konia spp., Stomatepia spp., Myaka myaka, Pungu maclareni, Sarotherodon caroli, S. linnellii, S. lohbergeri,  and S. steinbachi), and likely the results of sympatric speciation.Schliewen, U.K., Tautz, D., and Pääbo, S. (1994). Sympatric speciation suggested by monophyly of crater lake cichlids. Nature 368(6472): 629-632. All the endemics are seriously threatened by pollution and sedimentation from human activities, and potentially also by large emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the lake's bottom (compare Lake Nyos).[tpl]IUCN2010|assessors=Moelants, T.|year=2009|id=20865|title=Stomatepia mongo|downloaded=29 April 2011|version=2010.4[/tpl][tpl]IUCN2010|assessors=Moelants, T.|year=2009|id=11054|title=Konia dikume|downloaded=29 April 2011|version=2010.4[/tpl][tpl]IUCN2010|assessors=Moelants, T.|year=2009|id=11055|title=Konia eisentrauti|downloaded=29 April 2011|version=2010.4[/tpl] Commercial fishing is forbidden in the lake. Additionally, the lake has an endemic species of sponge (Corvospongilla thysi), and an endemic species of shrimp (Caridina sp.).
