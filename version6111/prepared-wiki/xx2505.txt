===Tenure===

A friend and fellow White House aide, Christopher Cox, won a southern Orange County seat in the same election.
In 2011, Rohrabacher voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362?page=1
During a trip to Iraq in June 2011, he said that Iraq should pay back the U.S. for all the money it had spent since the invasion, when it becomes a wealthy country. Rohrabacher also commented he would be holding a hearing with the Sub-Committee on Oversight and Investigations into if Iraq committed "crimes against humanity" at Camp Ashraf when a massacre occurred last April. The incident left 34 residents killed and over 300 wounded. The delegation was denied access to the camp by Iraqi government, citing their sovereignty. Rohrabacher's delegation was subsequently asked to leave the country.[tpl]cite news|title=Dana Rohrabacher, U.S. Congressman, Suggests That Iraq Pay Back U.S. For War Cos|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/10/dana-rohrabacher-iraq-war-cost_n_875163.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=June 11, 2011|date=2011-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/war-zones/iraq-bars-us-visit-to-iranian-camp/2011/06/10/AGqpHFPH_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=William | last=Wan | date=2011-06-10 | title=Iraq bars U.S. visit to Iranian camp[/tpl]
On November 4, 2005, the Los Angeles Times reported that Rohrabacher was paid 23,000 dollars for a thirty year old screen play of his. At issue was whether the producer paid him for the screenplay or for the introductions to congressional and federal officials. Rohrabacher claims that the introductions were made in good faith, were nothing that was not done regularly for legitimate causes, and that the introductions have only become an issue because of Joseph Medawar's misdeeds.
In May 2006, Rohrabacher announced through his press secretary that he would return the $23,000. The decision was made public shortly before Medawar took responsibility in a United States District Court for bilking $3.4 million from about 50 investors.[tpl]cite news|title=Rohrabacher to Give Back $23,000 – Los Angeles Times | first1=Greg | last1=Krikorian | first2=Christine | last2=Hanley | date=2006-05-17[/tpl]

In January 2004, Rohrabacher proposed giving Washington, D.C. residents the right to vote for congressional representation by treating them as Maryland residents for the purpose of Congressional elections.[tpl]cite news |title= Congressional Record of January 20, 2004 |publisher= Committee for the Capital City |date= 2006-01-20  |url =http://washingtonmd.org/Rohrabacher.htm |accessdate= 2008-05-22[/tpl]
In a debate at Orange Coast College, he voiced his support for Proposition 8, which defines marriage in California as only between a man and a woman, and said that he "would suggest not changing the definition of marriage in our society to make a small number of people feel more comfortable."

==Political positions==

===Afghanistan===

Rohrabacher's interest in Afghanistan extends back at least to the late 80s, before his time in office, when he entered the country in the company of mujahedin fighters who were intent on confronting Soviet occupation forces. Reportedly, these fighters "actually engaged Soviet troops in combat near the city of Jalalabad during the two months Rohrabacher was with them."[tpl]cite news | title = U.S. Lawmaker Questions Approaches To Pakistan, Afghanistan | author = Ron Synovitz | work = Afghanistan Report: December 7, 2007 | date = December 7, 2007 | publisher = Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty | accessdate = 2011-10-02 [/tpl]  In 2003, he defended the new Afghan constitution against those who saw in it mainly empowerment of warlords, saying
 I've heard a lot of negative posturing about...these people who happened to have been the guys who sided with the United States ...Dostam, Atta, Khan...these were the people who defeated the Taliban... Just keep that in mind if you're an American. They came to help us defeat people who slaughtered our own people 11, 2001. And I'm grateful for that. And I'm not about to label them in these pejorative terms warlords, especially when the Taliban are still on the border...I would admonish you not to go so quickly in getting rid of people who helped us defeat the Taliban.Quoted in [tpl]cite web | title = The New Afghan Constitution: A Step Backwards for Democracy | author = James Ingalls | date = March 10, 2004 | url = http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_new_afghan_constitution_a_step_backwards_for_democracy | accessdate = 2011-10-02[/tpl] 
Rohrabacher has since become a proponent of withdrawing from Afghanistan. He protested against the troop build up to Afghanistan by President Obama saying "If the Taliban is going is be defeated, it's got to be by the Afghan people themselves, not by sending more U.S. troops, which could actually be counterproductive."[tpl]cite journal | journal = The New Republic | author = Michael Crowley | title = Dana Rohrabacher, Unlikely Afghanistan Dove | date = October 1, 2009 | url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-plank/dana-rohrabacher-washingtons-most-surprising-afghanistan-dove | accessdate = 2011-10-02[/tpl] When Congressman Jim McGovern offered an amendment earlier this year requiring the Pentagon to draw up an exit plan from Afghanistan, Rohrabacher was just one of six Republicans to sign on. Rohrabacher further voted for McGovern's Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, requiring an exit plan from Afghanistan. The bill failed by 204–215 margin.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll373.xml
Rohrabacher is against President Obama's gradual draw down of troops supporting a full withdrawal. Saying “If we’re going to leave, we should leave." Rohrabacher has gone on to state “The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave,” continued Rohrabacher. “So let’s quit prolonging the agony and inevitable. 
“Karzai’s regime is corrupt and non representative of Afghanistan’s tribal culture. This failed strategy is not worth one more drop of American blood. Under the current strategy, our military presence alienates more Afghans that it pacifies. So if you’re going to pull the plug, then we need to get the hell out now.” http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=248190
In April 2012, CNN reported that "A top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee was asked by the State Department not to go to Afghanistan because President Hamid Karzai objected to the visit. ... Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told Security Clearance he was readying to travel with five other Republicans from Dubai to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, when the State Department requested he stay behind."[tpl]cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/23/republican-congressman-asked-to-stay-out-of-afghanistan/ | work=CNN | title=Clinton, Panetta ask congressman to stay out of Afghanistan | date=2012-04-23[/tpl]

===Second Iraq War===

Rohrabacher voted in support of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002,http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll455.xml a position that he later admitted was "a mistake."http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/dana-rohrabacher-afghanistan-war

===Iran===

In August 2012, Rohrabacher noted on his official website that he had written a letter written to the U.S. State Department noting he supported U.S. sponsorship of separatist movements in Iran, which elicited criticism from the Iranian-American community that included challenging Rohrabacher's understanding of the historical background he included in his letter to the Department of State.[ref]http://iranianfacebook.com/2012/08/27/congressman-dana-rohrabacher-embarrasses-himself-by-calling-for-a-separatist-movement-in-iran-based-on-a-flawed-historical-understaning/
[/ref]

===Uzbekistan===

During a US Congressional delegation's visit to Uzbekistan in February 2013, Rohrabacher made several controversial statements. The chief among those statements was that the United States should treat Uzbekistan like Saudi Arabia by disregarding the former's human rights abuses in achieving America's national interests, particularly in selling armaments and drones to Uzbekistan.

===Patent Reform===

Rohrabacher is a huge opponent of the America Invents Act, a bill that is attempting to change the current Patent System. Rohrabacher opposes changing from a "first to invent system" to a "first to file system" claiming it "hurts the little guy." Rohrabacher commented "Make no mistake, “first to file” weakens patent protection. It is likely to make vulnerable individual and small inventors, who don’t have an army of lawyers on retainer. These “little guys” have been the lifeblood of American progress and competitiveness for more than 200 years. Our system was designed to protect individual rights, and it has worked for all – not just the corporate elite." Rohrabacher went on to comment in a Politico article "We’re told this is necessary to harmonize with Japanese and European patent law. But those systems were established by elitists and economic shoguns interested in corporate power, not individual rights."http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53564.html

===Medical marijuana===

Unlike most Republican Party members of Congress, Rohrabacher is a supporter of the medicinal use of marijuana as a right of the state. He and Maurice Hinchey have jointly offered the Hinchey-Rohrabacher medical marijuana amendment to a Commerce Justice and Science appropriations bill that would prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting patients in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes. Rohrabacher said that conservatives should take states' rights into consideration when they consider the issue of marijuana.

===Space===

Rohrabacher was chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics from 1997 to January 2005[ref]
