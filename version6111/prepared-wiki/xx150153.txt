"In My Lifetime" is the debut single by Jay-Z. It is produced by Ski and contains samples from "Oh Baby" by Aretha Franklin and two Soul II Soul songs: "Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)" and "Get a Life". It is not featured on either of Jay-Z's first two albums, but is remixed by Big Jaz on the Streets Is Watching soundtrack. The original version of the single was sold by Jay-Z and his friend Damon Dash out of Dash's car in 1993.[tpl]cite web | last = Hunter | first = Asondra | url = http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12048673 | title = Rockin' On A Roc-A-Fella at Yahoo!
