CATEGORIES: 1984 albums, Christy Moore albums

Ride On is an album by Irish folk singer Christy Moore, released in 1984, and is widely regarded as one of his best.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] It contains one of his most popular songs, the title track. A number of songs – powerful and evocative – celebrate and remember the actions of those involved in political struggles, or the effects of those struggles; such as "Vive la Quinte Brigada" which is concerned with the Irish contingent amongst the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War; or "El Salvador" dealing with the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s and 1990s. Other songs deal with Irish history – "The City of Chicago", about emigration to America during the Irish famines of the late 1870s; "Back Home in Derry" written by Bobby Sands about the transportation to Australia of convicts; and "Lisdoonvarna" celebrating a music festival that took place annually in that town until the early 1980s. Lisdoonvarna is also well known for its match-making festival, very popular in the 1950s and 1960s to match young rural couples.

==Reception==

Since Ride On is a widely accepted album it has been re-issued ever since its release in 1984. It has been regarded as not only one of the best possible introductions to Moore but also to a vein of writing. The title track was written by one of Ireland's most famous songwriters Cork man Jimmy MacCarthy and many people have often given their own interpretation of the title song, which is thought to be the sign of its power.[tpl] cite web | url=http://www.rambles.net/moore_rideon84.html | title=Ride On Review | date=5 June 2004 | accessdate=10 May 2009 | publisher=Nicky Rossiter | work=Rambles [/tpl]
