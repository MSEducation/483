==History==

===Toponymy===

Believed to originate in around 1319, the name Mossley means "a woodland clearing by a swamp or bog".[tpl]cite book|last=Hanks|first=Patrick|coauthors=Flavia Hodges, A.D. Mills, Adrian Room|title=The Oxford Names Companion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-860561-7[/tpl]

===Events===

Mossley - alongside neighbouring Stalybridge and Uppermill in Saddleworth - helped launch the annual Whit Friday Band Contest, an internationally known brass band event. This came about when the three towns held unconnected brass band events on 6 June 1884.
George Lawton, the son of magistrate and alderman John Lawton, inherited a family fortune and, when he died in August 1949, he left his entire estate (apart from some legacies) to the people of Mossley. Part of his estimated £40,000 estate was left to build a public meeting place, the George Lawton Hall, which is a testament to his generosity.

==Governance==

Following the passing of the Public Health Act 1848 and the Local Government Act 1857, a Local Board of Health was established in Mossley in 1864.[tpl]cite book|last=Nevell|first=Michael|title=Tameside 1700–1930|publisher=Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council|year=1993|series=A History and Archaeology of Tameside|page=17|chapter=Chapter 2: An Industrial Society|isbn=1-871324-08-4|oclc=53181546[/tpl] On 13 March 1885 Mossley was granted a Charter of Incorporation to become a municipal borough, replacing the local board.[tpl]cite book|last=Holt|first=Alfred|title=The Story of Mossley; Ancient and Modern|publisher=Mossley Civic Society|year=1974|origyear=1926|page=9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Nevell|first=Michael|title=Tameside 1700–1930|publisher=Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council|year=1993|series=A History and Archaeology of Tameside|page=11|chapter=Chapter 2: An Industrial Society|isbn=1-871324-08-4|oclc=53181546[/tpl] The whole borough was unified under the administrative county of Lancashire under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974 the borough of Mossley was absorbed under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 into the new metropolitan borough of Tameside in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. It became an unparished area.
Under the provisions of the Local Government and Rating Act 1997 local electors were given the right to request that a new parish and council be created in unparished areas. The people of Mossley exercised this right and a civil parish for Mossley was established in 1999. The civil parish council voted to adopt town status and Mossley now has a town mayor. The town has three parish wards based on the historic county borders, with four members representing the Cheshire part, three members the Lancashire part and two members the Yorkshire part. The town's unofficial Coat of Arms includes Cheshire's sheaf of corn, Lancashire's red rose and Yorkshire's white rose to signify the historic demarcation.

===Parliament===

From 1918 to 1950 the town gave its name to the Mossley constituency which returned a Member of Parliament; for most of the period, the MP was Austin Hopkinson, who was notable for being elected as an Independent candidate. The town is now represented by the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde.

==Geography==
