CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Raven Oak albums

Walls, Boxes, & Jars (2001), featuring the popular songs "Tidal Wave Goodbye" and "Ligeia", was the debut album of writer and pianist Raven Oak. Written while facing the constraints of college music classes, this album explores the depths of the categories, labels, and boxes society often forces upon survivors. This album helped pave the way for Raven Oak, a survivor of rape and abuse, to freely express herself, no longer a silent victim.
From gentle mourning, to fire filled anger, this album truly shows the complex range of emotions available through means of a piano. One track, "MZB", was written just after author Marion Zimmer Bradley (of The Mists of Avalon) died as a tribute to her works.
This album also donates to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network.
Of the CD, Score! Music says: "Perfectly stunning musical compositions that, though they lack vocals, do not lack in emotional impact; it’s as though one can venture inside Raven’s being through her beautiful piano work. Think Tori Amos unplugged and without lyrics."Score! Music Magazine., Jeanne. October 2002. Splendid E-Zine says, "...Oak transcends the damning excesses of the Lilith Fair ghetto...if it's the job of a musician to tell stories through her instruments, Raven Oak does her job exceedingly well."Splendid E-Zine., Matthew Pollesel. February 22, 2002.
