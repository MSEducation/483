==Career==

Born as Walfredo de los Reyes III, his trumpeter father was named Walfredo de los Reyes II, also a well known musician.  To distinguish the two during their mutually active career span from the 1940s through the early 1960s, his father was originally published as Walfredo de los Reyes, Sr. and he as Walfredo de los Reyes, Jr.  With the senior's retirement, and the onset of his own son's career, he then became published as the new Walfredo Reyes, Sr. and his son as Walfredo Reyes, Jr. (natively Walfredo de los Reyes Palau IV).
