==Biography==

Professor Groves received undergraduate degree in chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he works with Frederick Greene. In 1965, he began his doctoral studies under the direction of Professor Ronald Breslow at the Columbia University. During this time, he focused on the synthesis and characterization of cyclopropenyl cation, the simplest aromatic system and the first aromatic compound prepared with other than six electrons in a ring.

Upon receiving his Ph.D., Groves began his independent research career as a member of the chemistry faculty at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1969. In 1985, he moved to Princeton University where he is presently Hugh Stott Taylor Chair of Chemistry.
The major thrust of his research program is at the interface of organic, inorganic, and biological chemistry. Recent efforts have focused on the design of new, biomimetic catalysts and the molecular mechanisms of metal-catalyzed redox processes, the design and assembly of large scale membrane-protein-small molecule constructs, strategies for the assembly of biogenic hard materials, molecular probes of peroxynitrite-mediated protein nitration, pharmaceutical strategies for protection against peroxynitrite-mediated pathologies, and mechanisms by which pathogens acquire metabolic iron from host cells.
Groves's many awards included: A. C. Cope Scholar Award (1989), Alfred Bader Award in Bioorganic and Bioinorganic Chemistry (1996), National Science Foundation Extension Award for Special Creativity, (2008-2011), Frontiers in Biological Chemistry Award (2009), and ACS Ira Remsen Award (2010). He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a foreign member of the Royal Society. 
He is on the Management Committee, of the Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalization, at the University of Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/cchf/people/index.html |title=People â€” Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalization |publisher=University of Virginia College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl]
