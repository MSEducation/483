==Performing career==

===Live comedy===

McManus is a long established exponent of stand up comedy, touring nationally and also appearing internationally at major events such as the 2010 Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and as the host of the 2013 International Comedy Gala.
In 2005 and 2008 McManus undertook live stand-up comedy shows, touring Australian capital cities as well as Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand. During the tour he returned to Melbourne each Tuesday to film Rove Live.

===Television===

McManus's first recorded television appearance was as a child, when he appeared in the ABC television series, 'Kaboodle' as 'Marty', in an episode called 'Marty Makes A Move'.
In 1997 McManus began hosting The Loft Live, which was produced by RMIT University's Student television station RMITV, on the community television station, Channel 31, where according to Rove he was given a budget of $50 per week. It was there where he met his now long-time co-host, Peter Helliar.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]  Rove then worked for Foxtel as a roving reporter on a show called In Fashion which was hosted by Hugh Jackman. He then took an offer from the Nine Network for ten late night episodes of his own variety show; Rove, in 1999, but Nine cancelled the series at the end of its run. In 2000, McManus was offered the opportunity to produce a new version of the Rove show for Network Ten. The resulting Rove Live was almost identical to Nine's Rove. Rove Live became a flagship show for Network Ten, and it was also broadcast on TV3 in New Zealand. The show followed a variety show format and showcased weekly celebrity guests; comedy acts; variety segments; local and international comedians; and live bands.
During the 2004 and 2007 federal elections, McManus unsuccessfully campaigned to have the Australian prime minister, John Howard, appear on his program. While Howard did not appear, then-opposition leaders Mark Latham appeared on the show in 2005 and Kevin Rudd in 2007. After being elected prime minister, Rudd appeared on the show again in 2008 and also on 28 June 2009.
When Bert Newton fell ill in early 2004, McManus was one of many guest presenters who hosted Newton's Good Morning Australia program. McManus hosted the episodes on 24 April and 12 October 2004. The following year, McManus and Newton co-hosted a Roving Enterprises television special Ten Seriously 40, a look at the history of the Ten Network.
In 2004, McManus appeared in comedian John Safran's TV show John Safran vs God in a segment in which Safran convinced the controversial UK Muslim cleric Omar Bakri Muhammad to put a fatwa on McManus. The fatwa was later taken off when Omar Bakri found out that the pictures showing McManus mocking Islam were falsified.
In November 2006, after his wife Belinda Emmett died after fighting breast cancer for eight years, McManus took indefinite leave and Rove Live did not screen its last two planned episodes of the year. At the time there were unfounded rumours circulating in the industry that he might quit television for good. He returned, however, in the competitive Sunday 8.30 pm timeslot on 1 April 2007 with a major format overhaul, including renaming the show to simply Rove.[tpl]cite news |url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21343387-661,00.html |title = Rove back in harness |accessdate = 7 September 2007 |author = Darren Devlyn and Marcus Casey |date = 8 March 2007 |publisher = Herald Sun [/tpl] Rove scored its highest ever audience of 1.69 million viewers.[tpl]cite web |url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=94668 |title = Kate Ritchie wins gold at Logies |accessdate = 7 September 2007 |date = 7 May 2007 |publisher = ninemsn [/tpl] In September 2007, McManus made his debut as a game show host in the Australian version of the US game show Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[tpl]cite web |url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=275056 |title = Second half TV line-ups revealed |accessdate = 7 September 2007 |date = 26 June 2007 |publisher = ninemsn [/tpl]
