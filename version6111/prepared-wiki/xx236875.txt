In January 2013, Toro y Moi released his third studio album, Anything in Return, which he described as having "sort of a '90s dance mix sound." According to him, the album "was definitely influenced by lots of different types of house, from deep house to two-step ... The chords in Change' and 'Say That' use—that's just something I've been a fan of for a while. I really wanted to mess around with those kinds of elements and revisit what I did on Causers This, but make those elements a little bit better and more apparent."[tpl]cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/toro_y_moi-pop_redemption |title=Toro y Moi |work=Exclaim! |date=February 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2013[/tpl] The album was called "highly indebted to the late sacrosanct hip-hop producer J Dilla" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian.[tpl]cite web |last=McIntire |first=George |url=http://www.sfbg.com/2013/02/26/just-chill |title=Just chill |work=San Francisco Bay Guardian |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 6, 2013[/tpl] In promotion of Anything in Return, Toro y Moi has embarked on a tour across North America and Europe, which started on May 27, 2013 in George, Washington and ended on November 10 in Vancouver, British Columbia.[tpl]cite web |last=Pelly |first=Jenn |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50623-toro-y-moi-announces-tour/ |title=Toro Y Moi Announces Tour |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2013[/tpl]
