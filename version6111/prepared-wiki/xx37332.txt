==Early and personal life==

David Norris was born in Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, now known as Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where his father (John Norris) worked as chief engineer for Lever Brothers. John Norris served in the British Armed Forces during World War I and World War II; he died while Norris was still a child. David Norris was then sent to Ireland to be cared for by his mother, Aida Fitzpatrick, and her extended family.
After first meeting in 1975, Norris was in a long-term relationship with Israeli activist Ezra Nawi for a number of years until 1985.http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill1.jpg They continued a platonic friendship after that. In a Today FM interview with Matt Cooper in Summer 2011 Norris said (paraphrasing[tpl]who|date=September 2011[/tpl]) "nowadays people think of a romantic relationship as a sexual one and Ezra and myself have not had that kind of relationship since the 1980s."

==Education and academic career==

Norris attended school at St. Andrew's College and The High School. He then entered Trinity College, the University of Dublin, to read for the degree of B.A. in English Literature and Language, where he was elected a Foundation Scholar in that subject before achieving a 1st Class Moderatorship and editing Icarus, the University literary magazine.  He remained at Trinity as a lecturer and college tutor between 1968 and 1996.http://www.senatordavidnorris.ie/1bio.htm His love of Joyce is borne out in Dublin's annual Bloomsday celebrations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-morning-for-the-stouthearted-by-jiminy-217446.html|title=A morning for the stout-hearted, by Jiminy|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=17 June 2003|quote=Beautiful, sinister, melodic, whispering," enthused Senator David Norris.

After contracting the waterborne variation of Hepatitis while visiting Central Europe in 1994, Norris received disability payments from a private income continuance insurer worth thousands of euro over 16 years. Trinity College paid for this, and not the State.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1005/breaking18.html?via=mr|title=Norris got TCD disability pay|accessdate=5 October 2011 | work=The Irish Times|first1=Steven|last1=Carroll|first2=Cían|last2=Nihil[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/norris-received-disability-allowance-because-of-hepatitis-diagnosis-245877-Oct2011/|title=Norris received TCD disability pension because of Hepatitis diagnosis|accessdate=5 October 2011|quote=Norris stressed that he had not claimed a state allowance for his condition...[/tpl] Norris left his role as a lecturer after Trinity College authorities said the situation arising from his illness was "untenable", although he remained an elected senator.

==Campaigning and activism==

Norris took the Attorney General to the High Court over the criminalisation of homosexual acts. His claim was based on the fact that the law infringed on his right to privacy and that since the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court of Ireland.Lacey, Brian (2008) Terrible Queer Creatures: Homosexuality in Irish History. Dublin In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.[tpl]cite web|title=Supreme Court Decision|url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1983/3.html|accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl]
Having lost the Supreme Court case, Norris took his case to the European Court of Human Rights (See Norris v. Ireland). In 1988, the European Court ruled that the law criminalising same sex activities was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular Article 8 which protects the right to respect for private life. The law was held to infringe on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice.Norris v. Ireland - 10581/83 (European Court of Human Rights)
This law was repealed in 1993.
Norris has since then expanded his activism to a concept of "universal rights".

==Political career==

Norris represents the University of Dublin constituency in the Seanad as an Independent. He was first elected to the Seanad in 1987, and has been re-elected at each election since.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4163|title=David Norris|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=16 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0428/1224295621916.html|title=Norris re-elected to Seanad|last=Hunt|first=Joanne|date=28 April 2011|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl]

Norris called this an attempt to "sabotage" his campaign. He said the quotes had been taken out of context.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0531/norrisd.html|title=David Norris hits out at campaign 'sabotage'|work=RTÉ News|date=31 May 2011[/tpl]
Norris's candidacy was endorsed by British actor and writer Stephen Fry, who said Ireland "couldn't have a more intelligent passionate and knowledgeable witty or committed President".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/david-norris-aras-bid-gets-celebrity-backing-165577-Jun2011/ |title=Norris’ Áras bid gets celebrity backing |publisher=The Journal |accessdate=2011-06-29[/tpl]
In late July, it was revealed that Norris had written a letter in 1992 (29 August 1992) to an Israeli court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi, who had been convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in 1992 but was awaiting sentencing. Norris's letter, written on parliamentary notepaper, said that Nawi had been lured into a "carefully prepared trap" and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. The story was publicised by a pro-Israel blogger John Connolly. Connolly stated that he had received a tip from "someone in the trade union movement".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Hate-mail-deluge-for-Irish-blogger-who-exposed-Norris-support-for-rapist-126507763.html|title=Hate mail deluge for Irish blogger|work=Irish Central|date=1 August 2011[/tpl] A number of people resigned from Norris's campaign team. While Norris himself said he remained committed to his campaign, he admitted that it was now "in serious trouble". It was claimed by some that these allegations, complete with Norris's subsequent defence of his comments on pederasty in ancient Greece would seriously damage his chances of securing a nomination.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/norris-in-lastditch-attempt-to-save-presidential-bid-2671079.html|title=Norris in last-ditch attempt to save presidential bid|author=Fionnan Sheahan|work=Irish Independent|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Time running out for Norris to turn campaign around|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0611/1224298736307.html|work=Irish Times|author=Harry McGee|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] Norris refuted this, saying he still expected to receive a nomination,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/despite-a-dirty-fight-norris-says-he-will-be-next-president-2672695.html|title=Despite a 'dirty fight' Norris says he will be next President|author=Joe Jackson|work=Sunday Independent|date=12 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] and the controversy did not affect his poll standings.

As of 22 July, Norris had secured the support of 15 of the 20 members of the Oireachtas required for a nomination.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0722/breaking25.html|title=Two more Senators back Norris bid|work=The Irish Times|date=22 July 2011[/tpl] On 1 August, the Independent TDs John Halligan, Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle announced that they were withdrawing their support for Norris over the revelations of the Nawi plea.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0801/norrisd.html|title=Norris supporter Maureen O’Sullivan says he has been the victim of a nasty campaign|work=RTÉ News|date=1 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/two-tds-withdraw-nominations-as-norris-campaign-hangs-in-balance-191029-Aug2011/|title=Two TDs withdraw nominations|work=The Journal|date=1 August 2011[/tpl] However, several other TDs re-iterated their support for Norris in his bid to become President.

Despite withdrawing from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice to vote for him (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the proportional representation electoral system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote."Byrne tops poll for presidency" 11 August 2011, The Irish Times

Norris is a Christian and regularly attends Church of Ireland services. He said the following of his religious beliefs:
 I am the kind of Christian who believes that the most important theological principle is the principle of positive doubt. Even Christ doubted, on the cross. And I think if people say they hear the voice of God all the time and say they know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments. 
Norris believes himself to be an "outsider" of "accepted society" and claims this gives him a heightened awareness of other minority or "outsider" groups. He says he wishes society to become more accepting of diversity. He has campaigned on mental health and child abuse issues.[tpl]cite web|last=Mac |first=Conor |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-i-know-how-david-norris-feels-i-was-smeared-too/ |title=I know how David Norris feels – I was smeared too |publisher=Thejournal.ie |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl]

==Controversy==

===Fairytale of Kathmandu===

On 11 March 2008, Norris called for the broadcast of the documentary Fairytale of Kathmandu (scheduled to be shown that evening on RTÉ) to be postponed. The film documented visits to Nepal by Irish poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh, during which he had sex with young boys. It questioned whether he was sexually exploiting the boys or engaging in child sex tourism. Norris criticised that the film had been leaked beforehand and that Ó Searcaigh had been treated harshly by the media before its broadcast. He announced to the Seanad that the film should be checked for factuality, because he claimed that "public money" had been spent on it. The issue was conveyed to Deputy John Cregan, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2008/03/11/00004.asp |title=Seanad Eireann Debate Vol. 188 No. 22 Page 4.|date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=24 February 2011 | work=Seanad Éireann[/tpl]

===Easter Rising comments===

An article in The Sunday Times claimed that Norris had, on more than one occasion, denounced the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising as "terrorists".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7043719.ece|title=Profile: David Norris|date=28 February 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|first1=Sean|last1=O'Neill|first2=Fiona|last2=Hamilton[/tpl] In May 2011, Norris denied that article's claim also, saying "That's not true, it's a slur, and it's not fair on me. Terrorists are people who use civilian casualties to advance a political end. The men of 1916 produced the proclamation, addressed equally – in an age when women didn't have the vote - to 'Irishmen and Irishwomen', that's wonderful!".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/all-my-life-i-have-fought-against-being-labelled-and-against-stigma-2654239.html|title='All my life, I have fought against being labelled and against stigma'|work=Sunday Independent|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011|author=Jackson, Joe[/tpl] The newspaper printed a retraction.

===Criticism of Pope John Paul II===

Norris has made statements about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly in relation to the Papacy. He criticised Pope John Paul II's statements on homosexuality because he said they led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an "instrument for evil as far as I'm concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community". Norris also described the pope's position as "calculated and deliberate wickedness" because he "closes down scholarly enquiry" and because he "marginalised all the wonderful people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gaytoday.com/garchive/events/111301ev.htm|title='The Pope is Evil' says Gay Irish Senator, David Norris|accessdate=25 October 2010|work=Gay Today[/tpl] Commenting on then Cardinal Ratzinger, he said, "Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a Nazi" because he is "afraid to tell the truth," and because he and John Paul II "won't even let themselves be in the presence of the truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things." He later stated that he regretted using the term "Nazi" in reference to Ratzinger.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0609/breaking15.html|title=Norris 'confident' of nomination|work=The Irish Times|date=9 June 2011[/tpl]

===2002 Magill magazine interview===

In a January 2002 interview for politics/current affairs magazine Magill, Norris discussed the age of consent, incest,  paedophilia and pederasty.[tpl]cite web|title=The Free Radical|author=Helen Lucy Burke|date=January 2002|publisher=Magill|url=http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill1.jpg, scanned by thejournal.ie[/tpl] http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill1.jpghttp://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill2.jpghttp://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill3.jpg The interviewer, restaurant critic Helen Lucy Burke, said, "I found some of his views on sexual matters deeply disturbing - notably on sex with minors".Extract from David Norris: The Free Radical, Magill Magazine, January 2002 According to Burke, Norris didn't seem to support a minimum age of consent. When asked "Where would you draw the line?" Norris replied, "I would hope we could produce a society where people would be inclined to draw lines for themselves"."Norris's views on sex between older and younger men broadcast on RTÉ". The Irish Times. 22 October 2011. On 30 May 2011, Burke was a guest on the talk radio show Liveline. Burke said that she had read the article to Norris before publication, and that he had wholeheartedly endorsed what was written. During the show, it was noted that the Magill article had been reported in a newspaper shortly after publication. The newspaper, Ireland on Sunday, went with the headline "Senator Backs Sex With Children". Burke claimed that, when Norris saw the reaction to the interview, he "back-tracked" and denied saying what had been quoted. She also called Norris' views "evil" and "against the law".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2011/pc/pod-v-30051138m17slivelinedavidnorris-pid0-2297928.mp3|title=Live line|work=RTÉ News[/tpl]
According to Norris, he was only read two paragraphs of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections to be made to those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2011/pc/pod-v-31051128m34stodaywithpatkenny-pid0-1714224.mp3|title=Pat Kenny interview|work=RTÉ Radio 1[/tpl] In a May 2011 statement on his Presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed "I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared". Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an "academic discussion about Classical Greece and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation" and that the "presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norrisforpresident.ie/askdavid/magill-magazine-2002|title=Ask David: Statement on Magill Magazine profile|work=Norris for President website|accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] Norris also spoke about the Magill profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the Sunday Independent, in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in "horror", and that “it so completely misrepresents everything I said. In the interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children".[tpl]cite web|url=http://joejacksonjournalist.com/2010/09/06/david-norris-the-joe-jackson-interview/|title=David Norris – The Joe Jackson interviews 2002 and 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl]
During the initial interview on 30 May 2011, Burke explained on Liveline that she had "a tape somewhere around but I cant find it, its twelve years old and I don't know whether it would be viable now". Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on RTÉ News: Six One on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, but it turns out that it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.
