Gǎnqíng ([tpl]zh|c=感情|p=gǎnqíng|w=kan-ch'ing[/tpl]) is an important concept in social relations in Chinese culture which is loosely translated as "feeling" and is related to the concept of guānxi (relationship network). Gǎnqíng reflects the tenor of a social relationship between two people or two groups.  One can speak of having good gǎnqíng, meaning that two people have a good rapport, or deep gǎnqíng, meaning that there is considerable feeling within a social relationship.
