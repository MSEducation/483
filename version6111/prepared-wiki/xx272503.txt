==2011 Final==

Urusla captained the Wexford team in 2011. Eight out of 14 journalists at the final described her goal as among the best in the history of the game.[ref]2011 final Wexford 2-7 Galway 1-8 Report in Camogie.ie Connacht Tribune Enniscorthy Echo Galway Advertiser Irish Examiner, Irish Independent, Irish Times, Camogie.ie, RTE Online, Tuam Herald
Wexford People Homecoming in Enniscorthy Echo Wexford People Preview in Irish Examiner Irish Times Irish Independent[/ref] TV analyst and three times All Ireland medalist Therese O’Callaghan described it as “a dream goal, as good a goal as you are likely to see.”
Former Galway hurling manager Cyril Farrell said during the course of his TV match commentary:
 "That's as good a goal as you will see anywhere, a beautiful cross field ball from Josie Dwyer, fantastic catch, back towards the goal, turn on the left, bang in to the back of the net. You won’t see better than that anywhere. Everything is just on precision, on the dot. Catches it, turns left handed, bang to the back of the net, brilliant score."  
Galway manager Noel Finn said: “The goal came against the run of play. It was a sucker punch that late, they got their dander up. They were winning the breaks and when you’re on the back foot it is very hard to try and push on.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.galwaynews.ie/21571-so-close-and-yet-so-far-once-again-galway |title=So close and yet so far once again for Galway |publisher=Galwaynews.ie |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-11-17[/tpl]

==2012 Final==

Ursula made a big difference to the scoreline against Cork scoring an amazing 2 Goals and 7 Points. Ursula was awarded Player of the match live on The Sunday Game Live whilst in their selected hotel, she was awarded with a beautiful glass ornament. Jacob's second goal in the final was an absolute cracker which she stated as a "fluke", she chipped the ball from far outside the Box and amazingly it landed in the back of the net, and commentator's on RTÉ could not believe what they had just seen classing it as "goal of the year". Ursula had really been a hero that day, and a hero the year before scoring the goal which leveled the game against Galway the previous year.

  “After lining up to greet the Taoiseach, the Wexford team, led by captain and eventual match-changer Ursula Jacob, turned left and came down along the line, shaking hands with all of their Galway opponents before trotting into position for the pre-match parade. It was a nice sporting gesture, surely one that would add greatly to the men's big days.”
