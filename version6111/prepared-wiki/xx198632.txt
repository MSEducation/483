It was created on 6 May 1678 for Sir Henry Oxenden, previously Member of Parliament for Winchelsea, Kent and Sandwich. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Sandwich and Kent. His younger brother, the third Baronet, was Deputy Governor of Bombay. The fourth Baronet was the son of George Oxenden, Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, who was the third son of the 1st Baronet.
