He was charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in connection with MF's bankruptcy in 2011.
Corzine began his career in banking and finance. In the early and mid-1970s, he worked for Midwestern banks (Continental-Illinois National Bank in Chicago, Illinois and BancOhio National Bank in Columbus, Ohio) during and after his master of business administration (MBA) studies at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In 1975 he moved to New Jersey to work for Goldman Sachs. He became Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs and the leading advocate in the firm's decision to go public. In 1999, having lost a power struggle with Henry M. Paulson, Corzine left the firm. After his departure from Goldman Sachs, he earned what has been estimated to be $400 million during the 1999 initial public offering of the company.
Corzine served five years of a six-year U.S. Senate term representing New Jersey before being elected Governor in 2005.  He was defeated for re-election in 2009 by Republican Chris Christie. In March 2010, Corzine was named chairman and CEO of MF Global Inc., a financial services firm specializing in futures brokerage.

==U.S. Senate==

===2000 election===

After being forced from Goldman Sachs in January 1999, Corzine campaigned for a New Jersey Senate seat after Frank Lautenberg announced his retirement.

During the campaign, Corzine refused to release his income tax return records. He claimed an interest in doing so, but he cited a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs.

During Corzine's campaign for the United States Senate, he made some controversial off-color statements.  When introduced to a man with an Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: “Oh, you make cement shoes!" according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee.

===2005===

Corzine and his opponent, Republican Doug Forrester, spent $73 million on their gubernatorial campaigns by the week before Election day.  This included $38 million by Corzine and $19 million by Forrester for the general election.

The campaign for the post of Governor of New Jersey was successful with 54% of the vote. Forrester, a businessman and a former Mayor of West Windsor Township, in Mercer County, won 43%. Corzine received 1,224,493 votes to Forrester's 985,235. A total of 80,277 votes, or 3%, were scattered among other candidates. Corzine won 13 of New Jersey's 21 counties: Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, Salem, and Union. Corzine won the three most populous counties (Bergen, Essex, and Middlesex), five of the top six, and seven of the top nine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/2005results/05_generalelection/2005_Official_General_Election-Governor_tallies.pdf|title=November 2005 General Election|accessdate=August 27, 2008|date=December 16, 2005|publisher=State of New Jersey|work=Official General Election Results|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Governor of New Jersey==

Corzine officially declined his $175,000 salary in 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/nyregion/04goldman.html?|title=The Goldman Sachs Crew That’s Helping Run Trenton Government|accessdate=July 21, 2008|date=October 4, 2006|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Chen, David W.[/tpl]
After taking office in January 2006, Corzine's approval numbers were very low. Many polls seemed to indicate that much of this negative polling was a result of the 2006 New Jersey State Government shutdown. An April 26, 2006, polls from Quinnipiac University Polling Institute showed Corzine at a 15% approval with a 72% disapproval."NJ Budget Problems End Corzine's Honeymoon, Quinnipiac University New Jersey Poll Finds; Raise State Taxes, Not Local Taxes, Voters Say 3–1 (Press release).

Corzine had long insisted that state employees must bear part of the cost of their health benefits after retirement.  As of July 1, 2007, in
agreements with the Communications Workers of America, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, active State employees in those unions (as well as certain other non-union employees) are now required to contribute 1.5% of their salary to offset health care costs.  State and local employees’ contributions to the two largest pension systems increased by 10%, from 5% to 5.5% of their annual salaries and increased the retirement benefit age for new public employees, from 55 to 60 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/omb/publications/09bib/BIB.pdf|title=Citizens Guide to the Budget[/tpl] In 2008, Corzine approved a law that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62, required that government workers and teachers earn $7,500 per year to qualify for a pension, eliminated Lincoln's Birthday as a state worker holiday, allowed the state to offer incentives not to take health insurance and required municipal employees work 20 hours per week to get health benefits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cbs3.com/local/Corzine.Worker.Benefits.2.828183.html|title=Corzine Approves Cuts In Public Worker Benefits|accessdate=November 8, 2008|date=September 28, 2008|publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc.|work=cbs3.com[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
As part of his attempt to balance the budget, Corzine has decreased funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams."Rutgers U. Adopts Grim Budget to Deal With State Cuts" Chronicle of Higher Education, July 16, 2006. Retrieved July 14, 2008. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts."Message on FY2009 State Budget" Rutgers: Office of the President, June 30, 2008. Retrieved July 14, 2008.
Corzine has been the only New Jersey Governor in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base."Governor Corzine Comments on School Funding Reform", April 28, 2009.

Corzine has championed expanding government health and education programs. He planned to require every resident to enroll in a health plan and have taxpayers help pick up the tab for all the welfare low- and middle-income residents. In June 2008, state legislators voted for the first phase of that program mandating health care coverage and Corzine signed it into law in July."NJ expands health care[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]at a price," Associated Press, July 8, 2008.

Corzine spent some $200,000 of New Jersey money on advertisements to promote a referendum on the 2007 New Jersey ballot to borrow $450 million to fund stem cell research.

Corzine, in attempting to pass the 2007 fiscal year budget, clashed with a few fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over the proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7%.

Corzine, who was running for the United State Senate in the spring of 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married president of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer.[tpl]cite news|author=Adams, Cindy|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/item_ISKCBQ17QJbA9OCyMbp7lK|title=Jon's Ex Tells All|work=New York Post|date=June 6, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2008[/tpl] Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.
After Corzine's breakup with Katz, their lawyers negotiated a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6 million, including cash (in part used to buy her $1.1 million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/nyregion/23carla.html?|title=Romance Over, Union Chief Has Corzine’s Number|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2008|author=Kocieniewski, David and Serge F.

Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who was forced to resign after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034,[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.cwa1034.org|title=CWA Local 1034|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=July 16, 2008|publisher=Communications Workers of America Local 1034[/tpl] which bargains on behalf of many state employees.Trymaine Lee, “Corzine Gave Money To Relative Of Friend”, September 3, 2007; accessed February 22, 2014.
In the summer of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his relationship with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct. 
Separately, New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Tom Wilson filed a lawsuit to release all e-mail correspondence between Corzine and Katz during the contract negotiations. On May 30, 2008, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Paul Innes ruled that at least 745 pages of e-mail records should be made public, but Corzine's lawyers immediately appealed the decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/31/nyregion/31corzine.html|title=Judge Rules That E-Mail by Corzine Is Public|work=The New York Times|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=May 31, 2008|author=Lee, Trymaine[/tpl]
Corzine won his case on appeal. On March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled it would not hear arguments in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public.[tpl]cite news|title=Corzine-Katz e-mails will remain private after N.J.

Nonetheless, on August 1, 2010, The Star-Ledger published 123 of the Corzine-Katz e-mails, revealing the extent of their personal contact during negotiations over a new state government workers contract in early 2007.[tpl]cite news|title=Former N.J.

===Appointments===

Corzine continued to serve in the U.S. Senate while running for Governor, which ensured that he could resign from the Senate and appoint a Democrat as his successor if he won and allowed him to retain his Senate seat if he lost. Speculation was that he would appoint a Democrat from one of the congressional districts in New Jersey, perhaps Congressmen Rob Andrews, Rush Holt, or Frank Pallone. He appointed Governor Richard Codey although on November 23, 2005, he announced that he was not interested in pursuing the seat. On December 9, 2005, Corzine named his friend, who lived and lives in the same apartment building, U.S. Rep. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, to succeed him.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/07/senate.menendez/index.html|title=Sources: Menendez tapped for U.S. Senate seat|publisher=CNN |date=December 7, 2005|accessdate=July 30, 2008|author=Preston, Mark|publisher=Cable News Network[/tpl]
One of Corzine's first nominations was that of Zulima Farber as New Jersey Attorney General. She served for approximately seven months until an ethics investigation concluded that she had acted improperly by going to the location where local police in Fairview, New Jersey had stopped her boyfriend, Hamlet Gore, for driving with a suspended license and an expired vehicle registration. Corzine said he did not ask for Farber's resignation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/nyregion/15cnd-farber.html?|title=N.J.

===Public opinion===

During the first months of his administration, Corzine experienced favorable approval ratings. According to a March 2006 Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind Poll, 47% of New Jersey voters approved of the job Corzine was doing, while 16% disapproved."President Tanks; Governor has Good Will Heading into Budget System" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. March 8, 2006. Peter Woolley, director of the PublicMind, noted, "the numbers are pretty good for a New Jersey governor heading full tilt into an unprecedented budget crisis". Much of the good will that was indicated by the March poll was quickly diminished, and in April 2006, a PublicMind poll showed that Corzine's approval rating had eroded to 39% while his disapproval rating increased to 36%."2006 Survey of Budget Proposals" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. April 4, 2006. By July 2006, the Governor's ratings recovered to some extent from the April decline and in September of the same year it was clear that Corzine's approvals had not suffered from the summer conflict over the budget and the sales tax hike; 51% of New Jersey voters approved of the governor's handling of his job while 31% disapproved."Corzine Shakes Off Sales Tax" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. August 31, 2006. His PublicMind poll ratings remained relatively stable and healthy through the rest of 2006 and 2007 with his average approvals at 54% and his average disapprovals at 29%."Key Questions: Corzine Summary". Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll.  
In January 2008, prior to the State of the State address Corzine was at 48% approving 32% disapproving, according to the PublicMind poll."Public Hasn't Taken  a Toll on Corzine – yet." (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. January 7, 2008. But another FDU PublicMind poll taken in late January, after the  State of the State address, showed that governor's ratings were slipping; 41% of voters approved of the job Corzine was doing while 39% reported that they disapproved."Governor's Toll Proposal a Drag" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. January 30, 2008. The decline was largely in response to the governor’s plan to raise tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway."Toll Plan Puts Public Opinion on Wrong Track" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. January 7, 2008. February 2008 was not any kinder, as a PublicMind poll indicated that his numbers continued to slip with disapprovals catching up to approvals with 42% of voters approving and 43% of voters disapproving."Voters Say Cut Spending" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. February 25, 2008. Woolley remarked on the decline saying, "Considering the beating he has taken on his toll plan, it's remarkable that his numbers are not a good deal worse." The governor's approval ratings showed no recovery through September 2008 with his approvals and disapprovals averaging 42% and 43% respectively. Coincident with the presidential campaign, Corzine's approval ratings saw some improvement.
In January 2009 he stood at 46% approving and 40% disapproving. Woolley asserted that the governor was faring relatively well in public opinion considering "the enormous and growing pressure on the state budget and on the governor to protect various constituencies"."For the Moment Advantage Corzine" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. January 9, 2009.  Come March 2009, the PublicMind Poll found that, "Gov. Jon Corzine's standing with the New Jersey public is suffering along with the economy," and as a result his approvals began to slip with 40% of voters approving and 43% disapproving."Corzine, Like Economy, Lags in New Jersey" (Press release). Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll. March 4, 2009. His approvals continued to decline in April as he contended with the budget and the financial crisis with 40% approving and 49% disapproving."Budget Battles Corzine, Still Behind Christie> (Press release).

In February 2013, a court approved a settlement deal among commodities firm MF Global's bankruptcy trustees that will reimburse its customers for 93 percent of the value of their accounts, from which about $1.6 billion had disappeared during the firm's bankruptcy.
In June 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed civil charges against Corzine for using funds from MF's customer accounts for corporate purposes. "Corzine is charged with one count of failure to segregate and misuse of customer funds and one count of failure to supervise diligently", a news report said. The commission drew on extensive taped Corzine phone conversations in filing the complaint. Corzine's attorney Levander issued a statement contesting the charges when they were filed.Patel, Sital S., and Ronald D.
