==History==

Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in the United Kingdom as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea, and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century, which meant that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.niagara.co.uk/fish_and_chips.htm  |title=Fish and chips - A great British tradition |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-06-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116221706/http://www.niagara.co.uk/fish_and_chips.htm |archivedate = 16 January 2008[/tpl] Deep-fried fish was first introduced into Britain during the 16th century by Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain,[tpl]cite news|last=Alexander |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8419026.stm |title=The unlikely origin of fish and chips |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2013-07-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4food/features/top-10s/the-origins-of-10-modern-classic-foods |title=The origins of 10 modern classic foods - Channel4 - 4Food |publisher=Channel4 |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2013-07-16[/tpl] and is derived from pescado frito.

Deep-fried chips (slices or pieces of potato) as a dish may have first appeared in Britain in about the same period: the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of "chips" in this sense the mention in Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities (published in 1859): "Husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil".
