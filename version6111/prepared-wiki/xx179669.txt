Htop is an interactive system-monitor process-viewer written for Linux. It is designed as an alternative to the Unix program top. It shows a frequently updated list of the processes running on a computer, normally ordered by the amount of CPU usage. Unlike top, htop provides a full list of processes running, instead of the top resource-consuming processes. Htop uses color and gives visual information about processor, swap and memory status.
Users often deploy htop in cases where Unix top does not provide enough information about the systems processes, for example when trying to find minor memory leaks in applications. Htop is also popularly used as a system monitor. Compared to top, it provides a more convenient, cursor-controlled interface for killing processes.
Htop is written in the C programming language using the ncurses library.  Its name is derived from the original author's first name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hisham.hm/htop/index.php?page=faq|title=htop FAQ|accessdate=2012-06-15[/tpl]
It is possible to run htop on FreeBSD,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/sysutils/htop.html/|title=htop FreeBSD|accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl] since it can emulate Linux's procfs.
