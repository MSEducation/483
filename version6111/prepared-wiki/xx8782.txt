New Zealand English (NZE, en-NZen-NZ is the language code for New Zealand English , as defined by ISO standards (see ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) and Internet standards (see IETF language tag).) is the dialectHay, J., Macglagan, M., & Gordon, E. (2008). New Zealand English. Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press. of the English language used in New Zealand.
The English language was established in New Zealand by colonists during the 19th century. It is one of "the newest native-speaker varieties of the English language in existence, a variety which has developed and become distinctive only in the last 150 years".Trudgill, P., Gordon, E., Lewis, G., & Maclagan, M. (2000). Determinism in new-dialect formation and the genesis of New Zealand English. Journal of Linguistics, 36(2), p. 300). The most distinctive influences on New Zealand English have come from Australian English, English in southern England, Irish English, Scottish English, the prestige Received Pronunciation, and Māori.[ref]

New Zealand English is similar to Australian English in pronunciation, with some key differences. One of the most prominent differences is the realisation of [tpl]IPA|/ɪ/[/tpl]: in New Zealand English, as in some Scots and South African varieties, this is pronounced as [tpl]IPA|/ɘ/[/tpl].

==Dictionaries==

The first comprehensive dictionary dedicated to New Zealand English was probably the Heinemann New Zealand Dictionary, published in 1979. Edited by Harry Orsman, it is a 1,300-page book, with information relating to the usage and pronunciation of terms that were widely accepted throughout the English-speaking world and those peculiar to New Zealand. It includes a one-page list of the approximate date of entry into common parlance of many terms found in New Zealand English but not elsewhere, such as "haka" (1827), "Boohai" (1920), and "bach" (1905).
In 1997, Oxford University Press produced the The Dictionary of New Zealand English, which it claimed was based on over 40 years of research. This research started with Orsman's 1951 thesis and continued with his editing this dictionary. To assist with and maintain this work, the New Zealand Dictionary Centre was founded in 1997. It has published several more dictionaries of New Zealand English, culminating in The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary in 2004.
A more light-hearted look at English as spoken in New Zealand, A Personal Kiwi-Yankee Dictionary, was written by the American-born University of Otago psychology lecturer Louis Leland in 1980. This slim volume lists many of the potentially confusing and/or misleading terms for Americans visiting or emigrating to New Zealand. A second edition was published in 1990. 

==Historical development==

A distinct New Zealand variant of the English language has been in existence since at least 1912, when Frank Arthur Swinnerton described it as a "carefully modulated murmur", though its history probably goes back further than that. From the beginning of the British settlement on the islands, a new dialect began to form by adopting Māori words to describe the different flora and fauna of New Zealand, for which English did not have any words of its own.The Story of English by Robert McCrum, William Cran, and Robert MacNeil. BBC Publications and Faber and Faber: London, 1986.
Audio recordings from the 1940s of very old New Zealanders captured the speech of those born to the first generation of settlers in New Zealand, which means linguists can hear the actual origin of the accent.  For example, a recording of 97-year-old Mrs Hannah Cross, who was born in New Zealand in 1851 and lived there her whole life, shows she had a Scottish accent.  Even some second generation New Zealanders did not have a noticeable "New Zealand accent", such as Mr Ernie Bissett, who was born in Kaitangata in 1894 and lived in New Zealand his entire life.  But people growing up in the mining town of Arrowtown, where there was a mixture of accents, developed a recognisable New Zealand accent, such as Annie Hamilton, whose parents arrived there in 1862.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s1324569.htm |title=Lingua Franca - 19/03/2005: The New Zealand Accent : 1 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2005-03-19 |accessdate=2011-03-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s1329378.htm |title=Lingua Franca - 26/03/2005: The New Zealand Accent : 2 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2005-03-26 |accessdate=2011-03-05[/tpl]  The children growing up exposed to different accents picked up different features of these, but in their children, the second generation, there is a unification towards the "foundation accent".

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

The vowels of New Zealand English are similar to that of other non-rhotic dialects such as Australian English and RP, but with some distinct variations, which are indicated by the transcriptions for New Zealand vowels in the tables below:[tpl]sfnp|Bauer|Warren|Bardsley|Kennedy|2007|p=98–100[/tpl]
However, vowel charts[tpl]sfnp|Mannell|Cox|Harrington|2009a[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Mannell|Cox|Harrington|2009b[/tpl] show that [tpl]IPA|/iː ɒ ɑe ɐʉ æo/[/tpl] aren't accurate transcriptions, and [tpl]IPA|/ɘi ɔ ɐe ɑɵ æɔ/[/tpl] approximate the actual pronunciation closer.

==Vocabulary==

There are a number of dialectal words and phrases used in New Zealand English. These are mostly informal terms that are more common in casual speech.
New Zealand adopted decimal currency in the 1960s and the metric system in the 1970s. Despite this, several imperial measures are still widely understood and encountered, such as feet and inches for a person's height, pounds and ounces for an infant's birth weight, and in colloquial terms such as referring to drinks in pints."When is a pint not a pint? ", Ministry of Consumer Affairs"Is a pint really a pint in Wellington? ", 06/09/2012, The Wellingtonian[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Dignan | first1 = J. R. E. | last2 = O'Shea | first2 = R.

===Differences from Australian English===

Many of these relate to words used to refer to common items, often based on which major brands become eponyms.

==Usage==

==Māori influence==

Many local everyday words have been borrowed from the Māori language, including words for local flora, fauna, place names and the natural environment.
The dominant influence of Māori on New Zealand English is lexical. A 1999 estimate based on the Wellington corpora of written and spoken New Zealand English put the proportion of words of Māori origin at approximately 0.6%, mostly place and personal names.Kennedy, Graham & Shinji Yamazaki 1999. The Influence of Maori on the New Zealand English Lexicon. In John M. Kirk (ed), Corpora Galore: Analyses and Techniques in Describing English. Amsterdam: Rodopi: 33-44
The everyday use of Maori words, usually colloquial, occurs most prominently among youth, young adults and Maori populations. Examples include words like kia ora ("hello"), or kai ("food") which almost all New Zealanders know.
Māori is ever present and has a significant conceptual influence in the legislature, government, and community agencies (e.g. health and education), where legislation requires that proceedings and documents be translated into Māori (under certain circumstances, and when requested). Political discussion and analysis of issues of sovereignty, environmental management, health, and social well-being thus rely on Māori at least in part. Māori as a spoken language is particularly important wherever community consultation occurs.

===Pronunciation of Māori place names===

The pronunciation of many Māori place names was anglicised for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but since the 1980s increased consciousness of the Māori language has led to a shift towards using a Māori pronunciation.
The anglicisations have persisted most among residents of the towns in question, so it has become something of a shibboleth, with correct Māori pronunciation marking someone as non-local.
Some anglicised names are colloquially shortened, for example, "coke" for Kohukohu, "the Rapa" (pronounced rapper) for the Wairarapa, "Kura" for Papakura, "Papatoe" (pronounced Papatowie) for Papatoetoe, "Otahu" for Otahuhu, "Paraparam" or "Pram" for Paraparaumu, "the Naki" (rhymes with lackey) for Taranaki, "Cow-cop" for Kaukapakapa and "Pie-cock" for Paekakariki.
There is some confusion between these shortenings, especially in the southern South Island, and the natural variations of the southern dialect of Mãori. Not only does this dialect sometimes feature apocope, but consonants also vary slightly from standard Mãori. To compound matters, names were often initially transcribed by Scottish settlers; as such further alterations are not uncommon. Thus, while Lake Wakatipu is sometimes referred to as "Wakatip", Oamaru and "Om-a-roo", and Waiwera South as "Wy-vra", these differences may be as much caused by dialect differences – either in Mãori or in the English used during transcription – as by laziness in anglicisation.

==Dialects==

Recognisable regional variations are slight, with the exception of Southland, where the "Southland burr" (see above) is heard. It is also common in the southern part of neighbouring Otago. This southern area formed a traditional repository of immigration from Scotland (see Dunedin). Several words and phrases common in Scots or Scottish English persist in this area: examples include the use of wee to mean "small", and phrases such as to do the messages meaning "to go shopping". Taranaki has also been said to have a minor regional accent, possibly due to the high number of immigrants from the South-West of England, however this becoming less-pronounced.http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/551/thesis.pdf
Some Māori have an accent distinct from the general New Zealand accent, tending to use Māori words more frequently. Bro'Town was a TV programme that exaggerated Māori, Polynesian, and other accents. Linguists recognise two main New Zealand accents, denoted "Pākehā English" and "Māori English"; with the latter strongly influenced by syllable-timed Māori speech patterns."Identifying Maori English and Pakeha English from Suprasegmental Cues: A Study Based on Speech Resynthesis", Szakay, Anita Pākehā English is beginning to adopt similar rhythms, distinguishing it from other stress-timed English accents.Jeanette King on the influence of Māori pronunciation on New Zealand English, 6/2/2010.
