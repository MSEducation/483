CATEGORIES: Rhenium compounds

Oxotrichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)rhenium(V) is the chemical compound with the formula ReOCl3(PPh3)2.  This yellow, air-stable solid is a precursor to a variety of other rhenium complexes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Johnson, N. P.; Lock, C. J.

The oxidation state of rhenium is +5 and its configuration is d2.

==Synthesis==

ReOCl3(PPh3)2 is commercially available, but it is readily synthesized by reaction of perrhenic acid with triphenylphosphine in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and acetic acid.  In this reaction, Re(VII) is reduced to Re(V), and triphenylphosphine is oxidized to its oxide.  
The required perrhenic acid solution can be prepared in situ from rhenium(VII) oxide.

==Uses==

ReOCl3(PPh3)2 is a precursor to a variety of other oxo-, nitridio, and hydrido complexes.  It converts to ReH7(PPh3)2 by a treatment with LiAlH4. [tpl]cite journal | author = K. Abdur-Rashid, A. J.
