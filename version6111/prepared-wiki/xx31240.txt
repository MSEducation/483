The Big East Conference was a collegiate athletics conference that consisted of as many as 16 universities in the eastern half of the United States from 1979 to 2013. The conference's members participated in 24 NCAA sports. Three members had football programs but were not Big East football schools: Notre Dame football was independent while Georgetown and Villanova competed in the Football Championship Subdivision. Another five schools—DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Providence—discontinued or did not have football programs.
In football, the Big East had all eight members play in bowl games since the 2005 realignment and had seven of eight teams ranked in the Top 25 since 2003. In that time, the Big East saw the emergence of new national players with West Virginia rising to as high as No. 1 and was ranked in the Top 10 for three-straight years (2005, 2006, 2007), South Florida rising as high as No. 2, Cincinnati and Louisville both as high as No. 3, Rutgers as high as No. 7, Pittsburgh as high as No. 9, and Connecticut as high as No. 13 in BCS standings. Also, Big East football saw an increase in attendance and enjoyed a new, $250 million plus television package that lasted through 2013.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/Attendance/2008.pdf |format=PDF| title=2008 NATIONAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL ATTENDANCE | publisher=NCAA | postscript=[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06338/743356-139.stm | title=ESPN's Thursday night football proves big to the Big East | publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=December 4, 2006[/tpl]
In basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships (UConn with three, Villanova, Georgetown, Syracuse, and Louisville with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference,[tpl]cite news | url=http://ncaabasketball.fanhouse.com/2009/11/04/battle-for-big-east-gets-even-bigger/ | title=Battle for Big East Gets Even Bigger | publisher=NCAA Basketball Fanhouse[/tpl] though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.
On July 1, 2013, as part of an ongoing realignment, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the Catholic 7) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name.  The remaining six football-playing members joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference. The American Athletic Conference is the legal successor of the old Big East; it retains the old Big East's structure and inherited the league's automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series.  However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013.American Athletic Conference history(New) Big East Conference history
At the time of the announcement of the conference's break-up, its then-current football-playing members were all secular schools, with Syracuse being a secular private school and the rest being public-supported; in contrast, all the non-football members of the conference were Catholic schools.

==History==

===Founding: The early years===

The Big East was founded in 1979 when Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, and Syracuse invited Seton Hall, Connecticut, Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College, with Rutgers and Holy Cross declining to join.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suathletics.com/sports/2001/8/8/history.aspx|title=A Big East History and Retrospective, Part 1|last=Crouthamel|first=Jake|date=December 8, 2000|publisher=SUAthletics.com|accessdate=October 26, 2011[/tpl] Villanova joined a year later in 1980[tpl]cite news |title=Big East, Villanova Make It Official |agency=United Press International |publisher=The Pittsburgh Press, via Google News |date=March 13, 1980 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xBshAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SFwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4471,6402629&dq=big-east-conference+villanova&hl=en [/tpl] and Pittsburgh joined in 1982.[tpl]cite news |title=Pittsburgh To Join Big East |first= Richard F |last=Hanley |work=Record-Journal |date=November 19, 1981 |publisher=Google News |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=schHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u_8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4292,2306993&dq=big-east-conference+football&hl=en [/tpl]
In 1982, Penn State applied for membership, but was rejected, with only five schools in favor (Penn State needed six out of eight). It was long rumored that Syracuse cast the deciding vote against Penn State, but Mike Tranghese confirmed that this was not the case and that Syracuse had, in fact, voted for Penn State's inclusion.[tpl]cite news | url=http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/quad-qa-big-east-commissioner-mike-tranghese/ | title=Quad Q&A: Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese |work=The New York Times | first=Pete | last=Thamel | date=March 9, 2009 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl]

===Football expansion===

About a decade after the conference's inception, Big East members decided to become a major football conference and thus added five schools including Rutgers, Miami, Temple, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia. The inaugural Big East football season launched in 1991. West Virginia and Rutgers joined the Big East as full members in 1995,[tpl]cite news|last=Moran|first=Malcolm|title=Rutgers and West Virginia Are Invited to Join Big East|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/10/sports/basketball-rutgers-and-west-virginia-are-invited-to-join-big-east.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=October 26, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 10, 1994[/tpl] and Virginia Tech joined as a full member in 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=Conference Affiliation History|url=http://www.hokiesports.com/conference.html|work=hokiesports.com|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=October 26, 2011[/tpl] Temple remained a football-only member until 2004, when it was voted out of the conference due to poor attendance figures, lack of playing success, and inadequate facilities.[tpl]cite news |title=Temple Expects Better Results in Big East Sequel |date=2012-08-17 |url=http://nytimes.stats.com/cfb/story.asp?i=20120817173242625024008 |accessdate=2012-11-18 |last=Gelston |first=Dan |newspaper=The New York Times [/tpl] The Big East offered Notre Dame a non-football membership effective 1995.[tpl]cite news|last=Moran|first=Malcolm|title=Notre Dame Joins the Big East |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/12/sports/colleges-notre-dame-joins-the-big-east.html|accessdate=October 26, 2011 |newspaper=New York Times|date=July 12, 1994[/tpl]

===Turmoil and realignment===

The unusual structure of the Big East, with the "football" and "non-football" schools, led to instability in the conference. In 2003, the ongoing press reports of tensions between the football schools and the basketball-only schools finally exploded into a months-long public tug-of-war between the Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conference over several Big East members. The end result was that three Big East schools—Virginia Tech, Miami and Boston College—moved to the ACC, while five schools moved to the Big East from Conference USA—Louisville, Cincinnati, South Florida, Marquette, and DePaul.
The addition of the three football schools, along with Big East non-football member Connecticut moving up to the Big East football conference, ensured that the league would keep the minimum eight teams needed to keep its BCS bid. In addition, two traditional basketball teams, DePaul and Marquette, were added to gain the Chicago and Milwaukee television markets and help the already solid basketball status of the conference.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Meanwhile, Loyola University Maryland (then Loyola College in Maryland) also joined the Big East as an associate member in women's lacrosse for the 2005–06 academic year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.laxpower.com/laxnews/news.php?story=228 |title=Loyola Joins the Big East as an Associate Member in WLax |publisher=LaxPower |date=January 5, 2005 |accessdate=October 8, 2011[/tpl]

===Continued instability===

In 2010, Texas Christian University accepted an invitation to join the conference as an all-sports member beginning in the 2012–13 academic year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/sports/tcubigeastconference.html|title=AP source: TCU going to Big East Conference|agency=Associated Press  |publisher=BET.com|date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2011[/tpl] Big East schools compete in Division I. Most of the football-playing schools play in Division I FBS, while Georgetown and Villanova have Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) football programs. Georgetown football competes in the Patriot League. Villanova has competed in the Colonial Athletic Association football conference since 1988, dating back to its time as a completely separate conference known as the Yankee Conference, which merged with the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1997, then in 2007 the CAA took over management of the A-10 football conference (which happened after Northeastern University joined the CAA in 2005, giving them the 6 football-playing members needed to start sponsoring football, which was eventually dropped by Northeastern after 2009). In September 2010, in the wake of a Division I realignment that affected a number of conferences around the country, the Big East asked Villanova to consider becoming a football member. The school once considered the offer, which required the school to substantially expand its football budget, as well as expand its stadium to meet FBS requirements or find another suitable venue in the Philadelphia area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5553575 |title=Villanova considering Big East invitation |publisher=ESPN  |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100913010809/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5553575| archivedate= September 13, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Villanova presented a plan to the Big East football members on April 10, 2011, which included the use of PPL Park as a football stadium, but the league declined to schedule a vote to offer membership on the objections of Pittsburgh, West Virginia and Rutgers to the plan. Before Villanova could present a revised plan to the Big East Conference, Pittsburgh sought and was granted admission to the Atlantic Coast Conference, causing Villanova's application to be tabled indefinitely. On September 17, 2011 Syracuse, a charter member of the conference, and Pittsburgh announced that they would be leaving the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/sports/big-east-exit-is-said-to-begin-for-syracuse-and-pittsburgh.html|date=September 17, 2011 | work=The New York Times | first=Pete |last=Thamel|title=If Syracuse and Pitt Move On, Things Could Get Interesting[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-09-19/pittsburgh-syracuse-big-east-move-to-acc-conference-realignment-john-swofford |title=Report: Big East will hold Syracuse, Pittsburgh to 27-month notice |work=Sporting News |date=September 20, 2011[/tpl] Both schools originally intended to fulfill their commitment to the 27-month waiting period.

On October 28, 2011 it was announced by the Big 12 Conference that West Virginia accepted its invitation to join, with membership beginning in 2012. This timeline was challenged by the Big East, and countersuits were launched by the school and conference.  Eventually, a settlement was reached with allowed West Virginia's departure for 2012 in exchange for sizable compensation.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=106181&SPID=13139&DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=205379627&DB_OEM_ID=10410 |title=2012 Football Schedule Announced - Big 12 Conference |publisher=Big12sports.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate= 2012-07-19[/tpl] Syracuse and Pittsburgh then used the acquiescence of the Big East to West Virginia's departure to challenge the validity of their own commitment, and the Big East agreed to a settlement with both schools in July 2012 to allow their departure for the 2013 academic year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/235666/BIG-EAST,-Syracuse-University-Reach-Agreement-on-Syracuse-Departure-From-the-BIG-EAST.aspx |title=BIG EAST, Syracuse University Reach Agreement on Syracuse Departure From the BIG EAST |publisher= The BIG EAST Conference |work= |accessdate= 2012-07-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/235709/BIG-EAST-Conference,-University-of-Pittsburgh-Reach-Agreement-on-Pittsburgh-Departure-From-The-BIG-EAST.aspx |title=BIG EAST Conference, University of Pittsburgh Reach Agreement on Pittsburgh Departure From The BIG EAST > The BIG EAST Conference > News |work= |accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl]

====New Big East====

Less than two weeks after Louisville announced its departure for the ACC, multiple media reports indicated that the Big East's seven remaining non-FBS schools, all Catholic institutions, were considering a mass exit from the conference.[tpl]cite news|url=http://ajerseyguy.com/?p=4188 |title=Big East Catholic schools breaking away? |first=Mark |last=Blaudschun |publisher=A Jersey Guy |date=December 10, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8735330/big-east-direction-concerns-conference-catholic-schools-sources-say |title=Big East fate vexes Catholic schools |first1=Andy |last1=Katz |first2=Brett |last2=McMurphy |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 11, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/21353826/big-easts-non-football-members-meet-discuss-possible-breakaway |title=Big East's non-football members meet, discuss possible breakaway |first=Gary |last=Parrish |work=Eye on College Basketball |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=December 11, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2012-12-10/big-east-conference-expansion-dissolve-georgetown-marquette-villanova?eadid=EL/SICOM&sct=hp_t2_a5 |title=Big East basketball-first schools reportedly meet on topic of dissolution |first=Mike |last=DeCourcy |publisher=Sporting News |date=December 10, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012[/tpl] By December 13, it was likely that the non-FBS schools would indeed leave to form a new conference,[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8742607/seven-catholic-schools-leaning-leaving-big-east-sources-say |title=Sources: 7 leaning to leave Big East |first1=Brett |last1=McMurphy |first2=Andy |last2=Katz |first3=Dana |last3=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 13, 2012[/tpl] and on December 15, the seven schools (soon to be called the Catholic 7 by the media) made their departure official, effective with the 2015–16 school year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8749700/seven-schools-decide-leave-big-east-pursue-new-basketball-framework |title=Seven schools leaving Big East |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 15, 2012 |accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl] Many details remained to be worked out, with one major issue being whether the "Big East" name would stay with the FBS schools.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8745235/seven-schools-agree-leave-big-east-debating-process-source-says |title=Sources: 7 schools agree to leave |first1=Brett |last1=McMurphy |first2=Andy |last2=Katz |first3=Dana |last3=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl]
On December 31, Boise State announced they had decided to stay in the Mountain West conference, leaving the Big East, much like TCU, without ever playing a game in it.  With Boise State staying in the Mountain West, it was noted that San Diego State would indeed try to rejoin the Mountain West as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8796807/boise-state-broncos-staying-mountain-west-conference-all|title=Boise St. sticking with Mountain West|last=McMurphy|first=Brett|accessdate=December 31, 2012|date=December 31, 2012[/tpl] On January 16, 2013, reports surfaced that SDSU would indeed stay in the Mountain West.  Rumors of the MWC looking at potentially adding Houston and SMU as its 13th and 14th football members, both of which have stated they will join the Big East in 2013, continue to circulate as well.
In February 2013, multiple media reports indicated that the Catholic 7 would depart in July 2013, two years earlier than originally planned. On March 5, the Associated Press reported tentative details of a financial agreement: In exchange for selling both the Big East name and a contract with Madison Square Garden (MSG) to host the men's basketball tournament to the Catholic 7, as well as $10 million, the football schools would receive $100 million of a $110 million pool that had accumulated from entry fees, exit fees, and proceeds earned from appearances in the NCAA men's basketball tournament.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9019093/big-east-football-schools-keep-close-110-million-league-split-according-report |title=Report: $100M for football schools |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2013[/tpl]  On April 3, the football-playing schools, which retained the old Big East's structure and its automatic BCS bid, announced they would operate as the American Athletic Conference starting on July 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130421031242/http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/243706/new-name-in-college-sports-current-big-east-enters-new-era-as-american-athletic.aspx|title=New Name in College Sports - Current BIG EAST Enters New Era as 'American Athletic Conference'|date=2013-04-03|accessdate=2013-04-03[/tpl]
