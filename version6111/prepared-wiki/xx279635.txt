[[Brain Mapping Foundation]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroscience organizations

The Brain Mapping Foundation was established in 2004 by neuroscientist Babak Kateb, in order to advance cross pollination of ideas across physical sciences into biological sciences/neuroscience.  The organization provides funding to the members of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT). One of the main focus of the foundation is to further establish and fund the National Center for NanoBioElectronics (NCNBE) in order to rapidly integrate nanotechnology, devices, imaging, cellular and stem cell therapy. The organization has played a significant role in President Obama's BRAIN initiative.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11894138/1/society-for-brain-mapping-and-therapeutics-sbmt-announce-the-formation-of-american-board-of-brain-mapping-its-2013-award-recipients-and-its-brain-mapping-day-at-the-us-congress.html |title=Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) announce the formation of American Board of Brain Mapping, its 2013 award recipients and its Brain Mapping Day at the US Congress |publisher=Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics |date=April 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt0613-480 |title=$350 million in new funding for brain research |year=2013 |last1=Fox |first1=Jeffrey L |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=480 |pmid=23752420[/tpl]

==Definition of brain mapping==

The study of the anatomy and function of the brain and spinal cord through the use of imaging (including intra-operative, Microscopic, Endoscopic and Multi-Modality imaging), Immunohistochemistry, Molecular & optogenetics, Stem cell and Cellular Biology, Engineering (material, electrical and biomedical), Neurophysiology and Nanotechnology (See Brain Mapping for more information).

==Mission statement==

Brain Mapping Foundation (BMF) is a non-profit 501c3 charitable organization, which is established for the purpose of facilitating multidisciplinary brain and spinal cord research and expediting integration of cutting-edge technologies into the field of neuroscience. BMF is focused on translating state-of-the-art technologies from NASA, DOD and industry into neurosurgery/neuroscience in order to bring the most advanced medicine to wounded warriors and civilians with neurological disorders.

==Special projects==

Currently the organization is focused on establishing Global Alliance for Nano-Bio-Electronics through its National Center for NanoBioElectronic and has shaped policies in the field of Nanoneuroscience and Nanoneurosurgery.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.105 |title=Nanoplatforms for constructing new approaches to cancer treatment, imaging, and drug delivery: What should be the policy? |year=2011 |last1=Kateb |first1=Babak |last2=Chiu |first2=Katherine |last3=Black |first3=Keith L. |last4=Yamamoto |first4=Vicky |last5=Khalsa |first5=Bhavraj |last6=Ljubimova |first6=Julia Y. |last7=Ding |first7=Hui |last8=Patil |first8=Rameshwar |last9=Portilla-Arias |first9=Jose Antonio |last10=Modo |first10=Mike |last11=Moore |first11=David F. |last12=Farahani |first12=Keyvan |last13=Okun |first13=Michael S. |last14=Prakash |first14=Neal |last15=Neman |first15=Josh |last16=Ahdoot |first16=Daniel |last17=Grundfest |first17=Warren |last18=Nikzad |first18=Shouleh |last19=Heiss |first19=John D. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=54 |pages=S106–24 |pmid=20149882 |pmc=3524337 |issue=Suppl 1|display-authors=8 [/tpl]  In this regard, the foundation has established significant ties with international partners and plans to launch a global consortium in Neuroscience with a specific aim of integrating nanotechnology, device, imaging and cellular therapy.http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/news/2013/20130511_00.html[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl] BMF has signed a formal consortium agreement with Dr. Charlie Teo's Cure For Life Foundation in Australia, which is focused on eradicating brain cancers.http://www.cureforlife.org.au/media_release_dr_charlie_teo_takes_plan_for_ten_year_cure_to_washington_dc/[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/health/mapping-human-brain[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl] NCNBE has also launched a graduate training program in NanoBioElectronic, which will be offering a doctoral degree in NanoBioElectronics.

==Publications==

BMF has been a major supporter of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) annual meetings and its publications.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.3892/ijmm.2012.942 |title=Functional MRI using robotic MRI compatible devices for monitoring rehabilitation from chronic stroke in the molecular medicine era (Review) |year=2012 |last1=Tzika |first1=A. |journal=International Journal of Molecular Medicine[/tpl] The Foundation supported series of special issue publications with NeuroImage, in which members of the Society published their findings.http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119/54/supp/S1[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119/47/supp/S2[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119/37/supp/S1[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl] The articles these publications were discontinued when the Society decided to establish an open-access Journal with PloSOne entitled ″NeuroMapping & Therapeutics″.http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/06/27/plos-one-launches-the-neuromapping-therapeutics-collection/[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl] BMF also played a major role in publishing the first Textbook of Nanoneuroscience and Nanoneurosurgery.Babak Kateb, John D.

Brain Mapping Foundation and the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) have established a relationship to identify the most important scientific and clinical contributions to the field, and recognize them with the prestigious “Pioneer” awards.  The awards are presented in partnership with SBMT, industry leaders and other foundations to highlight the significant work done by scientists, industry leaders, individuals, and policymakers.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/938595/top-scientists-from-us-canada-and-australia-member-of-the-canadian-parliament-and-stryker-executive-to-be-honored-by-the-society-of-brain-mapping-and- |title=Top Scientists from US, Canada, and Australia, Member of the Canadian Parliament and Stryker Executive to be Honored by the Society of Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) |publisher=Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics |date=March 16, 2012[/tpl]http://www.army.mil/article/81652[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is the only award recipient who has been recognized twice by the Society and the Foundation for her courage and dedication toward raising awareness for neurotrauma as well as her role in healthcare reform; she was awarded a Beacon of courage and dedication and Pioneer in healthcare policy award by the Foundation and the Society.http://www.wafb.com/story/14313763/medical-group-to-honor-rep-giffords-with-award[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]http://azjewishpost.com/2011/brain-mapping-society-to-honor-giffords/[tpl]full|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Global Physicians and Scientists (GPS)==

GPS is a humanitarian program, which is focused on mobilizing physicians, scientists and surgeons to serve for few weeks in the poor and rural areas of the United States and abroad. This program collaborates with industry and government officials and uses the national and international SBMT centers as bases of operations. The program is designed to help alleviate healthcare disparities by bringing world class physicians to poor areas, and to help improve local economies through micro and neuro economics.
