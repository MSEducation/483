The New York Palace is a hotel combining the historic landmark Villard Mansion with a modern 55-story tower.  Located at the center of Manhattan in Midtown at the corner of 50th Street and Madison Avenue, the luxury hotel is directly across the street from St Patrick's Cathedral.

==History==

In 1882, Henry Villard, a well-known railroad financier, hired McKim, Mead, and White to create six private brownstone townhouses surrounding a courtyard on Madison Avenue.  The prominent architectural firm created the houses in the neo-Italian Renaissance tradition, after the Palazzo della Cancellaria in Rome.
In the spring of 1974, the developer Harry Helmsley proposed a 55-story hotel for the site of the Villard Houses called The Helmsley Palace Hotel.  To construct his hotel tower, Helmsley hired Emery Roth & Sons, who created its design of dark bronze reflective glass and anodized aluminum to blend with the Villard Houses and Manhattan's surrounding skyline. The Helmsley Palace Hotel opened in 1981 and was operated by Helmsley until 1992, when the hotel came under the management of a private New York limited partnership, changing its name to The New York Palace.[tpl]cn|date=May 2013[/tpl]
During Helmsley's ownership Harry's wife Leona Helmsley maintained a strict and intolerant management style which involved her firing staff members for trivial mistakes, an act which gave her the nickname, "Queen of Mean." The hotel reverted to its bond holders from Leona Helmsley and was ultimately purchased by The Sultan of Brunei with the concurrence of the US Bankruptcy Court. The Sultan of Brunei, through its development company, Amedeo Limited, hired Lee Jablin of Harman Jablin Architects for the complete renovation of the hotel and Villard Houses.
Northwood Investors bought the hotel from the Sultan of Brunei in 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Brandt |first=Nadja |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-18/new-york-palace-hotel-to-be-sold-to-northwood-investors-for-400-million.html |title=New York Palace Hotel to Be Sold to Kukral’s Northwood |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-09-19[/tpl]

Overlooking Madison Avenue from the heart of Midtown Manhattan, The New York Palace is recognized around the world for its gracious hospitality, unrivaled service and stunning event venues. The award-winning hotel uniquely contrasts the timeless elegance of New York’s Gilded Age with intuitive service that caters to guests and their individual needs. 

===The courtyard and lobby===

What was once The Villard Mansion’s carriage entrance on Madison Avenue is now the New York Palace’s Courtyard. During the restoration of the hotel, the Courtyard was redesigned to incorporate motifs from the flooring of several 15th-century Italian cathedrals, a nod to its original styling after Rome’s Palazzo della Cancellaria.
The two-story marble lobby joins The Villard Mansion with the hotel.
