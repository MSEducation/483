A stomach rumble, also known as a bowel sound or peristaltic sound, is a rumbling, growling or gurgling noise produced by movement of the contents of the gastro-intestinal tract as they are propelled through the small intestine by a series of muscle contractions called peristalsis.[tpl]cite web|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|title=Causes of Stomach Growling|url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/systems/digestive/stomach-growling1.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=7 February 2012[/tpl] A doctor can listen to these intestinal noises with a stethoscope but they may be loud enough to be heard with bare ears and are known as stomach rumble or borborygmus as the fluid and gas moves forward in the intestines (in the vicinity of but not actually within the stomach). The lack of bowel sounds is indicative of ileus, intestinal obstruction, or some other serious pathology.

==Etymology==

The scientific name for a rumbling stomach, borborygmus (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɔɹ|b|ə|ˈ|ɹ|ɪ|ɡ|m|ə|s[/tpl]; plural borborygmi) is related to the 16th-century French word borborygme, itself from Latin, ultimately from Ancient Greek βορβορυγμός (borborygmós). The Greeks probably onomatopoetically coined the word.

The word borborygmic has been used in literature to describe noisy plumbing. In Ada, Vladimir Nabokov wrote: "All the toilets and waterpipes in the house had been suddenly seized with borborygmic convulsions".
In A Long Way Down (New York: Harper, 1959, p. 54), Elizabeth Fenwick wrote: "The room was very quiet, except for its borborygmic old radiator".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-bor1.htm |title=Borborygmus |publisher=World Wide Words |date=1998-10-12 |accessdate=2013-10-26[/tpl]
Graham Greene's short story "Alas, Poor Maling" tells the tale of a luckless individual whose borborygmus takes the form of imitating noises that he has recently heard.
