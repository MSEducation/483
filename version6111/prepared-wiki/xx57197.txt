Jacques Martin Barzun (November 30, 1907[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]October 25, 2012) was a French-born American historian of ideas and culture.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/arts/jacques-barzun-historian-and-scholar-dies-at-104.html |title=Jacques Barzun Dies at 104; Cultural Critic Saw the Sun Setting on the West |work=New York Times |author=Edward Rothstein |date=October 25, 2012  |accessdate=October 25, 2012 [/tpl] He wrote on a range of topics as broad as baseball and classical music, but is perhaps best known as a philosopher of education.
Barzun's Teacher in America (1945) was an important influence on post-WWII training of schoolteachers in the United States.  He published over 40 books, won the American Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was knighted into the French Legion of Honor. His New York Times best-selling magnum opus, From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present, was published in 2000, when he was 93 years of age.[tpl]cite news |date=October 26, 2012 |title=Jacques Barzun: An Appreciation |first=Joseph |last=Epstein |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204598504578080902026564368.html?mod=googlenews_wsj [/tpl]

==Life==

Barzun was born in Créteil, France to Henri-Martin and Anna-Rose Barzun. He spent his childhood in Paris and Grenoble. His father was a member of the Abbaye de Créteil group of artists and writers and also worked in the French Ministry of Labor.[tpl]cite news| first= Roger |last= Gathman| url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=78886 | title= The Man Who Knew Too Much: Jacques Barzun, Idea Man | work= The Austin Chronicle |date= 13 October 2000 |accessdate= 16 September 2009[/tpl] His parents' Paris home was frequented by many "modernist" artists of belle epoque France, such as poet Guillaume Apollinaire, Cubist painters Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp, composer Edgard Varèse, and writers Richard Aldington and Stefan Zweig. While on a diplomatic mission to the United States during the First World War, Barzun's father so liked what he saw that he decided that his son should have an American university education. Thus, Barzun was sent to the United States at age 12, first to attend a preparatory school, then Columbia University, where he obtained a broad liberal education.
As an undergraduate at Columbia College, Barzun was drama critic for the Columbia Daily Spectator, a prize-winning president of the Philolexian Society, the Columbia literary and debate club, and valedictorian of the class of 1927.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jan06/cover.php |title=COVER STORY, Living Legacies: Jacques Barzun ’27 | author =Thomas Vinciguerra||work=Columbia College Today |publisher=College.columbia.edu |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate= October 28, 2012[/tpl] He obtained his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1932 and taught history there from 1928 to 1955, becoming the Seth Low Professor of History and a founder of the discipline of cultural history. For years, he and literary critic Lionel Trilling, ran Columbia's famous Great Books course. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B| url= http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf |publisher= American Academy of Arts and Sciences| accessdate=May 20, 2011[/tpl] From 1955 to 1968, he served as Dean of the Graduate School, Dean of Faculties, and Provost, while also being an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge. From 1968 until his 1975 retirement, he was University Professor at Columbia. From 1951 to 1963 Barzun was one of the managing editors of The Readers' Subscription Book Club, and its successor the Mid-Century Book Society, (the other managing editors being W. H. Auden and Lionel Trilling), and afterwards was Literary Adviser to Charles Scribner's Sons, 1975 to 1993.
In 1936, Barzun married Mariana Lowell, a violinist from a  prominent Boston family. They had three children: James, Roger, and Isabel.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862171-8,00.html | title=Education: Parnassus, Coast to Coast | work= Time | date=11 June 1956 | accessdate= 1 November 2012[/tpl] Mariana died in 1979. In 1980, Barzun married Marguerite Lee Davenport. From 1996 the Barzuns lived in her hometown, San Antonio, Texas. His granddaughter Lucy Barzun Donnelly was a producer of the award-winning HBO film Grey Gardens. His grandson, Matthew Barzun, is a businessman who served from 2009-2011 as the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, and in 2013 was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom. On May 14, 2012 Jacques Barzun attended a symphony performance in his honor at which works by his favorite composer, Hector Berlioz, were performed.[tpl]cite news| first=Deborah | last= Martin | url= http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/article/In-the-Spotlight-Honoring-expert-on-Berlioz-3557449.php | title= In the Spotlight: Honoring expert on Berlioz| work= San Antonio Express-News| date= 14 May 2012[/tpl] He attended in a wheelchair and delivered a brief address to the crowd.
Barzun died peacefully at his home in San Antonio, Texas on October 25, 2012, aged 104.  The New York Times, which compared him with such scholars as Sidney Hook, Daniel Bell, and Lionel Trilling, called him a "distinguished historian, essayist, cultural gadfly and educator who helped establish the modern discipline of cultural history".[tpl]cite news |title=Jacques Barzun Dies at 104; Cultural Critic Saw the Sun Setting on the West |newspaper=New York Times |first=Edward |last=Rothstein | authorlink = Edward Rothstein|date=October 25, 2012 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/arts/jacques-barzun-historian-and-scholar-dies-at-104.html [/tpl] Naming Edward Gibbon, Jacob Burckhardt and Thomas Babington Macaulay as his intellectual ancestors, and calling him "one of the West's most eminent historians of culture" and "a champion of the liberal arts tradition in higher education," who "deplored what he called the 'gangrene of specialism'", The Telegraph remarked, "The sheer scope of his knowledge was extraordinary. Barzun’s eye roamed over the full spectrum of Western music, art, literature and philosophy."[tpl]cite news |title=Jacques Barzun |date=October 26, 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9636970/Jacques-Barzun.html [/tpl] Essayist Joseph Epstein, remembering him in the Wall Street Journal as a "flawless and magisterial" writer who tackled "Darwin, Marx, Wagner, Berlioz, William James, French verse, English prose composition, university teaching, detective fiction, and the state of intellectual life", described Barzun as a tall, handsome man with an understated elegance, thoroughly Americanized, but retaining an air of old-world culture, cosmopolitan in  an elegant way rare for intellectuals".[tpl]cite news |title=Jacques Barzun: An Appreciation |first=Joseph |last=Epstein |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204598504578080902026564368.html |date=October 26, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]subscription needed[/tpl]

==Career==

Over seven decades, Barzun wrote and edited more than forty books touching on an unusually broad range of subjects, including science and medicine, psychiatry from Robert Burton through William James to modern methods, and art, and classical music; he was one of the all-time authorities on Hector Berlioz. Some of his books—particularly Teacher in America and The House of Intellect—enjoyed a substantial lay readership and influenced debate about culture and education far beyond the realm of academic history. Barzun had a strong interest in the tools and mechanics of writing and research. He undertook the task of completing, from a manuscript almost two-thirds of which was in first draft at the author's death, and editing (with the help of six other people), the first edition (published 1966) of Follett's Modern American Usage. Barzun was also the author of books on literary style (Simple and Direct, 1975), on the crafts of editing and publishing (On Writing, Editing, and Publishing, 1971), and on research methods in history and the other humanities (The Modern Researcher, which has seen at least six editions).
Barzun did not disdain popular culture: his varied interests included detective fiction and baseball.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/212819-when-baseballs-best-cultural-critic-turned-his-back-on-the-game |title=Jacques Barzun, "Baseball's Best Cultural Critic", Turns His Back on the Game |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 26, 2012[/tpl]  His widely quoted statement, “Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.” was inscribed on a plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite news |title=Jacques Barzun, wide-ranging cultural historian, dies at 104 |first=Joe |last=Holley |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jacques-barzun-wide-ranging-cultural-historian-dies-at-104/2012/10/26/33a202c4-c5da-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html [/tpl] He edited and wrote the introduction to the 1961 anthology, The Delights of Detection, which included stories by G. K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers, Rex Stout, and others.  In 1971, Barzun co-authored (with Wendell Hertig Taylor), A Catalogue of Crime: Being a Reader's Guide to the Literature of Mystery, Detection, & Related Genres, for which he and his co-author received a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America the following year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mysterywriters.org/pages/awards/index.htm | title=The Edgars and Other MWA Awards|publisher=Mystery Writers of America|accessdate=2007-07-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070625063228/http://www.mysterywriters.org/pages/awards/index.htm  |archivedate = 2007-06-25[/tpl] Barzun was also an advocate
of supernatural fiction, and wrote the introduction to The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural. [ref] "Author and teacher Jacques Barzun has written an authorative introduction". B. Williams, "A Complete Guide for all lovers
of horror" (Review of The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural. The Courier-Mail, January 31st, 1987. [/ref]  Barzun was a proponent of the theatre critic and diarist James Agate, whom he compared in stature to Samuel Pepys.From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present, Jacques Barzun, Harper Perennial, 2001.  Barzun edited Agate's last two diaries into a new edition in 1951 and wrote an informative introductory essay, "Agate and His Nine Egos".The Later Ego. Consisting of Ego 8 and Ego 9. Introduction and notes by Jacques Barzun, Jacques Barzun, Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, 1951.
Jacques Barzun continued to write on education and cultural history after retiring from Columbia. At 84 years of age, he began writing his swan song, to which he devoted the better part of the 1990s. The resulting book of more than 800 pages, From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present, reveals a vast erudition and brilliance undimmed by advanced age. Historians, literary critics, and popular reviewers all lauded From Dawn to Decadence as a sweeping and powerful survey of modern Western history, and it became a New York Times bestseller. With this work he gained an international reputation.[ref]Le Nouvel Observateur'', which said "il a connu un rayonnement international avec la sortie de "From dawn to decadence".

The book introduces several novel typographic devices that aid an unusually rich system of cross-referencing and help keep many strands of thought in the book under organized control. Most pages feature a sidebar containing a pithy quotation, usually little known, and often surprising or humorous, from some author or historical figure. In 2007, Barzun commented that "Old age is like learning a new profession. And not one of your own choosing."Age of Reason by Arthur Krystal in The New Yorker, October 22, 2007, p. 103
In his philosophy of writing history, Barzun emphasized the role of storytelling over the use of academic jargon and detached analysis. He concluded in From Dawn to Decadence that "history cannot be a science; it is the very opposite, in that its interest resides in the particulars."From Dawn to Decadence, pp 654–656
