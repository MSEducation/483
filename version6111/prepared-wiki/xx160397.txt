[[Glutamate formimidoyltransferase]]

CATEGORIES: Protein domains, EC 2.1.2

In molecular biology, Glutamate formimidoyltransferase is a methyltransferase enzyme which uses tetrahydrofolate as part of histidine catabolism. It catalyses two reactions:
It is classified under [tpl]EC number|2.1.2.5[/tpl] and in mammals is found as part of a bifunctional enzyme that also has formimidoyltetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase activity.[tpl]cite journal |author=MacKenzie RE, Aldridge M, Paquin J |title=The bifunctional enzyme formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase is a tetramer of dimers |journal=J.

==Structure==

The formiminotransferase (FT) domain of formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD) forms a homodimer, with each protomer comprising two subdomains. The formiminotransferase domain has an N-terminal subdomain that is made up of a six-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kohls D, Sulea T, Purisima EO, MacKenzie RE, Vrielink A | title = The crystal structure of the formiminotransferase domain of formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase: implications for substrate channeling in a bifunctional enzyme | journal = Structure | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–46 |date=January 2000 | pmid = 10673422 | doi = 10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00078-2| url = [/tpl] In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in a disease phenotype.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hilton JF, Christensen KE, Watkins D, Raby BA, Renaud Y, de la Luna S, Estivill X, MacKenzie RE, Hudson TJ, Rosenblatt DS | title = The molecular basis of glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency | journal = Hum.
