Trillium catesbaei, also known as bashful wakerobin or rosy wake-robin,  is a spring flowering perennial plant found in the southeastern United States. Like most trilliums, it prefers moist, humus-rich soil in shade.   Its northern limit includes the Great Smoky Mountains and other parts of North Carolina and Tennessee. Most of its populations are in the Piedmont from North Carolina to Alabama, under deciduous trees such as American beech, various oak and hickory species, and tulip poplar. Its southernmost natural occurrence is in Early County, Georgia.
