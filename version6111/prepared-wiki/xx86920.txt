[[Canonical commutation relation]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Mathematical physics

In quantum mechanics (physics), the canonical commutation relation is the fundamental relation between canonical conjugate quantities (quantities which are related by definition such that one is the Fourier transform of another). For example,
between the position [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] and momentum [tpl]mvar|px[/tpl] in the  [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl]  direction of a point particle in one dimension, where [tpl]math| , px [tpl]=[/tpl] x px − px x[/tpl]  is the commutator of [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] and  [tpl]mvar|px [/tpl], [tpl]mvar|i[/tpl] is the imaginary unit, and [tpl]math|ℏ[/tpl] is the reduced Planck's constant [tpl]math|[tpl]sfrac|h|2π[/tpl][/tpl]  .
This relation is attributed to Max Born (1925),[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01328531|noedit[/tpl] who called it a "quantum condition" serving as a postulate of the theory;  it was noted by E. Kennard (1927)[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01391200|noedit[/tpl] to imply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

==Relation to classical mechanics==

By contrast, in classical physics, all observables commute and the commutator would be zero. However, an analogous relation exists, which is obtained by replacing the commutator with the Poisson bracket multiplied by [tpl]math|iℏ[/tpl]:
This observation led Dirac to propose that the quantum counterparts   [tpl]mvar|f̂[/tpl],  [tpl]mvar|ĝ[/tpl] of classical observables [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl], [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] satisfy
In 1946, Hip Groenewold demonstrated that a general systematic correspondence  between  quantum commutators and Poisson brackets could not hold consistently.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0031-8914(46)80059-4|noedit[/tpl] However, he did appreciate that such a systematic correspondence does, in fact, exist between the quantum commutator and a deformation of the Poisson bracket, the Moyal bracket, and, in general, quantum operators and  classical observables and distributions in phase space. He thus finally elucidated the correspondence mechanism, Weyl quantization, that underlies an alternate equivalent mathematical approach to quantization known as deformation quantization.

==Representations==

The group [tpl]math|H3(ℝ)[/tpl] generated by exponentiation of the Lie algebra specified by these commutation relations, [tpl]math|1=x, p = iℏ[/tpl], is called the Heisenberg group.
According to the standard mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, quantum observables such as [tpl]math|x[/tpl]  and [tpl]math|p[/tpl] should be represented as self-adjoint operators on some Hilbert space.  It is relatively easy to see that two operators satisfying the above canonical commutation relations cannot both be bounded—try taking the Trace of both sides of the relations and use the relation [tpl]math|1=Trace(A B ) = Trace(B A )[/tpl]; one gets a finite number on the right and zero on the left.More directly, note [tpl]math|1=xn, p = i ℏ n xn − 1[/tpl], hence [tpl]math|2 ‖ p ‖ ‖ x ‖n ≥ n ℏ ‖ x ‖n − 1[/tpl], so that, [tpl]math|∀n: 2 ‖ p ‖ ‖ x ‖ ≥ n ℏ[/tpl]. However, [tpl]mvar|n[/tpl]  can be arbitrarily large. Utilizing the Weyl relations, below, it can actually be shown that both operators are unbounded.
These canonical commutation relations can be rendered somewhat "tamer" by writing them in terms of the (bounded) unitary operators [tpl]math|exp(i t x)[/tpl] and [tpl]math|exp(i s p)[/tpl], which do admit finite-dimensional representations. The resulting braiding relations for these are the so-called Weyl relations 
The corresponding group commutator is then 
The uniqueness of the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum is then guaranteed by the Stone–von Neumann theorem.

==Generalizations==

The simple formula
This definition of the canonical momentum ensures that one of the Euler–Lagrange equations has the form
The canonical commutation relations then amount to
where [tpl]math|δij[/tpl] is the Kronecker delta.
Further, it can be easily shown that

==Gauge invariance==

Canonical quantization is applied, by definition, on canonical coordinates.  However, in the presence of an electromagnetic field, the canonical momentum [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl] is not gauge invariant.  The correct gauge-invariant momentum (or "kinetic momentum") is
where [tpl]mvar|q[/tpl] is the particle's electric charge, [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] is the vector potential, and [tpl]math|c[/tpl] is the speed of light. Although the quantity [tpl]math|pkin[/tpl] is the "physical momentum", in that it is the quantity to be identified with momentum in laboratory experiments, it does not satisfy the canonical commutation relations; only the canonical momentum does that. This can be seen as follows.
The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for a quantized charged particle of mass [tpl]mvar|m[/tpl] in a classical electromagnetic field is (in cgs units)
where [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] is the three-vector potential and  [tpl]mvar|φ[/tpl] is the scalar potential. This form of the Hamiltonian, as well as the Schrödinger equation  [tpl]math|Hψ [tpl]=[/tpl] iħ∂ψ/∂t[/tpl], the Maxwell equations and the Lorentz force law are invariant under the gauge transformation
where
and Λ=Λ(x,t) is the gauge function.
The angular momentum operator is
and obeys the canonical quantization relations 
The gauge-invariant angular momentum (or "kinetic angular momentum") is given by
which has the commutation relations
where
is the magnetic field. The inequivalence of these two formulations shows up in the Zeeman effect and the Aharonov–Bohm effect.

==Angular momentum operators==

From [tpl]math|1=Lx = y pz − z py[/tpl], etc, it follows directly from the above that 
All such nontrivial commutation relations for pairs of operators lead to corresponding uncertainty relations,[tpl]cite journal |first=H. P. |last=Robertson |title=The Uncertainty Principle |journal=Physical Review |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=1929 |pages=163–164 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 |bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R [/tpl] involving positive semi-definite expectation contributions by their respective commutators and anticommutators.  In general, for two Hermitian operators [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|B[/tpl], consider expectation values in a system in the state [tpl]mvar|ψ[/tpl], the variances around the corresponding expectation values being [tpl]math|1=(ΔA)2 ≡ [tpl]langle[/tpl](A − [tpl]langle[/tpl]A[tpl]rangle[/tpl])2[tpl]rangle[/tpl][/tpl], etc.
Then 
where [tpl]math|1=A, B ≡ A B − B A[/tpl] is the commutator of [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|B[/tpl], and [tpl]math|1={A, B} ≡ A B + B A[/tpl] is the anticommutator.
This follows through use of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, since
[tpl]math|[tpl]![/tpl][tpl]langle[/tpl]A2[tpl]rangle[/tpl][tpl]![/tpl] [tpl]![/tpl][tpl]langle[/tpl]B2[tpl]rangle[/tpl][tpl]![/tpl] ≥ [tpl]![/tpl][tpl]langle[/tpl]A B[tpl]rangle[/tpl][tpl]![/tpl]2[/tpl], and [tpl]math|1=A B = (A, B + {A, B})/2 [/tpl]; and similarly for the shifted operators [tpl]math|A − [tpl]langle[/tpl]A[tpl]rangle[/tpl][/tpl] and  [tpl]math|B − [tpl]langle[/tpl]B[tpl]rangle[/tpl][/tpl]. (cf. Uncertainty principle derivations.)
Judicious choices for [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|B[/tpl] yield Heisenberg's familiar uncertainty relation for [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl], as usual.
Here, for [tpl]mvar|Lx[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|Ly [/tpl], in angular momentum multiplets [tpl]math|1=ψ = [tpl]![/tpl][tpl]ell[/tpl],m[tpl]rangle[/tpl][/tpl], one has [tpl]math|1=[tpl]langle[/tpl]Lx2[tpl]rangle[/tpl] = [tpl]langle[/tpl]Ly2[tpl]rangle[/tpl] = ([tpl]ell[/tpl] ([tpl]ell[/tpl] + 1) − m2) ℏ2/2 [/tpl], so the above inequality yields useful constraints such as a lower bound on the Casimir invariant [tpl]math|[tpl]ell[/tpl] ([tpl]ell[/tpl] + 1) ≥ m (m + 1)[/tpl], and hence [tpl]math|[tpl]ell[/tpl] ≥ m[/tpl], among others.
