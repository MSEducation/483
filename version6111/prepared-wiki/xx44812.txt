==Etymology and related words==

The Old Iranian term airyanəm vaējah (in Avestan) is formed from the plural genitive case of airya and the word vaējah (whose oft-used nominative case is vaējō). The meaning of vaējah is uncertain. It may be related to the old Indic vej/vij (in Vedic), suggesting the region of a fast-flowing river.see Edwin Bryant, The Quest for the origins of Vedic culture, 2001: 327 it has also been interpreted by some as "seed" or "germ". Avestan airya is etymologically related to the Old Persian ariya. 
The related OIr. term *aryānām xšaθra- generated the name of "Iran" (through Middle Iranian renderings, such as the Middle Persian term Ērān-shahr and ultimately Ērān during Sassanian empire).

==Historical concepts==

The historical location of Airyanem Vaejah is still uncertain. In the first chapter of the Vendidad is a listing of sixteen countries, and some scholars believe that Airyanem Vaejah lies to the north of all of these.Zoroaster’s Time and Homeland: A Study on the Origins of Mazdeism and Related Problems by Gherardo Gnoli, Instituto Universitario Orientale, Seminario di Studi Asiatici, (Series Minor VII), Naples, 1980 But according to the Harvard University scholar Michael Witzel, Airyanem Vaejah lies at the center of these lands, in the central Afghan highlandsM. Witzel, "The Vīdẽvdaδ list obviously was composed or redacted by someone who regarded Afghanistan and the lands surrounding it as the home of all Aryans (airiia), that is of all (eastern) Iranians, with Airiianem Vaẽjah as their center." page 48, "The Home Of The Aryans", Festschrift J. Narten = Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft, Beihefte NF 19, Dettelbach: J.H. Röll 2000, 283-338. Also published online, at  Harvard University (LINK) (in the Wardak, Bamyan and Ghor regions). Bahram Farahvashi and Nasser Takmil Homayoun suggest that Airyanem Vaejah was probably centered around Khwarazm,Nasser Takmil Homayoun, Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?. 2004. ISBN 964-379-023-1 a region that is now split between several Central Asian republics. The University of Hawaii historian Elton L. Daniel likewise believes Khwarazm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the Avestan people,Elton L. Daniel, The History of Iran. 2001. ISBN 0-313-30731-8 and Dehkhoda once called Khwarazm "the cradle of the Aryan tribe". Talageri, in his book "The Rigveda: A Historical Analysis", proposes Airyam Vaejah to be located in Kashmir. http://voiceofdharma.org/books/rig/ch6.htm
