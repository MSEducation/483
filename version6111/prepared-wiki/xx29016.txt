The pomegranate has been mentioned in many ancient texts, notably in Babylonian texts, the Book of Exodus, the Homeric Hymns and the Quran.[tpl]Bibleref|Exodus|28:33-35|NIV[/tpl] In recent years, it has become more common in the commercial markets of North America and the Western Hemisphere.
Pomegranates are used in cooking, baking, juices, smoothies and alcoholic beverages, such as martinis and wine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pomegranatefacts.net/unique-pomegranate-treats-drinks.html |title=pomegranatefacts Resources and Information.|publisher=pomegranatefacts.net |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl]

==Description==

The Punica granatum leaves are opposite or sub-opposite, glossy, narrow oblong, entire, 3–7 cm long and 2 cm broad. The flowers are bright red, 3 cm in diameter, with four to five petals (often more on cultivated plants). Some fruitless varieties are grown for the flowers alone. The edible fruit is a berry and is between a lemon and a grapefruit in size, 5–12 cm in diameter with a rounded hexagonal shape, and has thick reddish skin. The exact number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1400 seeds, contrary to some beliefs that all pomegranates have exactly the same number of seeds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aquaphoenix.com/misc/pomegranate/| title=Does a larger pomegranate yield more seeds?| publisher=AquaPhoenix[/tpl] Each seed has a surrounding water-laden pulp—the edible sarcotesta that forms from the seed coat—ranging in color from white to deep red or purple. The seeds are embedded in a white, spongy, astringent membrane.Floridata: Punica granatum

==Cultivation==

Punica granatum is grown as a fruit crop plant, and as ornamental trees and shrubs in parks and gardens. Mature specimens can develop sculptural twisted bark multi-trunks and a distinctive overall form. Pomegranates are drought-tolerant, and can be grown in dry areas with either a Mediterranean winter rainfall climate or in summer rainfall climates. In wetter areas, they can be prone to root decay from fungal diseases. They can be tolerant of moderate frost, down to about −12 °C (10 °F).M.D. Sheets, former research assistant, M.L.

Insect pests of the pomegranate can include the pomegranate butterfly Virachola isocrates and the leaf-footed bug Leptoglossus zonatus. Pomegranate grows easily from seed, but is commonly propagated from 25–50 cm hardwood cuttings to avoid the genetic variation of seedlings. Air layering is also an option for propagation, but grafting fails.

===Varieties===

Punica granatum var. nana is a dwarf variety of P. granatum popularly planted as an ornamental plant in gardens and larger containers, and used as a bonsai specimen tree. It could well be a wild form with a distinct origin. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[tpl]cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - Punica granatum var. nana|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3482|accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl] The only other species in the genus Punica is the Socotran pomegranate (Punica protopunica), which is endemic to the island of Socotra. It differs in having pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit.[tpl]cite web|title=Punica granatum - the Drops of Blood from Garden of Eden|url=http://toptropicals.com/html/toptropicals/plant_wk/pomegranate.htm[/tpl]

===Cultivars===

Punica granatum has more than 500 named cultivars, but the pomegranate evidently has considerable synonymy in which the same genotype is named differently across regions of the world.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stover E, Mercure EW |title=The pomegranate: a new look at the fruit of paradise |journal=HortScience |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1088–92 |date=August 2007 |pmid=[/tpl]
Several characteristics between pomegranate genotypes vary for identification, consumer preference, preferred use, and marketing, the most important of which are fruit size, exocarp color (ranging from yellow to purple, with pink and red most common), seed-coat color (ranging from white to red), hardness of seed, maturity, juice content and its acidity, sweetness, and astringency.

==Etymology and terms for pomegranate in other languages==

The name pomegranate derives from medieval Latin pōmum "apple" and grānātum "seeded".medieval latin etymology of pomegranate on etymonline http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pomegranate&allowed_in_frame=0 This has influenced the common name for pomegranate in many languages (e.g. granada in Spanish, Granatapfel or Grenadine in German, grenade in French, granatäpple in Swedish, pomogranà in Venetian). Mālum grānātus, using the classical Latin word for apple, gives rise to the Italian name melograno, or less commonly melagrana.[tpl]cite web|title=Fruit of the Month − Pomegranate|url=http://www.kddc.com/fruitsofmonth.aspx[/tpl]
Perhaps stemming from the old French word for the fruit, pomme-grenade, the pomegranate was known in early English as "apple of Grenada"—a term which today survives only in heraldic blazons. This is a folk etymology, confusing Latin granatus with the name of the Spanish city of Granada, which derives from Arabic.[tpl]cite web|title=All hail the Pomegranate, official symbol of Granada|url=http://thelecrinvalley.wordpress.com/tag/pomegranate/[/tpl]
The genus name Punica refers to the Phoenicians, who were active in broadening its cultivation, partly for religious reasons.
Garnet comes from Old French grenat by metathesis, from Medieval Latin granatum, here used in a different meaning: "of a dark red color". This meaning perhaps originated from pomum granatum because of the color of pomegranate pulp, or from granum in the sense of "red dye, cochineal".[tpl]OEtymD|garnet[/tpl]
The French term grenade for pomegranate has given its name to the military grenade.Harper, Douglas (8 Oct 2011) "Grenade" Online Etymology Dictionary Soldiers commented on the similar shape of early grenades and the name entered common usage.
While most European languages have cognate names for the fruit, stemming from Latin granatum, exceptions are the Armenian term nur,  Albanian term shega, Bulgarian nar and  the Portuguese term romã which is derived from Arabic ruman, and has cognates in other Semitic languages (e.g. Hebrew rimmon) and Ancient Egyptian rmn.

==Cultural history==

The pomegranate is native to Persia (modern day Iran).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469326/pomegranate |title=pomegranate (plant) - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl] Pomegranates also thrive in the drier climates of California and Arizona, and have been cultivated in Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Russia, Bangladesh and the Mediterranean region for several millennia.[tpl]cite book |author=Doijode, S.

Carbonized exocarp of the fruit has been identified in Early Bronze Age levels of Jericho in the West Bank, as well as Late Bronze Age levels of Hala Sultan Tekke on Cyprus and Tiryns.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] A large, dry pomegranate was found in the tomb of Djehuty, the butler of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt; Mesopotamian cuneiform records mention pomegranates from the mid-Third millennium BC onwards.[tpl]cite book |author=Hopf, Maria; Zohary, Daniel |title=Domestication of plants in the old world: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=2000 |page=171 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-19-850356-3 [/tpl]
It is also extensively grown in South China and in Southeast Asia, whether originally spread along the route of the Silk Road or brought by sea traders. Kandahar is famous in Afghanistan for its high quality pomegranates.
Although not native to Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there and many cultivars have been developed. It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers and for the unusual twisted bark that older specimens can attain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240228&isize=L |title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |accessdate=2012-06-14[/tpl] The term "balaustine" ([tpl]lang-la|balaustinus[/tpl]) is also used for a pomegranate-red color.[tpl]cite book |author=Osborne, Roy; Pavey, Don |title=On Colours 1528: A Translation from Latin |publisher=Universal Publishers |location=Parkland, Fla |year=2003 |isbn=1-58112-580-1 [/tpl]
Pomegranate cultivation in Italy is diffused throughout the south, especially in Olevano sul Tusciano and the rest of Campania's area.
The ancient city of Granada in Spain was renamed after the fruit during the Moorish period. Spanish colonists later introduced the fruit to the Caribbean and Latin America, but in the English colonies it was less at home: "Don't use the pomegranate inhospitably, a stranger that has come so far to pay his respects to thee," the English Quaker Peter Collinson wrote to the botanizing John Bartram in Philadelphia, 1762. "Plant it against the side of thy house, nail it close to the wall. In this manner it thrives wonderfully with us, and flowers beautifully, and bears fruit this hot year. I have twenty-four on one tree... Doctor Fothergill says, of all trees this is most salutiferous to mankind."[tpl]cite book |author=Leighton, Ann |title=American gardens in the eighteenth century: "for use or for delight" |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |location=Amherst |year=1986 |page=242 |isbn=0-87023-531-1 [/tpl] The pomegranate had been introduced as an exotic to England the previous century, by John Tradescant the elder, but the disappointment that it did not set fruit there led to its repeated introduction to the American colonies, even New England. It succeeded in the South: Bartram received a barrel of pomegranates and oranges from a correspondent in Charleston, South Carolina, 1764. John Bartram partook of "delitious" pomegranates with Noble Jones at Wormsloe Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia, in September 1765.  Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello in 1771: he had them from George Wythe of Williamsburg.Leighton, American Gardens, p. 272.

===Culinary use===

After the pomegranate is opened by scoring it with a knife and breaking it open, the seeds are separated from the peel and internal white pulp membranes. Separating the seeds is easier in a bowl of water because the seeds sink and the inedible pulp floats. Freezing the entire fruit also makes it easier to separate. Another very effective way of quickly harvesting the seeds is to cut the pomegranate in half, score each half of the exterior rind four to six times, hold the pomegranate half over a bowl and smack the rind with a large spoon. The seeds should eject from the pomegranate directly into the bowl, leaving only a dozen or more deeply embedded seeds to remove.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gourmet.com/food/testkitchen/2008/12/roberts_how_to_de-seed_pomegranate |title=How to de-seed a pomegranate |publisher=Gourmet.com |year=2008 [/tpl]
The entire seed is consumed raw, though the watery, tasty sarcotesta is the desired part. The taste differs depending on the subspecies of pomegranate and its ripeness.
The pomegranate juice can be very sweet or sour, but most fruits are moderate in taste, with sour notes from the acidic tannins contained in the juice. Pomegranate juice has long been a popular drink in Armenian, Persian and Indian cuisine, and began to be widely distributed in the United States and Canada in 2002.[tpl]cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1118248441.html?dids=1118248441:1118248441&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+1%2C+2006&author=Jane+Porter&pub=The+Sun&desc=POMEGRANATES+GAIN+THE+SPOTLIGHT+ | title=Pomegranates Gain The Spotlight ; Fruit Earning Fans As More People Discover Its Health Benefits; Staying Healthy | first=Jane | last=Porter | date=2006-09-01[/tpl]
Grenadine syrup long ago consisted of thickened and sweetened pomegranate juice, but nowadays it is usually a salesname for a syrup based on various berries, citric acid and food coloring, mainly used in cocktail mixing. In Europe, Bols still manufactures grenadine syrup with pomegranate.[ref]
