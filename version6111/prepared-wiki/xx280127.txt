==History==

Warsaw Vodka Factory "Koneser", originally Spirit Distillation Plant (Polish: Fabryka Oczyszczania Spirytusu), was established in 1897 on the initiative of the Polish-Russian Warsaw Society of Distillation and Sale of Spirits. In those days, on the premises of the factory, apart from industrial buildings, the factory complex included warehouses, workshops, residential buildings and a school. At the time the factory was one of the most technologically advanced production plants in Warsaw. The interwar period was the prime of the factory, which at that time was also referred to as the Monopoly. The factory employed more than 400 people, and its production capacity totalled at quarter of a million bottles of vodka a day. In the twenties of the twentieth century "Koneser" created universally recognizable vodka brands such as: Wyborowa, Luksusowa, Żubrówka, Żytniówka and Siwucha. The further development of the plant was disrupted by the outbreak of the WW II. As a result, the production was significantly reduced and subsequently stopped.J.Zieliński: Koneser, Ząbkowska i okolice Warszawa 2012, s. 47-59 In the late 1940s, after the Second World War and necessary revitalization of the factory, the production was resumed and it continued up to the last decade, when the worsening condition of the company led to the end of production and shutdown of the factory.www.gazeta.pl Trzewia fabryki wódek: spacerownik po Koneserze/Kordegarda i dom administracji |8 August 2013. Along with the acquisition of the land by BBI Development the idea of the Praga Koneser Center was born.www.ikw.org.pl Dawna Wytwórnia Wódek Koneser | 8 August 2013.
