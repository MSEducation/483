Wout Holverda (born 22 April 1958) is a  former Dutch footballer who played most of his career  for Sparta Rotterdam.

==Club career==

A speedy and stocky forward, Holverda started his professional football career at Sparta and played 7 seasons for them, ending up as their top goalscorer in the 1983/1984 season. That earned him a move to Fortuna Sittard, where he played alongside British striker John Linford, but a niggling groin injury did not make him a success at Fortuna and he spent his last seasons at HFC Haarlem before retiring.
With Sparta as well as with Fortuna he played European Cup matches, 11 games in total (4 goals)Holverda in European games - Voetbalstats
