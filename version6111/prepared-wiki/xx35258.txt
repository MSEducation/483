Dungeon Adventures, or simply Dungeon, was a magazine targeting consumers of role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. It was first published by TSR, Inc. in 1986 as a bimonthly periodical.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp | title = Dungeons & Dragons Archives—The History of TSR: 1966–1999 | year = 2003 | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | location = Renton, WA | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110629070110/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp | archivedate = January 29, 2011 | deadurl = no | accessdate = August 20, 2005[/tpl] It went monthly in May 2003 and ceased print publication altogether in September 2007 with Issue 150.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070419a | title = Paizo Publishing to Cease Publication of DRAGON and DUNGEON | date = April 19, 2007 | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | location = Renton, WA | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100308103201/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070419a | archivedate = March 8, 2010 | deadurl = no | accessdate = March 23, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | editor-last = Jacobs | editor-first = J. |date=July 2007 | title = All Good Things | journal = Dungeon Adventures | issue = 148 | page = 6 | location = Bellevue, WA | publisher = Paizo | issn = 0890-7102[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Mona | first = E. | authorlink = Erik Mona | editor-last = Jacobs | editor-first = J |date=August 2007 | title = Statement from the Publisher | journal = Dungeon Adventures | issue = 149 | page = 7 | location = Bellevue, WA | publisher = Paizo | issn = 0890-7102[/tpl] Its sister publication was the more widely read Dragon. As of 2008, both magazines are published by Wizards of the Coast in an online format.
Each issue featured a variety of self-contained, pre-scripted, play-tested game scenarios, often called "modules" (commonly referred to as "adventures" or "scenarios"). Dungeon Masters (DMs) could either enact these adventures with their respective player groups as written or adapt them to their own campaign settings. By providing a full complement of ideas, hooks, plots, adversaries, creatures, illustrations, maps, hand-outs, and character dialogue, Dungeon aimed to save DMs time and effort in preparing game sessions for their players. As a resource containing several modules per issue, it was significantly cheaper than standard-format modules.

Dungeon Adventures first received mention in the editor's column of Dragon Issue 107 (March 1986). Lacking a title at that point, it was described as "a new magazine filled entirely with modules" made available "by subscription only" that would debut "in the late summer or early fall" of 1986 and "come out once every two months."[tpl]cite journal | editor-last = Mohan | editor-first = K. | editor-link = Kim Mohan |date=March 1986 | title = Coming Soon: A Magazine Full of Modules | journal = Dragon | issue = 107 | page = 3 | location = Lake Geneva, WI | publisher = TSR | issn = 0279-6848[/tpl]
The publication's original editor, Roger E. Moore, elaborated on this basic outline: Dungeon Adventures is a new periodical from TSR, Inc., in which you, the readers, may share your own adventures and scenarios from AD&D and D&D gaming with the legions of other fantasy gamers. Each issue offers a number of fairly short (but often quite complicated and long-playing) modules, selected from the best we receive.
What kind of adventures do you want to see? We're going to offer as broad a spectrum of material as possible: dungeon crawls, wilderness camp-outs, Oriental Adventures modules, solo quests, tournament designs, Battlesystem scenarios, and more.[tpl]cite journal | editor-last = Moore | editor-first = R.

The premiere issue of Dungeon: Adventures for TSR Role-Playing Games was undated, but "November/December 1986" appears on the cover of the subsequent issue, and Moore stated that it had been released prior to the November issue of Dragon.[tpl]cite journal | editor-last = Moore | editor-first = R. E. |date=November 1986 | title = Hello, Hello | journal = Dragon | issue = 115 | page = 3 | location = Lake Geneva, WI | publisher = TSR | issn = 0279-6848[/tpl] As the newly installed editor of both Dragon and Dungeon, Moore himself appeared in the "TSR Profiles" feature on page 82 of this issue. The magazine's format consisted of 64 pages of short D&D and AD&D game adventures of various lengths, themes, and tones, written by both amateur and professional fantasy role-playing writers.
In conjunction with the first anniversary of Dungeon Adventures, Ken Rolston included a brief review in Issue 125 (September 1987) of Dragon. Regarding the modules themselves, he called them "cheap and cheerful, full of the basic fun of D&D games", and said that they reminded him of "the selection of game sessions you find at gaming conventions or in old-fashioned modules". Rolston commented on the anthology format, which allowed writers to "publish fine little bits" and provided "great training grounds for new writers" that offered "an opportunity to experiment with offbeat themes and tones". Rolston concluded that "sophisticated gamers will find a lot to snicker at here, but there are some cute ideas", and added that the "writing ranges from young and enthusiastic to polished, and when compared with some of TSR's current modules...the quality of the layout and graphics is quite decent."[tpl]cite journal | last = Rolston | first = K. | authorlink = Ken Rolston | editor-last = Moore | editor-first = R.

==Paizo and Polyhedron==

In late 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired publishing rights to both Dungeon and Dragon magazine titles as part of a move by Wizards of the Coast to divest business ventures not related to its core business.
Beginning with Issue 90 (January 2002) and lasting until Issue 111 (June 2004), Polyhedron, the monthly membership publication of the Role-Playing Game Association, was combined with Dungeon into a single magazine.As is standard practice when a periodical undergoes a major title change, Dungeon was assigned a different ISSN during this period: [tpl]ISSN search link|1526-6391[/tpl]. Many of the Polyhedron sections presented complete mini-games for the d20 system in genres other than fantasy.
In September 2004, starting with Issue 114, editor Erik Mona changed the format, discontinuing the Polyhedron component and focusing solely on Dungeons & Dragons.[tpl]cite journal | editor-last = Mona | editor-first = E. |date=September 2004 | title = Building a Better Dungeon | journal = Dungeon Adventures | issue = 114 | pages = 6–7 | location = Bellevue, WA | publisher = Paizo | issn = 0890-7102[/tpl] In addition to three adventures per issue (one each for low, medium, and high levels), a few issues each year contained another substantial article which typically provided further details on the setting of one of the adventures (previously, Dungeon almost never had features other than modules). Following the adventures and articles, many issues included the three-page "Dungeoncraft" column, at the time written by Monte Cook, as well as a handful of shorter articles on various subjects, collectively titled the "Campaign Workbook".
On April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that Paizo would cease publication of Dungeon in September of that year. Scott Rouse, senior brand manager of Dungeons & Dragons at Wizards of the Coast, stated, "Today the internet is where people go to get this kind of information. By moving to an online model we are using a delivery system that broadens our reach to fans around the world."

==Dungeon magazine online==

Coinciding with the release of the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons in June 2008, Wizards of the Coast launched a website that included online versions of Dungeon and Dragon magazines for subscribers. In this new format, Dungeon retained its mandate to deliver adventures of varying lengths and levels as well as articles with information and advice for DMs. Mainstay columns such as "Dungeoncraft" (written by James Wyatt) were retained, and DM-focused articles that formerly appeared in Dragon magazine (like "Save My Game") were incorporated into Dungeon, making it a "one-stop shop" for DMs. The magazine shifted to a landscape format with the intent of making the articles and adventures more readable onscreen; content is released daily and gathered into PDF compilations on a monthly basis. In May 2011, Wizards of the Coast stopped making compilations and decided to leave content in single article format. As of October 2012, Wizards of the Coast resumed monthly compilations.

==Adventure Paths==

Beginning in 2003, Dungeon magazine has featured episodic, multi-part adventures, referred to as "Adventure Paths", which are designed to take a group of player characters from the beginning of their adventuring careers (1st level) through epic levels (20th and above). As of April 2013, four such serials have been published: Shackled City, Age of Worms, Savage Tide, and Scales of War.Shackled City: Issues 97 (March 2003), 98 (May 2003), 102 (September 2003), 104 (November 2003), 107 (February 2004), 109 (April 2004), 111 (June 2004), and 113 (August 2004) – 116 (November 2004); Age of Worms: Issues 124 (July 2005) – 135 (June 2006); Savage Tide: Issues 139 (October 2006) – 150 (September 2007); Scales of War: Issues 156 (July 2008) – 168 (July 2009) and 170 (September 2009) – 175 (February 2010). In addition, several shorter campaign arcs (typically consisting of three parts) and various sporadic, open-ended series and side treks were featured in these later issues. The Shackled City Adventure Path was collected into a hardcover edition in August 2005 with various revisions and corrections, new background information, and a bonus adventure meant to fill a gap near the beginning of the series.
