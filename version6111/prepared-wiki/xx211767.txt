The Scottish Liberal Party was the dominant political party of Victorian Scotland,[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown|first=Stewart J.|date=October 1992|title='Echoes of Midlothian': Scottish Liberalism and the South African War, 1899-1902|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|volume=LXXI|jstor=25530538[/tpl] and although its importance declined with the rise of the Labour and Unionist parties during the 20th century,[tpl]cite book|last=Devine|first=Thomas Martin|coauthors=Finlay, Richard J.|title=Scotland in the twentieth century|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1996|pages=73|isbn=978-0-7486-0839-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eEL69iDskI4C&pg=PA73&dq=%22Scottish+Liberal+Party%22&hl=en&ei=BiEYTsKZA43Oswb8lPS0Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Scottish%20Liberal%20Party%22&f=false[/tpl] it was still a significant force when it finally merged with the Social Democratic Party in Scotland, to form the Scottish Liberal Democrats in 1988.
The party reached its low point during the 1950s, when Jo Grimond was the sole Scottish Liberal MP in the House of Commons, but it gained a partial revival in the 1964 general election when it gained three further MPs, George Mackie, Russell Johnston and Alasdair Mackenzie. A further gain came the following year with David Steel's victory at the Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election. Steel went on to become a pivotal figure in the development of Scottish devolution, in partnership with John Smith, Donald Dewar and other key Labour and Liberal figures.
