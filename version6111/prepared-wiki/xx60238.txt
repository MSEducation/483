Kulangsu is an island off the coast of Amoy, Fujian province in southern China, about [tpl]Convert|2|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] in area. It is home to about 20,000 people and is a domestic tourist destination. The only vehicles permitted are small electric buggies and electric government service vehicles.
Visitors can reach it by ferry from Amoy Island in about 10 minutes. Kulangsu Island is renowned for its beaches and winding lanes and its varied architecture.
The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and also ranks at the top of the list of the ten most-scenic areas in the province.
Administratively, the island presently forms Gulangyu Subdistrict of Amoy's Siming District.

==History==

Amoy became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, hence the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture throughout Gulangyu Island, where 13 countries including Great Britain, France and Japan established consulates, churches, and hospitals. Gulangyu was officially designated an International Settlement in 1903. Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II. The Amoy dialect of Hokkien is spoken on the island.

==Attractions==

As a place of residence for Westerners during Amoy's colonial past, Kuulangsu is famous for its architecture and for hosting China's only piano museum, giving it the nickname of "Piano Island" or "The Town of Pianos" (鋼琴之鄉) or "The Island of Music" (音樂之島).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/play/gulangyu-chinas-top-island-getaway-brilliant-beaches-and-zero-cars-173356|title=Gulangyu: China's loveliest island|last=Bolsover|first=Gillian|date=1 February 2012|work=CNN GO|accessdate=25 September 2012[/tpl] There are over 200 pianos on this island.
The Chinese name also has musical roots, as gu lang which means drum waves so-called because of the sound generated by the ocean waves hitting the reefs. Yu means "islet".
In addition, there is a museum dedicated to Koxinga, Hai-toe Se-kai(海底世界) Marine World, a subtropical garden containing plants introduced by overseas Chinese, as well as Amoy Museum, formerly the Eight Diagrams Tower (八卦樓).
The island of Kulangsu is a pedestrian-only destination, where the only vehicles on the islands are several fire trucks and electric tourist buggies. The narrow streets on the island, together with the architecture of various styles around the world, give the island a unique appearance. The site is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn/html/2008-11/2008-11-16-10-27-72978.html|date=16 November 2008|title=AAAAA Scenic Areas|work=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=9 April 2011[/tpl] 

==Transportation==

Kulangsu is unique in China as a "traffic-free island". It is connected to the main island of Amoy only by ferry.
Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Amoy Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm. Freight is pulled on wheeled wooden carts up the often steep lanes by strong teams of men.
