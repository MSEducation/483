==History==

===Founding and establishment===

Louis R. Pietzsch founded a public junior college in Beaumont's South Park. He had become intensely interested in the junior college movement while enrolled in summer school at the University of Chicago in 1918, and by 1921, was convinced that South Park should have a junior college. 
Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School, Pietzsch acted as the first president of the college. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive Texas Department of Education approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925. 

===Early growth and campus changes===

In 1932, the college administration, recognizing that the junior college was serving the region rather than just the community, renamed it as Lamar College. It was named for Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas. Because he arranged to set aside land in counties for public schools, he is regarded as the "Father of Texas Education." A statue of him was installed in the quadrangle of the campus near the Setzer Student Center. The inscription is: "The cultivated mind is the guardian genius of democracy and, while guided and controlled by virtue, the noblest attribute of man. It is the only dictator that freemen acknowledge and the only security that freemen desire." 
In 1933, the college was moving toward independence from South Park High School when construction began on new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.

===Lamar State College of Technology===

With the end of World War II, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment. The Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led by Texas Representative Jack Brooks failed, but the following year the bill passed both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor Beauford Jester signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology; it was to focus on engineering and science, an emphasis that continues today.

===Path to university status===

Enrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960, when master's degrees were offered in several fields.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/kcl2.html | title = The Handbook of Texas Online - Lamar University | author = Ralph A. Wooster | accessdate = Sep 23, 2011[/tpl] The enrollment plateaued in the 1970s as the baby boomers generation reached adulthood. 
In 1969, Lamar State College opened its first branch at a center in Orange, Texas. In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering. In 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University.

===Modern history===

In 1975, the university merged with Port Arthur College in Port Arthur, Texas, creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator Carl A. Parker sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System. In 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. Lamar Institute of Technology was created in 1990 in Beaumont to provide technical, business, health, and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length.
In 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the Texas State University System, with the Lamar State College - Orange, Lamar State College - Port Arthur and Lamar Institute of Technology campuses becoming separate entities within the system. In the fall of 1998 the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Since the reorganization, Lamar University's enrollment has continually increased. 
Total enrollment reached 15,000 students in Fall 2012. Recently numerous construction projects have revitalized or replaced old buildings. In addition football was revived as a varsity sport.
The campus was moved to the current site in 1942 because the school had outgrown its current location and taken on a more regional role. In the late 1990s, Lamar began undertaking campus improvement projects. Most buildings on the campus dated to the late 1960s and 70s. Many older buildings in the northern part of the campus were gutted and refinished one-by-one.
In 2001, the University began replacing its 1960s-vintage residence halls with new apartment-style housing facilities, dubbed "Cardinal Village." Older campus housing facilities have been demolished as the Cardinal Village complex has expanded to meet demand. Demand for on-campus housing has risen, coinciding with the opening of the new residence halls. Cardinal Village II, III & IV were built specifically to meet these demands. [tpl]As of|2005|alt=As of January 2006[/tpl], a new gourmet food-court style dining hall was opened to provide students with a wider selection of dining opportunities.Lamar.edu[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In March 2005, the McDonald Gym temporarily closed. The gym underwent extensive renovation and adjacent to it, a new recreational sports center was built. The $19 million center, named the Sheila Umphrey Recreational Sports Center, opened in April 2007.Lamar.edu[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] The [tpl]convert|129500|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] facility includes [tpl]convert|13000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of cardiovascular and free-weight training; a one-tenth-mile indoor walking/jogging track; a [tpl]convert|43|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] climbing wall; basketball, volleyball and badminton courts; racquetball, handball and squash courts; a wellness and fitness center; health food café and juice bar; lounge areas with pool tables; an outdoor putting green; and air hockey, foosball, video games and TV.

===College of Engineering===

The College of Engineering is arguably the school's most respected program. Lamar's birth was in large part due to the demand for technically trained individuals in the area, after the 1901 Spindletop oil discovery, making Beaumont, Texas one of the most heavily industrialized areas of the United States. The school was founded in 1923 as a junior college. On September 1, 1951, the Texas Legislature promoted the school to a four-year institution and renamed the school Lamar State College of Technology. The legislature specifically noted the school would emphasize engineering, technology, and science to serve the regions large industrial base.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] The school immediately began granting engineering degrees in 1951. In 1970, Lamar's history as a science and technology school was again a driving force in a name change. The state authorized Lamar to offer its first doctoral degree program, the doctor of engineering. A dream shared by many became a reality on May 3, 1971, when Governor Preston Smith signed a bill changing the name of Lamar State College of Technology to Lamar University. In 2005, Lamar's First Ph.D program was established in the College of Engineering: the Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering.[tpl]cite web | url = http://dept.lamar.edu/chemicalengineering/www/greeting.htm | title = Department of Chemical Engineering - Greeting | accessdate = Sep 25, 2011[/tpl]

The 'L' Yell
The 'L' Yell occurs during football kickoffs. To accomplish the 'L' Yell, fans form an L with their right hand raised in the air.  At ten seconds prior to kickoff, fans yell "L" until the kicker hits the ball, then the entire stadium yells the letter "U" and rocks the L in their right hand to the right, this forms a U shape. This signifies LU which is a popular moniker for the university. The "'L' Yell" achieves a Doppler effect in the football stadium and is used to intimidate the opposing team. This tradition carries over into many other sports such as free throws in basketball games and serves during volleyball.
Traditions of Lamar University also extend to singing the schools fight song Go Big Red and the Alma Mater.
