WHOK-FM is an FM radio station in Circleville, Ohio, located at 107.1Â MHz, branded as "K 107.1". The station, which is owned by Wilks Broadcast Group, LLC, serves the Columbus area with a classic country format. An 80s music format also broadcast on an HD subchannel.  Its studios are located in Northeast Columbus and the transmitter site is near Circleville.
WHOK-FM is one of three country-formatted radio outlets in Columbus who currently has competition with WCOL-FM, and WCLT-FM for Country music listenership in the Columbus radio market, the most of any radio station in Ohio. However, WHOK-FM is the only one of the four outlets with a Class-A frequency. In addition, the station provides a rimshot signal from a location seven miles northeast of downtown Circleville and 28 miles from downtown Columbus.  Consequently, the station provides only distant and fringe signal coverage to most of Columbus itself.

==Station history==

107.1 went on the air in 1965 as WNRE, which stood for the young owner's name, Nelson Embry. At the time, the station broadcast from a small downtown Circleville studio with a very low power signal. The transmitter was later moved to its present location on a hill along State Route 159 northeast of Circleville.
In the mid-1980s the station adopted the Z-Rock format before changing format and call letters to WLRO or "Lady Radio", featuring programming geared specifically towards women. That was short lived and in 1989 the station was changed to "Classic Hits 107.1", employing an Adult Contemporary format.  In the early 1990s, it was WTLT "The Light", playing a Contemporary Christian format.
From 1993-1995, 107.1 had the call sign WAHC and repeated Rhythmic sister station WWHT 105.7's programming as Hot 105/Hot 107. On December 15, 1993, the station changed format along with 105.7 to "KISS-FM" and adopting a CHR/Pop format.  The call sign on 105.7 was eventually changed to WAKS early in 1994.  Final song as Hot 105/Hot 107 was "I Can See Clearly Now" by Jimmy Cliff and the first song broadcast on KISS-FM was "Make It Happen" by Mariah Carey.
In April, 1994, the CHR/Pop "KISS-FM" branding and format moved exclusively to 107.1, becoming "The New 107.1, KISS-FM".  This format would last until January, 1995.
In January, 1995, "KISS-FM" and its CHR/Pop format was abandoned for 70s music as "ARROW 107.1", complimenting sister station "ARROW 105.7", which broadcast a Classic Rock format.  A "Major announcement" had been teased on air during the previous week of an upcoming format change.  ARROW stood for All Rock n Roll Oldies.
The station changed formats in 1996 and became Active Rock WAZU "107.1 The Big Wazoo", which used exactly the same format and imaging as the former 102.9 in the Dayton market.  This name and format would broadcast on 107.1 until January 8, 2007, when the station switched their call sign to WNKK and adopted a New Country format as "WINK 107.1" at approximately 8 PM.
In October 2006, former station owners CBS Radio sold the station to Wilks Broadcast Group, LLC.
On April 1, 2013, the "WINK" branding and format was abandoned when WHOK's format was dropped on 95.5 due to a sports format change as "95.5 The Game". K95 moved to 107.1 as "K95 at 107.1" with a classic country format. On April 4, 2013, the station changed its call sign to the current WHOK-FM. Then, the station changed its branding to "K 107.1"
