==Reception==

Music website Allmusic gave You & Me 3.5 out of five stars, with reviewer Hal Horowitz calling the album "a solid blues-rock release and arguably his best work to date", but also an album "that doesn't take the chances that he claims might push the guitarist into uncharted territory". Music magazine Prefix published their review with a rating of four out of ten, criticising the indulgence of the style of music displayed on the album as displayed in the many guitar solos.
