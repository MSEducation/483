CATEGORIES: Townlands of County Kilkenny

Loughcullen is a small area of County Kilkenny in Ireland, close to the border of County Waterford and 12Â km from Waterford City. It is located near the town of Kilmacow. Loughcullen consists generally of land owned by farms in neighbouring Big Wood. Loughcullen used to be the site for the Loughcullen Creamery which served all local farmers however the creamery has closed and is now a supplier to local agricultural workers.
Loughcullen is notable in the region for being very supportive of the Kilkenny Cats hurling team. On match days and particularly when Kilkenny is participating in the All Ireland, Loughcullen is transformed into Amber and Black, the colours of the hurling team.
