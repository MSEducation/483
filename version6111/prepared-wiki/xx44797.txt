The Norwegian Forest Cat or skogkatt is a breed of domestic cat native to Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs, and a woolly undercoat for insulation. Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was not registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline until the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest Cat is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.
It is a big, strong cat, similar to the American Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed is very good at climbing, since they have strong claws. The lifespan is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases have been reported in the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.

==History==

The Norwegian Forest Cat is adapted to survive Norway's cold weather.[tpl]cite book|last=Rousselet-Blanc|first=Pie|title=Encyclopedie Active Le Cha|year=1992|publisher=Larousse Kingfisher Chambers|isbn=2-03-517402-3|page=174[/tpl] Its ancestors may include black and white shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain sometime after 1000 AD by the Vikings and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and might have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest Cat.[tpl]cite book|last=Richards|first=James|title=ASPCA Complete Guide to Cats: Everything You Need to Know About Choosing and Caring for Your Pet|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-8118-1929-9|pages=128–129[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Case|first=Linda|title=The Cat: Its Behavior, Nutrition and Health|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=978-0-8138-0331-9|edition=1|page=26[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=David|title=Ultimate Cat Book: A Unique Photographic Guide to More Than 100 International Breeds and Variations|year=1989|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-671-68649-9|pages=76–77|edition=1|authorlink=David Taylor (veterinarian)[/tpl] The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed. Norse legends refer to the Skogkatt as a "mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage."

Many people believe that the ancestors of the Norwegian Forest Cat served as mousers on Viking ships. They lived in the Norwegian forests for many centuries but were later prized for their hunting skills and were used on Norwegian farms.[tpl]cite book|last=Furstinger|first=Nancy|title=Norwegian Forest Cats|year=2005|location=Edina, Minnesota|publisher=Abdo Publishing|isbn=978-1-59679-267-8|page=6[/tpl] Norwegian Forest Cats would continue acting as mousers on Norwegian farms until they were discovered in the early twentieth century by cat enthusiasts.[tpl]cite book|last=Duno|first=Steve|title=Be the Cat: Secrets of the Natural Cat Owner|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-4027-5278-0|page=22[/tpl]
In 1938 the first Norwegian Forest Cat Club was formed. The club's movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing to cross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest Cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program.[tpl]cite book|last=Richards|first=Dorothy Silkstone|title=Cat: Selection, Care, Training, Nutrition, Health, Breeding, Showing|year=1996|location=London|publisher=Salamander Books|isbn=978-0-86101-703-4|page=56|edition=2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Robinson's Genetics for Cat Breeders and Veterinarians|year=1999|publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-7506-4069-5|pages=xi-xii|author=Carolyn M.

==Breed description==

The Norwegian Forest Cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. The breed has a long, sturdy body, long legs and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, glossy, thick and water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest and head. The profile of the breed is generally straight.[tpl]cite web|title=Breed Profile: The Norwegian Forest Cat|url=http://www.cfainc.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/NorwegianForestCat.aspx|work=Cat Fanciers' Association|accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl]
left|thumb|Hue distribution in bi-colored Norwegian forest cats varies widely. The head is long, with an over-all shape similar to an equilateral triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head is considered to be a defect.[tpl]cite book|last=Rousselet-Blanc|first=Pie|title=Encyclopedie Active Le Chat|year=1992|publisher=Larousse Kingfisher Chambers|location=New York City|isbn=978-2-03-517402-4|editor=Hardcover|page=175|language=French[/tpl] The eyes are almond shaped and oblique, and may be of any colour.Norwegian Forest Breed Standard. The International Cat Association. Published 1 May 2004. Accessed 26 March 2011. The ears are large, wide at the base, high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of the lynx. All coat colors are accepted except chocolate and lilac and the dilutions fawn and cinnamon. Since the cats have very strong claws, they are very good climbers, and can even climb rocks.
Norwegian Forest cats have a quiet voice but can develop a loud voice if kept in a house with a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and are generally good with people.  The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy  and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800.  The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old.[tpl]cite book|last=Burke|first=Don|title=The Complete Burke's Backyard: The Ultimate Book of Fact Sheets|year=2005|publisher=Murdoch Books|location=Millers Point, N.S.W.|isbn=1-74045-739-0|page=723[/tpl] As they are heavy-boned and tall they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.[tpl]cite book|last=Stephens|first=Gloria|title=Legacy of the Cat|year=2001|location=San Francisco|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0-8118-2910-6|pages=112–113 |id=[tpl]ASIN|0811829103[/tpl][/tpl]

===Health issues===

There have been kidney and heart diseases reported in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.ymgme.2006.12.003[/tpl] "Deficiency of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) activity causes glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV), an autosomal recessive error of metabolism. Abnormal glycogen accumulates in myocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons, causing variably progressive, benign to lethal organ dysfunctions. A naturally occurring orthologue of human GSD IV was described previously in Norwegian forest cats (NFC)."[tpl]cite book|title=Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook, Fully Revised and Updated|publisher=John Wiley & Sons[tpl]![/tpl]Howell Book House|isbn=978-0-470-09530-0|author=Eldredge, Debra; Carlson, Delbert DVM; Carlson, Liisa; Giffin, James|edition=3rd|page=403|format=Hardcover[/tpl] This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA test available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animal for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia,[tpl]cite book|last=Eldredge|first=Debra|title=Pills For Pets: The A to Z Guide to Drugs and Medications for Your Animal Companion|year=2003|publisher=Kensington Books[tpl]![/tpl]Citadel Press|isbn=978-0-8065-2436-8|page=63|format=Paperback|chapter=17: Preventative Health Care for Your Pet|quote=An example here is the Norwegian forest cat.
