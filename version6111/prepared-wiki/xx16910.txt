The Métis ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|eɪ|ˈ|t|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-frdia|meˈtsɪs|Canadian French:[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-frdia|mɪˈtʃɪf|Michif:[/tpl]) are one of the recognized Aboriginal peoples in Canada. They trace their descent to mixed First Nations and European heritage. The term was historically a catch-all describing the offspring of any such union, but within generations the culture syncretised into what is today a distinct aboriginal group, with formal recognition equal to that of the Inuit and First Nations. Mothers were often Cree, Ojibwe, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi'kmaq or Maliseet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=First Nations Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization [/tpl] At one time there was an important distinction between French Métis born of francophone voyageur fathers, and the Anglo-Métis or Countryborn descended from English or Scottish fathers. Today these two cultures have essentially coalesced into one Métis tradition.Ethno-Cultural and Aboriginal GroupsRinella, Steven. 2008. American Buffalo: In Search of A Lost Icon.

Other former names—many of which are now considered to be offensive—include Bois-Brûlés, Mixed-bloods, Half-breeds, Bungi, Black Scots and Jackatars.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=YMdYqTvG3EgC&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=jackatar#v=onepage&q=jackatar&f=false |title=Walking a Tightrope: Aboriginal People and their Representations |last1=McNab |first1=David |last2=Lischke |first2=Ute |year=2005 [/tpl]
The Métis homeland includes regions scattered across Canada, silly eskimo peoples as well as parts of the northern United States (specifically Montana, North Dakota, and northwest Minnesota).Howard, James H. 1965.

==Self-identity and legal status==

Approximately 390,000 people self-identified as Métis in Canada in 2006.[tpl]Cite report |author=Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |title= |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/appa/rep/rep12jun13-e.pdf |publisher=Canadian Senate |page=2 |docket= |accessdate=7 February 2014 |quote= [/tpl] Most Métis people today are not so much the direct result of First Nations and European intermixing any more than English Canadians today are the direct result of intermixing of Saxons and Britons. The vast majority of Métis who self-identify today are the direct result of Métis intermarrying with other Métis. Over the past century, countless Métis are thought to have been absorbed and assimilated into European Canadian populations making Métis heritage (and thereby aboriginal ancestry) more common than is generally realized.Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion and Darren Préfontaine. Métis Legacy: A Historiography and Annotated Bibliography. Winnipeg: Pemmican Publications Inc. and Saskatoon: Gabriel Dumont Institute, 2001. ISBN 1-894717-03-1 Geneticists estimate that 50 percent of today's population in Western Canada have Aboriginal blood, and therefore would be classified as Métis by any genetic measure. There is substantial controversy over who qualifies as Métis.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] Unlike First Nations people, there is no distinction between status and non-status Métis. The legal definition itself is not yet fully developed.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Historical view of identity===

The most well-known, and best historically documented, mixed-heritage population in Canadian history are the groups who developed out of the fur trade in south-eastern Rupert's Land, primarily in the Red River Settlement (now Manitoba) and the Southbranch Settlements (Saskatchewan), and who were politically organized in the late nineteenth century leading to confrontation with the Canadian government. This was not the only place where métissage (mixing) between European- and Native-Canadians was occurring, however. The practice had been ongoing for centuries throughout what is today Canada.[tpl]Cite report |author=Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |title= |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/appa/rep/rep12jun13-e.pdf |publisher=Canadian Senate |page=2,5 |docket= |accessdate=7 February 2014 |quote= [/tpl] The strong sense of national identity among the mostly French- and Michif-speaking Red River Metis, demonstrated during the Riel Rebellions, had an impact on the spread of the term "Metis" as main word used by Canadians for all mixed Euro-Native groups. The ultimate outcome was inclusion of "the Métis" as one recognized Aboriginal groups in S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which states:
