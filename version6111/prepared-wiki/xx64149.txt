==Early life==

Magnusson was born in Reykjavík but grew up in Edinburgh, where his father, Sigursteinn Magnússon, was the Icelandic consul. Under Iceland naming conventions, his name would have been Magnús Sigursteinsson (Magnús, son of Sigursteinn), but his family adopted British naming conventions and he took his father's surname. He was schooled at the Edinburgh Academy, and was in the school's marching brass band.

==Career==

===Journalism===

After graduating from Jesus College, Oxford, Magnusson became a reporter with the Scottish Daily Express and The Scotsman. He went freelance in 1967, then joined the British Broadcasting Corporation, presenting programmes on history and archaeology (including BC The Archaeology of the Bible Lands), as well as appearing in news programmes.

===Mastermind===

Magnusson presented the long-running quiz show Mastermind from 1972 to 1997. His catchphrase, which the current presenter John Humphrys has continued to use, was "I've started so I'll finish". Magnusson made a one-off cameo appearance as himself, hosting Mastermind in the children's series Dizzy Heights.

===Translator===

Magnusson translated a variety of books from modern Icelandic and Old Norse into English. Among these are several works by Halldór Laxness, the Nobel prize-winning novelist from Iceland, and a number of Norse sagas which he co-translated (with Hermann Pálsson) for the Penguin Classics series: Njal's Saga (1960), The Vinland Sagas (1965), King Harald's Saga (1966) and Laxdaela Saga (1969). Magnusson was also the author of a popular history of the Viking era, called The Vikings (revised edition, 2000).

==Awards and charity positions==

Magnusson was awarded an honorary knighthood (Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1989. He was elected President of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, for a five-year period, at their 94th AGM in October 1995, succeeding Max Nicholson. He also became the founder chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage upon its inception in 1992.
He was Lord Rector of Edinburgh University from 1975 to 1978 and later, in 2002, became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University.

==Later life==

In the early years of the 21st century, Magnusson also wrote for the New Statesman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/magnus_magnusson |title=Magnus Magnusson |publisher=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl]
On 12 October 2006, his 77th birthday, Magnusson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Magnusson mordantly noted that "this has to be one of my worst birthdays ever". His condition forced him to cancel a string of public appearances. He died on 7 January 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6045792.stm |title=Entertainment | Magnusson faces cancer treatment |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6239745.stm |title=UK | TV's Magnus Magnusson dies at 77 |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3561915.stm |title=UK | Obituary: Magnus Magnusson |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl]
