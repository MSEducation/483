James Connolly "Jimmy" Johnstone (30 September 1944 – 13 March 2006), nicknamed "Jinky", was a Scottish football player. Johnstone was best known for his time with Celtic, and was voted their best ever player by the club's fans in 2002.[tpl]cite web|title=Brilliant Celtic and Scotland winger who took the European Cup with the Lisbon Lions|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/mar/14/guardianobituaries.football|work=Obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 August 2011|author=Brian Glanville|date=14 March 2006[/tpl] He scored 129 goals for Celtic in 515 appearances.
Born in Viewpark, South Lanarkshire, the youngest of five children, Johnstone grew up at the family home on Old Edinburgh Road, directly across from Robertson Park, the home of local Junior side Thorniewood United FC. After being spotted by Celtic and Manchester United scouts at age 13, he chose to sign with Celtic.

==Club career==

===Celtic===

Johnstone was one of the "Lisbon Lions", the team that won the then European Cup for Celtic in 1967.
In the immediate aftermath of the Lisbon victory Celtic formed the opposition in the testimonial game for the Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano. Johnstone's performance was such that the Real supporters began to cry "Olé!" every time he dribbled past one of their own team's players.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jimmyjohnstone.com/news/article.asp?news_id=102&news_page=3|title=Celtic's Greatest Ever Player|publisher=Jimmy Johnstone|date=|accessdate=2010-06-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In all he made 308 League appearances for The Bhoys, scoring 82 goals. He also played another 207 times for them in the Scottish Cup, League Cup and in Europe, for an overall total of 515 matches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/Johnstone%2C+Jimmy+%27Jinky%27|title=Johnstone, Jimmy 'Jinky'|publisher=The Celtic Wiki|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]

==Later life==

Johnstone's dry wit was in evidence when the Lisbon Lions were paraded at Celtic Park on the 25th anniversary of their triumph in the European Cup. In an aside, Paul McStay, the then Celtic captain, asked Johnstone who he thought would win if the 1967 team was to play the team of 1992. Johnstone paused to consider for a moment, then replied that he thought it would be a draw. McStay suggested that perhaps the veteran was being kind to the current team. Johnstone explained - "well, you've got to remember that we're all in our fifties now!" [tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Motor neurone disease and death==

Johnstone was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in November 2001. To raise funds for charity and to raise awareness of the disease, he launched a new version of the song "Dirty Old Town" together with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds.
In June 2005, Carl Fabergé's great-granddaughter Sarah, produced 19 jewelled eggs related to Johnstone.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4072526.stm|title=Faberge descendants keep up tradition|last=Bill Wilson|date=9 June 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl]
Johnstone died in March 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4800766.stm|title=Celtic great dies at 61|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=29 January 2008[/tpl] The last person to call him was old Rangers rival, Willie Henderson, who had become a firm friend of Johnstone. Thousands of Celtic fans, and fans of many other clubs, including those of arch-rivals Rangers paid tribute to his memory outside Celtic Park on St Patrick's Day, the day of his funeral service. Tributes were paid to Johnstone before the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final, played between Celtic and Dunfermline.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/news/article/jimmy-johnstone-tribute/|title=CIS Insurance Cup Final 2006|work=|publisher=Scottish Football League|date=14 March 2006|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] There was a minute of applause before the game and the entire Celtic squad wore the number 7 on their shorts in his honour.
In 2011 a statue of Jimmy Johnstone and a memorial garden were created on the site at his former school, close to his home, on the Old Edinburgh Road, Viewpark, Uddingston. The garden was opened by Jimmy Johnstone's wife, family and some of the surviving members of the 'Lisbon Lions' team. The bronze life size statue was made by sculptor John McKenna.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonadvertiser.co.uk/news/local-news/hamilton-news/2011/08/18/viewpark-honours-football-hero-jimmy-johnstone-51525-29253840/|title=Viewpark Honours Football Hero Jimmy Johnstone|last=John Rowbotham|date=18 August 2011|work=Hamilton Advertiser|publisher=Scottish & Universal Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl]
