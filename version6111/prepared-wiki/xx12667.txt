The Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/spec1648.htm | work = Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate =14 September 2008 | title = ZX Spectrum 16K/48K [/tpl] the effects of which are still seen;[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6572711.stm | title=How the Spectrum began a revolution | accessdate=5 June 2007 | date= 23 April 2007 | publisher=BBC[/tpl] some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry.[tpl]cite web| last = Williams | first = Chris | url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/04/23/spectrum_zx_25/ | title=Sinclair ZX Spectrum: 25 today |work= Register Hardware | accessdate=14 September 2008 | date= 23 April 2007 | publisher=Situation Publishing[/tpl]  Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for "services to British industry".[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/zxspectrum.htm | work = Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate =14 September 2008 | title = ZX Spectrum [/tpl]
The Commodore 64, Oric-1 and Atmos, BBC Microcomputer and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. Over 24,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released, with over 100 new ones in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekadv.cgi?what=1&regexp=&yrorder=1&year=2012&type=0&players=0&turns=0&memory=0&language=0&country=0&licence=0&feature=0&publi=0&release=0&format=0&scheme=0&scorder=1&score=0&have=1&also=1&sort=1&display=3&loadpics=1 |title=List of ZX Spectrum titles released in 2012 | work = World of Spectrum| accessdate = 29 April 2013[/tpl] In 2014, a bluetooth keyboard modeled on the Spectrum was announced.

==Hardware==

The Spectrum is based on a Zilog Z80A CPU running at 3.5 MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The original model Spectrum has 16 kB (16×1024 bytes) of ROM and either 16 kB or 48 kB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the machine's outward appearance was designed by Sinclair's industrial designer Rick Dickinson.
Video output is through an RF modulator and was designed for use with contemporary portable television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32 columns × 24 rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black.[tpl]Cite book| last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate =23 August 2006 | year = 1982 | publisher = Sinclair Research Ltd | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap1.html [/tpl] The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations.[tpl]Cite book| last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate =23 August 2006 | year = 1982 | publisher = Sinclair Research Ltd|chapter = Colours|chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap16.html [/tpl] To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.
Altwasser received a patent for this design.[tpl]ref patent |country=EP |number=0107687 |status = patent |title=Display for a computer |gdate=1988-07-06 |fdate=1983-04-22 |pridate=1982-04-22 |invent1=Richard Francis Altwasser |assign1=Sinclair Research Ltd [/tpl]
An "attribute" consists of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing "flag" which, when set, causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals. This scheme leads to what was dubbed colour clash or attribute clash, where a desired colour of a specific pixel could not necessarily be accomplished. This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum, meaning programs, particularly games, had to be designed around this limitation. Other machines available around the same time, for example the Amstrad CPC or the Commodore 64, did not suffer from this limitation. The Commodore 64 used colour attributes in a similar way, but a special multicolour mode, hardware sprites and hardware scrolling were used to avoid attribute clash.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-face-off-zx-spectrum-vs-commodore-64|title=Face off - ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64|publisher=Eurogamer|date=29 April 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]
Sound output is through a beeper on the machine itself which is capable of producing one channel with 10 octaves.  Software was later available that could play two channel sound. The machine also includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3.5 mm audio in/out ports for the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data.  The "ear" port also provided line level[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] audio out which could be amplified, or connected to headphones.

==Firmware==

The machine's Sinclair BASIC interpreter is stored in ROM (along with fundamental system-routines) and was written by Steve Vickers on contract from Nine Tiles Ltd. The Spectrum's chiclet keyboard (on top of a membrane, similar to calculator keys) is marked with BASIC keywords, so that, for example, pressing "G" when in programming mode would insert the BASIC command GO TO.[tpl]Cite book| last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate =19 September 2006 | year = 1982|publisher = Sinclair Research Ltd | chapter = Basic programming concepts | chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap2.html [/tpl]
The BASIC interpreter was developed from that used on the ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features making it easier to use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and also supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was also much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myprius.co.za/tape_storage.htm|title=Tape Data Storage|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl] As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could in addition save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.

===Pre-production designs===

Rick Dickinson came up with a number of designs for the "ZX82" project before the final ZX Spectrum design. A number of the keyboard legends changed during the design phase including ARC becoming CIRCLE, FORE becoming INK and BACK becoming PAPER. The Spectrum reused a number of technologies used in the ZX81, such as some of the same ROM code (some obsolete routines used for the ZX81 exist in the Spectrum), and a similar ULA for hardware control. A bug in the ULA as originally designed meant that the keyboard did not always scan correctly, and was rectified by a "dead cockroach" (a small circuit board mounted upside down next to the CPU) for Issue 1 ZX Spectrums.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1985 | month = May | title = The Sinclair Story, Part 2 | number = 16 | journal = Crash | page = 127 | accessdate = 21 August 2012 [/tpl]

===ZX Spectrum 16K/48K [tpl]anchor|16k[/tpl][tpl]anchor|48k[/tpl]===

The original ZX Spectrum is remembered for its rubber keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released on 23 April 1982[tpl]Cite news |date=23 April 2012 |title = ZX Spectrum at 30: the computer that started a revolution |newspaper=The Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9220468/ZX-Spectrum-at-30-the-computer-that-started-a-revolution.html | accessdate =30 September 2012 [/tpl] with 16 kB of RAM for £125 or with 48 kB for £175;[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1983 | month = February | title = The High Street Spectrum |magazine=ZX Computing | page = 43 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8302/Pages/ZXComputing830200043.jpg | accessdate =5 August 2008 [/tpl] these prices were later reduced to £99 and £129 respectively.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1983 | month = June | title = News: Spectrum prices are slashed |magazine=Sinclair User | issue = 15 | page = 13 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/015/news.htm | accessdate =15 August 2006 [/tpl] Owners of the 16 kB model could purchase an internal 32 kB RAM upgrade, which for early "Issue 1" machines consisted of a daughterboard. Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48 kB versions. To reduce the price, the 32 kB extension used eight faulty 64 kilobit chips with only one half of their capacity working and/or available. Links on the PCB were configured accordingly so as to place these faulty memory locations in the unused half of each IC.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Goodwin | first = Simon |date=September 1984 | title = Suddenly, it's the 64K Spectrum! |magazine=Your Spectrum | issue = 7 | pages = 33–34 | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr07/yr07_33.htm|accessdate =21 August 2006 [/tpl] External 32 kB RAM packs that mounted in the rear expansion slot were also available from third parties. Both machines had 16 kB of onboard ROM.
About 60,000 "Issue 1" ZX Spectrums were manufactured; they can be distinguished from later models by the colour of the keys (light grey for Issue 1, blue-grey for later models).[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/spec48versions.htm | work = Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate =24 April 2006 | title = Spectrum 48K Versions [/tpl]
The Sinclair models all had audio line in and out, in the form of an "ear" and "mic" socket. An external tape recorder was needed to load the majority of software released. Either socket could also be connected to headphones or an amplifier as an audio output, though this would not disable the internal speaker.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

===ZX Spectrum+ [tpl]anchor|plus[/tpl]===

Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ started in June 1984,[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1984 | month = December | title = The Secret That Was Spectrum+ | journal = Your Spectrum | issue = 10 | page = 104 | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr10/yr10_a4.htm | last = Denham | first = Sue | accessdate =21 August 2006 [/tpl] and the machine was released in October the same year.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/specplus.htm | work=Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate=21 August 2006 | title=ZX Spectrum+[/tpl] This 48 kB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48 kB model. It was possible to change the system boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1984 | month = December|title = News: New Spectrum launch|journal = Sinclair User | issue = 33 | page = 11 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/033/news.htm | accessdate =19 August 2006 [/tpl] A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was also available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5­–6% for the older model.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

===ZX Spectrum 128 [tpl]anchor|spectrum128[/tpl]===

Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) in conjunction with their Spanish distributor Investrónica.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Bourne | first = Chris |date=November 1985|title = News: Launch of the Spectrum 128 in Spain|journal = Sinclair User | issue = 44 | page = 5 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/044/news.htm | accessdate =15 August 2006 [/tpl] Investrónica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after the Spanish government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64 kB RAM or less,[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Ministerio de Economía y Hacienda (BOE 211 de 3/9/1985), Real Decreto 1558/1985, de 28 de agosto, por el que se aclara el alcance del mínimo específico introducido en la subpartida 84.53.B.II del Arancel de Aduanas, por el Real Decreto 1215/1985. Rango: Real Decreto, Páginas: 27743 - 27744, Referencia: 1985/18847. and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Ministerio de Industria y Energía (BOE 179 de 27 July 1985), Real Decreto 1250/1985, de 19 de junio, por el que se establece la sujeción a especificaciones técnicas de los terminales de pantalla con teclado, periféricos para entrada y representación de información en equipo de proceso de datos. Rango: Real Decreto, Páginas: 23840 - 23841, Referencia: 1985/15611.
The appearance of the ZX Spectrum 128 was similar to the ZX Spectrum+, with the exception of a large external heatsink for the internal 7805 voltage regulator added to the right hand end of the case, replacing the internal heatsink in previous versions.
New features included 128 kB RAM, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32 kB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.
The machine was simultaneously presented for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of £179.95.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1985 | month = April|title = Clive discovers games — at last|journal = Sinclair User | issue = 49 | page = 53 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/049/128lnch.htm | accessdate =20 August 2006 [/tpl] No external keypad was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself remained.
The Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, which means only 64 kB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80 kB of RAM the designers used bank switching so that the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16 kB at the top of the address space. The same technique was also used to page between the new 16 kB editor ROM and the original 16 kB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrum128+3Manual/chapter8pt24.html|title=Spectrum 128+3 Manual, Chapter 8 Part 24|publisher=Amstrad|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl]
The new sound chip and MIDI out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is no way to switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80 kB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with some BASIC programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrum128+3Manual/chapter7.html|title=Spectrum 128+3 Manual, Chapter 7|publisher=Amstrad|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl]
The ZX Spectrum 128 had no internal speaker like its predecessors. The sound was produced from the television speaker instead.ZX Spectrum 128 Manual p. 9 at World of Spectrum
The Spanish version had the "128K" logo in white while the English one had the same logo in red.[tpl]Clear[/tpl]

==Amstrad models==

===ZX Spectrum +2 [tpl]anchor|plus2[/tpl]===

The ZX Spectrum +2 was Amstrad's first Spectrum, coming shortly after their purchase of the Spectrum range and "Sinclair" brand in 1986. The machine featured an all-new grey case featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in cassette recorder dubbed the "Datacorder" (like the Amstrad CPC 464), but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128. The main menu screen lacked the Spectrum 128's "Tape Test" option, and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message. These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses. Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to £139–£149.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Phillips | first = Max |date=November 1986|title = ZX Spectrum +2|journal = Your Sinclair | issue = 11 | page = 47 | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/spectrumplustworeview.htm | accessdate =29 August 2006[/tpl]
The new keyboard did not include the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue however, as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48k BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128k BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Goodwin | first = Simon |date=December 1987 | title = Tech Tips - Amstrology | journal = Crash | issue = 48|pages = 143 | accessdate = 20 August 2012 [/tpl]
The ZX Spectrum +2 power supply was a grey version of the ZX Spectrum+ and 128 power supply.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dataserve-retro.co.uk/contents/en-uk/d8.html|title=Spectrum +2, +2A, and +2B Spares|author=DataServe Retro|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]clear[/tpl]

===ZX Spectrum +2A [tpl]anchor|plus2a[/tpl]===

The ZX Spectrum +2A was a variant of the Spectrum +3 housed a black version of the Spectrum +2 case mouldings. The Spectrum +2A/+3 motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70830) was designed such that it could be assembled without the floppy disk controller or associated logic and a +2 style "datacorder" connected.Spectrum +3 Service Manual. AMSTRAD. p.18. Originally, Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface for the +2A/+2B called the AMSTRAD SI-1,Spital, Ivor. Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. AMSTRAD, 1987. p.354. however this never appeared. If an external disk drive was added, the "+2A" on the system OS menu would change to a +3.
The power supply of the ZX Spectrum +2A used the same pinout as the +3. However, the power supply purchased with the +2A/B had "Sinclair +2" written on the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hardware.speccy.org/hardware/Fuente+2A/imagenes/vista_superior.jpg|title=Image of Spectrum +2A power supply|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]

===ZX Spectrum +3 [tpl]anchor|plus3[/tpl]===

The ZX Spectrum +3 looked similar to the +2 but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249[tpl]Cite journal| last = South | first = Phil |date=July 1987 | title = It's here... the Spectrum +3 | journal = Your Sinclair | issue = 17|pages = 22–23 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue19/Pages/YourSinclair1900022.jpg | accessdate =5 August 2008 [/tpl] and then later £199[tpl]Cite journal| author = Amstrad |date=November 1987 | title = The new Sinclair has one big disk advantage | journal = Sinclair User | issue = 68 | pages = 2–3 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue068/Pages/SinclairUser06800002.jpg | accessdate =5 August 2008 | authorlink = Amstrad [/tpl] and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.
The +3 saw the addition of two more 16 kB ROMs. One was home to the second part of the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's PCWDOS (the disk access code used in LocoScript), called +3DOS. These two new 16 kB ROMs and the original two 16 kB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32 kB chips.  To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16 kB of RAM.
Such core changes brought incompatibilities:
Some older 48K and a few older 128K games were incompatible with the machine. The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible due to differences in ROM and expansion connector; therefore it was not possible to connect and use the Microdrive units.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Goodwin | first = Simon |date=December 1987 | title = Tech Tips - +3 Faults | journal = Crash | issue = 48 |pages = 145 | accessdate = 20 August 2012 [/tpl]
The ZX Spectrum +3 power supply provides the same voltages as the one supplied with +2A/B. This power supply has the same DIN connector so can also be used with the +2A/B. However, the power supply purchased with the +3 had "Sinclair +3" written on the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorkdistribution.co.uk/acatalog/York_Distribution_Power_supply_for_Spectrum_128__3_2337.html|title=Power supply for Spectrum 128, +2A, +3|publisher=York Distribution Limited|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]
Production of the +3 ceased in December 1990, believed to be in response for Amstrad relaunching their CPC range. At the time, it was estimated about 15% of ZX Spectrums sold had been +3 models. Production of the +2B (the only other model then still in production) continued, as it was believed not to be in competition with other computers in Amstrad's product range.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1990 | month = December | title = Death of the +3 | journal = Your Sinclair | issue = 60|pages = 10–11 [/tpl] It was eventually discontinued in 1992.

===ZX Spectrum +2B and +3B [tpl]anchor|plus2b[/tpl]===

The ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B were functionally similar in design to the Spectrum +2A and +3.Spectrum +2B/+3B Service Manual. AMSTRAD. The main electronic differences being simply changes to the generation of the audio output signal to resolve problems with clipping and the removal of the external tape loading input on the +2B.
Unlike the +2A and +3, the Spectrum +2B and +3B do not share a common motherboard.
The +2B board (AMSTRAD part number Z70833) has no provision for floppy disk controller circuitry and the +3B motherboard (Amstrad part number Z70835) has no provision for connecting an internal tape drive.

==Clones==

Sinclair licensed the Spectrum design to Timex Corporation in the United States. An enhanced version of the Spectrum with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Timex's derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems. However, some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research. A case in point was the abortive Pandora portable Spectrum, whose ULA had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the TS2068. Pandora had a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives and was intended to be Sinclair's business portable.  After Amstrad bought the computer business of Sinclair Research, Sir Clive retained the rights to the Pandora project, and it evolved into the Cambridge Computer Z88, launched in 1987.[tpl]cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Simon|title=SINCLAIR’S Z88 — Pandora’s Box? | journal = Crash |date=April 1987 | issue = 39 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/39/z88.htm | accessdate =30 June 2011 [/tpl]
In the UK, Spectrum peripheral vendor Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) released the SAM Coupé as a potential successor with some Spectrum compatibility. However, by this point, the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST had taken hold of the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership.[tpl]cite journal|last=Alway|first=Robin|title=So what really has happened to the SAM Coupé?|journal=Your Sinclair|issue=56|page=40|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/samsurgeon0890.htm|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]
Many unofficial Spectrum clones were produced, especially in the former Eastern Bloc countries (e.g. in Romania, several models were produced (Tim-S, HC85, HC91, Cobra, Junior, CIP, CIP 3, Jet), some featuring CP/M and a 5.25"/3.5" floppy disk) and South America (e.g. Microdigital TK90X and TK95). In the Soviet Union, ZX Spectrum clones were assembled by thousands of small start-ups and distributed through poster ads and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nvg.org/sinclair/computers/clones/clones.htm | title = Clones and variants | accessdate =26 October 2006 | last = Owen | first = Chris | work = Planet Sinclair [/tpl] Some of them are still being produced, such as the Pentagon and ATM Turbo. In India, Decibells Electronics introduced a licensed version of the Spectrum+ in 1986.

Several peripherals for the Spectrum were marketed by Sinclair: the ZX Printer was already on the market,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/peripherals/zxprinter.htm | title = ZX Printer | accessdate =24 August 2006 | last = Owen | first = Chris|work = Planet Sinclair[/tpl] as the ZX Spectrum expansion bus was backwards-compatible with that of the ZX81.
The ZX Interface 1 add-on module included 8 kB of ROM, an RS-232 serial port, a proprietary LAN interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for the connection of up to eight ZX Microdrives – somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1983 | month = September | title = News: Some surprises in the Microdrive | journal = Sinclair User | issue = 18 | page = 15 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/018/news.htm | accessdate =29 August 2006[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| last = Adams | first = Stephen |date=October 1983 | title = Hardware World: Spectrum receives its biggest improvement | journal = Sinclair User | issue = 19 | pages = 27–29 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/019/hardwre.htm | accessdate =29 August 2006[/tpl] These were later used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1983 | month = December|title = Hardware World: Sinclair cartridges may be out of step|journal = Sinclair User | issue = 21 | page = 35 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/021/hardwre.htm | accessdate =29 August 2006[/tpl]
There were also a plethora of third-party hardware addons. The better known of these included the Kempston joystick interface, the Morex Peripherals Centronics/RS-232 interface, the Currah Microspeech unit (speech synthesis),[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1983 | month = December | title = Hardware World: Clear speech from Currah module | journal = Sinclair User | issue = 21 | page = 40|url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/021/hardwre.htm|accessdate =29 August 2006[/tpl] Videoface Digitiser,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Frey |first=Franco |date=February 1987 |title = Tech Niche: Videoface to Face |journal = CRASH |issue = 37 |pages = 86–87 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue37/Pages/Crash3700086.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl] RAM pack, the Cheetah Marketing SpecDrum,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Bates |first=Jon |date=April 1986 |title=Tech Niche: SpecDrum |journal=CRASH |issue=27 |page=100 |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/27/specdrum.htm |accessdate=9 August 2007[/tpl] a drum machine, and the Multiface,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Frey |first=Franco |date=March 1986 |title=Tech Niche: Multifaceted device |journal=CRASH |issue=36 |page=86 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue26/Pages/Crash2600086.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl] a snapshot and disassembly tool from Romantic Robot.

There were numerous disk drive interfaces, including the Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/Kempston KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces were the first to come bundled with office productivity software (Tasword Word Processor, Masterfile database and Omnicalc spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced many small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were also both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Frey |first=Franco |date=March 1987 |title = Tech Niche: Pure Gospel |journal = CRASH |issue = 38 |pages = 82–83 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue38/Pages/Crash3800082.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl]
During the mid-1980s, Telemap Group Ltd launched a fee-based service allowing users to connect their ZX Spectrums via a Prism Micro Products VTX5000 modem to a viewdata service known as Micronet 800, hosted by Prestel, which provided news and information about microcomputers. The service also allowed a form of instant messaging and online shopping.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/hardware/feat24.html|title=Prism VTX 5000|publisher=Home Computer Advanced Course|year=1984[/tpl]

==Software==

[tpl]As of|July 2012[/tpl], over 24,000 titles had been released for the Spectrum family.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/archive.html | work=World of Spectrum | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn | accessdate=22 July 2012 | title=Archive![/tpl] While most of these are games, the library includes programming language implementations, databases (e.g. VU-File[tpl]Cite journal|last=Pearce |first=Nick |date=October–November 1982 |title=Zap! Pow! Boom! |journal=ZX Computing |page=75 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8210/Pages/ZXComputing821000075.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl]), word processors (e.g. Tasword II[tpl]Cite journal|last=Wetherill |first=Steven |date=June 1984 |title=Tasword Two: The Word Processor |journal=CRASH! |issue=5 |page=126 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue05/Pages/Crash0500126.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl]), spreadsheets (e.g. VU-Calc), drawing and painting tools (e.g. OCP Art Studio[tpl]Cite journal|last=Gilbert |first=John |date=October 1985 |title=Art Studio |journal=Sinclair User |issue=43 |page=28 |url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/043/sftwreb.htm |accessdate=18 January 2007 [/tpl]), and even 3D-modelling (e.g. VU-3D[tpl]Cite journal|last=Carter |first=Alasdair |date=October–November 1983 |title=VU-3D |journal=ZX Computing |pages=76–77 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8210/Pages/ZXComputing821000076.jpg |accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bioeddie.co.uk/Spectrum/vu-3d.htm |title=Psion Vu-3D |accessdate=18 January 2007[/tpl]) and archaeology software[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pitcalc.com/ | last = Brown | first = Paul N. | title = Pitcalc — simple interactive coordinate & trigonometric calculation software | accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl] amongst many other types.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekadv.cgi?type=Astro | title = World of Spectrum | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn | accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl]
The early Spectrum models' great success as a games platform came in spite of its lack of built-in joystick ports, primitive sound generation, and colour support that was optimised for text display:[tpl]Cite book| last = Adamson | first = Ian | authorlink = | coauthors = Richard Kennedy | title = Sinclair and the "Sunrise" Technology: The Deconstruction of a Myth | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | date = 30 October 1986 | url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/spec_sst.htm | isbn = 0-14-008774-5 [/tpl] the hardware limitations of the platform required a particular level of creativity from video game designers.[tpl]Cite news| last = McCandless | first = David | title = Retrospectrum | newspaper = Daily Telegraph | date = 17 September 1998 | url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/sinclair/clive_dt170998.htm [/tpl]
A simulation program called Foxes and Rabbits came with the Spectrum.  The logic was that too small a population of Rabbits would provide insufficient food for Foxes whose numbers would then decline, until too few Foxes would result in the Rabbit population again increasing, and the cycle would continue.  One nominated a number of Rabbits and number of Foxes to start, and then watched the basic graph of the two populations rising and falling.  At any point in time, one could stop the simulation and save to the audio cassette by pressing 'Record' on the connected remote Tape Recorder, and resume the simulation on the Spectrum from that point later.

===Distribution===

Most Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes. The Spectrum was intended to work with a normal domestic cassette recorder,[tpl]Cite book|last=Vickers |first=Steven |coauthors=and Bradbeer, Robin |authorlink=Steve Vickers (academia) |title=Sinclair ZX Spectrum: Introduction |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrumIntroduction/contents.html |accessdate=10 August 2007 |year=1982 |publisher=Sinclair Research Ltd |page=21 |chapter=6. Using the cassette recorder |chapterurl=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrumIntroduction/chapter_six.html[/tpl] and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite reliable, if somewhat slow (by today's standards).
Although the ZX Microdrive was initially greeted with good reviews,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Frey |first=Franco |title=Epicventuring and Multiplayer Networking |journal=CRASH |date=May 1984 |issue=4 |pages=46–47 |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/04/microdv.htm |accessdate=11 August 2007[/tpl] it never took off as a distribution method due to worries about the quality of the cartridges and piracy.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Foot |first=Cathy |title = Microdrive revisited | journal = CRASH |date=November 1985 | issue = 22 |page=8 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/22/opinion.htm | accessdate =10 August 2006 [/tpl] Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.
Although the Interface 2 proved popular, the relatively high cost of ROM cartridges meant that very few titles were released in this format.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/Interface2/Interface/Interface2_Introduction.htm |work = fruitcake.plus.com | title = ZX Interface 2 | accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl]
Despite the popularity of the DISCiPLE and +D systems, most software released for them took the form of utility software. The ZX Spectrum +3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on floppy disk. More than 700 titles were released on 3-inch disk from 1987 to 1997.
Software was also distributed through print media; magazines[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/typehome.htm | last = Grimwood | first = Jim | title = The Type Fantastic | accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl] and books.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/books.html | work = World of Spectrum | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn | title = Books | accessdate=17 September 2008[/tpl] The reader would type the Sinclair BASIC program listing into the computer by hand, run it, and could save it to tape for later use. The software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines also printed long lists of checksummed hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools.
Another software distribution method was to broadcast the audio stream from the cassette on another medium and have users record it onto an audio cassette themselves. In radio or television shows in many European countries, the host would describe a program, instruct the audience to connect a cassette tape recorder to the radio or TV and then broadcast the program over the airwaves in audio format.[tpl]Cite journal| title = News | journal = Sinclair User |date=July 1983 | issue = 16 | page = 17 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/016/news.htm | accessdate =19 August 2006 [/tpl]  Some magazines distributed 7" 33⅓ rpm flexidisc records, a variant of regular vinyl records which could be played on a standard record player.[tpl]cite web| url = http://equ.in/ox/spectrum/music/ | last = Collins | first = Paul Equinox | title = Spectrum references in popular music | accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] These disks were known as floppy ROMs.

===Copying and backup===

Many copiers—utilities to copy programs from audio tape to another tape, microdrive tapes, and later on diskettes—were available for the Spectrum.[tpl]cite web| work = World of Spectrum | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekadv.cgi?type=Copy | title = Sinclair Inforseek | accessdate =18 September 2008 | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn[/tpl]  As a response to this, publishers introduced copy protection measures to their software, including different loading schemes.[tpl]cite web| url = http://newton.sunderland.ac.uk/~specfreak/Schemes/schemes.html | title = ZX Spectrum Loading Schemes | accessdate =18 September 2008 | last = Barker | first = Andy[/tpl]  Other methods for copy prevention were also used including asking for a particular word from the documentation included with the game—often a novella such as the Silicon Dreams trilogy—or another physical device distributed with the software—e.g. Lenslok as used in Elite, or the colour-code chart included with Jet Set Willy. Special hardware, such as Romantic Robot's Multiface, was able to dump a copy of the ZX Spectrum RAM to disk/tape at the press of a button, entirely circumventing the copy protection systems.
Most Spectrum software has, in recent years, been converted to current media and is available for download. One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the parallel port of a PC.[tpl]cite web| work = World of Spectrum | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/taper.html | title = Taper | accessdate =12 September 2008 | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn[/tpl] Once in files on a host machine, the software can be executed on one of many emulators, on virtually any platform available today.
The largest on-line archive of ZX Spectrum software is World of Spectrum, with more than 21,000 titles. The legality of this practice is still in question and while a number of copyright holders have explicitly objected to the posting of their software, others have given their permission for their games to be archived as part of the preservation project.[tpl]cite web| work = World of Spectrum | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/ | title = World of Spectrum — Software — Copyrights and Distribution Permissions | accessdate =12 September 2008 | last = van der Heide | first = Martijn[/tpl]

===Community===

The ZX Spectrum enjoyed a very strong community early on. Several dedicated magazines were released including Sinclair User (1982), Your Spectrum (1983), rebranded as Your Sinclair in 1986, and CRASH (1984). Early on they were very technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials. Later on they became almost completely game-oriented. Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail. They included Computer Gamer, Computer and Video Games, Computing Today, Popular Computing Weekly, Your Computer and The Games Machine.[tpl]cite web| title = The Top Shelf — magazines, comics and papers of the near past. | work = TV Cream's Top Shelf | url = http://tv.cream.org/specialassignments/topshelf/arjcomp.htm | accessdate =10 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The Spectrum is affectionately known as the Speccy by elements of its fan following.[tpl]Cite journal| year = 1991 | month = October | title = The YS Top 100 Speccy Games Of All Time (Ever!) | journal = Your Sinclair | issue = 70 | page = 31 | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/ystop100.htm | accessdate =13 June 2007[/tpl]
More than 80 electronic magazines existed, many in Russian. Most notable of them were AlchNews (UK), ZX-Format (Russia), and Spectrofon (Russia).

===Notable developers===

A number of notable games developers and development companies began their careers on the ZX Spectrum, including David Perry of Shiny Entertainment, and Tim and Chris Stamper (founders of Rare, formerly Ultimate Play The Game, maker of many games for Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles). Other prominent games developers include Julian Gollop (Chaos, Rebelstar, X-COM series), Matthew Smith (Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy), Jon Ritman (Match Day, Head Over Heels), Jonathan "Joffa" Smith (Ping Pong, Batman: The Caped Crusader, Mikie, Hyper Sports), The Oliver Twins (the Dizzy series), Clive Townsend (Saboteur), Sandy White (Ant Attack; I, of the Mask), Pete Cooke (Tau Ceti), Mike Singleton (The Lords of Midnight, War In Middle Earth), and Alan Cox.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Cox/index.shtml | title = Alan Cox: and the Art of Making Beta Code Work | accessdate =18 January 2007 | last = Bezroukov | first = Nikolai | work = Portraits of Open Source Pioneers[/tpl] Although the 48K Spectrum's audio hardware was not as capable as chips in other popular 8-bit home computers of the era, computer musicians David Whittaker and Tim Follin produced notable multi-channel music for the machine.
Jeff Minter ported some of his Commodore VIC-20 games to the ZX Spectrum.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.llamasoft.co.uk/lshistory8.php | title = Llamasoft History — Part 8 - The Dawn of Llamasoft | accessdate =26 September 2007 | last = Minter | first = Jeff[/tpl]

==Reception==

BYTE in January 1983 acknowledged the appeal of the Spectrum's low £125 price to British consumers and called it a "promising machine". It criticized the keyboard; "inexpensive or not, the ... layout is impossible to justify ... poorly designed in several respects". The review was skeptical of the computer's appeal to American consumers if sold for US$220—"hardly competitive with comparable low-cost American units"—and expected that Timex would sell it for $125–150.[tpl]cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-01/1983_01_BYTE_08-01_Looking_Ahead#page/n41/mode/2up | title=Microcomputer, British Style / The Fifth Personal Computer World Show | work=BYTE | date=January 1983 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Williams, Gregg | pages=40[/tpl]

==Legacy==

On 23 April 2012, a Google doodle honoured the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum. As it coincided with St George's Day, the logo was of St George fighting a dragon in the style of a Spectrum loading screen.[tpl]cite web|title=St. George's Day / The 30th Anniversary of the ZX Spectrum|url=http://www.google.com/doodles/st-georges-day-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-zx-spectrum|publisher=Google|accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl]
