[[Gigabit Ethernet]]

CATEGORIES: Ethernet

In computer networking, gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is a term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, where it performed considerably faster. The cables and equipment are very similar to previous standards and have been very common and economical since 2010.
Half-duplex gigabit links connected through hubs are allowed by the specification,A single repeater per collision domain is defined in IEEE 802.3 2008 Section 3: 41. Repeater for 1000 Mb/s baseband networks but full-duplex usage with switches is used exclusively.

==History==

Ethernet was the result of the research done at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. Ethernet later evolved into a widely implemented physical and link layer protocol. Fast Ethernet increased speed from 10 to 100 megabits per second (Mbit/s). Gigabit Ethernet was the next iteration, increasing the speed to 1000 Mbit/s. The initial standard for gigabit Ethernet was produced by the IEEE in June 1998 as IEEE 802.3z, and required optical fiber. 802.3z is commonly referred to as 1000BASE-X, where -X refers to either -CX, -SX, -LX, or (non-standard) -ZX. For the history behind the "X" see Fast Ethernet.
IEEE 802.3ab, ratified in 1999, defines gigabit Ethernet transmission over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) category 5, 5e, or 6 cabling and became known as 1000BASE-T. With the ratification of 802.3ab, gigabit Ethernet became a desktop technology as organizations could use their existing copper cabling infrastructure.
IEEE 802.3ah, ratified in 2004 added two more gigabit fiber standards, 1000BASE-LX10 (which was already widely implemented as vendor specific extension) and 1000BASE-BX10. This was part of a larger group of protocols known as Ethernet in the First Mile.
Initially, gigabit Ethernet was deployed in high-capacity backbone network links (for instance, on a high-capacity campus network). In 2000, Apple's Power Mac G4 and PowerBook G4 were the first mass-produced personal computers featuring the 1000BASE-T connection.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&model=g4giga |title=Power Macintosh G4 (Gigabit Ethernet) |publisher=apple-history.com |accessdate=November 5, 2007[/tpl] It quickly became a built-in feature in many other computers.
Higher bandwidth 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards have since become available as the IEEE ratified a fiber-based standard in 2002, and a twisted pair standard in 2006.  [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], 10Gb Ethernet is replacing 1Gb as the backbone network and has begun to migrate down to high-end server systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

==Varieties==

There are five physical layer standards for gigabit Ethernet using optical fiber (1000BASE-X), twisted pair cable (1000BASE-T), or shielded balanced copper cable (1000BASE-CX).
The IEEE 802.3z standard includes 1000BASE-SX for transmission over multi-mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX for transmission over single-mode fiber, and the nearly obsolete 1000BASE-CX for transmission over shielded balanced copper cabling. These standards use 8b/10b encoding, which inflates the line rate by 25%, from 1000 Mbit/s to 1250 Mbit/s, to ensure a DC balanced signal. The symbols are then sent using NRZ.
IEEE 802.3ab, which defines the widely used 1000BASE-T interface type, uses a different encoding scheme in order to keep the symbol rate as low as possible, allowing transmission over twisted pair.
IEEE 802.3ap defines Ethernet Operation over Electrical Backplanes at different speeds.
Ethernet in the First Mile later added 1000BASE-LX10 and -BX10.

===1000BASE-X===

1000BASE-X is used in industry to refer to gigabit Ethernet transmission over fiber, where options include 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, 1000BASE-LX10, 1000BASE-BX10 or the non-standard -EX and -ZX implementations.

====1000BASE-CX====

1000BASE-CX is an initial standard for gigabit Ethernet connections with maximum distances of 25 meters using balanced shielded twisted pair and either DE-9 or 8P8C connector (with a pinout different from 1000BASE-T). The short segment length is due to very high signal transmission rate. Although it is still used for specific applications where cabling is done by IT professionals, for instance the IBM BladeCenter uses 1000BASE-CX for the Ethernet connections between the blade servers and the switch modules, 1000BASE-T has succeeded it for general copper wiring use.

====1000BASE-KX====

1000BASE-KX is part of the IEEE 802.3ap standard for Ethernet Operation over Electrical Backplanes. This standard defines one to four lanes of backplane links, one RX and one TX differential pair per lane, at link bandwidth ranging from 100Mbit to 10Gbit per second (from 100BASE-KX to 10GBASE-KX4). The 1000BASE-KX variant uses 1.25 GBd electrical (not optical) signalling speed.

====1000BASE-SX====

1000BASE-SX is a fiber optic gigabit Ethernet standard for operation over multi-mode fiber using a 770 to 860 nanometer, near infrared (NIR) light wavelength.
The standard specifies a distance capability between 220 metres (62.5/125 µm fiber with low modal bandwidth) and 550 metres (50/125 µm fiber with high modal bandwidth). In practice, with good quality fiber, optics, and terminations, 1000BASE-SX will usually work over significantly longer distances.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
This standard is highly popular for intra-building links in large office buildings, co-location facilities and carrier neutral internet exchanges.
Optical power specifications of SX interface: Minimum output power = −9.5 dBm. Minimum receive sensitivity = −17 dBm.

====1000BASE-LX====

1000BASE-LX is a fiber optic gigabit Ethernet standard specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 38 which uses a long wavelength laser (1,270–1,355 nm), and a maximum RMS spectral width of 4 nm.
1000BASE-LX is specified to work over a distance of up to 5 km over 10 µm single-mode fiber.
1000BASE-LX can also run over all common types of multi-mode fiber with a maximum segment length of 550 m. For link distances greater than 300 m, the use of a special launch conditioning patch cord may be required.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps679/products_installation_and_configuration_guide09186a008007d1cb.html |title=Mode-Conditioning Patch Cord Installation Note |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |postscript=[/tpl] This launches the laser at a precise offset from the center of the fiber which causes it to spread across the diameter of the fiber core, reducing the effect known as differential mode delay which occurs when the laser couples onto only a small number of available modes in multi-mode fiber.

====1000BASE-LX10====

1000BASE-LX10 was standardized six years after the initial gigabit fiber versions as part of the Ethernet in the First Mile task group. It is very similar to 1000BASE-LX, but achieves longer distances up to 10 km over a pair of single-mode fiber due to higher quality optics. Before it was standardized 1000BASE-LX10 was essentially already in widespread use by many vendors as a proprietary extension called either 1000BASE-LX/LH or 1000BASE-LH.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/modules/ps5455/ps6577/product_data_sheet0900aecd8033f885.html |title=Cisco SFP Optics For Gigabit Ethernet Applications |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |publisher=Cisco Systems[/tpl]

====1000BASE-EX====

1000BASE-EX is a non-standard but industry accepted[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] term to refer to gigabit Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 1000BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up to 40 km over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a LX10, running on 1310 nm wavelength lasers.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.optcore.net/optcore/html_products/1000BASE-EX-SFP-Module-40km-Reach-226.html |title=Optcore 1000BASE-EX SFP Module [/tpl] It is sometimes referred to as LH (Long Haul). Easily confused with a 1000BASE-LX10 or 1000BASE-ZX because some vendors use the LH term.

====1000BASE-BX10====

1000BASE-BX10 is capable of up to 10 km over a single strand of single-mode fiber, with a different wavelength going in each direction. The terminals on each side of the fibre are not equal, as the one transmitting downstream (from the center of the network to the outside) uses the 1,490 nm wavelength, and the one transmitting upstream uses the 1,310 nm wavelength.

====1000BASE-ZX====

1000BASE-ZX is a non-standard but industry accepted[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] term to refer to gigabit Ethernet transmission using 1,550 nm wavelength to achieve distances of at least 70 km over single-mode fiber.

===1000BASE-T===

1000BASE-T (also known as IEEE 802.3ab) is a standard for gigabit Ethernet over copper wiring.
Each 1000BASE-T network segment can be a maximum length of [tpl]convert|100|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl], and must use Category 5 cable or better (including Cat 5e and Cat 6).
Autonegotiation is a requirement for using 1000BASE-T[tpl]Cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/interp/IEEE802.3af-2003interp-6.pdf |title=Auto-Negotiation; 802.3-2002 |work=IEEE Standards Interpretations |publisher=IEEE |format=PDF |accessdate=November 5, 2007[/tpl] according to Section 28D.5 Extensions required for Clause40 (1000BASE-T).[tpl]Cite web|author=IEEE |url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section2.pdf |title=Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) access method and Physical Layer specifications |publisher=SECTION TWO: This section includes Clause21 through Clause 33 and Annex 22A through Annex 33E.|date= |accessdate=February 18, 2010[/tpl]  At least the clock source has to be negotiated, as one endpoint must be master and the other endpoint must be slave.
In a departure from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T uses all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions through the use of adaptive equalization and a five-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-5) technique. The symbol rate is identical to that of 100BASE-TX (125 Mbaud) and the noise immunity of the five-level signaling is also identical to that of the three-level signaling in 100BASE-TX, since 1000BASE-T uses four-dimensional trellis coded modulation (TCM) to achieve a 6 dB coding gain across the four pairs.
Since negotiation takes place on only two pairs, if two gigabit devices are connected through a cable with only two pairs, the devices will successfully choose 'gigabit' as the highest common denominator (HCD), but the link will never come up. Most gigabit physical devices have a specific register to diagnose this behaviour. Some drivers offer an "Ethernet@Wirespeed" option where this situation leads to a slower yet functional connection.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/faq_drivers.php |title=Broadcom Ethernet NIC FAQs |accessdate=July 25, 2009[/tpl]
The data is transmitted over four copper pairs, eight bits at a time. First, eight bits of data are expanded into four three-bit symbols through a non-trivial scrambling procedure based on a linear feedback shift register; this is similar to what is done in 100BASE-T2, but uses different parameters. The three-bit symbols are then mapped to voltage levels which vary continuously during transmission. An example mapping is as follows:
Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration is specified as an optional feature in the 1000BASE-T standard,Clause 40.4.4 in IEEE 802.3-2008 meaning that straight-through cables will often work between gigabit-capable interfaces. This feature eliminates the need for crossover cables, making obsolete the uplink/normal ports and manual selector switches found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.

===1000BASE-TX===

The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) created and promoted a standard similar to 1000BASE-T that was simpler to implement, calling it 1000BASE-TX (TIA/EIA-854).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tiaonline.org/news_events/press_room/press_releases/legacy.cfm?parelease=01-87 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110927060633/http://www.tiaonline.org/news_events/press_room/press_releases/legacy.cfm?parelease=01-87 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |date=July 25, 2001 |title=TIA Publishes New Standard TIA/EIA-854 |publisher=TAI[/tpl]
The simplified design would have, in theory, reduced the cost of the required electronics by only using two unidirectional pairs in each direction instead of 4 bidirectional. However, this solution has been a commercial failure, likely due to the required Category 6 cabling and the rapidly falling cost of 1000BASE-T products.
1000BASE-T products are sometimes marketed as 1000BASE-TX despite the difference in standards. The confusion possibly stems from the most popular form of Fast Ethernet (100 Mbit/s) is known as 100BASE-TX, leading to many products supporting multiple speeds of 10/100/1000Mbit/s marketed as "10/100/1000BASE-TX".An example of a product specifying 10/100/1000BASE-TX ports can be found at [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10018/index.html |title=Cisco SR224G 24-port 10/100 2-port Gigabit Switch + 2 miniGBIC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110910082300/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10018/index.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011[/tpl]
