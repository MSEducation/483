Eight studios are rented to London-based artists[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gasworks.org.uk/studioartists/|title=Studio Artists|publisher=GASWORKS|accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl] and three are reserved for an International Residency Programme for non-UK based artists. Gasworks residencies encourage exchange of ideas between practitioners, instigating experimentation with new concepts and new materials. The non-prescriptive and process-based nature of the residencies allows visiting artists to develop projects in response to their new context, or to conduct research benefiting from Londonâ€™s resources. Since 1994 Gasworks Residency Programme has worked with over 200 artists from more than 50 countries worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/|title=Residencies|publisher=GASWORKS|accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl]
Gasworks residencies include an education and outreach programme, with some residencies dedicated to working with local community groups. Residencies culminate in an Open Studio with occasional projects developed in collaboration with the exhibition programme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gasworks.org.uk/international/|title=International Fellowships|publisher=GASWORKS|accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl]
Gasworks Gallery hosts up to four exhibitions a year and profiles emerging or mid-career international or UK artists whose practice is of outstanding quality and who have limited previous exposure in London. The Gallery is committed to the professional development of artists and offers a strong level of curatorial, administrative and practical support. The exhibitions are complemented by a programme of education and off-site activities which aim to introduce and discuss themes and ideas of contemporary international art practice to both a younger and a professional audience.
