The church was built 1910-1912 to the designs of Joseph Hubert McGuire. It has a dome of Guastavino tile. According to Frederick D. Taylor in his article Medieval New York - Holy Trinity Church the church was built deliberately in the Byzantine style, unusual for the time, and has been "considered to be one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture in this country." The Rev. Frank W. Crowder, D.D., rector, had a four-story brick rectory at 341 East 87th Street built in 1927 to designs by G. Atterbury of 139 East 53rd Street for $50,000.
