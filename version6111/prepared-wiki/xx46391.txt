==History==

As the famed site of healing cold springs, Spa has been frequented as a watering-place since as early as the 14th century. Though other sources of healing mineral springs have become famous throughout the world, it is the town of Spa which has become eponymous with any place having a natural water source that is believed to possess special health-giving properties, as a spa. Since the eighteenth century casinos have also been located in the town.
In 1918, the German Army established its principal Headquarters in Spa, and it was from here that the delegates set out for the French lines to meet Marshal Foch and sue for peace in the consultations leading up to the Armistice which ended the First World War. In July 1920 it hosted the Spa Conference, a meeting of the Supreme Council. German delegates were invited to this to discuss war reparations.
The town is close to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, (actually today located in Stavelot) which hosts the annual Formula One Belgian Grand Prix. It is also the location of mineral water producer Spa.
Agatha Christie's fictional detective Hercule Poirot was born in Spa.
Spa hosted the finish of Stage 2 of the 2010 Tour de France on July 5.
