[[2000]]

CATEGORIES: 2000

2000 was designated as:
The year 2000 was the first year of the 2000s decade.  Popular culture holds the year 2000 as the first year of the 21st century and the 3rd millennium, due to a tendency to group the years according to decimal values, as if year zero were counted.  According to the Gregorian Calendar these distinctions fall to the year 2001, because the 1st century was retroactively said to start with year AD 1.  Since the calendar has no year zero, its first millennium spans from years 1 to 1000, inclusively, and its second millennium from years 1001 to 2000. (See more at Millennium.)
The "year 2000" is sometimes abbreviated as "Y2K" (the "Y" stands for "year", and the "K" stands for "kilo" which means "thousand").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calendarhome.com/clink/y2000.html |title=Y2K, After the Hype |publisher=CalendarHome.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=By TINA KELLEYPublished: December 27, 1999 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/27/nyregion/y2k-stands-for-the-year-2000-now-that-wasn-t-really-difficult-was-it.html |title='Y2K' Stands for the Year 2000. Now That Wasn't Really Difficult, Was It? - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-12-27 |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl] The year 2000 was the subject of Y2K concerns: fears that computers would not shift from 1999 to 2000 correctly.  However, by the end of 1999, many companies had already converted to new, or upgraded their existing software. Some even obtained Y2K certification. As a result of massive effort, much of it mis-directed, relatively few problems occurred.
