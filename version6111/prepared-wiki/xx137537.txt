Crenshaw/I-105 is a Los Angeles County Metro Rail station on the Green Line.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metro.net/around/rail/green-line/|title=Green Line station information|accessdate=2010-09-25[/tpl] It is located at Crenshaw Boulevard in the median of the Century Freeway in Hawthorne, California.  It is not necessarily named for the Crenshaw district (to the north) as Metro Rail usually names most of their stations after the nearest major cross streets; in this case, it is named for Crenshaw Boulevard which indeed travels up to the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles.  The original name for this station was Crenshaw/I-105 and it may still be used in some places. The stories on the tiled walls in the lower half were collected and organized by Buzz Spector.
