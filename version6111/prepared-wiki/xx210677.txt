The Apostolic Christian Church of America is a Christian denomination, based in the United States. Its website states, "The Apostolic Christian Church believes in the infallibility of the Bible, and it is founded on faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The purpose of the church is to teach the Gospel message of salvation, to nurture the believer, to preserve sound doctrine and to serve others in the likeness of Christ."http://apostolicchristian.org/
The denomination consists of approximately 90 congregations in the United States, Japan, Mexico and Canada.  The church also conducts worship services on many college campuses in several states. An organization called Apostolic Christian World Relief collects both financial and material aid for distribution to persons in need on a worldwide basis.  There is growing mission work in Mexico, including development of an orphanage in Magdalena, Mexico.http://apostolicchristian.org/about.php

==Biblical Practices and Traditions==

===Church Discipline===

Members are said to be disciplined out of love, and since the church believes some sins are worse than others, the degree of discipline varies on the degree of sin. If the member commits a sin unto death, as the Apostolic Christian Church believes to be laid out by the Bible, he or she will be excommunicated.  Although not completely shunned, the individual will no longer be considered a member of the ACCA. Common to popular misconception, ACCA members can be disciplined because of sin or because of a lack of adherence to traditions, though in practice, rarely has the latter reason ever been used as a basis of discipline.

===Conversion===

The conversion experienced for each member varies in timing and detail, but all include repentance for one's sins, making restitution, confessing sins to God while in the presence of man (an elder of the church), and finding peace with God.  The word "convert" is used throughout the denomination to describe anyone who begins repentance but has not yet been baptized into the church. It does not imply conversion from another denomination or religion, but from the carnal to the spiritual state.  Once converts "receive peace from God," this is announced to the church and a baptism date is set.  Converts give a testimony before the members of the church prior to the public baptism service, telling the story of their personal conversion experience.  This sharing, commonly referred to as a "testimony" or "proving", typically takes place the night before the baptism and is a closed member meeting.  Because baptism is identified with a "death to sin" in Romans 6 and other New Testament writings, congregational recognition of the convert's repentance and death to sin is desired prior to baptism.  The baptism service is open for anyone to attend and is performed before the entire congregation.  Before the baptism takes place the convert makes a covenant with God in the presence of the entire congregation.  Once the covenant is made, the convert is fully immersed in water (unless they are physically unable to do so).  After the baptism service, there is a laying on of hands by one or more elders and an accompanying consecration prayer.  This laying on of hands and prayer of consecration is said to place the seal the Holy Spirit on the life of the newly baptized.
If considering converting to the Apostolic Christian Church of America, it is imperative that you are instructed well before-hand and know what to expect.
