[[Goaltender interference]]

CATEGORIES: Ice hockey rules

Goaltender interference is a penalty in ice hockey whereby a player is found in the goal crease when a goalie is establishing his position in the same area.
Under the NHL rule book (# 69), this will result in a minor penalty to the offending player.  If a goal is scored as a result of a player obstructing the goaltender, the goal will be disallowed and a minor penalty assessed at the referee's discretion. In leagues where goaltender interference isn't an official penalty, a charging penalty is called instead.
