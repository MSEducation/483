Gary Pavkovich (born August 8, 1968), is a South African photographer best known for his controversial series "Black/White", depicting the ravages Hiv/Aids has inflicted on the people of Sub Saharan Africa. The controversy arose from the implication that the government of the day in South Africa, and surrounding countries, largely ignored the full scope of the disease and were in denial as to the long term effects on the population. In 2008 he was SIP photographer of the year.
