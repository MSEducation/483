[[Musbury Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Lancashire

The Musbury Valley is a small valley in the east Pennines, west of Helmshore and Haslingden in Rossendale, Lancashire. The valley is very picturesque and includes a variety of landscapes, mostly sheep pasture and moors but there are some patches of beautiful woodland here and there. 
Most of the Musbury valley is sheep grazing pasture and, around the river, quite boggy.  Like its sister valley, the Alden Valley, it is a spot of natural beauty.  
To the North east is Musbury Tor and the Alden valley, to the North west is Musbury Heights and the Grane valley.

==History==

Floods of 1964
Heavy rain in July 1964 caused a flood which destroyed much of the brookside footpath at the bottom of the valley.Musbury and Alden, 700 years of life and landscape; John Simpson; 2008 Helmshore Local History Society; ISBN 978-0-906881-19-4  The valley has since recovered and is still very picturesque although the area affected is now very waterlogged.

==Musbury Heights==

On the north west side of the valley is Musbury Heights.  In the past, this area was a quarry and is now disused.  The ruins of several buildings and a (rebuilt) chimney remain along with countless spoil heaps and old workings.  As a result of the extensive quarrying, the geography of Musbury Heights is greatly different to other hills in the area such as Musbury Tor.  Some of the old workings have the tendency to fill with water in times of heavy rain.  The area is very common with walkers and provides a starting point for a walk to the Grane valley which is also very popular.
