==Route description==

FM 1863 begins in Bulverde, at an interchange with US 281, and travels east through the southern portion of the city. Due to the manner in which the route was constructed, the route briefly enters Bexar County before returning to Comal County.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|403|accessdate=2011-01-05[/tpl] It has an intersection with FM 3009 near the Bulverde city limits. It continues eastward, eventually entering New Braunfels and ending at a junction with SH 46.

==History==

Historically, another route known as FM 1863 existed in Nacogdoches County from 1951 to 1953, when that route's mileage was transferred to FM 1274. That became FM 95 in 1964.[tpl]TxDOT|FM|1274[/tpl] The current designation for FM 1863 was introduced in 1952; at that time, the route's western terminus was listed as a "road intersection" west of New Braunfels. The designation was extended to US 281 in 1957.
