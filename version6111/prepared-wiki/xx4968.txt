The International Organization for Standardization ([tpl]lang-fr|Organisation internationale de normalisation[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-rus|Международная организация по стандартизации|r=Myezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii[/tpl]), known as ISO, is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.
Founded on 23 February 1947, the organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
It was one of the first organizations granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

==Name and abbreviation==

The three official languages of the ISO are English, French and Russian.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm |title=How to use the ISO Catalogue |publisher=ISO.org |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-10-04 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071004225623/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm[/tpl] As its name would have different abbreviations in different languages ("IOS" is English, "OIN" in French, etc.), the organization adopted "ISO", derived from the Greek word isos ([tpl]lang|grc|ἴσος[/tpl], meaning equal), as its abbreviated name.[tpl]cite web |title=About ISO - Our name |publisher=ISO |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm#2012_aboutiso_iso_name-text-Anchor |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919212143/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm#2012_aboutiso_iso_name-text-Anchor[/tpl]

==History==

The organization today known as ISO began in 1926 as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA). It was suspended in 1942[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] during World War II, but after the war ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization; the new organization officially began operations in February 1947.[tpl]cite |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf |format=PDF |title=Friendship among equals - Recollections from ISO's first fifty years |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |year=1997 |isbn=92-67-10260-5 |pages=15-18 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-10-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121026060448/http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf[/tpl]

==Structure==

ISO is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized authorities on standards, each one representing one country. Members meet annually at a General Assembly to discuss ISO's strategic objectives. The organization is coordinated by a Central Secretariat based in Geneva.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/about_governance.htm |title=Structure and governance |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919222955/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/about_governance.htm[/tpl]
A Council with a rotating membership of 20 member bodies provides guidance and governance, including setting the Central Secretariat's annual budget.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=55010 |title=Council |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-11-03 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121103211437/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=55010[/tpl]
The Technical Management Board is responsible for over 250 technical committees, who develop the ISO standards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees.htm |title=Technical committees |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919220258/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/who-develops-iso-standards.htm |title=Who develops ISO standards? |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919212351/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/who-develops-iso-standards.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/governance_of_technical_work.htm |title=Governance of technical work |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919222005/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/governance_of_technical_work.htm[/tpl]

===IEC joint committees===

ISO has formed joint committees with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to develop standards and terminology in the areas of electrical, electronic and related technologies.

====ISO/IEC JTC 1====

ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was created in 1987 to "develop, maintain, promote and facilitate IT standards".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home |title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2011-12-15 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111215062549/http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home[/tpl]

====ISO/IEC JTC 2====

ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 2 (JTC 2) was created in 2009 for the purpose of "standardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=585141 |title=ISO/IEC JPC 2 Joint Project Committee - Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources - Common terminology |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-10-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121006120431/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=585141[/tpl]

==Membership==

ISO has 164 national members,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/iso_members.htm |title=ISO members |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-09-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919221819/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/iso_members.htm[/tpl] out of the 206 total countries in the world.
ISO has three membership categories:
Participating members are called "P" members, as opposed to observing members, who are called "O" members.

==Financing==

ISO is funded by a combination of:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_general_information_on_iso.htm |title=General information on ISO |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-10-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071005105014/http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_general_information_on_iso.htm[/tpl] 

==International Standards and other publications==

ISO's main products are international standards. ISO also publishes technical reports, technical specifications, publicly available specifications, technical corrigenda, and guides.
[ref]The ISO directives are published in two distinct parts:

These are meta-standards covering "matters related to international standardization". They are named using the format "ISO/IEC Guide N:yyyy: Title".
For example:

===Document copyright===

ISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before it becomes finalized as a standard. Some standards by ISO and its official U.S. representative (and, via the U.S. National Committee, the International Electrotechnical Commission) are made freely available.[tpl]cite web |title=Freely Available Standards |publisher=ISO |date=1 February 2011 |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ |deadurl=no |archivedate= |archiveurl=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Free ANSI Standards |url=http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403014457/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp[/tpl]

==Standardization process==

A standard published by ISO/IEC is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee. Here are some abbreviations used for marking a standard with its status:[tpl]cite web |url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/about_mpeg.htm |title=About MPEG |publisher=chiariglione.org |deadurl=no |archivedate=2010-02-21 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100221015546/http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/about_mpeg.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description/stages_table.htm#s90 |title=International harmonized stage codes |author=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-08-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812204054/http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description/stages_table.htm#s90[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description.htm |title=Stages of the development of International Standards |author=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-08-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812204054/http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso27001security.com/html/faq.html#Acronyms |title=The ISO27k FAQ - ISO/IEC acronyms and committees |publisher=IsecT Ltd. |deadurl=no |archivedate=2005-11-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051124081445/http://www.iso27001security.com/html/faq.html#Acronyms[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/1st_Supplement.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO/IEC Directives Supplement — Procedures specific to ISO |year=2007 |author=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-01-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112093253/http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/1st_Supplement.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_list_abbreviations.htm |title=List of abbreviations used throughout ISO Online |year=2007 |author=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-08-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812204054/http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_list_abbreviations.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/US%20TAG%20Committe%20Handbook%206March2008.doc |format=DOC |title=US Tag Committee Handbook |date=March 2008 |author= |deadurl=no |archivedate= |archiveurl=[/tpl]

International Standards are developed by ISO technical committees (TC) and subcommittees (SC) by a process with six steps:[tpl]citation |url=http://www.iec.ch/tiss/iec/Directives-Part1-Ed6.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1 - Procedures for the technical work, Sixth edition, 2008 |year=2008 |author=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2010-07-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100714140207/http://www.iec.ch/tiss/iec/Directives-Part1-Ed6.pdf[/tpl]
The TC/SC may set up working groups (WG) of experts for the preparation of a working drafts. Subcommittees may have several working groups, which can have several Sub Groups (SG).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w12911.htm |title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29, SC 29/WG 11 Structure (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 - Coding of Moving Pictures and Audio) |author=ISO, IEC |date=5 November 2009 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2001-01-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010128180300/http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w12911.htm[/tpl]
It is possible to omit certain stages, if there is a document with a certain degree of maturity at the start of a standardization project, for example a standard developed by another organization. ISO/IEC directives allow also the so-called "Fast-track procedure". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.
The first step—a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g., SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of Moving Picture Experts Group - ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g., MPEG) usually make open request for proposals—known as a "call for proposals". The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model (VM) (previously also called a "simulation and test model"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft (WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes committee draft (CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.
The CD becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). The text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard (IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.

==Products named after ISO==

The fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of "ISO" to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:

==Criticism==

With the exception of a small number of isolated standards, ISO standards are normally not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-10-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm[/tpl] which has been seen by some as too expensive for small open source projects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community |date=1 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-11-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html[/tpl]
The ISO/IEC JTC1 fast-track procedures ("Fast-track" as used by OOXML and "PAS" as used by OpenDocument) have garnered criticism in relation to the standardization of Office Open XML (ISO/IEC 29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 WG1, is quoted as saying:
 
 I would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1’s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.

 
 The disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting 'standardization by corporation'.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-08-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm[/tpl]

Computer security entrepreneur and Ubuntu investor, Mark Shuttleworth, commented on the Standardization of Office Open XML process by saying "I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process," and Shuttleworth alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that Microsoft had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML.
 
 When you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion … then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate lobbying and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu’s Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML’s win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2008-04-04 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222[/tpl]
