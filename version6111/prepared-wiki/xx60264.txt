Route 175 is a short, [tpl]convert|2.95|mi|km[/tpl] long state highway in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs along a former alignment of New Jersey Route 29 before the construction of the John Fitch Parkway in the 1960s. The route begins at Route 29 in the capital city of Trenton, running along Sanhican Road, River Road and West Upper Ferry Road into Ewing Township. The route provides as a frontage road for Route 29 until the intersection with West Upper Ferry Road, where it turns on its own out into rural Ewing Township. For its final stretch, Route 175 heads along the Delaware and Raritan Canal until coming to an end at a merge with Route 29 in Ewing Township.
Route 175 originates as alignment of Route 29, which followed local roads after the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. It remained Route 29 through the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering and was moved onto the John Fitch Parkway upon its completion in the 1960s. By 1969, the original alignment was designated as Route 175 and both roads have remained the same since.

==Route description==

Route 175 begins at an offramp from New Jersey Route 29 and Aberfeldy Drive in the capital city of Trenton. The route heads northward, progressing through the northern residential districts on Sanhican Drive. The highway continues, parallelling Route 29 for a distance. At an intersection with Afton Avenue, the continuation of Aberfeldy Drive, Route 175 changes names from Sanhican Drive (which is not noted in the Straight Line Diagrams) to River Road, which is also the name for Route 29. The highway continues, intersecting with Mercer County Route 643 (Lower Ferry Road) in Ewing Township. A short distance later, Routes 175 and 29 cross under a railroad viaduct along the Delaware River, passing to the south of several high-end mansions. Route 175 itself passes to the south of condominium complexes, intersecting with the access road shortly afterward.[tpl]cite map|title=Overview map of NJ 175|publisher=Bing Maps/Microsoft Inc.|cartography=NAVTEQ Inc.|year=2009|accessdate=September 23, 2009|url=http://www.maps.bing.com/maps/?FORM=Z9LH8#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[/tpl] 
A short distance later, Route 175 juts to the northeast near a commercial business, interchanging with Route 29. After the short interchange, the highway continues along the side of Route 29, intersecting with Wilburtha Road (formerly an intersection with New Jersey Route 39) in Ewing. Routes 175 and 29 continue northward, crossing through the woodlands north of Trenton, until Route 175 makes a bend to the northeast, intersecting with West Upper Ferry Road. The highway turns onto West Upper Ferry Road, heading to the northeast, crossing through a wealthy district in Ewing surrounded by woodlands. The route begins to enter fields, crossing over the Delaware and Raritan Canal on character-less bridge. After the bridge, Route 175 turns to the north onto River Road, while West Upper Ferry Road continues as Mercer County Route 634.
Route 175 heads northward along the Delaware and Raritan Canal as River Road, passing through woodlands and residential homes. A short distance later, it intersects with State Police Drive, a road serving the local New Jersey State Police headquarters. Continuing along the canal, Route 175 progresses northward, intersecting with Trooper Drive before crossing under Interstate 95 at Interchange 1. Route 175 continues for a short distance, becoming a divided highway just after the overpass. A short distance later, the highway comes to end as the right-of-way continues onto Route 29.
