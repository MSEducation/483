==Early life==

Wheaton was born in Burbank, California, to Debbie (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[tpl]cite web|url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/wheaton.htm |title=Genealogy | work = Roots Web | publisher= Ancestry | accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/13/Wil-Wheaton.html |title=Wil Wheaton Biography (1972–) | publisher=Film reference | accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.

===Acting===

Wheaton made his acting debut in the 1981 television film A Long Way Home, and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the 1982 animated film The Secret of NIMH, the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH. He had a minor role in the 1984 movie The Last Starfighter as Louis' friend but it was cut out. He first gained widespread attention in 1986 as Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me, the film adaptation of Stephen King's The Body.

====Star Trek====

From 1987 to 1990, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. Although his Star Trek character, and by extension Wheaton himself, was disliked by a vocal group of Trekkies during TNG's first run, he commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:
[tpl]Quote | Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[tpl]Citation | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081224071024/http://www.webtalkguys.com/091804.shtml | archivedate = December 24, 2008 | url = http://www.webtalkguys.com/091804.shtml | contribution = From Star Trek: Next Generation to Geek Blogger | publisher = Web talk guys[/tpl].[/tpl]

Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger issues. He came back to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, then re-entered the acting world.[tpl]Cite book| first =Wil | last = Wheaton| title=Just a geek: unflinchingly honest tales of the search for life, love, and fulfillment beyond the Starship Enterprise|year=2004|publisher = O'Reilly |location=Sebastopol, CA| isbn =0-596-00768-X|page=9[/tpl] In the late 1990s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things, in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker.

He later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's Law, which states "don't be a dick" (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post). Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).

===Writing===

Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm", as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[tpl]cite web|url = http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/9036/ |title=New Writers for SuicideGirls Newswire |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |publisher= Suicide girls |date=June 3, 2005 |accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The Onion AV Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2009[/tpl] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.
In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monolithpress.com/about.php | title =About | publisher = Monolith Press |accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[tpl]Citation | first = Wil | last = Wheaton | url = http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/02/i_wrote_on_card.html | contribution = Punch a hole in the sky | title = Wil Wheaton Dot Net in Exile | date = February 3, 2006 | publisher = Type pad | accessdate = March 3, 2009[/tpl]. Subsequently in 2007, his next book, "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with and memories, of the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of "The Happiest Days of Our Lives", which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan.
