This is the second time that David Carradine and Daryl Hannah have teamed up to do a Kung Fu film since appearing in Kill Bill. They teamed up again for Carradine's posthumous release of Eldorado, where they would again get together again with another member of Kill Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Michael Madsen. All three have been friends for a long while, and on his and Hannah's friendship as well as her character Carradine stated " I've known Daryl Hannah for 20 years. She's kind of a friend of the family. Anyway, I've been hot for her ever since Blade Runner. It was great working with her on this. She plays a torch singer, and she's actually pretty good at it. I think that's probably why she took the part, because she got to sing." http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-carradine,2451/

The Kung Fu action site 24 Frames per Second gave the film a poor review criticising the script the "coma inducing" David Carradine as well as Daryl Hannah's singing ability http://www.24framespersecond.net/index.php?/24frames/news_details/the-white-crane-chronicles-review/ and Movie phone called it "a rather unfortunate tribute".http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/06/13/spike-tv-to-show-kung-fu-killer-as-part-of-carradine-marathon/ Beyond Hollywood however praises Daryl Hannah but criticises the film as "boring".http://www.beyondhollywood.com/kung-fu-killer-2008-movie-review/
