The William Leitch Medal was an annual award which was presented to the Best and Fairest player in the TANFL/TFL Statewide League.
At various times prior to 1930 and between 1935 and 1939 the TFL award was known by other names. 
From 1942 to 1944 the competition was suspended due to World War Two.
Following the collapse of both the Tasmanian Football League (TFL) in 1998 and its replacement competitions (the TSFL in 1999 and the SWL in December 2000), the award was suspended until its revival in 2004, awarded to the best and fairest player in the SFL Premier League and from 2009, awarded to the best and fairest player in the SFL.
