The town of Nag Hammadi was established by Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi, who was a member of the Hammadi family in Sohag, Egypt. Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi was a major landholder in Sohag, and known for his strong opposition to the British occupation.
Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi created Nag Hammadi for the indigenous people from Sohag who were forced to abandon their homeland by the British occupation. In recognition of this, the new town was given the name "Hammadi".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

==Nag Hammadi Library==

Nag Hammadi is best known for being the site where local farmers found a sealed earthenware jar containing thirteen leather-bound papyrus codices, together with pages torn from another book, in December 1945. The mother of the farmers burned one of the books and parts of a second (including its cover). Thus twelve of these books (one missing its cover) and the loose pages survive.[tpl]cite book |author=James M. Robinson |year=1988 |title=The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Harper San Francisco |location=San Francisco[/tpl]. "The Nag Hammadi library consists of twelve books, plus eight leaves removed from a thirteenth book in late antiquity and tucked inside the front cover of the sixth. These eight leaves comprise a complete text, an independent treatise taken out of a book of collected essays." (p.10) The writings in these codices, dating back to the 2nd century AD,www.nag-hammadi.com comprised 52 mostly Gnostic tractates, were found in a single grave site.
The contents of the Coptic-bound codices were written in Coptic, though the works were probably all translations from Greek. The Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete copy of the Gospel of Thomas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
All the texts have been public since 1975, and are available online.
