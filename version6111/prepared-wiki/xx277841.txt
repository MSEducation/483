Olstrup Church is a Romanesque church in open country west of Errindlev in the south of the Danish island of Lolland."Olstrup Kirke", Danmarks Kirker. [tpl]da icon[/tpl] Retrieved 8 August 2013. There are 16th-century frescos of the Last Judgment on the chancel arch with Christ sitting on a rainbow. 

==Architecture==

In the Middle Ages, the church was originally dedicated to St Lawrence. Built of red brick, the relatively small church first consisted of a Romanesque chancel and nave. It was later extended to the west in the Late Gothic period with a stepped gable."Olstrup kirke", Historisk Atlas. [tpl]da icon[/tpl] Retrieved 8 August 2013. The chancel's cross-vaults and the round chancel arch may date from the church's original construction. The cross-vaults in the nave also seem to be older than the Gothic extension."Olstrup kirke", Nordens kirker. [tpl]da icon[/tpl] Retrieved 8 August 2013.

==Frescos==

In 1936, Egmont Lind discovered frescos in the east vault of the nave which were dated to c. 1575. They present scenes of the Last Judgment. Christ is depicted sitting on a rainbow with his feet on the globe of the Earth, flanked by trumpet-playing angels and the 12 apostles. Some pre-Reformation features such as the lily and sword are included but there are no halos.

==Interior==

The carved pulpit from 1622 has figures of the apostles. The canopy is from c. 1675. On the north wall there is a figure of St Lawrence from c. 1300. There is a decorated font in Gotland  limestone.
