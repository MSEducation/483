BerliOS consists of several subprojects:

==Closure and relaunch==

The operators of the BerliOS project announced that BerliOS will close at the end of 2011 due to lack of sufficient funding and support.[tpl]cite web |url=http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=37450 |title=BerliOS will be closed on 31.12.2011 |author=Fraunhofer FOKUS |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |work=BerliOS Neuigkeiten |publisher=BerliOS [/tpl]
As the news of the pending closure spread, BerliOS received numerous rescue proposals.
