Wild horses have lived in this park since the 1930s. In October 2000, over 600 horses in the Guy Fawkes River National Park were shot and killed from a helicopter during a controversial cull by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association Inc. Retrieved 7 January 2009. In response to public outcry, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Bob Debus, commissioned a study into the heritage value of horses in the park and indicated that, should the horses be found to have genuine heritage significance, they would be humanely removed from the park so that they can be managed properly in another location by people with an interest in their heritage value. In February 2002, the final report by the Heritage Working Party found that these horses had significant historical, military and cultural value. They are direct descendants of Australia's wartime cavalry horses, known as Walers, and are the only group of Australian wild horse to have proven heritage value.(The Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association n.d) Since the campaign began to remove horses from there over 400 have been passively trapped, taken from the park, and 200 of these have been found a home elsewhere.The Land Magazine, p.3, 19 June 2008. The Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association (GFHHA) takes possession of horses passively removed from the GFRNP and offer them for sale to the public, they also manage the horses to maintain their inherent characteristics and to preserve the unique genetics of these wild horses. A formal register and Stud Book has been established for these purposes. The GFHHA also actively promotes the GF horse versatility by sponsoring classes held at local Ag Shows and encouraging horse owners to participate in all disciplines.
In the 1970s the Bicentennial National Trail was plotted to run along the western side of Guy Fawkes River on what is a travelling stock route.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/archive/RedIndex/NSW/guy2.htm |title=Guy Fawkes |work=NSW Wilderness Index |publisher=The Colong Foundation for Wilderness Ltd |date=September 1999 |accessdate=8 December 2008 [/tpl]
