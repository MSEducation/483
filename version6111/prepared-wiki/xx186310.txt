[[CNTRL]]

Centriolin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CNTRL gene. It was previously known as CEP110.[tpl]cite journal | author = Guasch G, Mack GJ, Popovici C, Dastugue N, Birnbaum D, Rattner JB, Pebusque MJ | title = FGFR1 is fused to the centrosome-associated protein CEP110 in the 8p12 stem cell myeloproliferative disorder with t(8;9)(p12;q33) | journal = Blood | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 1788â€“96 |date=Mar 2000 | pmid = 10688839 | pmc =  | doi =  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CEP110 centrosomal protein 110kDa| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11064| accessdate = [/tpl]
This gene encodes a centrosomal protein required for the centrosome to function as a microtubule organizing center. The gene product is also associated with centrosome maturation. One version of stem cell myeloproliferative disorder is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 9, with the breakpoint associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and centriolin.
