Foreign Languages Press is a publishing house located in the People's Republic of China.
Based in Beijing, the organisation was founded in 1952.  It currently forms part of the China Foreign Languages Publication and Distribution Administration, and is closely associated with the Government of China.
The press publishes books on a wide range of topics in eighteen languages spoken primarily outside China.  Much of its output is aimed at the international community - its 1960s editions of works by Marx and Lenin are still widely circulated - but it also publishes some material aimed at foreign language students within China.
As of 2008, the house had published over 30,000 titles in a total of 43 languages.
