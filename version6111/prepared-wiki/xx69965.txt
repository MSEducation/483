[[Blood test]]

CATEGORIES: Blood tests

A blood test, also known as bloodwork, is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a needle, or via fingerprick.  Blood tests[tpl]cite web|title=Blood Panel|url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/blood-panel/|accessdate=2013-10-28[/tpl]  (also referred to as blood work) are used to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, drug effectiveness, and organ function. They are also used in drug tests.

==Extraction==

Venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Since blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium for providing oxygen and nutrients, and drawing waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003423.htm | title=Venipuncture - the extraction of blood using a needle and syringe | accessdate=June 21, 2012[/tpl]
If only a few drops of blood are needed, a fingerstick is performed instead of drawing blood from a vein.[tpl]cite journal |author=MacLennan CA, van Oosterhout JJ, White SA, Drayson MT, Zijlstra EE, Molyneux ME |title=Finger-prick blood samples can be used interchangeably with venous samples for CD4 cell counting indicating their potential for use in CD4 rapid tests |journal=AIDS (London, England) |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1643–5 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17630562 |pmc=2408852 |doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32823bcb03 |url=[/tpl]
Phlebotomists, laboratory practitioners and nurses are those charged with patient blood extraction. However, in special circumstances, and emergency situations, paramedics and physicians sometimes extract blood. Also, respiratory therapists are trained to extract arterial blood to examine arterial blood gases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Aaron SD, Vandemheen KL, Naftel SA, Lewis MJ, Rodger MA |title=Topical tetracaine prior to arterial puncture: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial |journal=Respir Med. |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=1195–1199 |year=2003 |pmid=14635973  |doi=10.1016/S0954-6111(03)00226-9[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/careers/0,1607,7-170-46398-64537--,00.html |title=Michigan careers |publisher=Michigan.gov |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2011-08-09[/tpl]

==Types of blood tests==

===Biochemical analysis===

A basic metabolic panel measures sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), magnesium, creatinine, glucose, and sometimes includes calcium.  Blood tests focusing on cholesterol levels can determine LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, as well as triglyceride levels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ldlhdlcholesterollevels.org/|title=Cholesterol Levels|last=Belargo|first=Kevin|publisher=Manic EP|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl]
Some blood tests, such as those that measure glucose or a lipid profile, require fasting (or no food consumption) eight to twelve hours prior to the drawing of the blood sample.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1018.aspx?CategoryID=69&SubCategoryID=693 | title=Fasting blood samples | publisher=NHS UK | accessdate=June 21, 2012[/tpl]
For the majority of blood tests, blood is usually obtained from the patient's vein. However, other specialized blood tests, such as the arterial blood gas, require blood extracted from an artery. Blood gas analysis of arterial blood is primarily used to monitor carbon dioxide and oxygen levels related to pulmonary function, but it is also used to measure blood pH and bicarbonate levels for certain metabolic conditions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-gases-test/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Blood gases | publisher=NHS UK | accessdate=June 21, 2012[/tpl]
While the regular glucose test is taken at a certain point in time, the glucose tolerance test involves repeated testing to determine the rate at which glucose is processed by the body.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003466.htm | title=Glucose tolerance test | publisher=Medline | accessdate=June 21, 2012[/tpl]

====Normal ranges====

Blood tests results should always be interpreted using the ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the test. Example ranges are shown below:
