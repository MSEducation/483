The 'Order' of Ethiopia lamaTopiya was an African religious group from the Methodists Church who originates from the  Ethiopian movement started by 18th century African Theologians such as Revds. Tiyo Soga,Nehemiah Tile,Mzimba,Mangena Mokoena,Mata Dwane and others. After trying to associate themselves with the African Methodist Episcopal AMEChurch in search of establishing an authentic African Church, they ended up forming relations with the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, It was founded and initially led by James Mata Dwane. James Mata Dwane left the A.M.E church as he did not feel his episcopal status was valid, and thus along with the likes of m. mpumlwane and nehemiya tile left the church. They sought talks with the Church of the Province and in 1900 a compact was signed by the seven bishops of the province to be in communion with the Ethiopian church. This involved a decision to consecrate bishops, priest and deacons for the Order. James Mata Dwane was made a deaconin 1900,ordained as a Priest in 1911 and he died in 1916 as a Provincial of the Order of Ethiopia a Presidential title equal to that of an Anglican Bishop.

==The end of the Order of Ethiopia==

In July 1999 the Provincial Synod of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa the Anglicans were petitioned by Bishop Sigqibo Dwane who became the first Bishop of the Order of Ethiopian to rescind its Canon 48, which dealt with the relations between the CPSA and the Order of Ethiopia. The former Order of Ethiopia then decided, on August 27, 1999, to change its name to the Ethiopian Episcopal Church, and declared that the Ethiopian Episcopal Church was the successor in title to the Ibandla laseTiyopia / Order of Ethiopia.
