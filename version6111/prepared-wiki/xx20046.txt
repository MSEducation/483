Takoma Park is a city in Montgomery County, Maryland. It is a suburb of Washington, D.C., and part of the Washington metropolitan area. Founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1890, Takoma Park, informally called "Azalea City," is a Tree City USA and a nuclear-free zone. A planned commuter suburb, it is situated along the Metropolitan Branch of the historic Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, just northeast of Washington, D.C. and it borders the neighborhood of Takoma, Washington, D.C.. It is governed by an elected mayor and six elected councilmembers, who form the city council, and an appointed city manager, under a council-manager style of government. The city's population was 16,715 at the 2010 national census.
Residents of Takoma Park can vote in municipal elections when they turn sixteen. It is the first city in the United States to extend voting rights to 16 and 17 year olds in general elections.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/takoma-park-16-year-old-savors-his-history-making-moment-at-the-polls/2013/11/03/89f00962-425c-11e3-b028-de922d7a3f47_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Annys | last=Shin | title=Takoma Park 16-year-old savors his history-making moment at the polls | date=November 4, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Takoma Park was founded by Benjamin Franklin Gilbert in 1883.[tpl]cite book |title= Proctor's Washington and Environs |first= John Claggett |last= Proctor |publisher= John Clagett Proctor, LL.D. |year= 1949 |page= 331 [/tpl] It was one of the first planned Victorian commuter suburbs,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] centered on the B&O railroad station in Takoma, D.C., and bore aspects of a spa and trolley park.
Gilbert's first purchase of land was in the spring of 1884 when he bought the [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] Grammar farm, which was known as Robert's Choice. This plot of land was located on both sides of the railroad station, roughly bounded by today's Sixth Street on the west, Aspen Street on the south, Willow Avenue on the east, and Takoma Avenue on the north. At its founding, lots were sold for $327 to $653 per acre.[tpl]cite news |title= New Towns in Montgomery |date= August 23, 1888 |work= The Baltimore Sun |url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpbaltimoresun/docview/535089946/136F0F4568E535F7294/6?accountid=46320 [/tpl]
Gilbert purchased another plot of land in 1886. The land was roughly bounded by Caroll Avenue to the Big Spring (now Takoma Junction) and what is now Woodland Avenue. Gilbert named this land New Takoma. Gilbert later purchased the Jones farm and the Naughton farm, which together he named North Takoma.
Gilbert hired contractor Fred E. Dudley to build many of the homes in Takoma Park. One of the homes built by Dudley was the home of Cady Lee, which still stands today at Piney Branch Road and Eastern Avenue. Dudley's son Wentworth was the first child born in Takoma Park. 
By 1888, there were 75 houses built in the community, and the number increased to 235 homes by 1889. The deed of each of the original houses prohibited alcohol from being made or sold on the property,[tpl]cite book |title= Proctor's Washington and Environs |first= John Claggett |last= Proctor |publisher= John Clagett Proctor, LL.D. |year= 1949 |page= 335 [/tpl] a prohibition that continued in the city until 1983.[tpl]cite news |title= Takoma Park Boasts Fast-Growing Values: From 'Tacky Park' to 'Chevy Chase East' |first= Sari |last= Horwitz |work= The Washington Post |date= November 22, 1986 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/138891796/136F19D3A16728B09AA/9?accountid=46320 [/tpl] Takoma Park incorporated as a town on April 3, 1890.[tpl]cite news |title= Takoma Park to Rally Round the Oak Leaf |last= Kaiman |first= Beth |work= The Washington Post |date= June 29, 1989 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/139976356/136F192CA6A48F35AED/28?accountid=46320 [/tpl]
Many of the streets were originally known as avenues. When the Commissioners of the District of Columbia mandated a District-wide street-naming system, those on the District side were renamed streets but retained their names otherwise. Other streets in Takoma D.C. were renamed entirely. Susquehanna Avenue became Whittier Street. Tahoe Street was renamed Aspen Street. Umatilla Street became Aspen Street. Vermilion Street became Cedar Street. Wabash Street was renamed Dahlia Street. Aspin became Elder Street. Magnolia Street became Eastern Avenue.[tpl]cite book |last= Baist |first= G.

In 1904, the Seventh-day Adventist Church purchased five acres of land in Takoma Park along Carroll Avenue, Laurel Avenue, and Willow Avenue.[tpl]cite news |title= Seventh Day Adventists: Colonizing Largely in Takoma Park, Montgomery County |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= May 15, 1904 |page= 11 |url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpbaltimoresun/docview/536847192/136F10385D32A40B111/1?accountid=46320 [/tpl] The land was located on both sides of the Maryland-District of Columbia border. The land was intended for a church, office building, printer, and residences for prominent members of the church. In 1903, the Seventh-day Adventist Church decided to move their headquarters to the Washington area after its headquarters' publishing house in Battle Creek, Michigan, had burned to the ground.[tpl]cite news |title= Deem Fire a Blessing: Why Seventh-day Adventists Moved to Washington |work= The Washington Post |date= May 9, 1904 |page= 10 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/144498698/136F1788AEE3DD4AC70/4?accountid=46320 [/tpl] The church decided that moving to a more urban setting would be a more appropriate place from which to increase the church's presence in the southern states.[tpl]cite news |title= Work of Adventists: Denomination Makes Washington Its Headquarters |date= September 10, 1905 |work= The Washington Post |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/144552432/136F1855FC748F35AED/13?accountid=46320 [/tpl] The church purchased fifty acres of land along Sligo Creek in Takoma Park to build the new headquarters.[tpl]cite news |title= Home for Adventists: Church Executives Perfecting Plans to Build Here |work= The Washington Post |date= October 8, 1903 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/144391958/136F1788AEE3DD4AC70/1?accountid=46320 [/tpl] The land was away from downtown Washington and had clean water available from a natural spring located at present-day Spring Park.[tpl]cite news |title= Adventists' Move Marks End of Era: Takoma Park Losing 80-Year Neighbor |last= Pressley |first= Sue Anne |work= The Washington Post |page= C7 |date= May 5, 1989 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/140016506/136F192CA6A48F35AED/23?accountid=46320 [/tpl] For many decades Takoma Park served as the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church,[tpl]cite news |title=Seventh-Day Adventists Reeling From Financial, Theological Crises |first=Marjorie |last=Hyer |work=The Washington Post |publisher=Toledo Blade, via Google News |date=August 29, 1981 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VicxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6786,4993830&dq=takoma+seventh-day-adventist+headquarters&hl=en [/tpl] until it moved to northern Silver Spring in 1989.
In 1964, an inside-the-Capital-Beltway extension of Interstate 70S, also known as the North Central Freeway, was proposed via a route known as "Option #11 Railroad Sligo East," up to 1/4 mile parallel to the B&O railroad upon a swath of land displacing 471 houses, that would have cut the city in two. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the future Mayor and civil rights activist Sam Abbott led a campaign to halt freeway construction and replace it with a Metrorail line to the site of the former train station, and worked with other neighborhood groups to halt plans for a wider system of freeways going into and out of DC.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
This controversy also raised the profile of Takoma Park at a time in the late 1960s and 1970s when it was becoming noted regionally and nationally for political activism outside the Nation's capital, with newspaper commentators describing it as "The People's Republic of Takoma Park" or "The Berkeley of the East".[tpl]Cite web|author=DCist.com|url=http://dcist.com/2007/07/24/takoma_park_vot.php|title=Takoma Park Votes to Impeach President Bush|quote=Commonly referred to as 'The People's Republic of Takoma Park' or 'The Berkeley of the East'[/tpl]
Also dividing the community is the boundary line of the District of Columbia, which contains part of the original Gilbert tract. This area is now known as Takoma, D.C. While politically separate from Takoma Park, Maryland, it shares its history and much of its culture.
Much of the old town Takoma Park was incorporated into the Takoma Park Historic District; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
Before 1995, the eastern boundary of the city of Takoma Park was in Prince George's County, Maryland, causing the community to be divided across two counties and the Maryland/D.C. line (where the original downtown area is located). For several years, Takoma Park lobbied the State of Maryland for legislation allowing county boundaries to be adjusted. The State finally agreed to this change, with the stipulation that cross-county municipalities would no longer be allowed; the new municipal boundary would forever remain within the county of its choosing. In August 1995, after passage of the law, the city held a public referendum asking registered voters living in three Prince George's County neighborhoods north of New Hampshire Avenue whether they wanted to be annexed to the city of Takoma Park. There was a majority of votes, 211 out of 304, in favor of annexation to the city.[tpl]Cite news|title=Casting Their Lots With Takoma Park: Three P.G. Neighborhoods Vote 211 to 93 to Join City  |work=Washington Post |first=David |last=Montgomery |date=August 23, 1995 [/tpl]
In November 1995, the State-sponsored referendum was held asking whether the portions of the city in Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County, or vice versa. The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of the entire city in Montgomery County.[tpl]Cite news|title=In a Montgomery State of Mind, Takoma Park Votes to Unify |work=Washington Post |first=David |last=Montgomery |date=November 8, 1995 [/tpl] Following subsequent approval by both counties' councils and the Maryland General Assembly, the county line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 1, 1997.[tpl]Cite web|title= Substantial Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970-Present|url= http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html|publisher=Census Bureau |accessdate=8 August 2009[/tpl] This process became known as Unification (see the Takoma Voice's 10-year retrospective on Unification).
The city has experienced substantial gentrification in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), with many group houses containing accessory apartments being converted back into single-family homes. This process was encouraged by an M-NCPPC "phase back", effectively eliminating scattered-site multifamily housing and implementing single-use zoning citywide, which prompted calls by some residentscf. Dan Robinson, City councilmember, et al. for the city to have its own planning authority. The majority of the city's population remain tenants, many of whom live in a cluster of high-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings surrounding Sligo Creek, which cuts a deep valley through the community.

==Geography==

Takoma Park sits on the edge of the Mid-Atlantic fall line and is thus quite hilly, with many narrow, gridded streets.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|2.09|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|2.08|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] Sligo Creek and Long Branch (both tributaries of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River) flow through the area. Sligo Creek Park and the [tpl]convert|9|mi|adj=on|0[/tpl] Sligo Creek Trail bisect the area. The main street, Carroll Avenue, and the main state highway, Route 410/East West Highway, narrow to two lanes within city limits. Takoma Park has an extensive hardwood tree canopy which is protected by local ordinance.
Takoma Park is bounded by downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, a major urban center to the northwest, by Montgomery College campus; East Silver Spring, a community of houses, apartments and small shops, along Flower Avenue and Piney Branch Road, to the north; Langley Park, Maryland, a community of apartments and shopping centers, along University Boulevard to the northeast; Chillum, Maryland, in Prince George's County to the southeast, bounded by New Hampshire Avenue, a state highway; and Takoma, Washington, D.C. to the southwest, separated by Eastern Avenue, which follows the District of Columbia line.
The corner of Eastern and Carroll Avenues roughly marks the center of the old commercial district. Other town centers include: "Takoma Junction", the corner of Carroll Avenue and Route 410 in the geographic center of town, home to the city's large food co-op; Takoma-Langley Crossroads in downtown Langley Park, and the Flower shopping district, both of which are home to many immigrant-owned establishments. Takoma Park's municipal center is located at the corner of Maple Avenue and Route 410. Washington Adventist University marks the corner of Carroll and Flower Avenues.

In 2010, the Seventh-Day Adventist Church received authorization to relocate the regional Washington Adventist Hospital from the center of town to an outlying area of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, alongside its international headquarters and the Adventist Book and Health Food Store, which had also been located within city limits. This had followed an effort by county officials to close or relocate the city's fire station, located on the side of a steep hill. Due to resulting controversy, the City Council lobbied to retain the old Hospital facility as a "health campus." The hospital had been in operation for over a century,[tpl]When|date=September 2010[/tpl] having been founded as the Washington Sanitarium overlooking Sligo Creek, shortly after the church's relocation from Battle Creek, Michigan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Officials also successfully lobbied to retain a university located on the same campus, which has been renamed Washington Adventist University.
In the 1970s, the city experienced controversy over plans to expand or relocate Montgomery College, which has a campus located in the historic district of North Takoma, an area of large old homes adjacent to downtown Silver Spring. This debate was subsequently resolved when the County agreed to preserve the existing campus, and expand in the direction of downtown Silver Spring by building a bridge across the B&O railroad tracks. It was renamed the "Takoma Park-Silver Spring Campus," focused on health, nursing and the arts. The expanded campus included a major new arts center located in South Silver Spring, near the boundary between the three jurisdictions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]  The Washington Adventist Hospital will be moving to an alternate location within the next five years.

==Law and government==

Takoma Park's electorate and its elected officials are known for their liberal and left-of-liberal values, which have led to the enactment of several municipal laws.  For instance, Takoma Park allows non-U.S.-citizen residents to vote in its own municipal elections, and has lowered their voting age to 16.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/16-year-olds-able-to-vote-_n_3276520.html | work=Huffington Post | title=16-Year-Olds Able To Vote In Takoma Park, Md. | date=2013-05-14 | accessdate=2013-05-16[/tpl] The city was also forbidden, by statute, from doing business with any entity having commercial ties with the government of Burma (Myanmar),http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/code/Takoma_Park_Municipal_Code/Title_9/08/index.html [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl] though after a United States Supreme Court decision struck down a similar Massachusetts provision, enforcement of the provision was suspended in the year 2000.

Takoma Park is noted for being a "Nuclear Free Zone" along with cities including Berkeley, California; Cleveland Heights, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; and Homer, Alaska. It has an active Nuclear Free Zone Committee that advocates for nuclear disarmament and is entrusted with making purchasing recommendations to the city. Employees are forbidden from purchasing from companies involved in the production of nuclear weapons or their components. Contractors working for the city must also sign a notarized document that they are not "engaged in the development, research, production, maintenance, storage, transportation and/or disposal of nuclear weapons or their components."Takoma Park Nuclear Free Zone Act Waivers have been given in the past, including a waiver to purchase a library system from Userful corporation that includes computers made by Hewlett-Packard, a company that has also worked on nuclear weapons programs for the United States government.[tpl]cite news |title= Takoma Park Grants Waiver to 'Nuclear-free Zone' Ordinance |first= Victor |last= Zapana |date= June 19, 2012 |work= The Washington Post |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/takoma-park-grants-waiver-to-nuclear-free-zone-ordinance/2012/06/19/gJQADMB2oV_story.html [/tpl] 
Because Takoma Park is a certified Tree City, its residents must obtain a permit from the City arborist to cut down any tree on their property measuring more than 8 inches in diameter. This has contributed to the preservation of second-growth hardwood forest which covers much of the city, as is visible in satellite photos.
Takoma Park is chartered with its own police force, public works department, housing department, and recreation department. It has also historically maintained its own Volunteer Fire Department and Municipal Library. Until 2007, the city operated a Tool Library as well, and continues to operate its own compost recycling program and silo for corn-burning stoves. As one of the most urbanized areas outside Washington, D.C., Takoma Park is densely developed with narrow houses on deep lots, often featuring mid-block developments and a mix of apartments and homes which are no longer permitted under regional suburban zoning laws, under which many apartments were de-zoned in 1989. Development and reconstruction of the fire station and other public facilities have been highly controversial,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] with some advocating that facilities be closed and moved to outlying, automobile-friendly areas.

===Voting===

In the 2005 election, an advisory referendum on the institution of Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) for municipal elections passed with 84% approval.17 In 2006, the City Council amended the City Charter to incorporate IRV.

==Transportation==

Takoma Park's Metrorail station sits in the heart of the old downtown area, at the terminus of Carroll Street NW, main street of the Old Takoma area (continuing as Carroll Avenue in Maryland) on the D.C. side two blocks from the Maryland line.  The Takoma Metro station is noted for having one of the highest pedestrian mode shares of any non-central business district station in the Washington Metrorail system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] 
New Hampshire Avenue is the only six-lane thoroughfare running through city limits, continuing into central Washington, D.C. and primarily serving through-traffic to the east of the city. Other major roads narrow to two lanes within city limits, including Route 410/East West Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and Piney Branch Road, which was narrowed from four lanes to two within city limits as a result of a traffic calming measure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The primary route into D.C. is Georgia Avenue, the main turnpike through downtown Silver Spring, and Blair Road, a two-lane road (formerly part of the Montgomery Blair estate) which becomes North Capitol Street, a six-lane boulevard to the south. University Boulevard, the major suburban shopping strip, skirts the area to the northeast. Carroll Avenue ends two miles short of the Washington Beltway/I-95 interchange.
While the [tpl]convert|9|mi|adj=on|0[/tpl] Sligo Creek Trail is primarily used for recreation by bicyclists and pedestrians, the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is sponsoring efforts to construct the Metropolitan Branch Trail, a rail trail in D.C. parallel to the Red Line, to connect Washington Union Station to Silver Spring and Bethesda, Maryland by way of the [tpl]convert|12|mi|adj=on|0[/tpl] Capital Crescent Trail for bicycle commuting purposes.
