==History==

Organized education in Silver Creek dates back to 1823. Classes were held in one-room schoolhouses and other locations until a two-story schoolhouse was constructed in the early 1860s. That building was replaced in 1879 and the first graduation took place in 1882. A separate grade school building was constructed in 1897, followed by a junior-senior high school building in 1920. These buildings are known as the Babcock Avenue School (converted into apartments in the 1980s) and the Main Street School. The school district was centralized in 1956 and the current high school building on Dickinson Street began construction in 1958.

==Campus==

The Silver Creek Central School campus contains the elementary, middle, and high schools. As of 2009, the school is undergoing approximately $9 million in construction, including renovation and upgrades to the air conditioning and electrical systems.[tpl]cite news |first=Susan |last=Chiappone |title=Silver Creek plans hurtle forward |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/cityregion/otherwny/story/741908.html |work=Buffalo News |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2010-01-11 [/tpl]
