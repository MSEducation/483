==Name and Aboriginal heritage==

The name Garigal is taken from the clan of the Ku-ring-gai aboriginal tribe that had lived in that area in times past.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19911115005 |title=Nattai National Park Bill |author=Moore, Tim J. |authorlink=Tim Moore (Australian politician) |work=Hansard |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |date=15 November 1991 |accessdate=7 September 2012 [/tpl]
