[[Chirp]]

CATEGORIES: Signal processing, Test items

A chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases ('up-chirp') or decreases ('down-chirp') with time. In some sources, the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal.Weisstein, Eric W. "Sweep Signal." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SweepSignal.html It has also been called quadratic-phase signal.http://books.google.com.br/books?id=QuIHjnXQqM8C&lpg=PA703&dq=chirp%20quadratic%20phase&pg=PA703#v=onepage&q&f=false It is commonly used in sonar and radar, but has other applications, such as in spread spectrum communications.  In spread spectrum usage, SAW devices such as RACs are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals. In optics, ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates. The name is a reference to chirping in analogy to the sound made by some birds, see bird vocalization.

==Types of chirp==

===Linear chirp===

For the linear chirp, this results in:
The corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal linear chirp is the sine of the phase in radians:

===Exponential chirp===

In an exponential chirp, the frequency of the signal varies exponentially as a function of time:
Unlike the linear chirp, which has a constant chirp rate, an exponential chirp has an exponentially increasing chirp rate.
The corresponding time-domain function for the phase of an exponential chirp is the integral of the frequency:
The corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal exponential chirp is the sine of the phase in radians:

==Generation of a chirp signal==

A chirp signal can be generated with analog circuitry via a VCO, and a linearly or exponentially ramping control voltage.  It can also be generated digitally by a DSP and DAC, using a Direct digital synthesizer (DDS) and by varying the step in the numerically controlled oscillator. It can also be generated by a YIG oscillator.

==Relation to an impulse signal==

A chirp signal shares the same spectral content with an impulse signal. However, unlike in the impulse signal, spectral components of the chirp signal have different phases.http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ap_chirp.php Dispersion of a signal propagation medium may result in unintentional conversion of impulse signals into chirps. On the other hand, many practical applications, such as chirped pulse amplifiers or echolocation systems,http://www.dspguide.com/ch11/6.htm use chirp signals instead of impulses because of their inherently lower PAPR.

==Uses and occurrences==

===Chirp modulation===

Chirp modulation, or linear frequency modulation for digital communication was patented by Sidney Darlington in 1954 with significant later work performed by Winkler in 1962. This type of modulation employs sinusoidal waveforms whose instantaneous frequency increases or decreases linearly over time. These waveforms are commonly referred to as linear chirps or simply chirps.
Hence the rate at which their frequency changes is called the chirp rate. In binary chirp modulation, binary data is transmitted by mapping the bits into chirps of opposite chirp rates. For instance, over one bit period "1" is assigned a chirp with positive rate a and "0" a chirp with negative rate âˆ’a. Chirps have been heavily used in radar applications and as a result advanced sources for transmission and matched filters for reception of linear chirps are available.

===Chirplet transform===

Another kind of chirp is the projective chirp, of the form:
having the three parameters a (scale), b (translation), and c (chirpiness).  The projective chirp is ideally suited to image processing, and forms the basis for the projective chirplet transform.[ref]Mann, Steve and Haykin, Simon;  The Chirplet Transform: A Generalization of
            Gabor's Logon Transform; Vision Interface '91.[http://wearcam.org/chirplet/vi91scans/index.htm]</ref>

===Key chirp===

A change in frequency of Morse code from the desired frequency, due to poor stability in the RF Oscillator is known as chirp,The Beginner's Handbook of Amateur Radio By Clay Laster and in the RST code is given an appended letter 'C'.
