the company as Cenergie Plc and provided shares for all but a few of
the 500 ZeTek shareholders. Following a series of cyber and other
commercially driven attacks, Abson resigned.
Abson continues work on fuel-cell development by publishing papers and
working pro-bono for a number of organisations and universities.
Citing his experiences with Cenergie, he now writes and campaigns for
greater scrutiny of UK money-laundering activities and industrial
espionage. His first political philosophy, titled “Factions and
Pyramids” is set to be released in 2012.

===Music===

In 1970, Abson returned to Britain and launched Freerange Sound
Studios using funds earned from documentaries “The Stonemen” and “The
Earthmovers”, which document St. Paul Cathedral’s masons and the
reclamation of Britain’s largest coal tip (respectively).
Abson went on to make many music concert films during the 1970s,
starting with Dr. Feelgood's’s “Going Back Home” and ending with the
Ramones' “New Year’s Concert”. He pioneered music videos with artists
such as Stevie Wonder, Kate Bush, The Damned, Queen and Lena Lovitch
while Covent Garden’s Freerange recorded Gary Numan, The Sex Pistols,
Patti Smith and The Slits, supporting musicians by subsidizing them
with film profits.
In 1979, he closed Freerange to pursue careers outside of the music
industry after his longtime business partner, Neville Wills (age 36)
died.

“The Haley Comet Show” and “Real World”. Between 1980 and 1990, he
directed more than 2,000 network shows.
