[[Molar concentration]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical properties

The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution.

==Notation==

==Units==

The SI unit is mol/m3. However, more commonly the unit mol/L is used.
A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as "1 molar" (1 M).
An SI prefix is often used to denote concentrations. Commonly used units are listed in the table hereafter:

===Number concentration===

===Mass concentration===

===Mole fraction===

A simpler relation can be obtained by considering the total molar concentration namely the sum of molar concentrations of all the components of the mixture.

===Mass fraction===

===Molality===

The conversion to molality (for binary mixtures) is:
where the solute is assigned the subscript 2.
For solutions with more than one solute, the conversion is:

===Sum of molar concentrations – normalizing relation===

The sum of molar concentrations gives the total molar concentration, namely the density of the mixture divided by the molar mass of the mixture or by another name the reciprocal of the molar volume of the mixture. In an ionic solution ionic strength is proportional to the sum of molar concentration of salts.

===Sum of products molar concentrations-partial molar volumes===

The sum of products between these quantities equals one.

===Dependence on volume===

Molar concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature the dependence is :

==Spatial variation and diffusion==

Molar and mass concentration have different values in space where diffusion happens.

==Examples==

The density of such a solution is 1.07 g/mL, thus its volume will be:
The molar concentration of NaCl in the solution is therefore:
Here, 58 g/mol is the molar mass of NaCl.
Example 2: Another typical task in chemistry is the preparation of 100 mL (= 0.1 L) of a 2 mol/L solution of NaCl in water. The mass of salt needed is:
To create the solution, 11.6 g NaCl are placed in a volumetric flask, dissolved in some water, then followed by the addition of more water until the total volume reaches 100 mL.
Example 3: The density of water is approximately 1000 g/L and its molar mass is 18.02 g/mol (or 1/18.02=0.055 mol/g).  Therefore, the molar concentration of water is:
Likewise, the concentration of solid hydrogen (molar mass = 2.02 g/mol) is:
The concentration of pure osmium tetroxide (molar mass = 254.23 g/mol) is:
The molar concentration is:
