Keith Douglas Scott (born July 20, 1954) is a Canadian guitar player. He is best known for his long-term collaboration with the singer-songwriter Bryan Adams. He has also worked with Cher, Tina Turner, Bryan Ferry, Tom Cochrane, Craig Northey and other musicians.

==Background==

Scott was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his father played jazz piano and his mother sang occasionally. His own introduction to music was playing flute in a school orchestra: anecdotally, it said that he chose the flute because he lived quite far away from the school and did not want to drag a large instrument case around with him. While still at school, he learned how to play the acoustic guitar and, by the time he was 17, he had acquired a used 1960s Fender Stratocaster, which was to become a trademark instrument. Many of his musical influences are also associated with this instrument: Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, for example. During his career, he has used other instruments and recently the Gretsch company produced a "Keith Scott Nashville Gold Top" signature guitar, to Scott's specifications[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harmony-central.com/Events/WNAMM99/Gretsch/Keith-Scott-Nashville.html|title=Gretsch Keith Scott Nashville Features Stunning Gold Top|date=Winter 1999|publisher=harmony-central.com|accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] as a thank you to Scott for using his orange Gretsch for the video for "Everything I Do".

==Early bands==

Scott formed a band with people he had met at school but quickly found work with better-known bands such as  "Bowser Moon", The Handley Page Group and Zingo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bryanadams.com/index.php?target=archive,band|title=Archive/Band Area|publisher=bryanadams.com|accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] playing about 300 shows a year in the then lucrative nightclub scene.

==Bryan Adams==

Scott was introduced to Adams in Ontario in the summer of 1976.  As the 1970s were coming to an end, he started doing some recording work for the then-unknown Bryan Adams. This proved successful and within a year Scott was touring with Adams. They have been together on stage ever since.
One part of Scott's live career which was particularly demanding was when Adams' band were touring as a 3 piece from 1998 to 2002. He performed all the rhythm and lead guitar work simultaneously, while Adams played bass and the third band member, Mickey Curry, played drums. In later years, however, the band developed into a 5-piece band, allowing Scott to play lead guitar while Adams plays rhythm. Adams' concerts often allow Scott to perform a "showcase song" to show off his lead guitar skills. Adams stands back and lets Scott go to town on an improvised solo, sometimes involving the use of microphone stands, beer bottles, or other items that can be applied to guitar strings. Examples are songs such as "It's Only Love" and "Touch The Hand". On very rare occasions, Scott has also performed his own songs at Adams' shows: for example, "You're The Reason I Wear Black", during their tour of Japan during the 1990s.
At the Juno Awards in 2006, Bryan Adams described Scott as his best friend.
Scott, along with Bryan Adams' drummer, Mickey Curry, and Mark Holden (the founding member of 1980s Canadian rock band Boulevard) created a band called 'The Fontanas.' The band has released a self-titled album.
