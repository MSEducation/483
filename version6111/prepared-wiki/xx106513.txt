==Plot==

When Bart and Lisa fight over what to watch on TV, they accidentally change the channel to a show hosted by a children's entertainer. This does not appeal to Bart and Lisa, but Maggie adores the show, and after Bart and Lisa accidentally say there is a CD so that they can get the TV back, Marge buys the disc and plays it everywhere, much to the annoyance of Bart, Lisa, and Homer. Marge goes as far as to even buy tickets to the concert, which is to be held at Cletus Spuckler's farm. However, because the concert was oversold, it ends up packed and is then cancelled due to rain. Soon, the babies riot, an event referred to in the news as the "Tot Offensive".
In a response to the disaster, all the adults of Springfield who do not have children (single people, the elderly, couples who do not have children, teenagers, and homosexuals) are up in arms, because Kabul has declared they will no longer be Springfield's sister city and Mayor Quimby forcibly takes $1 million from the audience to cover the damages. Lindsay Naegle arrives to form an anti-youth group named "Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays Against Parasitic Parents" (SSCCATAGAPP) to rid the town of anything that provides comfort to families. A statue to America's deadbeat dads is erected, a school bus ignores kids waiting at the stop to take senior citizens on a gambling junket, and a new ordinance allows children who act up in public to be tasered.
A furious Marge lobbies to get an initiative: "Families Come First", as she lobbies "Proud Parents Against Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays" (PPASSCCATAG). Her lobbying efforts do poorly at first, and she fends off a $50,000 offer from America's tobacco lobby, but fair support grows after Mr. Burns loans his signature on Marge's petition because he cares about children (specifically, their "supple young organs"). Other Springfield residents follow his lead (as Carl notes, "Rich guys always want what's best for everyone!"), and the proposition (Proposition 242) gets on the ballot. Homer tries to help with the campaign but screws up badly by placing the wrong information on bumper stickers and buttons for the voters, while his Rudy Giuliani-featuring advertisement is a disaster and the opposition slanders Marge with an ad where an actress posing as Marge says even she is against Prop 242. Bart and Lisa soon concoct a plan. When everyone goes to the voting polls, they are stopped in their tracks by the (literally) infectious hugs of children. Proposition 242 passes easily, and Homer decides to celebrate by dumping his kids at an R-rated movie with no supervision while he and Marge go some place nice by themselves.
