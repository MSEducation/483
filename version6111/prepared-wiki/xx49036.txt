Greyhound was a grey Standardbred gelding by Guy Abbey out of Elizabeth by Peter the Great. Born in 1932, Greyhound was the outstanding trotting horse of his day and arguably the most outstanding in the history of the sport. He was nicknamed "The Great Grey Ghost" and "Silver-skinned Flyer."
In 1935, he won the Hambletonian race and in 1938 he lowered the record time for trotting the mile to 1:55Â¼. This record stood until 1969. He trotted 25 two-minute miles and at one time held fourteen world records. He once raced in double harness, hitched to the great trotting mare Rosalind.  He was retired in 1940 to Red Gate Farm in St. Charles, Illinois. During his twenty years of retirement, Greyhound was immensely popular among horse enthusiasts around the country. As he aged, his coat whitened, and his owners painted his hooves red and draped garlands of roses over his back, a color combination that became iconic of the horse. Greyhound was so popular that his owner, Col. Edward J. Baker, allowed visitors to see the horse until February 1965 when he died at the age of 33.
Greyhound was honored as Horse of the Century after his death.
