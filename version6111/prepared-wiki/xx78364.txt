Komárom ([tpl]lang-sk|Komárno[/tpl], Croatian: Komoran, German: Komorn, Serbian: Коморан) is a city split between Hungary on the south bank of the Danube in Komárom-Esztergom county and Slovakia on the other.[ref]The fortress played an important role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and
many contemporary English sources refer to it as the Fortress of Comorn (e.g. [tpl]cite book|first1=George|last1=Ripley|first2=Charles|last2=Anderson|title=The New American Cyclopaedia|publisher=D.

The city of Komárom was formerly a separate suburban village called [tpl]lang|hu|Újszőny[/tpl]. In 1892 Komárom and Újszőny were connected with an iron bridge and in 1896 the two towns were united under the name Komárom. 
The center was split by the newly created border of Czechoslovakia in 1920 following the Treaty of Trianon in which Hungary lost 2/3 of its territory creating a sizeable Hungarian minority in Slovakia. The Czechoslovak (Slovak) part is now Komárno, Slovakia). 
Komárom and Komárno are connected by two bridges: The iron bridge and a newer lifting bridge. The two towns used to be a border crossing between Czechoslovakia (later Slovakia) and Hungary, until both countries became part of the Schengen Area, resulting in all immigration and customs checks to be lifted on December 12, 2007.
