[[File:Keith Emerson & Moog 15May10.jpg|thumb|"I took to riding the L100 like a bucking bronco. It weighs 350 lb; when it's on top of you, you need the adrenalin rush you get onstage to chuck it around." Keith Emerson]]
Booker T Jones is cited as being the bridge from rhythm and blues to rock. British organist James Taylor said the Hammond "became popular the UK when people such as Booker T & The MGs and artists on the Stax Records label came over to London and played gigs."[tpl]sfn|Vail|2002|p=21[/tpl] Matthew Fisher first encountered the Hammond in 1966 having heard the Small Faces' Ian McLagan playing one. When Fisher asked if he could play it, McLagan told him "They're yelling out for Hammond players; why don't you go out and buy one for yourself?"[tpl]sfn|Johansen|2001|p=65[/tpl] Fisher went on to play the organ lines on Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale, which topped the UK charts in the summer of 1967.[tpl]sfn|Johansen|2001|p=66[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Macan|1997|p=33[/tpl] Steve Winwood started his musical career with the Spencer Davis Group playing guitar and piano, but he switched to Hammond when he hired one to record "Gimme Some Lovin'".[tpl]sfn|Welch|1990|p=73[/tpl]
Gregg Allman became interested in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it.[tpl]sfn|Allman|2012|p=67-68[/tpl] His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band,[tpl]sfn|Allman|2012|p=97[/tpl] and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance.[tpl]sfn|Allman|2012|pages=100-101[/tpl] Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.[tpl]sfn|Moriarty|2003|p=44[/tpl]
Deep Purple's Jon Lord became inspired to play the Hammond after hearing Jimmy Smith's "Walk on the Wild Side".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/lord/jl19741000.html|title=Deep Purple's Jon Lord and 'Burn'|publisher=Circus Magazine|last=Cohen|first=Scott|pages=42–45|date=October 1974|accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl] He modified his Hammond so it could be played through a Marshall stack to get a growling, overdriven sound,[tpl]sfn|Till|2010|p=122[/tpl] which became known as his trademark and he is strongly identified with it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jonlord.org/a-biography/|title=Jon Lord - A Biography|publisher=Jon Lord (official site)|accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl] This organ was later acquired by Joey DeFrancesco.[tpl]sfn|Vail|2002|p=186[/tpl] Van der Graaf Generator's Hugh Banton modified his Hammond E-100 extensively with customised electronics, including the ability to put effects such as distortion on one manual but not the other, and rewiring the motor. The modifications created, in Banton's own words, "unimaginable sonic chaos."[tpl]sfn|Faragher|2011|p=369[/tpl]
The Hammond was a key instrument in progressive rock music. Author Edward Macan thinks this is because of its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a "tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound."[tpl]sfn|Macan|1997|p=34[/tpl] Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice, with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing it upside down, or riding it across stage in the manner of a horse. He continued to play the instrument in this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson, Lake and Palmer.[tpl]sfn|Cateforis|2011|p=158[/tpl] Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include the Zombies' and Argent's Rod Argent, Yes's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman, Focus's Thijs van Leer, Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley, Pink Floyd's Rick Wright, Kansas's Steve Walsh, and Genesis's Tony Banks. Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs.[tpl]sfn|Awde|2008|p=200[/tpl]
Ska and reggae music made frequent use of the Hammond throughout the 1960s and '70s. Junior Marvin started to play the instrument after hearing Booker T & The MGs' "Green Onions", although he complained about its weight.[tpl]sfn|Masouri|2010|p=71[/tpl] Winston Wright was regarded in the music scene of Jamaica as one of the best organ players, and used the Hammond when performing live with Toots and the Maytals, as well as playing it on sessions with Lee "Scratch" Perry, Jimmy Cliff and Gregory Isaacs.[tpl]sfn|Moskowitz|2006|p=320[/tpl] Tyrone Downie, best known as Bob Marley & The Wailers' keyboard player, made prominent use of the Hammond on "No Woman, No Cry", as recorded at the Lyceum Theatre, London, for the album Live![tpl]sfn|Masouri|2010|p=596[/tpl]
The Hammond organ was perceived as outdated by the late 1970s, particularly in the UK, where it was often used to perform pop songs in social clubs.[tpl]sfn|Fowles|Wade|2012|pages=165-166[/tpl] Punk and New Wave bands tended to prefer second-hand combo organs from the 1960s, or use no keyboards at all.[tpl]sfn|Cateforis|2011|p=104,160[/tpl] Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable synthesizers that were starting to come onto the market.[tpl]sfn|Fowles|Wade|2012|pages=136-137[/tpl] The Stranglers' Dave Greenfield was a notable exception to this, and used a Hammond onstage during the band's early career. Andy Thompson, better known for being an aficionado of the Mellotron, stated that "the Hammond never really went away. There are a lot of studios that have had a B-3 or C-3 sitting away in there since the 70s."[tpl]sfn|Awde|2008|p=531[/tpl] The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the mod revival movement. Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s, first with the Prisoners and later with the James Taylor Quartet.[tpl]sfn|Bogdanov|2001|p=507[/tpl] The sound of the Hammond made an appearance in hip-hop music, albeit mostly via samples. A notable exception was the Beastie Boys' "So What'cha Want", where it was mixed into the foreground.[tpl]sfn|Vail|2002|p=22[/tpl]
Jazz musicians continued to use Hammond organs into the 21st century. Barbara Dennerlein has received critical acclaim for her performances on the Hammond, particularly her use of the bass pedals,[tpl]sfn|Bogdanov|Voodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=325[/tpl] and has modified the instrument to include samplers triggered by the pedals.[tpl]sfn|Enstice|Stockhouse|2004|pp=96-110[/tpl] Joey DeFrancesco embraced the instrument during the 1990s, and later collaborated with Jimmy Smith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joey-defrancesco-mn0000209719/biography|title=Joey DeFrancesco: Artist Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl] He is positive about the future of the Hammond organ, saying "Everybody loves it. It makes you feel good... I think it's bigger now than ever."[tpl]sfn|Faragher|2012|p=248[/tpl]
