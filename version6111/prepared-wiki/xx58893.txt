==Governor of New Zealand==

In September 1855, he was appointed Governor of New Zealand, replacing temporary Administrator Robert Wynyard. His handling of Māori land issues were a contributing factor in the outbreak of the First Taranaki War: despite divisions among Waitara Maori over the ownership of land, Browne persisted with the purchase of the disputed Pekapeka block, further inflaming tensions between Maori and English settlers.[tpl]DNBSupp|wstitle=Browne, Thomas Gore |first=Ernest Marsh|last=Lloyd[/tpl]
