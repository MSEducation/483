Fifth and Columbia Tower is a 660ft (201m) tall skyscraper approved for construction in Seattle, Washington. It will consist of 43 floors and be completed in 2016. It was designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca and is being developed by Daniels Real Estate. When the building is completed it will be the fifth tallest building in Seattle, and the tallest building completed since 1990. To achieve LEED Gold standards it will have a system to capture rainwater for reuse, a [tpl]convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] "living wall" where plants grown in Columbia Street facade, and a rooftop solar energy equipment. Plans call for the building to be smallest at its base with each floor a different size. Shoring and excavation began in summer 2008 and was delayed due to economic conditions.  Construction will restart in fall 2013.
The tower will be built next to the former First Methodist Episcopal Church. Although the education wing was demolished to make room for the tower, the remainder of the former church building is being preserved and has since been re-purposed into the Daniels Recital Hall.
