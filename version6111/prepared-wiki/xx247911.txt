Dr. Abby Lindsey Marlatt (born 1916 in Kansas - died March 3, 2010 in Lexington, Kentucky) was an advocate of the civil rights movement.

==Civil rights movement==

Marlatt taught home economics at the University of Kentucky (UK) in Lexington, Kentucky for several years without incident.
The holder of a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, Marlatt joined the faculty as a professor of nutrition at UK in 1956. In the 1960s she encountered problems with the school's administration. After she became involved in the civil rights movement and began helping young people and other Lexington citizens desegregate public accommodations there, she was demoted from her position as Dean of the College of Home Economics in 1963 by UK head by Dr. Frank Graves Dickey. What specifically led to her being investigated were handbills encouraging citizens to dissent by avoiding signing up for the draft and not paying taxes.
A Unitarian, Marlatt was also a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E)and the ACLU. Because Marlatt, who hailed from an abolitionist background, was a tenured professor at UK, she was ultimately unable to be fired from her position as a faculty member, though in an oral interview she mentions being removed from teaching duties for a year. In 2001, Marlatt was recognized by the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights.
