The Novi engine was a dual overhead cam supercharged V8 engine used in the Indianapolis 500. It was designed by Bud Winfield and Leo Goossen and built by Fred Offenhauser.

==Early years==

The Novi was first used in 1941 under the "Winfield" name and produced over [tpl]convert|450|hp|abbr=on[/tpl], an amazing output for the time.http://www.studebaker-info.org/Indy/NOvi/novi1.html  It was fitted to a 1935 frame built for a Miller engine, but it was very difficult to handle.Andy Granatelli recounts the difficulties and fatalities involved with the Novi in Karl Ludvigsen's, Novi V-8:  Indy Cars 1941 through 1965.
After World War II, the Novi returned in 1946 with 510 horsepower (fitted in a more advanced Kurtis Kraft front-wheel-drive chassis) and performed beautifully, setting the track record and leading 44 laps in a car driven by Ralph Hepburn.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]  Drivers such as Paul Russo and Duke Nalon later drove cars powered by the engine at notable speeds, but were unable to win.  In 1949, Nalon's Novi was involved in a spectacular crash, where he hit the wall in Turn 3, rupturing the gasoline tank and creating a napalm-like 'wall of fire' most of the way through the turn.
The engine's crowd-pleasing 'shriek' was caused by its gear-driven centrifugal supercharger which turned at five (5.35) times the crankshaft speed, thus giving it a banshee-like scream at full power.[ref]Offenhauser
