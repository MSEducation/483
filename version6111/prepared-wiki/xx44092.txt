[[Illbient]]

CATEGORIES: Ambient music, Trip hop

Illbient is a term allegedly coined by DJ Olive to describe the iconoclastic[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2010[/tpl] music being produced by a community of artists based in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York in 1994.http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Olive  The word "Illbient" is a portmanteau of the hip hop slang term "ill" (a positive expression: bad meaning good) and "ambient". 
Psychedelic musician Helios Creed joked that "although Eno invented ambient music while ill in bed - 'illbient' is actually an extreme retro offshoot that demands that the listener produces a doctor's note before being allowed to purchase."
Though there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by interesting dub-wise layering of soundscapes, hip hop-influenced use of samples and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses all genres of world groove and electronic music.  Usually, but not always, illbient uses beats more than purely ambient music, and often illbient includes loops in the recordings.
Illbient was introduced to the public at large in 1996 through the Asphodel Records Incursions in Illbient compilation and a feature in The Wire magazine.  
According to DJ Spooky, DJ Olive started an event in Brooklyn called Lalalandia - that had nothing to do with illbient. DJ Spooky also claims to have invented the word "illbient" in relation to the multicultural digital arts scene in Manhattan.[tpl]cite web |url = http://thephoenix.com/boston/music/54467-beyond-illbient/ |title = Beyond illbient |last =  Garelick |first = Jon | date = January 14, 2008 |publisher = The Boston Phoenix |accessdate= February 4, 2013 [/tpl] To his credit, he released Necropolis, a mix CD in 1996 as a follow up to the 1995 Subharmonic release VALIS 1 CD that first pulled together many illbient associated artists. DJ Spooky wrote the liner notes to the VALIS release and recommended many of the artists that were included on the compilation. DJ Spooky strongly disagrees that DJ Olive coined the term illbient[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2011[/tpl]. The compilation that Asphodel put out took many of the same artists that DJ Spooky pulled together, and made a commercial release in October 1996.
DJ Spooky's events like Molecular at The Gas Station on Avenue B and Second street in Manhattan set the tone for the genre, and predated all of the Manhattan events around what later came to be called "illbient."
