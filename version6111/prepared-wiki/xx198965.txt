Cádiz Cathedral ([tpl]lang-es|Catedral de Cádiz, Catedral de Santa Cruz de Cádiz[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic church  in Cádiz, southern Spain, and the seat of the Diocese of Cadiz y Ceuta. It was built between 1722 and 1838. The cathedral was declared Bien de Interés Cultural in 1931.[tpl]Bien de Interés Cultural[/tpl]
The Plaza de la Catedral houses both the Cathedral and the Baroque Santiago church, built in 1635.
The church sits on the site of an older cathedral, completed in 1260, which burned down in 1596. The reconstruction, which was not started until 1776, was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero left the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was originally intended to be a baroque edifice, it contains rococo elements, and was finally completed in the neoclassical style. Its chapels have many paintings and relics from the old cathedral and monasteries from throughout Spain.
In the crypt are buried the composer Manuel de Falla and the poet and playwright José María Pemán, both born in Cádiz.
Poniente (or West) Tower, one of the towers of Cádiz Cathedral, is open to the public and shows panoramas of the city from on high.
