[[Father to a Sister of Thought]]

CATEGORIES: 1995 singles, Pavement songs

"Father to a Sister of Thought" is a song written by Stephen Malkmus of Pavement that appears on the band's third album, Wowee Zowee (1995). On June 20, 1995, the song was released as the second single from the album in 7" vinyl and CD-single formats; the track list is the same for both versions. Both B-sides are included amongst the bonus tracks on 2006's deluxe Sordid Sentinels Edition reissue of Wowee Zowee.
"Father to a Sister of Thought" is unique in that it is about as close to alt-country or jangly-guitar rock that Pavement ever got, due to its use of pedal steel guitar and mixolydian mode. For most of the song, the harmony is limited to four chords, but it ends with an unexpected blues-style riff.  The music video for "Father to a Sister of Thought" features the band playing together in front of a western themed props painted by Steve Keene, which were also used by the band on tour during the period.
