The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery is a museum in Carlisle, Cumbria in England. Opened by the Carlisle Corporation in 1893, the original building is a converted Jacobean mansion, with extensions added when it was converted.  At first the building contained the museum and also a library, an art school and a technical school.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=386607 | title=Tullie House and extensions: Detailed Record | work=Images of England | publisher=English Heritage | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-09-06 [/tpl]
The building, including the extensions, is a Grade I listed building.
The two schools were moved in the 1950s and the library in 1986. The museum expanded into the city Guildhall in 1980 and with new space available from 1986 it underwent an extensive redevelopment over 1989-90 and again in 2000-01.
The museum houses the Human History Collection, most notable for antiquities associated with Hadrian's Wall and the two Roman forts established in Carlisle, as well as a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Border Reivers. It also has large and eclectic collections of zoological, botanical and geological material, as well as fine and decorative arts collections.  Paintings in the collection include works by Burne-Jones, Stanley Spencer, Winifred Nicholson, Sheila Fell and Phil Morsman.
