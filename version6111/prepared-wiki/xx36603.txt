Retrieved 20 August 2013 The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.
Doctors was originally produced and broadcast in blocks of episodes, ranging from blocks of 40 to 130 episodes in the first three years."Doctors" (2000) - Episode list.

However, the series' audience has developed and increased, prompting the BBC to commission Doctors as a year-round continuing series. Currently, the show breaks in the summer for the Wimbledon Tennis matches held for two weeks, over Christmas and Easter period and for bank holidays.

==Location and setting==

Until mid-2004, Doctors was filmed at the BBC's Pebble Mill studios in Edgbaston, Birmingham.[tpl]cite web|last=Kempton |first= Martin |url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/rest%20of%20britain.htm#old bbc |title=The rest of Britain - today (more or less)|publisher=TV Studio History personal website[/tpl][tpl]Dubious|date=February 2012[/tpl] The show utilised space originally occupied by Pebble Mill at One (1973–1986) /Pebble Mill (1991–1996).Pebble Mill at One (TV Series 1973–1996) - IMDb[tpl]Dubious|date=February 2012[/tpl] As Studio A had been mothballed a year before production started, the existing building had to be utilised for the show. The Pebble Mill foyer was used as a street frontage and sets such as the police station and The Lether Bar used other areas of the studio complex alongside the Riverside surgery. Later in the storyline, The Best Practice was also introduced. Real houses were used for the homes of the staff and patients. After the closure of Pebble Mill, BBC Birmingham moved to a much smaller production base in Birmingham City Centre which had no studio space for the show. In light of this, the show moved to the new BBC Drama Village development in Selly Oak, Birmingham, with the transition between locations achieved on screen by an explosion destroying the Riverside practice in March 2005 for the fifth anniversary of the series and the surgery moving to a new specially constructed set, The Mill Health Centre, named after the series' original production home. Alongside the surgery, other regular locations include the police station, The Icon Bar and since 2008, The Campus Surgery, after a storyline saw the practice take over the surgery at the fictional University of Letherbridge.

==Storylines==

The show's storylines deal with the lives of staff and patients at the fictional Mill Health Centre and Campus Surgery.
