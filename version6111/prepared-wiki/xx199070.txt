==History==

The lands of Pardesiya were purchased in 1928 by Jean-Yona Fisher, but remained unused. In 1937, Avraham Tabib of the Yemenite olim organization asked its members to come to the land to build a village, promising cheap land.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pardesia.muni.il/history/history.asp|title=History of Pardesiya|publisher=Pardesiya Municipality|accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl] Twenty families came and in 1939 completed the construction. During World War II, the villagers found themselves unemployed and unable to pay taxes for their housing. The residents managed to settle the issue with the Jewish Agency for Israel and continued living in the village. After the war, a new neighborhood was built, as well as a ma'abara to absorb new immigrants. Pardesiya gained local council status in 1952.
