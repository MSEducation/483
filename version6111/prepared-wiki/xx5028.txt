==Career==

Like Martin Scorsese and James Cameron, among others, Sayles began his film career working with Roger Corman. In 1979, Sayles funded his first film, Return of the Secaucus 7, with $30,000 he had in the bank from writing scripts for Corman.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] He set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set it over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so that he could have his friends act in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim, and in November 1997, the National Film Preservation Board announced that Return of the Secaucus 7 would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.
In 1983, after the films Baby It's You (starring Rosanna Arquette) and Lianna (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a MacArthur Fellowship. He used the money to partially fund the fantasy The Brother from Another Planet,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954425,00.html | title=Blues for Black Actors | author=Richard Corliss | date=October 1, 1984 | publisher=Time | accessdate=August 13, 2010[/tpl] a film about a black, three-toed slave who escapes from another planet and finds himself at home among the people of Harlem.
In 1989, he created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show Shannon's Deal about a down-and-out Philadelphia lawyer played by Jamey Sheridan. Sayles received a 1990 Edgar Award for his teleplay for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being canceled in 1991.
Sayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts such as Piranha, Alligator, The Howling and The Challenge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Having collaborated with Joe Dante on Piranha and The Howling, Sayles acted in Dante's movie Matinee. In deciding whether to take a job, Sayles reports that he mostly is interested in whether there is the germ of an idea for a movie which he would want to watch.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Sayles gets the rest of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for Apollo 13, and Mimic.
One such genre script, called Night Skies, inspired what would eventually become the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] That film's director, Steven Spielberg, later commissioned Sayles to write the script for the fourth Jurassic Park film.
He has written and directed his own films, including Lone Star, Passion Fish, Eight Men Out, The Secret of Roan Inish, and Matewan. He serves on the advisory board for the Austin Film Society.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Maggie Renzi has been John Sayles' long time companion (and collaborator) though they haven't married. Maggie has produced most of his films since Lianna. They met as students at Williams College.
Sayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, and Gordon Clapp, each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films.
In early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name "Statement of Conscience" (along with Noam Chomsky, Steve Earle, Brian Eno, Jesse Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Bonnie Raitt, Oliver Stone, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and others) which opposed the invasion of Iraq.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
In February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an HBO series based on the early life of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The drama, tentatively titled Scar Tissue, centers on Kiedis's early years living in West Hollywood with his father. At that time, Kiedis's father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included The Who and Led Zeppelin) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.Sayles red hot for HBO's 'Scar' from Variety
In February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama Amigo, in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the Philippine–American War, with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and Garret Dillahunt.Joel Torre believes ‘Baryo’ may stir controversy from www.mb.com.ph
