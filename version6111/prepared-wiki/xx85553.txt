Craigievar Castle is a pinkish harled castle six miles (10 km) south of Alford, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It was the seat of Clan Sempill and the Forbes family resided here for 350 years until 1963, when the property was given to the National Trust for Scotland. The setting is among scenic rolling foothills of the Grampian Mountains. The contrast of its massive lower storey structure to the finely sculpted multiple turrets, gargoyles and high corbelling work create a classic fairytale appearance.
An excellent example of the original Scottish Baronial architecture, the great seven-storey castle was completed in 1626 by the Aberdonian merchant William Forbes, ancestor to the "Forbes-Sempill family" and brother of the Bishop of Aberdeen, Patrick of Corse.  Forbes purchased the partially completed structure from the impoverished Mortimer family in the year 1610. Forbes' nickname was Danzig Willy, a reference to his shrewd international trading success with the Baltic states.
William's son was became a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles I and this title remains with the Forbes family today .  The Forbes Baronecy, of Craigievar in the County of Aberdeen, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 April 1630 for William Forbes.Forbes baronets#Forbes, of Craigievar (1630) He was also a descendant of Hon. Patrick Forbes, third son of the second Lord Forbes, and the nephew of the first Baronet of the 1628 creation. The fourth Baronet represented Aberdeenshire in the House of Commons. The fifth Baronet married the Hon. Sarah Sempill, eldest daughter of Hugh Sempill, 12th Lord Sempill. Their grandson, the eighth Baronet, succeeded as seventeenth Lord Sempill in 1884 (see the Lord Sempill for earlier history of this title). The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the nineteenth Lord and tenth Baronet, in 1965.
Designed in the L plan, as was Muchalls Castle, which is located in the same region, Craigievar is noted for its exceptionally crafted plasterwork ceilings.  Craigevar, Muchalls Castle and Glamis Castle are generally considered to have the three finest ceilings in Scotland. The Clan Forbes family were close friends of the Clan Burnett of Leys, who built both Crathes Castle and Muchalls Castle. The ceilings feature plaster figures of the Nine Worthies and other family emblems.
By the early 19th-century, the tower had fallen into decay. Sir John Forbes had considered demolishing the tower and consulted the Aberdeen city architect John Smith who advised against that course of action, stating the tower was: "one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built."[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=David G.|title=Tudor Johnny: City Architect of Aberdeen: The Life and Works of John Smith 1781-1852|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1quYSQAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Librario|isbn=978-1-904440-97-0|pages=129–130[/tpl] Roof repairs were undertaken and involved the re-construction of almost all of the top floor. The windows, external harling and pointing were replaced and it is likely Smith also designed the gardener's cottage.[tpl]cite web|title=Craigievar Castle, Canmore ID 17471|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/17471/details/craigievar+castle/|publisher=RCAHMS|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LDlInXwa|archivedate=18 November 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The castle originally had more defensive elements including a walled courtyard with four round towers; only one of the round towers remains today.  In the arched door to that round tower are preserved the carved initials of Sir Thomas Forbes[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl], William Forbes' son.  There is also a massive iron portculis or gate covering the entrance door which is named a yett.
The castle interior boasts a Great Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians gallery; secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen's Bedroom; servants' quarters and of course several splendid plasterwork ceilings.  There is a collection of Forbes family portraits inside as well as a considerable quantity of Forbes furnishings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries.  The castle also houses two original Henry Raeburn portraits complete with original receipts.
The Forbes family also owned a large granite house at Fintray near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire.  This became the family's main residence for a number of years until the Second World War.  During this time Fintray House was used as a hospital for wounded Belgian soldiers.[tpl]cite book|last=Forbes|first=Ewan|title=The aul' days|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|location=Aberdeen|year=1984|isbn=0-08-032415-0[/tpl]
The castle, its estate, and over [tpl]convert|200|acre|km2[/tpl] of adjoining farmlands and woodlands have now entered their fiftieth year as a property of the National Trust for Scotland. They are open to the public from Easter until the end of September. The castle is strictly guided tours only with each tour lasting approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Due to limited group numbers large groups and coach tours must book in advance. During the July and August the castle is open from 11:00 until 5:30 with the last tour leaving at 4:45. During all other open months the castle is open Friday until Tuesday. Between November 2007 and October 2009 the castle was closed due to its exterior being given an entirely new harl, returning to it what is believed to be a close copy of the harling placed of the castle during the refurbishment of 1820.
