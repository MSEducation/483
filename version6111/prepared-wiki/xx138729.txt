The name is a pun on the Redheads brand of matches.
The matches were made in Villawood, New South Wales, Australia by Steric Trading Pty Ltd, from local and imported materials. While the matchsticks and matchheads were made overseas, local packaging allowed the product to be labelled "Australian made".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s198328.htm|title=Dickheads raises questions about "Australian made" labelling|last=Aiken|first=Kirsten|date=11 October 2000|work=PM|publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=15 May 2009[/tpl] These matchboxes were first sold in boxes of 25, "DICKHEADS 25", then 22,"DICKHEADS 22" and finally 20 "DICKHEADS 20".
