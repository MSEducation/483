[[Tsai–Wu failure criterion]]

CATEGORIES: Failure, Plasticity, Solid mechanics, Mechanics

The Tsai–Wu failure criterion is a phenomenological material failure theory which is widely used for anisotropic composite materials which have different strengths in tension and compression. This failure criterion is a specialization of the general quadratic failure criterion proposed by Gol'denblat and Kopnov and can be expressed in the form

==Tsai–Wu failure criterion for orthotropic materials==

It can be shown that the Tsai-Wu criterion is a particular case of the generalized Hill yield criterion.

==Tsai-Wu failure criterion for transversely isotropic materials==

For a transversely isotropic material, if the plane of isotropy is 1–2, then
Then the Tsai–Wu failure criterion reduces to
In order to maintain closed and ellipsoidal failure surfaces for all stress states, Tsai and Wu also proposed stability conditions which take the following form for transversely isotropic materials

===Tsai–Wu failure criterion in plane stress===

==Tsai–Wu criterion for foams==

The Tsai–Wu criterion for closed cell PVC foams under plane strain conditions may be expressed as
where
For aluminum foams in plane stress, a simplified form of the Tsai–Wu criterion may be used if we assume that the tensile and compressive failure strengths are the same and that there are no shear effects on the failure strength.  This criterion may be written as 
where
