Lambda Theta Phi is a non-profit social fraternity in the United States. It was founded on December 1, 1975 as a Latino Fraternity in the U.S. at Kean College in Union, New Jersey. It emphasizes Latin unity and the celebration of the Latin culture. In 1992, Lambda Theta Phi was accepted into the North-American Interfraternity Conference.  With its acceptance into the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1992 it became the first nationally recognized Latino Greek lettered organization in the U.S. In 1994, with the release of The History of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc., the fraternity published a historical account about its organization.
Lambda Theta Phi has received commendations from the American Red Cross for its fundraising efforts on behalf of victims of earthquakes in Italy and Mexico, mud-slides in Puerto Rico, volcanic eruptions in Colombia, the homeless in the United States and hurricanes in Florida. Lambda Theta Phi has also received commendations from the Division of Youth and Family Services, various other community service organizations as well as proclamations, resolutions and commendations from the United States Congress and some state legislatures. The American Heart Association also commends Lambda Theta Phi for adopting the association as their National Philanthropy. Some of the fraternity's chapters have raised $1,000 or more for the fight against heart disease.
Although Lambda Theta Phi is Latino by tradition, membership is open to all college males.
Since its founding, the organization has expanded across the United States. The organization strives to make an impact on not just undergraduate students, but also their surrounding community at large, through positive social actions. Lambda Theta Phi's goals are to promote scholarship, Latin unity, respect for all cultures and brotherhood.
