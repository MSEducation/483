==History==

The group was formed in 1984 by Lars Lillo-Stenberg with bassist and occasional vocalist Lars Fredrik Beckstrøm and drummer Rune Lindstrøm. In 1986, Lindstrøm left the band to join the Hare Krishna movement and was replaced by Øystein Jevanord. In 1988, Jevanord left and was replaced by Øystein Paasche. In 1991, the band added guitarist Lars Lundevall. 
The most recent studio album credited to deLillos was Midt i begynnelsen from 2002. Both Lars Lillo-Stenberg and Lars Fredrik Beckstrøm have released several solo albums.  
The debut album Suser avgårde (1986) is still one of deLillos' most popular records.
In 2005, the first two deLillos albums were re-released in Deluxe Editions which included the 1985 demo "Kjerringvikdemoen". This inspired Lars Lillo Stenberg and Lars Fredrik Beckstrøm to reunite the "original" deLillos with Rune Lindstrøm under the name "deLillos '85". To celebrate their reunion, the trio played a concert at the tiny Elm Street rock-club in Oslo in November 2005. In 2006, they continued as deLillos '85  and released the album "Suser videre".
