[[Operation Plowshare]]

CATEGORIES: American nuclear weapons testing, Peaceful nuclear explosions

Project Plowshare was the overall United States term for the development of techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful construction purposes. The phrase was coined in 1961, taken from Isaiah 2:3–5 ("And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more"). It was the US portion of what are called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNE).
Successful demonstrations of non-combat uses for nuclear explosives include rock blasting, stimulation of tight gas, chemical element manufacture (test shot Anacostia resulted in Curium-250m being discovered), unlocking some of the mysteries of the so-called "r-Process" of stellar nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust, creating reflection seismology Vibroseis data which has helped geologists and follow on mining company prospecting.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf  |title=Isotope recovery; neutron physics experiment; examination of heat recovery; seismic measurements; and explosive development.[/tpl]http://symposia.obs.carnegiescience.edu/series/symposium4/ms/becker.ps.gzhttp://www.ociw.edu/ociw/symposia/series/symposium4/proceedings.html
Negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear projects led to the program's termination in 1977, due in large part to public opposition.  These consequences included tritium contaminated water[tpl]quantify|date=December 2013[/tpl] and the deposition of fallout from radioactive material being injected into the atmosphere before underground testing was mandated by treaty.

==Rationale==

By exploiting the peaceful uses of the "friendly atom" — in medical applications, earth removal, and later in nuclear power plants — the nuclear industry and government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of nuclear weapons. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the United States Federal government initiated Project Plowshare, involving "peaceful nuclear explosions". The United States Atomic Energy Commission chairman announced that the Plowshares project was intended to "highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests".[tpl]cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/69/5/56.full |title=Nuclear denial: From Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=Charles Perrow |date=September/October 2013 vol. 69 no. 5 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists [/tpl]

==Proposals==

Proposed uses for nuclear explosives under Project Plowshare included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems.  Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage.  Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations.  One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona.  Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California's Sacramento Valley for a water transport project.
Project Carryall,[tpl]cite journal | url = http://pubsindex.trb.org/document/view/default.asp?lbid=110048 | title =Preliminary Design Studies In A Nuclear Excavation — Project Carryall |publisher= Highway Research Board | year=1964 |issue=50 |pages= 32–39 |accessdate= 2010-01-30[/tpl] proposed in 1963 by the Atomic Energy Commission, the California Division of Highways (now Caltrans), and the Santa Fe Railway, would have used 22 nuclear explosions to excavate a massive roadcut through the Bristol Mountains in the Mojave Desert, to accommodate construction of Interstate 40 and a new rail line.  At the end of the program, a major objective was to develop nuclear explosives, and blast techniques, for stimulating the flow of natural gas in "tight" underground reservoir formations.  In the 1960s, a proposal was suggested for a modified in situ shale oil extraction process which involved creation of a rubble chimney (a zone in the oil shale formation created by breaking the rock into fragments) using a nuclear explosive.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Lombard| first = DB | last2 =Carpenter|first2=HC |title=Recovering Oil by Retorting a Nuclear Chimney in Oil Shale |journal = Journal of Petroleum Technology |publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers |pages= 727–34 |issue= 19 |year = 1967[/tpl]  However, this approach was abandoned for a number of technical reasons.

==Plowshare testing==

One of the first plowshare nuclear blast cratering proposals that came close to being carried out was Project Chariot, which would have used several hydrogen bombs to create an artificial harbor at Cape Thompson, Alaska. It was never carried out due to concerns for the native populations and the fact that there was little potential use for the harbor to justify its risk and expense.[tpl]Citation | last = O'Neill | first = Dan | year = 2007 | origyear = 1995 | title = The Firecracker Boys: H-Bombs, Inupiat Eskimos, and the Roots of the Environmental Movement | place = New York | publisher = Basic Books | ISBN = 0-465-00348-6[/tpl].  A number of proof-of-concept cratering blasts were conducted; including the Buggy shot of 5 1-Kt-devices for a channel/trench in Area 21 and the largest being 104 kiloton (435 terajoule) on July 6, 1962 at the north end of Yucca Flats, within the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada Test Site (NTS) in southern Nevada. The shot, "Sedan", displaced more than 12 million short tons (11 teragrams) of soil and resulted in a radioactive cloud that rose to an altitude of 12,000 ft (3.7 km).  The radioactive dust plume headed northeast and then east towards the Mississippi River.
The first PNE blast was Project Gnome, conducted on December 10, 1961 in a salt bed 24 mi (39 km) southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico.  The explosion released 3.1 kilotons (13 TJ) of energy yield at a depth of 361 meters (1,184 ft) which resulted in the formation of a [tpl]convert|170|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] diameter, [tpl]convert |80|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high cavity. The test had many objectives.  The most public of these involved the generation of steam which could then be used to generate electricity.  Another objective was the production of useful radioisotopes and their recovery.  Another experiment involved neutron time-of-flight physics.  A fourth experiment involved geophysical studies based upon the timed seismic source. Only the last objective was considered a complete success. The blast unintentionally vented radioactive steam while the press watched. The partly developed Project Coach detonation experiment that was to follow adjacent to the Gnome test was then canceled.
Over the next 11 years 26 more nuclear explosion tests were conducted under the U.S. PNE program.  Funding quietly ended in 1977.  Costs for the program have been estimated at more than (US) $770 million.

===Natural gas stimulation experiment===

The final PNE blast took place on 17 May 1973, under Fawn Creek, 76.4 km north of Grand Junction, Colorado.  Three 30 kiloton detonations took place simultaneously at depths of 1,758, 1,875, and 2,015 meters.  It was the third nuclear explosion experiment intended to stimulate the flow of natural gas from "tight" formation gas fields. Industrial participants included the El Paso Natural Gas Company for the Gasbuggy test; Austral Oil Company; CER Geonuclear Corporation for the Rulison test; and CER Geonuclear Corporation for the Rio Blanco test.
If it was successful, plans called for the use of hundreds of specialized nuclear explosives in the western Rockies gas fields.  The previous two tests had indicated that the produced natural gas would be too radioactive for safe use.  After the Rio Blanco test it was found that the three blast cavities had not connected as hoped, and the resulting gas still contained unacceptable levels of radionuclides.
By 1974, approximately $82 million had been invested in the nuclear gas stimulation technology program. It was estimated that even after 25 years of gas production of all the natural gas deemed recoverable, that only 15 to 40 percent of the investment could be recovered.
Also, the concept that stove burners in California might soon emit trace amounts of blast radionuclides into family homes did not sit well with the general public.  The contaminated well gas was never channeled into commercial supply lines.
The radioactive blast debris from 839 U.S. underground nuclear test explosions remains buried in-place and has been judged impractical to remove by the DOE's Nevada Site Office.
The situation remained so for the next three decades, but a resurgence in Colorado Western slope natural gas drilling has brought resource development closer and closer to the original underground detonations. By mid-2009, 84 drilling permits had been issued within a 3-mile radius, with 11 permits within one mile of the site.[tpl]cite web|first=Mark |last= Jaffe |url= http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_12737664 |title = Colorado drilling rigs closing in on '60s nuke site |publisher=The Denver Post |date=07/02/2009 |accessdate = 2010-01-30[/tpl]

==Nuclear tests==

The U.S. conducted 27 PNE shots in conjunction with other, weapons-related, test series.[tpl]cite paper|title=The Plowshare Program - Final Report|url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl] A report by the Federation of American Scientists includes yields slightly different than that presented below.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html |title=RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENT, RDD-7, January 1, 2001.[/tpl]

==Non-nuclear tests==

In addition to the nuclear tests, Plowshare executed a number of non-nuclear test projects in an attempt to learn more about how the nuclear explosives could best be used.  Several of these projects lead to practical utility as well as to furthering knowledge about large explosives. These projects included:

==Proposed nuclear projects==

A number of projects were proposed and some planning accomplished, but were not followed through on.  A list of these is given here:

==Negative impacts and opposition==

Operation Plowshare "started with great expectations and high hopes". Planners believed that the projects could be completed safely, but there was less confidence that they could be completed more economically than conventional methods. Moreover, there was insufficient public and Congressional support for the projects. Projects Chariot and Coach were two examples where technical problems and environmental concerns prompted further feasibility studies which took several years, and each project was eventually canceled.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf |title= Plowshare Program | type = executive summary | location = US | publisher = Department of Energy | format = PDF |work= OSTI[/tpl]
Citizen groups voiced concerns and opposition to some of the Plowshare tests.  There were concerns that the blast effects from the Schooner explosion could dry up active wells or trigger an earthquake. There was opposition to both Rulison and Rio Blanco tests because of possible radioactive gas flaring operations and other environmental hazards. In a 1973 article, Time used the term "Project Dubious" to describe Operation Plowshare.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903965,00.html |title=Environment: Project Dubious |date=Apr 9, 1973 |work= Time magazine[/tpl]
There were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions:[tpl]Citation | first = Benjamin K | last = Sovacool | author-link = Benjamin K. Sovacool | year = 2011 | title = Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy | journal = World Scientific | pages = 171–2[/tpl].
Project Plowshare shows how something intended to improve national security can unwittingly do the opposite if it fails to fully consider the social, political, and environmental consequences. It also “underscores that public resentment and opposition can stop projects in their tracks”.
