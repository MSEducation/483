==Early life==

Cho was born into a Korean family in San Francisco, California. She grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of "old hippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the '60s, drag queens, Chinese people, and Koreans. To say it was a melting pot — that's the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time.""Biography". Margaret Cho: Official Site. August 15, 2008. Retrieved September 20, 2008.

==Early career==

After doing several shows in a club adjacent to her parents' bookstore, Cho launched a stand-up career and spent several years developing her material in clubs.

In 1994, Cho won the American Comedy Award for Best Female Comedian.[tpl]cite news | url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com/search/env-past-winners-search,0,1243372,results.formprofile?Query=margaret+cho&selectsearch=pastwinners&target=article&Lib=turbine_cdb_lib%3Aresult_doc_id+result_doc_rank+document_id+cdb_num+cdb_01_txt+cdb_02_txt+cdb_03_txt+cdb_04_txt+cdb_01_num&SortBy=COMPOSITE_RANK+desc&PageSize=10&Page=1&MinCoarseRank=500&QueryType=CONCEPT&x=0&y=0 | author = TheEnvelope.com | title = Margaret Cho search results | work=The Los Angeles Times[/tpl] In 2010, on The View, she discussed her nervousness about doing The Golden Palace and thanked the late Rue McClanahan for her help with rehearsing.

==Television career==

===All American Girl===

That same year, ABC developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho's stand-up routine. The show, All-American Girl, was initially feted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short lived sitcom Mr. T and Tina preceded it by nearly two decades.
Cho has expressed subsequent regret for much of what transpired during the production of the show.
The show was canceled after suffering from poor ratings and the effect of major content changes over the course of its single season (19 episodes).[tpl]cite web|last=Anderson |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136087/ |title=Saved by the Gong: The sitcom that turned Margaret Cho into a cultural hero |publisher=Slate |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl]
After the show's 1995 cancellation, Cho became addicted to drugs including alcohol. As detailed in her 2002 autobiography, I'm the One That I Want, in 1995 her substance abuse was evident during a performance in Monroe, Louisiana, where she was booed off the stage by 800 college students after going on the stage drunk.Margaret Cho’s mix of raunch and self-help conquers America[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Books==

===I'm the One That I Want===

Cho's career and personal life were challenging after the cancellation of the show, but Cho eventually sobered, refocused her energy and developed new material. In 1999, she wrote about her struggles with the show in her first one-woman show, I'm the One That I Want. Cho then released her book of the same name, and the show was filmed and released as a concert film in 2000. Her material dealt with her difficulties breaking into show business because of her ethnicity and weight and her resulting struggle with and triumph over body image issues and drug and alcohol addiction.[tpl]cite web | url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/margaret_cho.html | title=Cho, Margaret – Comedienne, Actress | first=Dominick | last=Miserandino | publisher=The Celebrity Cafe[/tpl]

==Shows and tours==

Cho appeared in an episode of the HBO comedy Sex and the City's fourth season. The episode, titled "The Real Me", first aired on June 3, 2001, and also guest-starred Heidi Klum.
In 2002, the show Notorious C.H.O. (the title derived from slain rapper The Notorious B.I.G.) dealt with the comedian having been raised in 1970s San Francisco and her bisexuality. The next year, Cho made another stand-up film, Revolution, which was released in 2004.
In 2005, Cho started promoting and touring with her new show, Assassin. The show became her fourth live concert film and premiered on the gay and lesbian premium cable network Here! TV in September 2005. In this DVD, she notably includes herself when talking about gays, saying "we" and "our community". Posters for Assassin featured Cho in paratrooper gear and holding a microphone in the style of an automatic rifle, a reference to the infamous 1974 photo of heiress Patty Hearst.
Cho launched "The Sensuous Woman"[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html | title=The Sensuous Woman | publisher=Margaret Cho official site | accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071004212803/http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html  |archivedate = 2007-10-04[/tpl] burlesque-style variety show tour in Los Angeles on August 10, 2007, with tour dates scheduled through November 3, as of October 10.[tpl]cite web | url=http://margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm | title=The Sensuous Woman Tour Dates | publisher=Margaret Cho official site | accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070903151957/http://www.margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm  |archivedate = 2007-09-03[/tpl]  Past and scheduled tour stops after Los Angeles are Chicago, Illinois and New York City.  On August 10, 2007 the San Francisco Chronicle reviewed the show, Cho's work, key events in her personal life and characterized the show as, "In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more like a crazy family reunion than a performance."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2007/10/10/apop.DTL | title=ASIAN POP / New tricks | first=Jeff | last=Yang | date=October 10, 2007 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate=2007-10-10 [/tpl]

The episode featuring Cho aired on June 26, 2008.
Her "Mother" tour embarked fall 2013 and is heading to Europe in 2014. The title of the tour refers not to Cho's  impressions of her own mother, but to Cho herself.

In May 2010, Cho directed and appeared in the music video for "I Wanna Be a Bear," a song by "Pixie Herculon" (a pseudonym of Jill Sobule).

==Nature of material and political advocacy==

Cho is also well known for discussing her relationship with her mother, particularly in imitating her mother's heavily accented speech. Her depictions of "Mommy" have become a popular part of her routine. Cho's comedy routines are often explicit. She has covered substance abuse, eating disorders, her bisexuality and obsession with gay men, and Asian-American stereotypes, among other subjects, in her stand up.
A substantial segment of her material and advocacy addresses LGBT issues. In addition to her shows, Cho also developed an additional outlet for her advocacy with the advent of Margaretcho.com and her daily weblog. When San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom directed that San Francisco's city hall issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco in 2004 (until reversed by the state supreme court), Cho started Love is Love is Love,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loveisloveislove.com |title=Love is Love is Love |publisher=Love is Love is Love |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl] a website promoting the legalization of gay marriage in the United States.
Cho's material often features commentary on politics and contemporary American culture. She has also been outspoken about her dislike of former President George W. Bush. She began to draw intense fire from conservatives over her fiercely anti-Bush commentary; a live performance in Houston, Texas was threatened with picketing. Although protesters never showed up, she held a counter protest outside the club until security told her she had to go inside.Protest This an entry in Margaret's blog[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In 2004, Cho was performing at a corporate event in a hotel when after ten minutes her microphone was cut off and a band was instructed to begin playing. Cho claims this was because the manager of the hotel was offended by anti-Bush administration comments. Cho's payment, which was issued by way of check directly to a non-profit organization, a defense fund for the West Memphis Three, initially bounced but was eventually honored.They Turned Off the Mic an entry in Margaret's blog[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In July 2004, during the Democratic National Convention, Cho was disinvited to speak at a Human Rights Campaign/National Stonewall Democrats fundraiser out of fear that her comments might cause controversy. In November 2005, she campaigned to pardon Stanley Tookie Williams, an early Crips gang leader, for his death sentence for four murders.  On December 13, 2005, after exhausting all forms of appeal, Williams was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison, California.Save Tookie an entry in Margaret's blog[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
