==Early life==

Pat Morita was born in Isleton, California. He developed spinal tuberculosis at the age of two and spent the bulk of the next nine years in Northern Californian hospitals, including the Shriners Hospital in San Francisco. For long periods he was wrapped in a full-body cast and was told he would never walk.    It was during his time at a sanitarium near Sacramento that he was given his stage name, "Pat".  Released from the facility at age 11 after undergoing extensive spinal surgery and learning how to walk, Morita was transported from the hospital directly to the Gila River camp in Arizona to join his interned family.[tpl]citation |last=Thurber |first=Jon |title=Pat Morita, 73; Actor Starred in 'Karate Kid' Movie Series | newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=November 26, 2005 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/26/local/me-morita26[/tpl]
