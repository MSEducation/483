[[Telecommunications in Eritrea]]

CATEGORIES: Communications in Eritrea, Internet censorship by country

Telecommunications in Eritrea are poorly developed and controlled by the government.

==Infrastructure==

The Eritrea Telecommunication Services Corporation, more commonly known as EriTel, is the sole operator of both landline and mobile telephone communication infrastructure in Eritrea, but is one of several internet service providers in the country."Eritrea Telecommunication Services Corporation (EriTel)", International Telecommunications Union (ITU), 2011. Retrieved 1 November 2013.
The domestic telecommunications infrastructure is very inadequate. Most fixed line telephones are located in Asmara, the capital and largest city. Cell phones are in increasing use throughout the country. The government is seeking international tenders to improve the system.
On 13 April 2006, Eritrea received a soft loan from the government of China to upgrade their communication infrastructure. The total sum loaned to EriTel was $23 million. All major cities are connected to the mobile telephone system in Eritrea except for Nakfa, Afabet, and Asseb. Afabet and Nakfa are expected to be online by July 2006.[tpl]update after|2013|11|1[/tpl]

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

Eritrea has not set up a widespread automatic Internet filtering system, but it does not hesitate to order blocking of several diaspora websites critical of the regime. Access to these sites is blocked by two of the Internet service providers, Erson and Ewan, as are pornographic websites and YouTube. Self-censorship is said to be widespread."Countries under surveillance: Eritrea", Reporters Without Borders, March 2011
