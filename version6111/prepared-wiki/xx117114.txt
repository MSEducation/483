[[Kallidin]]

CATEGORIES: Peptides, Kinin–kallikrein system

Kallidin is a bioactive kinin formed in response to injury from kininogen precursors through the action of kallikreins. 
Kallidin is a decapeptide that can be converted to bradykinin by the aminopeptidase enzyme.  
It can be a substrate for carboxypeptidase M and N.[tpl]cite book|author1=Stefan Offermanns|author2=Walter Rosenthal|title=Encyclopedia of Molecular Pharmacology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iwwo5gx8aX8C&pg=PA673|accessdate=11 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-38916-3|pages=673–[/tpl]
Kallidin is identical to bradykinin with an additional lysine residue added at the N-terminal end and signals through the bradykinin receptor.
