Separatism is the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group. While it often refers to full political secession,Free Dictionary; Merriam Webster dictionary; The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current= English 2008. separatist groups may seek nothing more than greater autonomy.[ref]R.

==Motivations for separatism==

Groups may have one or more motivations for separation, including:Metta Spencer, Separatism: Democracy and Disintegration, Rowman & Littlefield, 1998, 2-4.

==Governmental responses==

How far separatist demands will go toward full independence, and whether groups pursue constitutional and nonviolent or armed violence, depend on a variety of economic, political, social and cultural factors, including movement leadership[ref]Link to:

Horowitz's "Patterns of Ethnic Separatism", originally published in Comparative Studies in Society and History, 1981, vol 23, 165-95. Republished in John A. Hall, The State: Critical Concepts, Routledge, 1994.  Governments may respond in a number of ways, some of which are mutually exclusive. Some include:Metta Spencer, 5-6.
Some governments suppress any separatist movement in their own country, but support separatism in other countries.

==Types of separatist groups==

Separatist groups practice a form of identity politics - "political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice of members of certain social groups."  Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination.Identity Politics, Stanford University Encyclopedia of Philosophy, November 2, 2007.  However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.

Religious separatist groups and sects want to withdraw from some larger religious groups and/or believe they should interact primarily with co-religionists.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
