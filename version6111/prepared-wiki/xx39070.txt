Earth Day is an annual event, celebrated on April 22, on which day events worldwide are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection. It was first celebrated in 1970, and is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Earth Day Network |publisher=Earthday.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl] and celebrated in more than 192 countries each year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://earthday.org/countries |title=Earth Day International |deadurl=yes |archivedate=March 15, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100315055335/http://www.earthday.org/countries |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl]
In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a Proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award in recognition of his work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/a-brief-history-of-earth-day.html |title=Earth Day | Care2 Healthy Living |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bullitt.org/who-we-are/staff |title=Staff — The Bullitt Foundation |publisher=Bullitt.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2009/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-denis-hayes/ |title=The Rumpus Interview With Earth Day Organizer Denis Hayes |publisher=The Rumpus.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl] Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues.

==Earth Day 1970==

The first Earth Day family had participants and celebrants in two thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools, and hundreds of communities across the United States. More importantly, it "brought 20 million Americans out into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform."[tpl]cite web |url=http://epa.gov/35thanniversary/topics/epa/15c.htm |author=Jack Lewis |date=November 1985 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |title=The Birth of EPA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20060922192621/http://epa.gov/35thanniversary/topics/epa/15c.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2006[/tpl] It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now "the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earthday.org/about/default.aspx |archiveurl=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070423053633/http://www.earthday.org/about/default.aspx |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |title=About Earth Day Network |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action which changes human behavior and provokes policy changes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earthday.org/earth-day-history-movement |title=Earth Day: The History of A Movement |publisher=Earth Day Network |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 16, 2013[/tpl]

===New York City===

In the winter of 1969–1970, a group of students met at Columbia University to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day. Among the group were Fred Kent, Pete Grannis, and Kristin and William Hubbard. This New York group agreed to head up the New York City part of the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. "The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day," according to Kristin Hubbard (now Kristin Alexandre). 'From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay's offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton."
In addition to shutting down Fifth Avenue, Mayor John Lindsay made Central Park available for Earth Day. The crowd was estimated as more than one million—by far the largest in the nation. Since Manhattan was also the home of NBC, CBS, ABC, The New York Times, Time, and Newsweek, it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm |title=The Spirit of the First Earth Day|publisher=U.S.Environmental Protection Agency|date=January–February 1990|accessdate=April 22, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100328214819/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm|archivedate=March 28, 2010[/tpl]

===Philadelphia===

The event was hosted by environmentalist Ira Einhorn.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42711922/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/earth-day-co-founder-killed-composted-girlfriend/#.UXX-c7WG2Sq |title=Earth Day co-founder killed, composted girlfriend|publisher=NBC News|date=April 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl] U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader; Landscape Architect Ian McHarg; Nobel prize-winning Harvard Biochemist, George Wald; U.S. Senate Minority Leader, Hugh Scott; and poet, Allen Ginsberg.

==Earth Day 1990==

Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.
Two separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by Edward Furia (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by Denis Hayes (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator Gaylord Nelson, the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/business/the-business-of-earth-day.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Business of Earth Day |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=November 12, 1989 |accessdate=April 22, 2012[/tpl] Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board Hewlett-Packard, a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents. In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the National Toxics Campaign, a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fund raising, and email marketing.
The Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in George, Washington, near the Columbia River with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb who called from their base camp on Mount Everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues.Ellensburg Daily Record – Google News Archive Search The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by Jim Whittaker, the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the United States, Soviet Union, and China had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest. The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, John Ratzenberger, from "Cheers", and the headlining musician was the "Father of Rock and Roll," Chuck Berry.
Warner Bros. Records released a single in 1990 entitled, "Tomorrow's World", written by Kix Brooks (who would later become one-half of Brooks & Dunn) and Pam Tillis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/28757025.html?dids=28757025:28757025&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+22%2C+1990&author=Jack+Hurst%2C+Country+music+writer&pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Earth+calling.+.+.Help!+Cautious+Nashville+is+starting+to+turn+green&pqatl=google |title=Earth calling. . .Help!

==Earth Day 2000==

Earth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. This was the first year that Earth Day used the Internet as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/23/us/peaceful-easy-feeling-imbues-30th-earth-day.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |title=Peaceful, Easy Feeling Imbues 30th Earth Day |first=Jeff |last=Gerth |date=April 23, 2000 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Leonardo DiCaprio was the official host for the event, and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day.

==Subsequent Earth Day events==

To turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA. Building on the momentum created by thousands of community organizers around the world, Earth Day USA coordinated the next five Earth Day celebrations through 1995, including the launch of EarthDay.org. Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network.
As the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on global warming and pushing for clean energy. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the Internet to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board, reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A talking drum chain traveled from village to village in Gabon, Africa, for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., USA.
Earth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating, in the activities, in thousands of places including Kiev, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; Tuvalu; Manila, Philippines; Togo; Madrid, Spain; London; and New York.

==The Earth Day name==

According to Nelson, the moniker "Earth Day" was "an obvious and logical name" suggested by "a number of people" in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both "a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations" and "a New York advertising executive," Julian Koenig.Gaylord Nelson Papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Box 231, Folder 43. Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; "Earth Day" rhyming with "birthday," the connection seemed natural.[tpl]Cite episode |title=Origin Story |url=http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |series=This American Life |airdate=June 19, 2009 |number=383 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nci.org/06nci/06/NCI25thAnniversary.htm |title=Statement by Paul Leventhal on the 25th Anniversary of the Nuclear Control Institute |date=June 21, 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Other names circulated during preparations—Nelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was "practically unanimous" in its use of "Earth Day," so the name stuck.

==Earth Day Canada==

The first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D. Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen's University. Flora MacDonald, then MP for Kingston and the Islands and Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980 with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and MPPs across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways as well as tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch Elm Disease.Tait, Teresa (July 23, 1980), "A Little Litter is Too Much", Kingston This Week.Wright, Sylvia (July 1980), "Canada's First Earth Day Scheduled for Sept. 11", The Kingston Whig Standard.

Earth Day Canada's Community Environment Fund funds sustainable community projects in Ontario providing grants of up to $20 000 to schools and not-for-profit organizations.
The Diversity Engagement and Inclusion Initiative helps the environmental sector to better communicate with, engage and activate Canada's diverse social and cultural communities. The Employee Engagement program works with employers to achieve business and sustainability goals through inclusion of best practices.

==History of the Equinox Earth Day (March 20)==

The equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the March equinox (around March 20) to mark the precise moment of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and of astronomical autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. An equinox in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the equinoxes and solstices are considered to start or separate the seasons.
John McConnell[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |publisher="EarthSite" |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2010[/tpl] first introduced the idea of a global holiday called "Earth Day" at the 1969 UNESCO Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day proclamation was issued by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General U Thant supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:
 
 May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl]

United Nations secretary-general Kurt Waldheim observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). Margaret Mead added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:
 
 "Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.

Earth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way – which is also the most ancient way – by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate."Margaret Mead, "Earth Day," EPA Journal, March 1978.

At the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the Japanese Peace Bell, which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl] Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations. The equinox Earth Day at the UN is organized by the Earth Society Foundation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.earthsocietyfoundation.org |title=Earth Society Foundation |publisher="Earth Society Foundation" |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2010[/tpl]

===Growing eco-activism before Earth Day 1970===

In 1968, Morton Hilbert and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health.[tpl]cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead;cc=bhlead;view=text;rgn=main;didno=umich-bhl-07183 |title=Bentley Historical Library Finding Aids |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date=October 18, 1976 |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl] This was the beginning of Earth Day.

Project Survival, an early environmentalism-awareness education event, was held at Northwestern University on January 23, 1970. This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, Ralph Nader began talking about the importance of ecology in 1970.
The 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against DDT in Nassau County, New York, had inspired Rachel Carson to write her bestseller, Silent Spring (1962).

===Significance of April 22===

Nelson chose the date in order to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an "environmental teach-in". He determined the week of April 19–25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nelsonearthday.net/earth-day/proposal.htm |title=A proposal reprinted across the country |date=April 18, 2010 |publisher=Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week events—so he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist John Muir.

Subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of Soviet power, including Eastern Europe, and at the height of its power the Soviet Union established a nation-wide subbotnik to be celebrated on Lenin's birthday, April 22, which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1955.

===Earth Day Anthem (William Wallace)===

The "Ode to Joy" melody by Beethoven, the official anthem of the European Union, also is performed on the Earth Day. Lyrics for the Earth Day Anthem set to "Ode to Joy" are as follows:
 Joyful joyful we adore our Earth in all its wonderment 
 Simple gifts of nature that all join into a paradise 
Now we must resolve to protect her 
Show her our love throughout all time 
With our gentle hand and touch 
We make our home a newborn world 
Now we must resolve to protect her 
Show her our love throughout all time 
With our gentle hand and touch 
We make our home a newborn world[tpl]cite web|author=William Wallace |url=http://earthdayanthem.homestead.com/ |title=Earth Day Anthem |publisher= |date= |accessdate=April 21, 2014[/tpl]
