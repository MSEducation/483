==Biography==

Posey Wilson Rorer was born in Franklin County, Virginia. He suffered from severely clubbed feet for the first 30 years of his life. At the age of 10 he learned to play the banjo but soon switched to the fiddle. In 1917, he moved to West Virginia but due to the flu epidemic of 1919, he had to return to Virginia. Rorer had become close friends with Charlie Poole and together they performed all over North Carolina in the 1920s.Lornell 1989, p. 162. In 1925, Rorer together with Charlie Poole and Norman Woodlieff formed the North Carolina Ramblers. They went to New York to record for Columbia Records.Lornell 1989, p. 142. They made their recording debut on July 27, 1925.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 698-699. When Norman Woodlieff left the band in 1926 he was replaced by Roy Harvey.Lornell 1989, p. 88. Between September 1926 and February 1928, the band was often led by Harvey during recording sessions since Charlie Poole was not present.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 409-410. In 1928, Rorer left the North Carolina Ramblers over some disagreements concerning record royalties. He was quickly replaced by Lonnie Austin.
Rorer joined the duo of Walter Smith and Norman Woodlieff recording for Gennett Records in March 1929.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 846. In March 1930, he recorded with Buster Carter and Lewis McDaniels alternately calling themselves the Carolina Buddies or the Dixie Ramblers.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 170.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 180. Later in 1930, Rorer and Carter teamed up with Preston Young and formed a trio using the North Carolina Ramblers as a model. They went to New York for an audition.Lornell 1989, p. 35. They made their first recordings in June 1931 cutting 10 songs.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 318. Although Rorer continued to make recordings with different bands, The Great Depression finally forced him to retire from music. He began working as a woodcutter and in 1936 for the Works Progress Administration. He died in June 1936 of a heart attack.Lornell 1989, p. 164.
