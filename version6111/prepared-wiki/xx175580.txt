Cymopterus aboriginum is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family known by the common name Indian springparsley. This small, flat, taprooted perennial is native to the US states of California and Nevada, where it grows in the rocky soils of the desert mountains in the Mojave region. It has no stem, instead forming a patch of basal leaves flat on the ground. The leaves are gray-green and highly divided into tiny segments, giving the foliage a wrinkly, lacy look. It is also covered in minute, rough hairs. The plant erects tall peduncles which support the flowers. The peduncles and umbels are brownish and the small flowers within the crinkly inflorescence are white.
