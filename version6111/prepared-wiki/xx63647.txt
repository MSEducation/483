Silvertown is an industrialised district on the north bank of the Thames in the London Borough of Newham. It was named after Samuel Winkworth Silver's former rubber factory which opened in 1852, and is now dominated by the Tate & Lyle sugar refinery and the John Knight ABP animal rendering plant.

==History==

In 1852 S.W.Silver and Co moved to the area from Greenwich and established a rubber works, originally to make waterproof clothing. This subsequently developed into the works of the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Cable Company, which constructed and laid many submarine cables. By the 1860s a number of manure and chemical works and petroleum storage depots had been set up.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Alan Godfrey|title=Notes to London Sheet 80, Silvertown 1867|scale=1:2500 reduced to 1:4340|series=Old Ordnance Survey Maps, The Godfrey Edition|isbn=1-84151-861-1[/tpl]
Sugar refiners in the area were joined by Henry Tate in 1877 and Abram Lyle in 1881, whose companies merged in 1921 to form Tate & Lyle.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Alan Godfrey|title=Notes to London Sheet 80, Silvertown 1893|scale=1:2500 reduced to 1:4340|series=Old Ordnance Survey Maps, The Godfrey Edition|isbn=978-0-85054-073-4[/tpl] Prior to the merger, which occurred after they had died, the two men were bitter business rivals, although they had never met in person.[tpl]cite book|author=Duncan Barrett and Nuala Calvi|publisher=Collins|title=The Sugar Girls|isbn=978-0-00-744847-0[/tpl] Tate & Lyle still has two large refineries in the area.
On 19 January 1917 parts of Silvertown were devastated by a massive TNT explosion at the Brunner-Mond munitions factory, in what is known as the Silvertown explosion. Seventy three people died and hundreds were injured in one of the largest explosions ever experienced in the British Isles.[tpl]cite news  |title= London's explosion was at Silvertown |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807E1DA173AE433A2575AC2A9679C946696D6CF |work= New York Times |date= 29 January 1919 |accessdate=2009-06-12 [/tpl]
In the early 20th Century the area suffered greatly from road congestion due to being located between the Thames and the Royal Docks, then the largest and one of the busiest dock groups in the world. The area was cut off for much of the time by lifting bridges over dock entrances, and by level crossings which were closed for up to three quarters of each hour by train movements. This led in the early 1930s to the construction of the elevated Silvertown Way, one of the earliest urban flyovers.[tpl]cite book|author=Winchester C (Ed)|title=London's Dockland Highway|series=Wonders of World Engineering|pages= 749–756|publisher=The Amalgamated Press|year=1937|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl]

Silver's was eventually taken over by the British Tyre and Rubber Co, later known as BTR Industries. The site closed in the 1960s and is now the Thameside Industrial Estate.[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham: Industries|work=A History of the County of Essex|volume=6|year=1973|pages=76–89|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42755|accessdate=14 April 2011[/tpl]
Another major local employer was the Loders and Nucoline plant at Cairn Mills, a traditional port oleo industry and formerly part of Unilever. This originally milled seeds but later concentrated on production of fats from palm kernel oil.
The district formed part of the County Borough of West Ham in Essex until 1965.

==Regeneration==

The area has been transformed since the 1970s by the construction of the Thames Barrier, an adjacent park, new housing areas and the London City Airport. In the mid 1990s much of the business activity in the area was centred around the brewing firm Bass[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl].

==Transport==

The nearest Docklands Light Railway station is West Silvertown. Access was much improved by an extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Canning Town to Woolwich Arsenal, which opened on 2 December 2005. However, the old Silvertown railway station on the North London Line, was closed in 2006.
[tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], construction is underway for Crossrail which will pass through the area from 2018, using the trackbed of the old North London Line. A new station is currently planned at Custom House stationhttp://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/stations/ and there is passive provision for a stop serving City Airport to be built in future.
London City Airport is located on the eastern edge of Silvertown.
