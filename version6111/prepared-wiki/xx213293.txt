John VI Kantakouzenos, who restored and fortified the city, stated that it was the ancient Abdera, a statement that also occurs in a Byzantine list of names of cities published by Parthey.Hierocles, Synecdemus, Berlin, 1866, 314, cited by Pétridès Pétridès rejected this identification, saying that Polystylus/Polystylum was what in his time (1911) was called Bouloustra, a village situated 5 or 7 kilometres from the ruins of ancient Abdera,John S.

==History of the see==

When Philippi was made a metropolitan see Polystylum was one of its suffragans.Le Quien, Oriens christianus, II, 65. It figures as such in: the Notitiæ episcopatuum of Leo the Wise about 901-7;Heinrich Gelzer, "Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notit. episcopat.", Munich, 1900, 558. the Nova Tactica about 940;Gelzer, "Georgii Cyprii descr. orbis romani", Leipzig, 1890, 80, cited by Pétridès "Notices" 3 and 10 of Parthey, which belong to the 13th century. In 1212 Pope Innocent III mentions it among the suffragans of the Latin Archdiocese of Philippi.Patrologia Latina, CCXVI, 585, cited by Pétridès
In 1363 the Greek bishop Peter became Metropolitan of Christopolis and the see was united to the Archdiocese of Maronia, the metropolitan see of Rhodope.Miklosich and Müller, "Acta patriarchatus Constantinopolit", I, 474, 475, 559; Petit, "Actes du Pantocrator", Petersburg, 1903, p. x and vii, cited by Pétridès
