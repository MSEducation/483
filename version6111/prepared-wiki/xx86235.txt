[[Kuma–Manych Depression]]

CATEGORIES: Depressions of Russia, Landforms of Europe

The Kuma–Manych Depression ([tpl]lang-ru|Кумо–Манычская впадина, Kumo–Manychskaya vpadina[/tpl]),  is a geological depression in southwestern Russia that separates the Russian Plain (north) from the Fore-Caucasus (south). It is named after Kuma and Manych rivers.
It is sometimes regarded as a definition for the natural boundary between Europe and Asia, although most modern sources use the Greater Caucasus watershed instead.
The Rostovsky Biosphere Reserve is located within the Depression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=RUS+40&mode=all|title=Rostovsky|date=14 January 2010|work=The MAB Programme|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 December 2013[/tpl]
