The temple priest quits and starts a tea shop. A new priest from neighboring village Brahmadattan Nambothiri (Ravi Menon) now takes care of the temple. He is eager to get a government job as his situation at home is not good and younger sisters not yet married. He seduces Ammini daughter of Velichapdu and leaves the village. Because of extreme poverty Velichapdu starts to beg. One day his son Appu tries to sell the holy sword to a pawn seller and Velichapadu finds it. He asks his son Appu to leave the house immediately.
Meanwhile there is a smallpox outbreak in the village, first affected is Variyar's (Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair) wife. Due to the outbreak of smallpox people become serious about the temple and its ritual. The villagers decide to conduct the festival in temple for the Goddess and started collecting money from all. On the day of festival Velichapadu found that his wife was selling her body to a local moneylender for a living. The Velichapadu was totally devastated. The film ends with a devastating scene.

==Production==

The film's major shooting location was a small village near Edappal called Mukkola (Mukuthala).The film is produced by M. T. Vasudevan Nair under the banner of Novel Films.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2482063.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=B. | last=Vijayakumar | title=Nirmalyam 1973 | date=2011-09-25[/tpl] Cinematographer Ramachandra Babu says, "There was full co-operation from the villagers and they always were there to help us with properties for the scenes and also acting in minor and crowd scenes. In fact they got so attached to the unit, many children were in tears when it was time for us to depart after the shooting was over. Except for the Sreekovil portion all other scenes were completed in one schedule. We had erected a set in Calicut where the Sreekovil with the idol where close up shots were taken. It was because in the temple which was used for our shooting there were no regular Poojas taking place and more over it was such a cramped place and customs prevent you from entering it too for placing lights etc. For other outdoor locations, we used the steps on the riverside at Thirumittakode temple for the parting song and a cave nearby for the rain sequence which was done with the help of fire engines." Post production was done in Madras.Ramachandra Babu. Nirmalyam. Nostalgia. Retrieved 13 January 2012.
Veteran actor Sankaradi was originally cast for the role of Velichapad. But he rejected the offer saying that his physique wouldn't suit the role. He himself suggested P. J. Antony, whose performance is still regarded as one of the finest onscreen performances ever."ശങ്കരാടി,നാട്യങ്ങളില്ലാത്ത നടന്‍". Janayugom. Retrieved 2012-01-04.
