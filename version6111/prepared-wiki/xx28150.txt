The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known unofficially as the Warren Commission, was established by President Lyndon B.

The Commission took its unofficial name—the Warren Commission—from its chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren.[tpl]cite news|title=Johnson Names a 7-Man Panel to Investigate Assassination; Chief  Warren Heads It|first=John D.|last=Morris|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1963|page=1[/tpl] According to published transcripts of Johnson's presidential phone conversations, some major officials were opposed to forming such a commission and several commission members took part only reluctantly.[tpl]cite news|title=Taking charge: the Johnson White House tapes, 1963-1964|last=Beschloss|first=Michael R.|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1997|authorlink=Michael Beschloss[/tpl] One of their chief reservations was that a commission would ultimately create more controversy than consensus, and those fears proved valid.

==Method==

The Commission conducted its business primarily in closed sessions, but these were not secret sessions.

==Death of Lee Harvey Oswald==

In response to Jack Ruby's shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, the Warren Commission declared that the news media must share responsibility with the Dallas police department for "the breakdown of law enforcement" that led to Oswald's death. In addition to the police department's "inadequacy of coordination," the Warren Commission noted that "these additional deficiencies security were related directly to the decision to admit newsmen to the basement." 
The commission concluded that the pressure of press, radio, and television for information about Oswald's prison transfer resulted in lax security standards for admission to the basement, allowing Ruby to enter and subsequently shoot Oswald, noting that "the acceptance of inadequate press credentials posed a clear avenue for a one-man assault." Oswald's death was said to have been a direct result of "the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or control the crowd in the basement."
The consequence of Oswald's death, according to the Commission, was that "it was no longer possible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination John F. Kennedy through normal judicial procedures during the trial of the alleged assassin." While the Commission noted that the prime responsibility was that of the police department, it also recommended the adoption of a new "code of conduct" for news professionals regarding the collecting and presenting of information to the public that would ensure "there would be no interference with pending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of individuals to a fair trial."[tpl]cite book|last=Fixx|first=James F.|title=The Great Contemporary Issues: The Mass Media and Politics|year=1972|publisher=Ayer Co.

==Aftermath==

===Secret Service===

The specific findings prompted the Secret Service to make numerous modifications to its security procedures.[tpl]cite news|title=(Warren Commission) Rebukes Secret Service, Asks Revamping|first=Felix|last=Belair Jr.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 28, 1964|page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Johnson Names 4 to Act on Report|author=Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 28, 1964|page=1[/tpl]

===Commission records===

In November 1964, two months after the publication of its 889-page report, the Commission published twenty-six volumes of supporting documents, including the testimony or depositions of 552 witnesses and more than 3,100 exhibits.[tpl]cite news|title=Kennedy Slaying Relived in Detail in Warren Files|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Anthony|last=Lewis|date=November 24, 1964|page=1[/tpl] All of the commission's records were then transferred on November 23 to the National Archives. The unpublished portion of those records was initially sealed for 75 years (to 2039) under a general National Archives policy that applied to all federal investigations by the executive branch of government,[tpl]harvnb|Bugliosi|2007|pages=136–137[/tpl] a period "intended to serve as protection for innocent persons who could otherwise be damaged because of their relationship with participants in the case.”National Archives Deputy  Dr. Robert Bahmer, interview in New York Herald Tribune, December 18, 1964, p.24 The 75-year rule no longer exists, supplanted by the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and the JFK Records Act of 1992. By 1992, 98 percent of the Warren Commission records had been released to the public.Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board (1998), p.2. Six years later, at the conclusion of the Assassination Records Review Board's work, all Warren Commission records, except those records that contained tax return information, were available to the public with redactions.ARRB Final Report, p. 2. Redacted text includes the names of living intelligence sources, intelligence gathering methods still used today and not commonly known, and purely private matters. The Kennedy autopsy photographs and X-rays were never part of the Warren Commission records, and were deeded separately to the National Archives by the Kennedy family in 1966 under restricted conditions. The remaining Kennedy assassination related documents are scheduled to be released to the public by 2017, twenty-five years after the passage of the JFK Records Act."Unless the president certifies that continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations, and the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.” — JFK Records Act. Both the National Archives and the former chairman of the ARRB estimate that 7.6 percent of all identified Kennedy assassination records have been released kent to the public. The great majority of the unreleased records are from subsequent investigations, including the Rockefeller Commission, the Church Committee, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations.
In 1992, the Assassination Records Review Board was created by the JFK Records Act to collect and preserve the documents relating to the assassination. It pointed out in its final report:

===Criticisms===

In the years following the release of its report and 26 investigatory evidence volumes in 1964, the Warren Commission has been frequently criticized for some of its methods, important omissions, and conclusions.
In a 2013 interview Robert Kennedy Jr. said his father Attorney General Robert Kennedy who publicly supported the commission privately felt it was a "shoddy piece of craftsmanship." children speak about JFK assassination AP published by USA today 

====Witness testimony====

There were many criticisms about the witnesses and their testimonies. One is that many testimonies were heard by less than half of the commission in person and that only one of 94 testimonies was heard in person by everyone on the commission.  However, all on the commission had access to all of the testimony.[tpl]Citation needed|date = September 2012[/tpl]

===Other investigations===

Three other U.S. government investigations have agreed with the Warren Commission's conclusion that two shots struck JFK from the rear: the 1968 panel set by Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the 1975 Rockefeller Commission, and the 1978-79 House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which reexamined the evidence with the help of the largest forensics panel. The HSCA involved Congressional hearings and ultimately concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, probably as the result of a conspiracy.  The HSCA concluded that Oswald fired shots number one, two, and four, and that an unknown assassin fired shot number three (but missed) from near the corner of a picket fence that was above and to President Kennedy's right front on the Dealey Plaza grassy knoll. However, this conclusion has also been criticized, especially for its reliance upon disputed acoustic evidence. The HSCA Final Report in 1979 did agree with the Warren Report's conclusion in 1964 that two bullets caused all of President Kennedy's and Governor Connally's injuries, and that both bullets were fired by Oswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.HSCA Final Report, pp. 41-46.
As part of its investigation, the HSCA also evaluated the performance of the Warren Commission, which included interviews and public testimony from the two surviving Commission members (Ford and McCloy) and various Commission legal counsel staff. The Committee concluded in their final report that the Commission was reasonably thorough and acted in good faith, but failed to adequately address the possibility of conspiracy.
