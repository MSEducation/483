==History==

Lauda Air was established in April 1979 by former Formula One world motor racing champion, Niki Lauda, and started operations in 1985, initially operating as a charter and air taxi service.  One of the first jetliner types used by Lauda Air was the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 500 with these aircraft being leased from Romanian airline TAROM.  It opened its headquarters in the Lauda Air Building in Schwechat, Austria.99 "World Airline Directory;" Flight International; 27 March–2 April 1991; Head Office: Lauda Air Building, PO Box 56, 1300 Wien-Schwechat, Austria; accessed .  Scheduled operations were licenced and initiated in 1987; and in 1990 licences for international flights were obtained.[tpl]cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= Flight International | page= 105 | date= 2007-04-03[/tpl]  In 1989 Lauda started its first long-haul flights from Vienna to Sydney and Melbourne, via Bangkok.  In the 1990s, it started to fly its Sydney and Melbourne flights via Kuala Lumpur.  Daily flights to Dubai, Cuba, and Miami via Munich followed.
Lauda Air became a wholly owned subsidiary of Austrian Airlines in December 2000, and employed 35 as of March 2007.  In 2005 the flight operation merged with Austrian Airlines, and the label, "Lauda Air" operated charter flights within the Austrian Airlines Group.
At an AAG board meeting in November 2006, plans were approved to retire the Airbus wide-bodied fleet by mid-2007, to concentrate on a Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 fleet.  As a result of subsequent fleet cuts, Austrian Airlines suspended some long-haul services and Lauda Air withdrew from the long-haul charter market over the next year.Airliner World; January 2007  This led to a refocus on the short/medium haul market, and led to the addition of a 737-800 to take over most of the charter routes.
Lauda Air was officially merged into Austrian Airlines on 1 July 2012.[tpl]Citation | title = Austrian bids farewell to the 737 | journal = Airliner World | pages = p6 | date = June 2013 | year = 2013 [/tpl]
The brand was retired at the start of the summer flight schedule on 31 March 2013, and was replaced by "Austrian myHoliday". It is no longer an airline but branding that is used to sell Austrian Airlines' own leisure offers.
