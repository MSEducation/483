==History==

Grahams Hi-Fi was founded in 1929 as Grahams Electrical, and opened a specialist hi-fi department in 1967.
In 1969 Grahams took over a warehouse-style building in Pentonville Road, Islington on the edge of the City of London. After developing this site to include three demonstration rooms, in 1989 the store moved to a new building in Canonbury Yard. The new site is a purpose-built facility which is built principally on one floor for wheelchair access and has four air-conditioned listening studios.
In 2002 Arena Magazine described Grahams Hi-Fi as "One of the five best hi-fi shops in the world."http://www.linnrecords.com/news-Maeve-O-Boyle-wows-at-london-gig.aspx
In 2009 the store hosted a demo evening for the latest Linn Products music system. Maeve O'Boyle performed at the store to demonstrate Linn's newest DS players.http://www.linnrecords.com/news-Maeve-O-Boyle-performs-at-Grahams-Hi-fi-.aspx
