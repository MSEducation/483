After the fall of the Empire a triumvirate called the Supreme Executive Power was created. The provisional government would be responsible for the creation of the Federal Republic, and it was in effect from April 1, 1823 to October 10, 1824.[tpl]cite web |title=El Viajero en México (Pág. 30)|url=http://cdigital.dgb.uanl.mx/la/1020004349/1020004349_004.pdf|publisher=CDigital|accessdate=October 5, 2010[/tpl]
Unrest in the provinces was huge. On May 21, 1823, The Founding Plan of the Federal Republic was enacted. Its sixth article precisely stated, "The component parts of the Republic are free, sovereign and independent States in that which touches internal administration and government".[tpl]cite web |title=División Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (1810-1995) Pag.21|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf|publisher=INEGI|accessdate=October 5, 2010[/tpl] Most of the Free States which were invited to form the Federal Republic joined the Union, except for the former Captaincy General of Guatemala which formed their own Federal Republic.[tpl]cite web |title=01 de julio de 1823.

On January 31, 1824, the decree to create a Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation was issued, which incorporated the basic structure of the Federal Republic. It was determined that the criteria for inviting states to the federation should be that they "...not be so few that through expansion and wealth in a few years they be able to aspire to constitute themselves as independent nations, breaking the federal bond, nor so many that through lack of manpower and resources the system should come to be unworkable."[tpl]cite news | title=Acta constitucional presentada al soberano Congreso Constituyente por su comisión. | url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1823_122/Acta_constitucional_presentada_al_soberano_Congres_183.shtml| language =Spanish[/tpl]
Between 1823 and 1824, some of the free states created their own constitutions and others had already installed a Constituent Congress. Special cases were those of Yucatan, which on December 23, 1823 decided to join the federation but as a Federated Republic, and Chiapas, which decided by referendum to join the federation on September 14, 1824.[tpl]cite news | title=Aniversario de la Federación de Chiapas a México | url=http://www.blogsentrelagente.com.mx/blog_home.asp?idU=230&idP=5871| language =Spanish[/tpl]
