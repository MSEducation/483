[[1905]]

CATEGORIES: 1905

Year 1905 (MCMV) was a common year starting on Sunday (link will display full calendar) of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Saturday of the 13-day-slower Julian calendar.

==Overview==

As the second year of the massive Russo-Japanese War begins, more than 100,000 die in the largest world battles of that era, and the war chaos leads to a revolution against the Tsar. (Shostakovich's 11th Symphony is subtitled "The Year 1905" to commemorate this.)  Canada and the U.S. expand west, with the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces and the founding of Las Vegas, Nevada. 1905 is also the annus mirabilis of Albert Einstein, publishing papers which lay the foundations of quantum physics, introduced the special theory of relativity, explained Brownian motion, and established mass-energy equivalence.
