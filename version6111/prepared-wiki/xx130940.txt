Polo is among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games, and was held five times between 1900 and 1936. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when competitions in polo and other equestrian events (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be separate sports) were held.[tpl]cite web|author=Kubatko, Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/POL/|title=Polo|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=February 13, 2010|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Olympic Equestrian: The Sports and the Stories from Stockholm to Sydney|author=Bryant, Jennifer O.|year=2000|publisher=The Blood-Horse, Inc|location=Canada|isbn=1-58150-044-0|pages=24â€“25[/tpl]
