Conectiva was a company founded on August 28, 1995, in Curitiba, Paran√°, Brazil, by a group of friends, among them Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, who was a pioneer in the distribution of Linux and open source software in Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and English for all of Latin America.

In addition, the company provided consulting services, training and technical support in all of Latin America through its own service centers and certified partners.
