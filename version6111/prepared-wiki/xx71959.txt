==Early life==

Robbins was born in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, United States (U.S.) to George Thomas Robbins and Katherine Belle Robinson, and both of his grandfathers were Baptist preachers. The Robbins family resided in Blowing Rock before moving to Richmond, Virginia when the author was still a young boy.[tpl]cite news|title=A look at author Tom Robbins|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/books/news/03/10/tom.robbins/|accessdate=27 April 2013|newspaper=CNN.com|date=10 March 2000|author=Tracy Johnson[/tpl] As an adult, Robbins has described his young self as a "hillbilly."[tpl]cite web|title=Tom Robbins|url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/robbins.html|work=January Magazine|publisher=January Magazine|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=Linda L.

Robbins attended Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, where he won the Senior Essay Medal. The following year he enrolled at Washington and Lee University to major in journalism, leaving at the end of his sophomore year after being disciplined by his fraternity for bad behavior and failing to earn a letter in basketball.
In 1953, he enlisted in the Air Force after receiving his draft notice, spending a year as a meteorologist in Korea, followed by two years in the Special Weather Intelligence unit of the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska. He was discharged in 1957 and returned to Richmond, Virginia, where his poetry readings at the Rhinoceros Coffee House led to a reputation among the local bohemian scene.

==Early media work==

In late 1957, Robbins enrolled at Richmond Professional Institute, a school of art, drama, and music, which later became Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). He served as an editor and columnist for the college newspaper, Proscript, from 1958-1959.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/rps | title=RPI Student Newspapers | publisher=VCU Libraries | accessdate=2013-06-06 [/tpl] He also worked nights on the sports desk of the daily Richmond Times-Dispatch.  After graduating with honors from VCU in 1959 and indulging in some hitchhiking, Robbins joined the staff of the Times-Dispatch as a copy editor.
In 1962, Robbins moved to Seattle to seek an M.A. at the Far East Institute of the University of Washington.  During the next five years in Seattle (minus a year spent in New York city researching a book on the painter, Jackson Pollock) he worked for the Seattle Times as an art critic. In 1965, he wrote a column on the arts for Seattle Magazine.  Also during this time, he hosted a weekly "underground" radio show at non-commercial KRAB-FM.  It was in 1967, while writing a review of the rock band The Doors, that Robbins says he found his literary voice. Robbins would remain in Seattle, on and off, for the following forty years.

==Writing career==

In 1967, Robbins moved to South Bend, Washington, where he wrote his first novel. In 1970, Robbins moved to La Conner, Washington, and it was at his home on Second Street that he subsequently authored nine books (although, in the late 1990s, he spent two years living on the Swinomish Indian reservation).
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Robbins regularly published articles and essays in Esquire magazine,[tpl]cite web|title=TOM ROBBINS, writing in Esquire magazine about a C...|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/rzn20g00|work=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=You Gotta Have Soul - by Tom Robbins|url=http://www.universalmetropolis.com/magazine/articles.php?articleid=915|work=UMagazine & Universal Metropolis|publisher=UMagazine & Universal Metropolis|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Author Name Vollmann, William; Pynchon, Thomas; Robbins, Tom; Robbins, Harold; et. al.|url=http://www.opcit.com/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=3796|work=opcit.com|publisher=ChrisLands.com|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] and also contributed to Playboy, The New York Times,[tpl]cite news|title=Zen-like wisdom from Tom Robbins|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/11/entertainment/et-book11|accessdate=27 April 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=11 October 2005|author=Bernadette Murphy[/tpl] and GQ.[tpl]cite news|title=Tom Robbins' bold imagination soars in `Wild Ducks'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-14/features/0510140089_1_wild-ducks-flying-backward-short-writings-tom-robbins|accessdate=27 April 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=14 October 2005|author=Jessie Milligan[/tpl]
Michael Dare described Robbins' writing style in the following manner: "When he starts a novel, it works like this. First he writes a sentence. Then he rewrites it again and again, examining each word, making sure of its perfection, finely honing each phrase until it reverberates with the subtle texture of the infinite. Sometimes it takes hours. Sometimes an entire day is devoted to one sentence, which gets marked on and expanded upon in every possible direction until he is satisfied. Then, and only then, does he add a period."[tpl]cite web|title=Emulsional Problems: How to Write Like Tom Robbins|url=http://www.dareland.com/emulsionalproblems/robbins.htm|work=Dareland|publisher=Michael Dare|accessdate=15 August 2012|author=Michael Dare|year=2002[/tpl] When Robbins was asked to explain his "gift" for storytelling in 2002, he replied:
 
 I'm descended from a long line of preachers and policemen. Now, it's common knowledge that cops are congenital liars, and evangelists spend their lives telling fantastic tales in such a way as to convince otherwise rational people that they're factual. So, I guess I come by my narrative inclinations naturally.[tpl]cite web|title=THE GREEN MAN: TOM ROBBINS|url=http://hightimes.com/read/green-man-tom-robbins|work=High Times|publisher=High Times|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=Gregory Daurer|date=12 June 2002[/tpl]
