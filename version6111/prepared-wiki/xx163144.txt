==Route description==

Route 348 begins at an intersection with the southbound lanes of the divided Route 435 in Roaring Brook Township. The route progresses northeastward as the Luzerne and Wayne County Pike through woodlands just north of Interstate 84. The two-lane road parallels the nearby interstate into a small residential area along the north side of the highway. Both roads make a curve to the east and enter downtown Mount Cobb, Pennsylvania, a neighborhood of Jefferson Township.
Through Mount Cobb, Route 348 intersects with Route 247 and changes names to Mount Cobb Road. Crossing through several local residences and businesses, Route 348 curves eastward out of Mount Cobb, following a stretch of residences into the hamlet of Elmdale. In Elmdale, the route crosses over Wallenpaupack Creek and turns to the southeast. After an intersection with Old Mill Road, Route 348 crosses from Lackawanna County into Wayne County and changes names to the Mount Cobb Highway. A short distance over the county line, Route 348 passes north of the hamlet of Hollisterville and ends at a merge with Route 590, which continues on the right-of-way as the Hamlin Highway.[tpl]bing maps|title=Overview map of Pennsylvania State Route 348|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/#Y3A9cXd5cm44OHEzcmtuJmx2bD0xNyZzdHk9YiZydHA9cG9zLjQxLjM5MTAwNTAxMjM3MDI5Xy03NS41NTMxMzg2NjEzNzY5M19fX19hX35wb3MuNDEuNDA5ODU4ODY4NTAwOTdfLTc1LjUwNDk0MjgzNDM3NzI1X25lYXIlMjAxMTk5JTIwTW91bnQlMjBDb2JiJTIwUmQlMkMlMjBKZWZmZXJzb24lMjBUb3duc2hpcCUyQyUyMFBBJTIwMTg0MzYtMzMwMF9fX2FffnBvcy40MS40MDUwMDg0MTUwNjg3MzVfLTc1LjQyODA3MDI2NzM4ODgzX25lYXIlMjAyMzclMjBNb3VudCUyMENvYmIlMjBId3klMkMlMjBMYWtlJTIwQXJpZWwlMkMlMjBQQSUyMDE4NDM2X19fYV8mbW9kZT1EJnJ0b3A9MH4wfjB+[/tpl]
