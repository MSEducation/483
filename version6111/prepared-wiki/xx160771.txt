She was at Bank Street College of Education as Senior Research Associate, 1958–1965, and at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the social sciences department, 1963–1972. She struggled to get a full-time job. She taught as an adjunct for decades before taking a full-time job as a professor of anthropology at City College and Graduate Faculty of City University of New York in 1972. Her appointment occurred after writing her celebrated introduction to Frederick Engels' The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State. She resuscitated Engels' theory that linked the domination of women to the rise of classes and the state in which he termed as "the historic defeat of the female sex."Engels, Frederick, 1972 1888, Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State, NY: International Publishers, pp. 120-121.
One of Leacock's most fruitful contributions to the field of anthropology was her essay entitled, "Interpreting the Origins of Gender Inequality: Conceptual and Historical Problems" (1983). Throughout this essay, she discusses gender inequalities.  
Leacock died in 1987 in Hawai'i.
