==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Curt Swan, whose Swedish grandmother had shortened the original family name of Swanson, was the youngest of five children. Father John Swan worked for the railroads; mother Leotine Hanson had worked in a local hospital.Harrington, Wallace. Curt Swan, Superman Super Site. Accessed March 28, 2009. As a boy, Swan's given name — Douglas — was shortened to "Doug," and, disliking the phonetic similarity to "Dog," Swan thereafter reversed the order of his given names and went by "Curtis Douglas," rather than "Douglas Curtis."Swan's former wife Helene, in [tpl]cite book|last = Zeno|first = Eddy.|chapter= Helene Swan|title = Curt Swan A Life in Comics|publisher = Vanguard Productions|year = 2002|page = 56|isbn = 978-1887591393[/tpl]
Having enlisted in Minnesota's National Guard's 135th Regiment, 34th Division in 1940, Swan was sent to Europe when the "federalized" division was shipped initially to Northern Ireland and Scotland. While his comrades in the 34th eventually went into combat in North Africa and Italy, Swan spent most of World War II working as an artist for the G.I. magazine Stars and Stripes. While at Stars and Stripes, Swan met writer France Herron, who eventually directed him to DC Comics.Zeno "The First Fifteen Years", p. 10
During this period Swan married the former Helene Brickley, who he had met at a dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and who was stationed near him in Paris in 1944 as a Red Cross worker; they were married in Paris the following year. Shortly after returning to civilian life in 1945 he moved from Minnesota to New Jersey and began working for DC Comics.[tpl]gcdb|type=credit|search=Curt+Swan[/tpl] Apart from a few months of night classes at the Pratt Institute under the G.I. Bill, Swan was an entirely self-taught artist.Zeno "The First Fifteen Years", p. 17 After a stint on Boy Commandos he began to just pencil pages, leaving the inking to others.

===Superman===

Initially, Swan drew many different features, including "Tommy Tomorrow" and "Gangbusters", but slowly he began gravitating towards the Superman line of books. His first job pencilling the iconic character was for Superman #51 (March–April 1948).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/curt_swan/|title= Curt Swan: A Superman Walked Among Us|first= Paul|last= Gravett|authorlink = Paul Gravett|year= 2002|publisher= Comic Book Marketplace |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120414122242/http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/curt_swan|archivedate= April 14, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/swan_curt.htm|title= Curt Swan|year= 2012|publisher= Lambiek Comiclopedia|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120921224905/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/swan_curt.htm|archivedate= September 21, 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl] Many comics of the 1940s and 1950s lacked contributor credits, but research shows that Swan began pencilling the Superboy series with its fifth issue in 1949.Zeno "The First Fifteen Years", p. 13 Swan always felt that his breakthrough came when he was assigned the art duties on Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen, in 1954.Zeno "The First Fifteen Years", p. 16
Swan didn't take to line editor Mort Weisinger's controlling style. Swan discussed this period in an interview: "I was getting terrible migraine headaches and had these verbal battles with Mort. So it was emotional, physical. It just drained me and I thought I'd better get out of here before I go whacko." After leaving comics for the advertising world in 1951, Swan soon returned, for National's higher paychecks. And as biographer Zeno notes, "The headaches went away after Swan gained Weisinger's respect by standing up to him."Zeno "The First Fifteen Years", p. 16 
Around 1954, Swan unsuccessfully pitched an original comic strip for newspaper syndication. Called Yellow Hair, it was about a blond boy raised by Native Americans.Zeno, p. 158 A couple of years later, starting with the episode of June 18, 1956, Swan drew the Superman daily newspaper comic strip, which he continued on until November 12, 1960.Zeno "Swan and the Superman Newspaper Strip", p. 46 
In the view of comics historian Les Daniels, Swan became the definitive artist of Superman in the early 1960s with a "new look" to the character that replaced Wayne Boring's version.[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|chapter= The Superman Family Strength in Numbers|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|publisher = Bulfinch Press|year = 1995|page = 118|isbn = 0821220764|quote= By 1961, Swan's new look would replace Wayne Boring's patriarchal version. Swan's Superman became definitive, and ultimately he would draw, as he says, 'more Superman stories than anybody else.'[/tpl] Swan and writer Jim Shooter crafted the story "Superman's Race With the Flash!" in Superman #199 (Aug. 1967) which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their super-speed powers.[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 124 |quote = Since the dawn of comics' Silver Age, readers have asked 'Who's faster: Superman or the Flash?' Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan tried answering that question when the Man of Steel and the Fastest Man Alive agreed to the U.N.'s request to race each other for charity. [/tpl] Over the years, Swan was a remarkably consistent and prolific artist, often illustrating two or more titles per month. Swan remained as artist of Superman when Julius Schwartz became the editor of the title with issue #233 (Jan. 1971), and writer Denny O'Neil streamlined the Superman mythos, starting with the elimination of Kryptonite.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 144 "New editor Julius Schwartz, new scripter Denny O'Neil, and regular artist Curt Swan removed the Man of Steel's greatest weakness from the face of the Earth." Among Swan's contributions to the Superman mythos, he and writer Cary Bates co-created the supervillains Terra-ManMcAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 150: "Scripter Cary Bates and artist Curt Swan chose an inopportune time for Superman to meet Terra-Man, a spaghetti Western-garbed menace who rode a winged horse and wielded lethal alien weaponry." and the 1970s version of the ToymanMcAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 158: "Writer Cary Bates and artist Curt Swan gave Superman all the 'fun' he could handle with the savvy new Toyman in Action Comics #432." as well as the superhero Vartox.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 161: "Fans of John Boorman's 1974 sci-fi film Zardoz, starring Sean Connery in revealing red spandex, could appreciate writer Cary Bates and artist Curt Swan's inspiration for Vartox of Valeron." Writer Martin Pasko and Swan created the Master Jailer character in Superman #331(January 1979).McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 180: "Writer Martin Pasko and artist Curt Swan introduced...the Master Jailer."

===Later life and career===

After DC's 1985 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths and with the impending 1986 revision of Superman by writer/artist John Byrne, Swan was released from his duties on the Superman comics. Critic Wallace Harrington summed up Swan's dismissal this way:
Swan's last work as regular artist on Superman was the non-canonical 1986 story "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?", written by Alan Moore.Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 220: "In 'Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?', a two-part story written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Curt Swan, the adventures of the Silver Age Superman came to a dramatic close."
After this, Swan continued to do occasional minor projects for DC, including the artwork of what is thought to be one of the rarest Superman comics ever published, titled "This Island Bradman" (written by David P. Levin), a comic book that was privately commissioned in 1988 by real estate tycoon Godfrey Bradman as a Bar Mitzvah gift for his son,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.recalledcomics.com/SupermanBradman.php|title=Rare Comics[/tpl] as well as an Aquaman limited series and special in 1989, and various returns on illustrating Superman. 
In 1995, Swan did four illustrations for Penthouse Comix[tpl]cite comic|writer= Niven, Larry|penciller= Swan, Curt|inker= Swan, Curt|story= Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex|title= Penthouse Comix|issue= 5|date= January–February 1995| publisher= Penthouse| page= | panel= [/tpl] for the Larry Niven essay "Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex," which detailed the problems that Superman would face in having sexual intercourse and reproducing with a human woman, using arguments based on humorous yet logical reconciliations between physics, biology, and the abilities of Kryptonians as presented in the Superman comic books.
Swan's swan song was five pages published posthumously in the 1996 special Superman: The Wedding Album.Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 275: " The behind-the-scenes talent on the monumental issue appropriately spanned several generations of the Man of Tomorrow's career.  Written by Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, David Michelinie, Louise Simonson, and Roger Stern, the one-shot featured the pencils of John Byrne, Gil Kane, Stuart Immonen, Paul Ryan, Jon Bogdanove, Kieron Dwyer, Tom Grummett, Dick Giordano, Jim Mooney, Curt Swan, Nick Cardy, Al Plastino, Barry Kitson, Ron Frenz, and Dan Jurgens."  
Swan was residing in Wilton, Connecticut, at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife Helene, daughters Karin and Cecilia, and son Christopher Curtis. Helene Swan died at the age of 91 on January 27, 2012.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.acorn-online.com/joomla15/ncadvertiser/news/obits/113563-helene-r-swan-91-real-estate-agent-traveler.html|title= Helene R.

==Art style==

Critic Arlen Schumer praises Swan's ability to depict "the spectrum of human emotion, from agony to anger, mournful to mirthful."Arlen Schumer in Zeno "The Curt Swan Gallery", p. 100 As characterized by critic Paul Gravett, Swan's Superman made ". . . Krypton's last son in exile, the alien in our midst, into someone like us, who would think and feel as well as act, who was approachable, big-hearted, considerate, maybe physically superpowerful yet gentle, noble yet subtly tragic." In a similar vein, Swan biographer Eddy Zeno calls Swan "the Norman Rockwell of . . . comics."Zeno "Summation", p. 185 Critic Gary Groth remarked that "Swan is symptomatic of what the industry requires. They adore Swan at DC because they give Swan a script and it says 'Superman flies out the window'... and there's Superman flying out the window. The script says 'Clark Kent walking down the hall' and there's Clark Kent walking down a hall. He's just a technician who does exactly what's required of him."[tpl]cite news|last = Groth| first= Gary|date = Fall 1982|title = John Byrne at Dallas|work = The Comics Journal|issue = 75|pages = 62-74|publisher = Fantagraphics Books[/tpl]
With his frequent inker Murphy Anderson from 1970–1974 and 1988–1989, the pair's collaborative artwork came to be called "Swanderson" by the fans. Despite his and Anderson's success together, Swan's favorite inker was Al Williamson, with whom he only worked with for a short time, from 1985–1986.Zeno "New Glories in the '80s and '90s", p. 40

==Legacy==

In 1985, DC Comics named Swan as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great.[tpl]Cite comic|writer = Marx, Barry|cowriters = Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas|artist = Petruccio, Steven|editor = Marx, Barry|story = Curt Swan The Definitive Superman Realized|title = Fifty Who Made DC Great|date = 1985|publisher = DC Comics|page = 27[/tpl]
Swan's favorite story — one of the few he both pencilled and inked — was "I Flew With Superman" from Superman Annual #9 (1983), in which Swan himself appears and helps Superman solve a case.
In a story titled "Swan's Way," issue #92 of the Legion of Super-heroes (May 1997) memorialized Swan with a cameo appearance as an art teacher.
