==Football career==

Born in Azpeitia, Gipuzkoa, Aranburu made his professional debuts aged 18, in the last round of the 1996–97 campaign against CD Logroñés, courtesy of manager Javier Irureta. From his fourth season onwards he became a full member of the main squad, being essential as the Basque finished second in La Liga in 2002–03 by contributing with 34 games and two goals.
Aranburu was seriously injured during 2005–06, and returned to major action only to see Real get relegated in the following season, the first time in 40 years. He continued to be an important first-team member during the second division campaigns, appearing in 35 matches in 2009–10 as the Txuriurdin returned to the top level after three years.
In the 2010–11 campaign Aranburu was once again first-choice, partnering Diego Rivas in central defensive midfield in most of the games. He equalled a career-best five goals, including two in a 4–0 away win against Getafe CF – he only played five minutes in the gameFour-star Sociedad batter Getafe; ESPN Soccernet, 15 January 2011– and the all-important last-minute winner at home against Real Zaragoza in the 36th round (2–1),Aranburu the hero for Sociedad; ESPN Soccernet, 11 May 2011 as Sociedad narrowly retained its division status.
