[[Communal aggregation]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins, Chemical bonding

Communal aggregation is the phenomenon of aggregation of the hydrophobic proteins to come closer and form the bonding between them, so as to reduce the total area exposed to water. It is a very common problem with the hydrophobic protein to make aggregates. Such aggregates hamper the filtration process by cake formation.
