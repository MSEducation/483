[[HP-18C]]

CATEGORIES: HP calculators

The HP-18C was a Hewlett-Packard business calculator which was quickly followed by the very similar but greatly improved HP-19B.  The HP-18C was HP's first RPL-based calculator even though this model was not user programmable.  The user did have a solver (another HP first) available, but only had about 1.5 K of continuous memory available to store equations. 
The calculator had many functions buried in a menu structure. The clamshell design was fairly robust, but the battery door is the Achilles' heel of this whole line; 18C, 19B, and 28C/S.
The HP-18C was introduced in 1986.
