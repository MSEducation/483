==History==

In early 1962, Omagh St. Enda's club purchased [tpl]convert|13|acre|m2[/tpl] of land at Lisnelly located near the Gortin Road. By 1968 the club had raised enough money to start construction of the new stadium. The park was eventually opened on 17 September 1972, by former GAA president Alf Murray and on the 19th of October 1980, the new park was dedicated to Micheal Healy. The two years between 1980 and 1982 saw the fruitation of the new clubrooms and social centre at Healy Park, which added further to the infrastructure of Healy Park. 1994 saw the terracing added to three sides of the pitch.Omagh St. Endas Club History (published 1982)

==Redevelopment==

Work began in September 2001 to build a new all-seated covered stand with a capacity of 5,000. The stand was opened in 2004.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/6197863.stm |title=Healy Park to get a second stand |work=BBC online |accessdate=2008-04-02  | date=20 December 2006[/tpl]

New changing rooms and disabled facilities have also been installed.http://www.omaghstendas.com/ocms/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=117

==Plans==

Tyrone GAA has unveiled plans for a second covered stand at Healy Park as the board feels it is time for additional covered and seated accommodation. They also plan to expand the ends behind both goals. Work has already started on the second phase of a £5m redevelopment scheme.
