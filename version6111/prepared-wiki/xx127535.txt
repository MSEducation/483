===Professional===

Johnson was drafted in the third round, 26th overall, by Real Salt Lake in the 2006 MLS SuperDraft. On July 25, 2006, Johnson was traded to the Chicago Fire, after only appearing in 7 matches with Salt Lake. In the remainder of the 2006 season, Johnson played 3 matches for the Fire and failed to agree on a new contract with the team at season's end.
In early 2007, he was trialing with various teams in Scandinavia and eventually got a short-term contract with Swedish side Östers IF (then at Superettan), that stretched from March 2007 to July 2007. Because of Östers' then surplus of centre forwards and their then lack of a natural second striker, they chose not to extend his contract any further and instead loaned Anatolij Ponomarev from GAIS. In 2007 he was on a trial in FK Bodø/Glimt where he played one game against Leknes FK. He scored the last goal in the 8-1 win.
After a short stint playing indoor soccer with the New Jersey Ironmen, Johnson signed with the San Jose Earthquakes for the 2008 MLS season.  At the end of the 2009 MLS season, Johnson was named team MVP as the team's leading goalscorer.
On July 14, 2011, the San Jose Earthquakes traded Johnson, an international roster spot and allocation money to Toronto FC for Nana Attakora, Alan Gordon and Jacob Peterson.http://www.torontofc.ca/news/2011/07/johnson-jumps-toronto On July 20 Johnson made his debut for Toronto in a 1-0 home loss to FC Dallas.New-Look Reds Sunk By Strike From Shea from TorontoFC.ca, Posted 20 July 2011.
