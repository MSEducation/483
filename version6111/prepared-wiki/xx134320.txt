CATEGORIES: Message-oriented middleware, Enterprise application integration

OpenGate is a communications platform designed to facilitate a fast development and deployment of robust wireless solutions, to be used as a M2M platform or as a mobile platform.
OpenGate acts as a data gateway between remote devices and the applications that need to send and receive information to and from those devices. Making use of a very simple interface and thanks to the Internet, GSM/GPRS and UMTS, OpenGate lowers the cost and the complexity of the implementation of wireless solutions, unifying the language of every connected device.
OpenGate has been designed to allow M2M and Mobile developers to concentrate on data exchange and data processing, instead of worrying about obtaining data in a secure and reliable way.

==Middleware architecture==

OpenGate implements a distributed architecture designed to provide tools and functions for the development and deployment of GSM/GPRS/UMTS based wireless solutions. This architecture presents several components:

==Communications==

In order to provide communication services to applications and devices, OpenGate provides features like:

==Integration==

===Corporate Application Integration===

OpenGate provides integration mechanisms to get devices talk with corporate (existing or new) applications. In order to allow these integration processes, OpenGate has the following mechanisms:

===Device integration===

OpenGate provides different Agents, that run as pieces of software on different devices. These agents will take care of the communications with the platform, and are provided as programming libraries, in order to let developers integrate it into their embedded applications.
The OpenGate agents will reduce development effort, given that all the communication features are managed by the agent, so the developer will only take care of the business logic inside the device.

==Developing with OpenGate==

OpenGate is an open platform that helps to integrate wireless applications using a proprietary SDK. These development tools have been designed for:
In order to do this, OpenGate offers a set of APIs, Integrators and tools that are designed to facilitate the deployment tasks with the goal of reducing the development costs of the solution.
OpenGate's SDK provides several integration mechanisms:
OpenGate has, as well, a set of tools oriented to developers:
