==Genomes and transcriptomes==

Two choanoflagellate species have had their genomes fully sequenced, with a further two species having had transcriptome data published.

===Monosiga brevicollis genome===

The genome of Monosiga brevicollis, with 41.6 million base pairs, is similar in size to filamentous fungi and other free-living unicellular eukaryotes, but far smaller than that of typical animals. Recently, a phylogenomic study revealed that several algal genes are present in the genome of Monosiga brevicollis. This could be due to the fact that in early evolutionary history, choanoflagellates consumed algae as food through phagocytosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sun|first=Guiling|coauthors=Arjun Ishwar, Zefeng Yang, Jinling Huang|title=Algal genes in the closest relatives of animals|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=July 13, 2010|volume=27|issue=12|doi=10.1093/molbev/msq175|pmid=20627874|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/12/2879.abstract|pages=2879–89[/tpl]

===Salpingoeca rosetta genome===

The genome is 55 megabases in size.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fairclough |first=S. R. |last2=et al. |year=2013 |title=Premetazoan genome evolution and the regulation of cell differentiation in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta |journal=Genome Biol |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=R15 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-2-r15 |first2=Zehua |last3=Kramer |first3=Eric |last4=Zeng |first4=Qiandong |last5=Young |first5=Sarah |last6=Robertson |first6=Hugh M |last7=Begovic |first7=Emina |last8=Richter |first8=Daniel J |last9=Russ |first9=Carsten |last10=Westbrook |first10=M Jody |last11=Manning |first11=Gerard |last12=Lang |first12=B Franz |last13=Haas |first13=Brian |last14=Nusbaum |first14=Chad |last15=King |first15=Nicole |display-authors=8 [/tpl] Homologs of cell adhesion, neuropeptide and glycosphingolipid metabolism genes are present in the genome.

===Monosiga ovata transcriptome===

An EST dataset from Monosiga ovata was published in 2006.[tpl]cite journal|last=Snell|first=Elizabeth A|coauthors=Nina M Brooke, William R Taylor, Didier Casane, Hervé Philippe,Peter W.H Holland|title=An unusual choanoflagellate protein released by Hedgehog autocatalytic processing|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|date=February 22, 2006|volume=273|issue=1585|pages=401–407| doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3263 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/273/1585/401.abstract|pmid=16615205|pmc=1560198[/tpl] The major finding of this transcriptome was the choanoflagellate Hoglet domain and shed light on the role of domain shuffling in the evolution of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.

===Stephanoeca diplocostata transcriptome===

The first transcriptome of a loricate choanoflagellate  led to the discovery of choanoflagellate silicon transporters. Subsequently, similar genes were identified in a second loricate species, Diaphanoeca grandis. Analysis of these genes found that the choanoflagellate SITs show homology to the SIT-type silicon transporters of diatoms and have evolved through horizontal gene transfer.
