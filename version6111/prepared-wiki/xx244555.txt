==Reviews==

===CNET===

Grindstone 2 received five out of five stars on CNET's Editor Review scale. "We were impressed with Grindstone 2's performance and pleased by its extras. It's easy to use but does a lot, so the excellent Help file, online forums, and video tutorials go a long way toward getting the most out of all that this fine free tool offers."Grindstone Download.com. CNET. Retrieved 2010-11-14.

===PCWorld===

PCWorld's review of Grindstone 2 focused on its functionality and features, calling them "incredibly simple, yet incredibly efficient." However, PCWorld's editors did indict Grindstone 2 for having a less than entertaining graphical user interface. "Once you delve into the app, its power becomes apparent, as does it ability to help you manage your time, but with its bland design, Grindstone can feel about as appealing as work."Grindstone PCWorld.com.
