==History==

The FCC granted an original construction permit on June 20, 1994 for a low-power television station on channel 43 to serve the Cheyenne market. The permit for the station, given callsign K43CM, was awarded to Aracelis Ortiz of Faith Pleases God Church in Harlingen, Texas, operators of Spanish-language religious television stations. The permittee was not able to timely build the station, and the permit was canceled and callsign deleted. However, the FCC later renewed the construction permit, and in June 1998, Ortiz completed a sale of the permit to Daystar, who was granted a license for the station on October 25, 1999. The license for the station was upgraded to Class A on October 28, 2002. The station took the call letters KCHD-CA on June 17, 2006. The station's license was cancelled and its call sign deleted by the FCC on August 16, 2007.
