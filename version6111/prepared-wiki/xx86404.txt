[[Personal weapon]]

CATEGORIES: Personal weapons

A personal weapon or ordnance weapon is a weapon that is issued to an individual 
member of a military or paramilitary unit, e.g. to individual infantry soldiers, but also side arms carried by officers or other personnel.
These weapons in pre-modern contexts tend to be melee weapons (blade weapons or polearms), and in modern contexts usually firearms, but also blade weapons such as the bayonet or the officer's sword.
