CATEGORIES: Chemotherapy regimens

BEACOPP is a chemotherapy regimen for treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma developed by the German Hodgkin Study Group used for patients in Stages > II or early (IA or IB) with unfavorable risk factors.[tpl]cite journal|last=von Tresckow|first=Bastian|author2=et al.|title=Dose-Intensiﬁcation in Early Unfavorable Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the German Hodgkin Study Group HD14 Trial|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=March 20, 2012|volume=30|pages=907–913|doi=10.1200/JCO.2011.38.5807|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/9/907.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl] 
Patients typically receive treatment in cycles of 21 days with no drugs given on days 15-21.See HD14 Redacted Trial Protocol, available at
There also exists a more intensive regimen with cycles of 14 days. Usually a course of BEACOPP therapy consists of four, sometimes six to eight cycles, or in combination with ABVD. 
In some countries BEACOPP still is experimental, in others (e.g. Germany and Austria) it is a standard therapy. In the United States, ABVD (or Stanford V) is generally given instead, because BEACOPP was thought to induce more secondary neoplasias (such as leukemias), although the final results from the GHSG HD14 trial indicate that "there
were no overall differences in treatment-related mortality or secondary malignancies" of BEACOPP relative to ABVD.
Some consider that the BEACOPP regimen is not generally given in the US for cost reasons:
However, BEACOPP delivers approximately 7% points success relative to ABVD for early unfavorable Hodgkin's disease (as measured five-year freedom from treatment failure) and 12% points greater success relative to ABVD for advanced Hodgkin's disease (Stage IIB with risk factors or stages III and IV) as measured by seven-year freedom from treatment failure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Viviani|first=Simonetta|author2=et al.|title=ABVD versus BEACOPP for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  When High-Dose Salvage Is Planned|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 21, 2011|volume=365|issue=3|pages=203–212[/tpl]
