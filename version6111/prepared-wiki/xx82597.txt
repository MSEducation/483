[[As Good as Dead]]

CATEGORIES: 1996 albums, Island Records albums, Local H albums

As Good as Dead is the second album released by Illinois-based alternative rock duo Local H. It was released in April 1996 on Island Records. 
As Good as Dead is notable for including some of Local H's most recognizable songs, including "High-Fiving MF", "Fritz's Corner", "Eddie Vedder", and the hit "Bound for the Floor". The album's title comes from a line in the song "Eddie Vedder". Some prints of the album received a Parental Advisory sticker perhaps due to the use of profanity in the song "High-Fiving MF" and some others.
