LAME is a free software codec used to encode/compress audio into the lossy MP3 file format.

==History==

The name LAME is a recursive acronym for "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder".[tpl]cite web|url=http://lame.sourceforge.net/about.php |title=LAME MP3 Encoder :: About |publisher=Lame.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17[/tpl]  Around mid-1998, Mike Cheng created LAME 1.0 as a set of modifications against the "8Hz-MP3" encoder source code. After some quality concerns raised by others, he decided to start again from scratch based on the "dist10" MPEG reference software sources. His goal was only to speed up the dist10 sources, and leave its quality untouched. That branch (a patch against the reference sources) became Lame 2.0. The project quickly became a team project. Mike Cheng eventually left leadership and started working on tooLAME (an MP2 encoder).
Mark Taylor then started pursuing increased quality in addition to better speed, and released version 3.0 featuring gpsycho, a new psychoacoustic model he developed.
A few key improvements, in chronological order:

==Patents and legal issues==

Like all MP3 encoders, LAME implements some technology covered by patents owned by the Fraunhofer Society and other entities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mp3licensing.com/ |title=Home |publisher=mp3licensing.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17[/tpl] The developers of LAME do not themselves license the technology described by these patents. Distributing compiled binaries of LAME, its libraries, or programs that derive from LAME in countries that recognize those patents may be patent infringing.
The LAME developers state that, since their code is only released in source code form, it should only be considered as an educational description of an MP3 encoder, and thus does not infringe any patent by itself when released as source code only. At the same time, they advise users to obtain a patent license for any relevant technologies that LAME may implement before including a compiled version of the encoder in a product.http://lame.sourceforge.net/tech-FAQ.txt Some software is released using this strategy:  companies use the LAME library, but obtain patent licenses.
In November 2005, there were reports that the Extended Copy Protection rootkit included on some Sony Compact Discs included portions of the LAME library without complying with the terms of the LGPL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176021,00.html|title=Sony BMG Software May Contain Open-Source Code|date=21 November 2005|authors=Reuters|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2011-11-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/52-Is-Sony-in-violation-of-the-LGPL-Part-II.html |title=Is Sony in violation of the LGPL? |publisher=The-interweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17[/tpl]Sony's XCP DRM[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
