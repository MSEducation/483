[[Noric language]]

CATEGORIES: Continental Celtic languages, Extinct Celtic languages, Languages of Austria, Languages of Slovenia

The Noric language or Eastern Celtic language was a Continental Celtic language. It is attested in only two fragmentary inscriptions from the Roman province of Noricum (one in Grafenstein, Austria, the other in Ptuj, Slovenia), which do not provide enough information for any conclusions about the nature of the language to be drawn. However, the language was probably similar to the other Celtic languages near to it, such as Gaulish. Due to the scanty evidence it is unknown when it became extinct.

==Ptuj inscription==

The Ptuj inscription, discovered in 1894, is written right to left in a northern Italic alphabet and reads:
This is interpreted as two personal names: Artebudz son of Brogduos.Encyclopédie de l'arbre celtique, Vase de Ptuj. Retrieved 2008-01-09. The name Artebudz may mean "bear penis"Il Vocabolario Celtico, p. 87, p. 89. Retrieved 2008-01-09. (compare Welsh [tpl]lang|cy|arth[/tpl] "bear" and Irish [tpl]lang|ga|bod[/tpl] "penis"), while Brogduos may contain the element brog-, mrog- "country"A. Falileyev, Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names. Retrieved 2008-01-09. (compare Welsh [tpl]lang|cy|bro[/tpl] "region, country").

==Grafenstein inscription==

The Grafenstein inscription, on a tile from the 2nd century AD that was discovered in a gravel pit in 1977, is incomplete, but the extant part has been transcribed as follows:David Stifter, 2007-10-12, Keltisch in Österreich (Powerpoint document), (PDF of lecture). Retrieved 2008-01-09.

Here, Moge seems to be a personal name or an abbreviation of one, P· II- lav a Latin abbreviation indicating a weight, ne sadiíes a verbal form possibly meaning "you (singular) do not set", ollo so perhaps "this amount", and Lugnu another personal name. The text may therefore be a record of some sort of financial transaction.
Other readings of the inscription have also been proposed, including:
