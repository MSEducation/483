[[Conversion of units]]

CATEGORIES: Units of measurement, Metrication, Conversion of units of measurement

Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.

==Techniques==

===Process===

The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose.  This may be governed by regulation, contract,  Technical specifications or other published standards.  Engineering judgment may include such factors as:
Some conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement.  This is sometimes called soft conversion.  It does not involve changing  the physical configuration of the item being measured.
By contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion  may not be exactly equivalent.  It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item.  Nominal values are sometimes allowed and used.

===Multiplication factors===

Conversion between units in the metric system can be discerned by their prefixes (for example, 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 1 milligram = 0.001 grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10−6 metre).

===Table ordering===

Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the SI units (base or derived) are highlighted.

==Tables of conversion factors==

This article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit.

===Length===

===Area===

===Volume===

===Plane angle===

===Solid angle===

===Mass===

Notes:

===Density===

===Time===

===Frequency===

===Speed or velocity===

A velocity consists of a speed combined with a direction; the speed part of the velocity takes units of speed.

===Flow (volume)===

===Acceleration===

===Force===

===Information entropy===

Often, information entropy is measured in shannons, whereas the (discrete) storage space of digital devices is measured in bits. Thus, uncompressed redundant data occupy more than one bit of storage per shannon of information entropy. The multiples of a bit listed above are usually used with this meaning. Other times the bit is used as a measure of information entropy and is thus a synonym of shannon.

===Luminous intensity===

The candela is the preferred nomenclature for the SI unit.

===Radiation - source activity===

Please note that although becquerel (Bq) and hertz (Hz) both ultimately refer to the same SI base unit (s−1), Hz is used only for periodic phenomena, and Bq is only used for stochastic processes associated with radioactivity.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/table3.html | title=The International System of Units, Section 2.2.2., Table 3 | edition=8 | publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures | year=2006 | accessdate=August 27, 2009[/tpl]

===Radiation - exposure===

The roentgen is not an SI unit and the NIST strongly discourages its continued use.[tpl]citation | url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#5.2 | title=The NIST Guide to the SI (Special Publication 811), section 5.2 | year=2008 | accessdate=August 27, 2009[/tpl]

===Radiation - absorbed dose===

===Radiation - equivalent dose===

Although the definitions for sievert (Sv) and gray (Gy) would seem to indicate that they measure the same quantities, this is not the case. The effect of receiving a certain dose of radiation (given as Gy) is variable and depends on many factors, thus a new unit was needed to denote the biological effectiveness of that dose on the body; this is known as the equivalent dose and is shown in Sv. The general relationship between absorbed dose and equivalent dose can be represented as
where H is the equivalent dose, D is the absorbed dose, and Q is a dimensionless quality factor. Thus, for any quantity of D measured in Gy, the numerical value for H measured in Sv may be different.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ | title=Comité international des poids et mesures, 2002, Recommendation 2 | accessdate=August 27, 2009[/tpl]

==Software tools==

Home and office computers come with converters in bundled spreadsheet applications or can access free converters via the Internet. Units and measurements can be easily converted using these tools, but only if the units are explicitly defined and the conversion is compatible (e.g., cmHg to kPa).

===General commercial sources of converters===

==In fiction==

When a measure is converted to another unit in a fiction work like a novel or film, the value often loses meaning (as in numerology) or gets too many significant digits ("40 miles" turns into "64 km"). For this reason, authors sometimes choose numbers that can be converted easily. Most notably, distances measured in miles often begin with 3 or 5, so the value converted to km also has one significant digit (5 or 8).
