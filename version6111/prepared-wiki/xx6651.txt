[[Local Group]]

The Local Group is the group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way among others. It comprises more than 54 galaxies, counting dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of [tpl]convert|10|Mly|Mpc|1|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] (see 1 E+23 m for distance comparisons) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group is estimated to have a total mass of 1.29±0.14 [tpl]e|12[/tpl] M☉ and has a velocity dispersion of 61±8 km/s.
The group itself is part of the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).
The two most massive members of the group are Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy. These two spiral galaxies each have a system of satellite galaxies. 

==History==

The term, "The Local Group" was introduced by Edwin Hubble in Chapter VI of his book The Realm of the Nebulae (Hubble 1936, pp. 124–151). There, he described it as "a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field." He delineated, by decreasing luminosity, its members to be M31, Milky Way, M33, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, M32, NGC 205, NGC 6822, NGC 185, IC 1613 and NGC 147. He also identified IC 10 as a possible Local Group member. By 2003, the number of known Local Group members has increased from his initial twelve to thirty-six by way of the discovery of almost two dozen low-luminosity galaxies.[ref]
