==Death==

She was found dead on November 29, 1892 on the exterior staircase leading to the beach, of what was believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  This was five days after checking into the Hotel del Coronado in Coronado.  A San Francisco lawyer, the late Alan May, speculated in the 1980s that her death involved foul play. Evidence for the alleged homicide was a passing statement (or misstatement), during the coroner's inquest, that the bullet found in her head did not match that of her own gun.Alan M. May.

Officials who reviewed his speculations chose not to reopen the case.
