[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|250px|right|alt=When Canada was formed in 1867 its provinces were a relatively narrow strip in the southeast, with vast territories in the interior. It grew by adding British Columbia in 1871, P.E.I. in 1873, the British Arctic Islands in 1880, and Newfoundland in 1949; meanwhile, its provinces grew both in size and number at the expense of its territories.|CANADA TIMELINE:
Evolution of the borders and the names of Canada's Provinces and Territories]]
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia are the original provinces, formed when British North American colonies federated on July 1, 1867, into the Dominion of Canada and by stages began accruing the indicia of sovereignty from the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite book|author=Janet Ajzenstat|title=Canada's Founding Debates|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=73gRch5cXZ4C&pg=PA3|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8607-5|page=3[/tpl] Ontario and Quebec were united before Confederation as the Province of Canada. Over the following six years, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island were added as provinces.
The Hudson's Bay Company maintained control of large swathes of western Canada referred to as  Rupert's Land until 1870, when it turned over the land to the Government of Canada, forming part of the Northwest Territories.[tpl]cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Robert Shadle|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire: A-J|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA538|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5|page=538[/tpl] Manitoba and the Northwest Territories were created in 1870 from Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory.

In 1912, the boundaries of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba were expanded northward: Manitoba's to the 60° parallel, Ontario's to Hudson Bay and Quebec's to encompass the District of Ungava.[tpl]cite web| url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1912/1| title=Territorial evolution| author=Atlas of Canada|accessdate=January 27, 2007[/tpl]

==Government==

Theoretically, provinces have a great deal of power relative to the federal government, with jurisdiction over many public goods such as health care, education, welfare, and intra-provincial transportation.[tpl]cite book|author=Gregory S. Mahler|title=New Dimensions of Canadian Federalism: Canada in a Comparative Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q4g0d98vpp0C&pg=PA86|year=1987|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3289-5|page=86[/tpl] They receive "transfer payments" from the federal government to pay for these, as well as exacting their own taxes.[tpl]cite book|author=Ian Peach|title=Constructing Tomorrows Federalism: New Perspectives on Canadian Governance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K8VkyxvK1VAC&pg=PA52|year=2007|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-315-8|page=52[/tpl] In practice, however, the federal government can use these transfer payments to influence these provincial areas. For instance in order to receive healthcare funding under medicare, provinces must agree to meet certain federal mandates, such as universal access to required medical treatment.
Provincial and territorial legislatures have no second chamber like the Canadian Senate. Originally, most provinces did have such bodies, known as legislative councils, but these were subsequently abolished, Quebec's being the last in 1968.[tpl]cite book|author=Jocelyn Maclure|title=Quebec Identity: The Challenge of Pluralism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rDq-VVN4XtcC&pg=PA162|year=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7111-2|page=162[/tpl] In most provinces, the single house of the legislature is known as the Legislative Assembly except in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, where it is called the House of Assembly, and Quebec where it is generally called the National Assembly.[tpl]cite book|author=Nathan Tidridge|title=Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: An Introduction to Our Form of Government|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvGsvHsAtDgC&pg=PA281|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-0084-0|page=281[/tpl] Ontario has a Legislative Assembly but its members are called Members of the Provincial Parliament or MPPs.[tpl]cite book|author=Laura Elizabeth Pinto|title=Curriculum Reform in Ontario: 'Common-Sense' Policy Processes and Democratic Possibilities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4DYswZZ5gPIC&pg=PT325|year=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-6158-5|page=325[/tpl] The legislative assemblies use a procedure similar to that of the Canadian House of Commons.

==Provincial parties==

Most provinces have provincial counterparts to the three national federal parties. However, some provincial parties are not formally linked to the federal parties that share the same name.[tpl]cite book|author=William Cross|title=Political Parties|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3d9G8yUG-9QC&pg=PA17|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4111-5|pages=17–20[/tpl] The New Democratic Party and Green Party of Canada have integrated membership between the provincial and federal wings. Some provinces have regional political parties, such as the Saskatchewan Party.
The provincial political climate of Quebec is quite different: the main split is between sovereignty, represented by the Parti Québécois, and federalism, represented primarily by the Quebec Liberal Party.[tpl]cite book|author=Alain-Gustave Gagnon|title=The Canadian Social Union Without Quebec: 8 Critical Analyses|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=97a8-s131u0C&pg=PA209|year=2000|publisher=IRPP|isbn=978-0-88645-184-4|pages=209–210[/tpl]
The provincial Progressive Conservative parties are also now separate from the federal Conservative Party, which resulted from a merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance.[tpl]cite book|author1=J. Peter Meekison|author2=Hamish Telford|author3=Harvey Lazar|title=Reconsidering the Institutions of Canadian Federalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rBZVjldHHhgC&pg=PA11|year=2004|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=978-1-55339-008-4|page=11[/tpl] In most provinces the provincial Liberal Party separated from the federal Liberal Party and are now an independent entities.

==Ceremonial territory==

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial, near Vimy, Pas-de-Calais, and the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, near Beaumont-Hamel, France are ceremonially considered Canadian territory.[tpl]cite book|author=John Wilson|title=Failed Hope: The Story of the Lost Peace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QgwtimQ_C-AC&pg=PA38|year=2012|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-0345-2|page=38[/tpl] In 1922, the French government donated the land used for the Vimy Memorial "freely, and for all time, to the Government of Canada the free use of the land exempt from all taxes".
The site of the Somme battlefield near Beaumont-Hamel site was purchased in 1921 by the people of the Dominion of Newfoundland. These sites do not, however, enjoy extraterritorial status and are thus subject to French law.

==Proposed provinces and territories==

Since Confederation in 1867, there have been several proposals for new Canadian provinces and territories. The Constitution of Canada requires an amendment for the creation of a new province but the creation of a new territory requires only an act of Parliament;[tpl]cite book|author=Norman L. Nicholson|title=The boundaries of the Canadian Confederation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ek7cloNk3E8C&pg=PA174|year=1979|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|isbn=978-0-7705-1742-7|pages=174–175[/tpl] therefore, it is easier legislatively to create a territory than a province.
In late 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin surprised some observers by expressing his personal support for all three territories gaining provincial status "eventually". He cited their importance to the country as a whole and the ongoing need to assert  sovereignty in the Arctic, particularly as global warming could make that region more open to exploitation leading to more complex  international waters disputes.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/11/22/provinces041122.html|title= Northern territories 'eventually' to be given provincial status| author=CBC News| authorlink=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=January 27, 2007 | date=November 23, 2004[/tpl]
