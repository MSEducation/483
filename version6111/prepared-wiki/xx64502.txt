Clotted cream (sometimes called scalded, clouted, Devonshire or Cornish cream) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full-cream cow's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms 'clots' or 'clouts'.BBC Devon: article on clotted, or clouted, cream It forms an essential part of a cream tea.
Although its  origin is uncertain, the cream's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in South West England and in particular the counties of Cornwall and Devon. The current largest commercial producer in the UK is Rodda's in Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons (25,000 kg; 55,000 lb) of clotted cream a day. In 1998 the term Cornish clotted cream became a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) by European Union directive, as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55%.

==Description==

Clotted cream has been described as having a "nutty, cooked milk" flavour,[tpl]cite book|last=Figioni|first=Paula|title=How Baking Works: Exploring the Fundamentals of Baking Science|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-470-39267-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC&dq=clotted+cream+flavour|page=363[/tpl] and a "rich sweet flavour" with a texture that is grainy, sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface. It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum of 55%, but an average of 64%); in the United States it would be classified as butter. For comparison, the fat content of single cream is only 18%.[tpl]cite book|last=Barnett|first=Anne|title=Understanding Ingredients|year=1998|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0-435-42827-6|page=26[/tpl] Despite its popularity, virtually none is exported due to its short shelf life.
Due to its high saturated fat content, the regular consumption of clotted cream is usually thought to be bad for health, though some dairy fat in the diet is considered beneficial.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3633366/Full-fat-takes-the-cream.html|title=Full fat takes the cream|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2011-03-01|last=Clay|first=Xanthe|location=London|date=13 July 2007|quote=No one is suggesting that eating clotted cream for breakfast every day is life-prolonging, but a moderate amount of dairy fat in your diet is not only not going to do you harm, it's actually healthy, as well as life-enhancing.[/tpl] A 2006 survey of nutrition professionals ranked clotted cream as the least healthy of 120 foods selected to be representative of the British diet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Scarborough, P., Rayner, M., Stockley, L., & Black, A.|year=2007|title=Nutrition professionals' perception of the 'healthiness' of individual foods|journal=Public Health Nutrition|volume=10|issue=4|pages=346–353|doi=10.1017/S1368980007666683|url=http://www.aseanfood.info/Articles/11020362.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2013[/tpl] According to the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, a [tpl]convert|100|g|adj=on[/tpl] tub of clotted cream provides [tpl]convert|586|kcal|lk=on[/tpl], roughly equivalent to a [tpl]convert|200|g|adj=on[/tpl] cheeseburger.[tpl]cite book|title=Food Standards Agency: Manual of Nutrition|year=2008|publisher=HMSO London[/tpl]

==History==

Originally made by farmers to reduce the amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream has become so deep-rooted in the culture of South West England that it is now a tourist attraction.[tpl]cite book|title=Between the local and the global: confronting complexity in the contemporary agri-food sector|year=2006|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=0-7623-1317-X|pages=306–309|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6285iMejcogC&dq=clotted+cream|author=Terry Marsden|coauthors=Jonathan Murdoch|accessdate=2 December 2010[/tpl] While there is no doubt of its strong association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear where it first originated. It is similar to kaymak (or kajmak), a Near Eastern delicacy that is made throughout the Middle East, Southeast Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, India and Turkey. According to the Oxford Companion to Food, it may have been introduced to Cornwall by Phoenician traders in search of tin.[tpl]cite book|title=The Oxford companion to food|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280681-5|page=225|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC&pg=PA225&dq=clotted+cream#v=onepage&q=clotted%20cream&f=false|author=Alan Davidson|coauthors=Tom Jaine[/tpl] 
However, ancient food experts,Wood, Jacqui. Prehistoric Cooking. Stroud: Tempus, 2001. ISBN 0-752-41943-9  noting Strabo's commentaries on Britain ("They live off their herds ... As they have mines of tin and lead, they give these metals and hides from their cattle to the sea traders ... instead of olive oil they use butter."), have proposed that the early Britons would probably have clotted cream to preserve its freshness.
More recently, regional archaeologists Medieval Decon & Cornwall: Shaping an Ancient Countryside, Ed. Sam Turner, 2006 have associated the stone fogou (dial. 'fuggy-hole'), or souterrains, found across Atlantic Britain, France and Ireland as a possible form of 'cold store' for dairy production of milk, cream and cheese in particular. Similar functions are ascribed the linney (dial. 'lean-to') stone-built form, often used as a dairy in later medieval longhouses in the same regions.[tpl]cite web|title=The Pre-Norman Landscape|url=http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/flyingpast/continuity.html#courtyard|publisher=Flyingpast.org[/tpl]

===EU directives===

In 1993, an application was made for the name Cornish clotted cream to have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall. This was  accepted in 1998.[tpl]cite EU directive |serial=98 |year=1998 |date=30 September 1998 |description=supplementing the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 on the entry of certain names in the Register of protected designation of origin and protected geographical indications |eurlextag=OJ:L:1998:266:0024:0025:EN:PDF [/tpl] Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum butterfat content of 55%.[tpl]cite web |title=EU Protected Food Names Scheme — UK registered names — National application No: 03514: Cornish clotted cream  |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/industry/regional/foodname/products/registered/cornclcream.htm |accessdate =2 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The unique, slightly yellow, Cornish clotted cream colour is due to the high carotene levels in the grass.

==Preparation==

Traditionally, clotted cream was created by straining fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream to rise to the surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fielden|first=Marjory Eckett|year=1934|title=Old-time survivals in Devon|journal=Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association|publisher=The Devonshire Press|location=Torquay|volume=LXVI|page=367[/tpl] The clots that had formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer.  By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, whereas before heating produced far more clotted cream for the same amount of milk: as a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, "the separator saves a whole cow!"
Today, there are two distinct modern methods for making clotted cream. The "Float Cream method" includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled over 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged.[tpl]cite book|last=Early|first=Ralph|title=The technology of dairy products|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7514-0344-X|pages=45–49|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BuR28Y-S4SMC&dq=clotted+cream[/tpl] The "Scald Cream method" is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts.[tpl]cite book|title=Milk and milk products: technology, chemistry and microbiology|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-8342-1955-7|pages=204–205|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WorGTC1YjsIC&dq=clotted+cream+crust|author=A. H. Varnam|coauthors=Jane P. Sutherland[/tpl] As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.
The largest UK manufacturer is Rodda's, a family-owned business based in Scorrier, Cornwall. Founded in 1890, the company was producing over [tpl]convert|1000000|lb|kg[/tpl] per year in 1985,[tpl]cite news |last=Anderson |first=Lisa |title='Clotted cream' caviar of dairy|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ub4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1298,1063710&dq=clotted+cream+legend&hl=en|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=23 January 1985[/tpl] and in 2010 the managing director said that they might produce as little as 5 or 6 tons (5,000 or 6,000 kg) a day in January, but up to 25 tons (25,000 kg) a day as Christmas approached.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Nicholas Rodda|url=http://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/features/face-to-face-nicholas-rodda-123|accessdate=2 December 2010[/tpl] In the early 1980s, Rodda's signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in-flight desserts, and the company considers the annual Wimbledon tennis championships one of their peak selling periods. As a by-product, for every [tpl]convert|100|impgal[/tpl] of milk used, [tpl]convert|94|impgal[/tpl] of skimmed milk is produced, which is then used in food manufacture.
One Devon manufacturer, Definitely Devon was purchased by Robert Wiseman Dairies in March 2006, closing one of the two Devon dairies and moving all production to Okehampton.[tpl]cite news|title=Forty-five jobs go in dairy close |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6078182.stm|accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 October 2006[/tpl] However, in 2011 Robert Wiseman sold the Definitely Devon Brand to Rodda's, who moved the production of Definitely Devon to Cornwall, which caused some controversy as the name was not changed,[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.thisisdevon.co.uk/Fury-Definitely-Devon-clotted-cream-Cornwall-label-saying-add-jam/story-11758309-detail/story.html | title= Fury as 'Definitely Devon' clotted cream is made in Cornwall and label says add jam first | publisher= This Is Devon | date= 21 April 2011 | accessdate= 13 June 2011[/tpl]

Throughout Cornwall and south-west England clotted cream manufacture is a cottage industry, with many farms and dairies producing cream for sale in local outlets. As clotted cream is not regularly available outside south-west England, there are a number of ways to create an approximation. One example is to mix mascarpone with whipped cream, a little sugar and vanilla extract.[tpl]cite web|title=Devonshire (Clotted) or Devon Cream Recipe|url=http://www.joyofbaking.com/DevonshireCream.html|publisher=Joy of Baking|accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl]

==Uses==

===Cream tea===

Clotted cream is an essential part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional 'splits' in CornwallNigel Slater's Devonshire cream tea recipes, The Guardian, 22 August 2010—with strawberry or raspberry jam, along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top; in Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8694000/8694384.stm |title=How do you do take your cream tea? |accessdate=2 December 2010 |work=BBC News Online |date=9 June 2010 [/tpl] Cream teas spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them.[tpl]cite book |title=Wakefield Companion to South Australian History |year=2001 |publisher=Wakefield Press |isbn=1-86254-558-8 |page=210 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDgPo8KWKh4C |author=Wilfrid Prest, Kerrie Round, Carol S.

===Confectionery===

It can be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, especially clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout the south-west of England in the production of ice creamFor example: [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kellysofcornwall.co.uk/products|accessdate=2010-12-03|title=Kelly's of Cornwall products[/tpl] and fudge.For example: [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radfordsfinefudge.co.uk/about.html |title=Radford's Fine Fudge |accessdate=2011-03-22[/tpl]

===Historical===

Cabbage cream (which does not contain cabbage) was a delicacy in the mid-17th century: layers of clotted cream were interspersed with sugar and rosewater, creating a cabbage effect when served.[tpl]cite book|title=A gift to young housewives|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21210-3|pages=368–369[/tpl]  It was a common accompaniment to junket, a milk-based dessert which went out of fashion in the mid-20th century.

===Notable usages===

During the reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, one course was strawberries and Cornish clotted cream.

==Literature and folklore==

It was mentioned in The Shepheardes Calendar, a poem by Edmund Spenser in 1579:
 Ne would she scorn the simple shepherd swain, For she would call him often heam, And give him curds and clouted cream. 
As with many Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He eventually fell in love with her and made her his fourth wife.[tpl]cite book|last=Viccars|first=Sue|title=Frommer's Devon and Cornwall With Your Family|year=2011|publisher=Frommer|isbn=0-470-74947-4|page=238[/tpl] Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first.
