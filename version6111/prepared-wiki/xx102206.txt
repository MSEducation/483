[[Clay Springs and Apopka Railroad]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct Florida railroads

The Clay Springs and Apopka Railroad ran from the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad's Orlando Division southeast of Apopka, north and northeast across the Florida Midland Railroad at East Apopka, to Clay Springs (now Wekiva Springs). It was operational from around 1890 to sometime after 1919. If it had not already been shut down, the paving of Wekiva Springs Road (Orange County Bond Project 44) in the late 1920s spelled the demise of the railroad.
