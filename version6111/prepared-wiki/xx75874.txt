The London commuter belt is the metropolitan area surrounding London, from which it is practical to commute to work in the capital. It is also known as the London metropolitan area,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1947|title=Greater South East needs strategic investment to secure future|publisher=London Development Agency|date=18 June 2007[/tpl] or Southeast metropolitan area.London Assembly - London in its Regional Setting (PDF) It should not be confused with Greater London or the Greater London Urban Area.  
The most up-to-date population figures are from Eurostat, that the London metropolitan area is the largest in the EU with a population of 13,614,409.[tpl]cite web |url= http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&lang=en |title= Metropolitan Area Populations |publisher=Eurostat |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2013[/tpl] 

==Scope==

The boundaries are not fixed; they expand as transport options improve and affordable housing moves further away from city centre.BBC News - The new commuter belt. 18 July 2006. The belt currently covers much of the South East region and part of the East of England region, including the home counties of Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey, Kent and Essex, and, by several definitions, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Bedfordshire. 
The population of Greater London and those counties adjacent to the green belt was 18,868,800 in 2011. Much of the undeveloped part of this area lies within the designated Metropolitan Green Belt, which covers nearly all of Surrey, eastern Berkshire, southern Buckinghamshire, southern and mid Hertfordshire, southern Bedfordshire, south-west Essex, and western Kent. In addition, three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (the Chiltern Hills, Surrey Hills and North Downs AONBs) surrounding the Thames basin are within the commuter belt.

===Environs of Greater London===

There are 17 local government districts that share a boundary with Greater London, in the East and South East regions. Most districts are entirely, or have sections, within the M25 motorway or are within [tpl]convert|15|-|20|mi|km[/tpl] of Charing Cross. 
Adjacent districts often share characteristics of Outer London, such as forming part of the continuous urban sprawl, being served by the London Underground, being covered by the London telephone area code, (until 2000) forming part of the Metropolitan Police District and having a relatively high employed population working in London.
