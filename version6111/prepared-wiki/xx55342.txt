The network consists of six lines which radiate from Manchester city centre and terminate at Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Didsbury, Eccles, and Rochdale. The system is owned by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) and operated and maintained under contract by RATP Group.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/ratp-buys-manchester-metrolink-operator.html |title=RATP buys Manchester Metrolink operator |date=2 August 2011 |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London[/tpl] Also referred to as Manchester Metrolink, 25 million passenger journeys were made on the system in 2012/13.
A light rail system for Greater Manchester was born of Greater Manchester County Council's obligations to provide "an integrated and efficient system of public transport" under its structure plan and the Transport Act 1968.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=6–7[/tpl] Greater Manchester's public transport network suffered from poor north – south connections, exacerbated by the location of Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, which were unconnected and lay at opposing edges of central Manchester. Abandoning the monorail and underground options conceived in the 1960s and 1970s, light rail was proposed in 1982 as the best and most economical public transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area, and gathered support throughout the 1980s as an appropriate integrated commuter service. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992. This founded the United Kingdom's first modern street running rail system and its second operational public tram system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only heritage tram system in the UK which endured up to Metrolink's creation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/manchester/|publisher=Railway Technology|title=Manchester Metrolink, United Kingdom|accessdate=12 July 2013|year=2010[/tpl]

The system has a mix of designated light railway (segregated from other traffic) and on-street tramway (shared with pedestrians and motor vehicles). Its fleet of passenger vehicles is composed of Bombardier Flexity Swift M5000s, but also used Ansaldo Firema T-68/T-68As between 1992 and 2014. These vehicles were originally termed LRVs (light rail vehicles),[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=30[/tpl] but have become widely known as trams.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metrolink.co.uk/futuremetrolink/Pages/new-trams.aspx|publisher= Metrolink|title=New Trams |accessdate=11 July 2013|author=TfGM[/tpl] Other changes include a yellow and silver branding and livery, which replaced the system's original grey and aquamarine identity in 2008.
Expansion of Metrolink has been a key strategy of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 2CC, which, upon completion of Phases 3b and 2CC in 2016/17, will make Metrolink the largest light rail network in the United Kingdom, with [tpl]convert|60|mi|km|[/tpl] of track and 93 stops, handling an estimated 45 million passenger journeys a year. TfGM have endorsed further expansion with proposals for new lines to Stockport and Port Salford, and the addition of tram-train technology.

==History==

===Origins===

A light rail system for Greater Manchester was born of a desire by the Greater Manchester County Council to fulfil its obligations to provide "an integrated and efficient system of public transport" under its structure plan and the Transport Act 1968.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=6–7[/tpl] Greater Manchester's public transport network suffered from poor north – south connections, exacerbated by the location of Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|p=273[/tpl] which were unconnected and located at opposing edges of its city centre.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=6–7[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|p=273[/tpl] Piccadilly and Victoria were built in the 1840s by rival companies on cheaper land on the fringes of the city centre, resulting in poor integration and access to the central business zone.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=4[/tpl] In as early as 1839, in anticipation of the stations being built, a connecting underground railway tunnel was proposed but abandoned on economic grounds,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=4[/tpl] as was an overground suspended-monorail in 1966.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=21[/tpl] SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive — the body tasked with improving public transport for Manchester and its surrounding municipalities in the 1960s – made draft proposals for a Picc-Vic tunnel,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=22[/tpl] "a proposed rail route beneath the city centre" forming "the centrepiece of a new electrified railway network for the region".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/astragal/manchester-unearths-forgotten-1970s-tube-line/8627773.article |title= Manchester unearths forgotten 1970s tube line |date=13 March 2012 |work= The Architects' Journal |location =London[/tpl] Despite investigatory tunnelling under the Manchester Arndale shopping centre, when the Greater Manchester County Council presented the project to the United Kingdom Government in 1974,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=5[/tpl] it was unable to secure the necessary funding,[tpl]sfn|Donald|Cross|Bristow|1983|p=45[/tpl] and was abandoned on economic grounds when the County Council dropped the plans in 1977.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=22[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=5[/tpl]
In 1982, the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE; the successor to SELNEC PTE) concluded that an overground metropolitan light rail system to replace or complement the region's under-used heavy railways was the most economical solution to improving Greater Manchester's public transport network, which suffered from poor integration and outdated infrastructure;[tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|p=273[/tpl] a Rail Study Group, composed of officials from British Rail, Greater Manchester County Council and GMPTE formally endorsed the scheme in 1984.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=6–7[/tpl] Abstract proposals based on light rail systems in North America and continental Europe,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=26–27[/tpl] and a draft [tpl]convert|62|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] network consisting of three lines were presented by the Rail Study Group to the UK Government for funding.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=22[/tpl] Following route revisions in 1984 and 1987,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=22[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=25[/tpl] and a trial on 9 February 1987 using Docklands Light Railway rolling stock on a freight-only line adjacent to Debdale Park,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=37[/tpl] funding was granted by HM Treasury with the strict condition that the system be constructed in phases.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=22[/tpl] Additional funding came from the European Regional Development Fund and bank lending.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl]

===Phase 1===

Conversion of the East Lancashire Railway (Bury-to-Victoria) and Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (Altrincham-to-Piccadilly) heavy rail lines, and creation of a street-level tramway[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=74[/tpl] through Manchester city centre to unite the lines as a single [tpl]convert|19.2|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] network,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=17[/tpl] was chosen for Phase 1 because the two heavy rail lines were primarily used for commuting to central Manchester, and would improve north – south links and access to the city centre.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=73[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=56[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|pp=14–15[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=17[/tpl] The required parliamentary authority to proceed with Phase 1 was obtained with two Acts of Parliament – the Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) Act 1988 and Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) (No. 2) Act 1988.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=30–31[/tpl]
On 27 September 1989, following a two-stage tender exercise, the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority awarded a contract to the GMA Group (a consortium composed of AMEC, GM Buses, John Mowlem and Company, and a General Electric Company plc subsidiary)[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=51[/tpl] who formed Greater Manchester Metrolink Limited to design, build, operate and maintain Phase 1 of Metrolink.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=47[/tpl] The contract was approved by Michael Portillo on behalf of the Department for Transport on 24 October 1989, and formally signed on 6 June 1990.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=47[/tpl]
The Bury line was closed in stages between 13 July 1991 and 17 August 1991, after which the 1200V DC third rail electrified line was adapted for a 750V DC overhead line operation.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.therailengineer.com/2011/11/30/manchester-metrolink-20-years-of-evolution/ |work=The Rail Engineer |title=Manchester Metrolink 20 Years of Evolution |first=Clive |last=Kessell |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2013[/tpl] In Manchester city centre, a tramway – built with network expansion in mind[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=94[/tpl] – from Victoria to Piccadilly via Market Street and Piccadilly Gardens connected Bury to Altrincham via Manchester; The overhead structures and wiring of the Altrincham line were adapted for light rail. As well as upgrades to signalling and stations on the network, a combined headquarters, depot and control centre was built at Cheetham Hill on Queens Road, north of Victoria station, at a cost of £8 million (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|8000000|1991|r=-5[/tpl]|0[/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl][tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl]).[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=53[/tpl]
Initially projected to open in September 1991, then promised for 21 February 1992,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=87[/tpl] Metrolink began operation on 6 April 1992 with a service between Victoria and Bury.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=82[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=90[/tpl] Along with the Tyne and Wear Metro and Docklands Light Railway, it helped to reintroduce light rail to the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lrta.org/mrthistory.html |title=The History of Tramways and Evolution of Light Rail|publisher= Light Rail Transit Association[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=147[/tpl] The network was expanded beyond Victoria to G-Mex Metrolink station on 27 April 1992; a service through to Altrincham joined the network on 15 June 1992,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=90[/tpl] completing Phase 1 and enabling use of all 26 T-68 vehicles acquired for the operation.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=9[/tpl] Elizabeth II declared Metrolink open at a ceremony in Manchester on 17 July 1992, adding that Metrolink would improve communication between northern and southern Greater Manchester.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=9[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=90[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-18867824 |date=17 July 2012 |title= Manchester's oldest Metrolink trams to be replaced |accessdate=20 January 2013 |work= BBC News [/tpl] After the ceremony the Queen visited Manchester Town Hall and rode from St Peter's Square to Bury to visit Bury Town Hall.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=9[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=90[/tpl]
Then costing £145 million (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|145000000|1992|r=-5[/tpl]|0[/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl][tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl])[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl] Phase 1 was expected to carry 10 million passengers per year,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=13[/tpl] but surpassed this figure by the 1993/94 fiscal year, and every year thereafter.[tpl]cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/light-rail-and-tram-statistics-2011-12 |at=Light rail and tram statistics 2011/12 and XLS tables (Table LRT0101) |accessdate=18 January 2013 |date=19 July 2012 |title=Light rail and tram statistics: 2011/12 |publisher= Department for Transport[/tpl] In recognition of passenger demands and the decommissioning of the Arndale bus station after the 1996 Manchester bombing, adjustments were made to Phase 1 to the design of Manchester City Council's city centre masterplan, by modifying Market Street Metrolink station to handle two-way traffic, demolishing High Street Metrolink station in 1998 and creating a new stop for Shudehill Interchange in 2002.[tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|pp=276–277[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|p=290[/tpl] Sections of track in the city centre were relaid following damage to the road surface adjacent to the line.[tpl]cite journal| title=Design, build, operate and maintain contract as applied to Manchester's Metrolink| last=Hall|first= J.R.| journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Transport| volume= 111| issue= 4| pages= 310–313|date=November 1995| issn=0965092X| publisher=Thomas Telford| doi=10.1680/itran.1995.28033[/tpl] By 2003, Phase 1 was deemed a "long-term success" by GMPTE, and, with overcrowding at peak times, carried more than 15 million passengers per year.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=13[/tpl]

===Phase 2===

Extension of the Metrolink network was intended to be continuous with successive expansion phases delivered in strict order of priority.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=63[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=91[/tpl] GMPTE wanted to repeat its "success" with Phase 1 by converting other parts of Greater Manchester's under-utilised suburban rail network.[tpl]sfn|Williams|2003|p=275[/tpl] However, changes in circumstances and new opportunities, combined with a shift in government policy following the early 1990s recession stalled the immediate expansion of Metrolink after Phase 1.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=91[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Docherty|Shaw|2011|[/tpl] Phase 1a, a proposed east – west route from Eastlands to Dumplington via Salford Quays was muted by uncertainty surrounding the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, the (unbuilt) Trafford Centre, and regeneration of Manchester Docks respectively.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=63[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=148[/tpl] Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s, the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority continued to acquire rights to construct Metrolink lines under the Transport and Works Act 1992.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl]
During the 1990s, Salford Quays became a business district specifically redeveloped for commerce, leisure, culture and tourism with a high density of business units and modern housing, complemented by a cinema complex, office blocks, and waterfront promenade. As it had poor public transport integration and no rail provision, it was earmarked for a potential Metrolink line as early as 1986 and legal authority to construct the line through the Quays was acquired in 1990.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=10[/tpl] The Quays received millions of pounds of investment and a public consultation and public inquiry resulted in government endorsement in 1994. In autumn 1995 a [tpl]convert|4|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] Metrolink line branching from Cornbrook Metrolink station to Eccles via Salford Quays capitalising on the regenerated Quayside was confirmed as Phase 2 of Metrolink.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=10[/tpl] No funding came from central government and money was raised from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority (GMPTA), the European Regional Development Fund and private developers.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=10[/tpl] In April 1997 Altram, a consortium of the Serco Group plc, Gio. Ansaldo & C. and John Laing plc was appointed to construct the Eccles Line; Serco, responsible for the Sheffield Supertram would operate the whole network under contract; Ansaldo provided six additional vehicles — T-68As – and signalling equipment. Construction work officially began on 17 July 1997.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/manchester/|publisher=railway-technology.com|accessdate=10 January 2013|title=Manchester Metrolink, United Kingdom[/tpl]
The Eccles Line was officially opened as far as Broadway Metrolink station on 6 December 1999 by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who praised Metrolink as "exactly the type of scheme needed to solve the transport problems of the metropolitan areas of the country";[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/aug/02/transport.politics |title= Tram fury rattles ministers |first=David |last=Ward |date=2 August 2004 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=13[/tpl] a service to Eccles Interchange joined the network on 21 July 2000,[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl] and was officially declared open by Anne, Princess Royal at a ceremony on 9 January 2001.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/42018_whistlestop_princess_takes_home_hat_souvenir_ |work=Manchester Evening News |date=9 January 2001 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |title= Whistle-stop Princess takes home hat souvenir[/tpl] On completion, Phases 1 and 2 gave Metrolink a total route length of [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl].[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/more-money-for-uk-light-rail.html |title=More money for UK light rail |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London |date=1 January 2003 |accessdate=13 January 2013[/tpl] Phase 2 was predominantly privately funded and cost £160,000,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|160000000|2000|r=-4[/tpl]|0[/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl] Salford City Council considered Phase 2 "an important contribution to Salford's public transport network, providing a fast and frequent service between Eccles, Salford Quays and Manchester city centre". But, in competition with comparatively quicker and cheaper buses, the line navigated the Quays on a slow and meandering route, and failed to reach its initial passenger targets.[tpl]sfn|Docherty|Shaw|2011|[/tpl] Patronage increased during the 2000s as the Eccles Line steadily increased in popularity in keeping with a rise in passenger numbers across the whole Metrolink system and was beginning to become overcrowded by the end of the decade.

===Phase 3===

In 2000, officials and transport planners in Greater Manchester considered Metrolink to be a "phenomenal success".[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl] The system was exceeding patronage targets and reducing traffic congestion on roads running parallel to its lines.[tpl]sfn|Docherty|Shaw|2011|[/tpl] Consequently, when the Transport Act 2000 required passenger transport executives to produce local transport plans, GMPTE's top public transport priority was a third phase of Metrolink expansion, which would create four new lines along key transport corridors in Greater Manchester: the Oldham and Rochdale Line (routed northeast to Oldham and Rochdale), the East Manchester Line (routed east to East Manchester and Ashton-under-Lyne), the South Manchester Line (routed  southeast to Chorlton-cum-Hardy and East Didsbury), and the Airport Line (routed south to Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfgm.com/Corporate/Documents/GMLTP/LTP2.pdf |title=Greater Manchester Local Transport Plan 2 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |publisher= Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority[/tpl] The East Manchester Line would capitalise on serving the City of Manchester Stadium, a host venue of the 2002 Commonwealth Games.[tpl]cite press release |author=GMPTE|authorlink=Transport for Greater Manchester |title=Metrolink is coming ... |year=2000 |publisher=GMPTE Promotions |location=Manchester |url=http://www.tfgm.com/Corporate/Documents/Metrolink/met.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] Satisfied it would deliver a key policy commitment with faster expansion and greater value from economies of scale,[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=13[/tpl] GMPTE and the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) lobbied central government to provide partial funding to upgrade the current network with a new depot, passenger information displays, and construct four new lines in a single Phase 3 contract (dubbed the "Big Bang") worth £489,000,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|489000000|2000|r=-5[/tpl]|0[/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5152948.stm |title= Metrolink extension is announced |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=7 January 2013 |work=BBC News[/tpl]
Conceding that it would be "very difficult" to bring Metrolink to the City of Manchester Stadium by 2002, the Government accepted its importance to Greater Manchester and the Commonwealth Games on 22 March 2000, with an announcement from Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott that a £289,000,000 government contribution to fund Phase 3 would make Metrolink "the envy of Europe".[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/687277.stm |title= £500m tram extension unveiled |work=BBC News |date=22 March 2000 |accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/11937_289m_for_metrolink_big_bang |work= Manchester Evening News |accessdate=5 January 2013 |date=22 March 2000 |title=£289m for Metrolink 'Big Bang'[/tpl] The remaining £200,000,000 was assembled from the private sector by July 2000.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2000|[/tpl] Following the announcement, preparatory work such as legal costs, land acquisition and construction of rail bridges over the River Medlock was actioned.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/182/182478_bring_on_the_metro_urges_bridge_boss.html |title=Bring on the Metro, urges bridge boss |first=Clarissa |last=Satchell |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |work=Manchester Evening News[/tpl] However, Metrolink made a loss in 2002 and failed to reduce traffic congestion in Manchester city centre.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/98/98124_trams_fail_to_cut_jams.html |title= Trams fail to cut jams |work=Manchester Evening News |date=23 April 2004 |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] Costs for Phase 3 implementation were revised in the December after the 2002 Commonwealth Games, totalling £820,000,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|820000000|2002|r=-5[/tpl]|0[/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]),[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl] meaning Metrolink required a Government contribution of at least £520,000,000.

===Branding and public relations===

The name Metrolink and a system-wide aquamarine, black and grey corporate branding and vehicle livery was devised by Fitch RS and Design Triangle,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=42[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=143[/tpl] and first revealed at a press launch in June 1988.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=26–27[/tpl][tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2003|p=4[/tpl] Previously, during the planning and promotional stages, the system was known as Project Light Rail, and borrowed an orange and brown identity used by Greater Manchester Transport and GM Buses.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=24[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=30[/tpl] In August 1991, in partnership with BBC Manchester, Metrolink ran a "Nickname Metrolink" competition to find an affectionate short name for the system, comparable to "The Tube" for London Underground and "The L" for the Chicago elevated transit system. Most submissions were inspired by textile manufacturing, Greater Manchester's historic staple industry, using names such as "The Thread" and "The Shuttle", but the winning entry was "The Met".[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=30[/tpl] In 2008, a distinctive yellow and metallic silver vehicle livery, and corresponding yellow system-wide corporate re-branding was introduced by Manchester-based Hemisphere Design and Marketing Consultancy, designed in partnership with Peter Saville, Dalton Maag and Design Triangle.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1072244_tram_design_on_the_right_track |title=Tram design on the right track |work= Manchester Evening News |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |first=Simon |last=Donohue[/tpl] Yellow was chosen by Hemisphere for its high visibility and to reflect Greater Manchester's culture of confidence and optimism.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2009|p=3[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

===Stations and lines===

As of April 2014, Metrolink has a network length of [tpl]convert|48.5|mi|km|[/tpl], and 77 stations – known as stops[tpl]sfn|TfGM|GMCA|2011|pp=136–137[/tpl] — along six lines which radiate from a "central triangular junction at Piccadilly Gardens which forms the hub of the Metrolink system" in the City Zone.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=61[/tpl] The lines are: the Altrincham Line (which terminates in Altrincham), the Bury Line (which terminates in Bury), the East Manchester Line (which terminates in Ashton-under-Lyne), the South Manchester Line (which terminates in East Didsbury), the Eccles Line (which terminates in Eccles), and the Oldham and Rochdale Line (which terminates in Rochdale). Some stops, such as Cornbrook, are shared between lines, and may be used as interchange stations; others, such as Altrincham Interchange, are transport hubs which integrate with heavy rail and bus stations. Each station has at least one high-floor platform measuring a minimum of [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|[/tpl] wide, accessed by ramp, stairs, escalator, lift or combination thereof.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=89–90[/tpl] Low-floor platforms commonly used for light rail throughout the world were ruled out for Metrolink because the system inherited [tpl]convert|90|cm|inch|adj=on[/tpl] high-floor platforms from British Rail on lines formerly used for heavy rail.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=31[/tpl] Shelters and canopies at stations were supplied by JCDecaux,[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=89–90[/tpl] and ticket vending machines by Scheidt & Bachmann.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2009|p=4[/tpl] There are up to five ticket vending machines at each stop.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2009|p=4[/tpl] Each line has track with standard gauge specification, powering vehicles electrically from 750 V DC overhead lines.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=102[/tpl] Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements to ensure that sustainable power would be factored into choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first  light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower.

===Rolling stock===

For passenger services, Metrolink uses a fleet of specially designed articulated vehicles exclusively composed of Bombardier Flexity Swift M5000s, first introduced in 2009. These were preceded by Ansaldo Firema T-68/T-68As,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=42[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=111[/tpl] which were retired in February 2014 and April 2014 respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/metrolink-trams-end-line-manchester-7056688|work=Manchester Evening News|title=End of the line for Metrolink's first tram fleet|first=Dean|last=Kirby|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014[/tpl] These vehicles were originally termed LRVs (light rail vehicles),[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=30[/tpl] but are now widely known as trams. Both varieties are bi-directional, designed to be driven by a single driver from either end in a cab separate from passengers.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=111[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=104[/tpl]
The T-68s were Metrolink's original passenger fleet. They were in passenger service from the opening of Metrolink in 1992, and were phased out between April 2012 and February 2014.[tpl]sfn|Coward|Henderson|2014|p=184[/tpl] They were [tpl]convert|29|m|ft|[/tpl] in length by [tpl]convert|2.65|m|ft[/tpl] wide, weigh [tpl]convert|48|LT|ST|0[/tpl] and have a top speed of [tpl]convert|50|mph|kph[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=40[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=114–115[/tpl] The nominal capacity of each T-68 was 201 passengers, of whom 86 are seated; the maximum crush load capacity is 270 passengers.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1991|p=41[/tpl] Each unit was given a number from 1001 through to 1026;[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=42[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=114–115[/tpl] number 1000 was given to a half length mockup displayed to the public before opening, and now exhibited at the Greater Manchester Museum of Transport.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=42[/tpl] Each T-68 was also to have a nickname referencing the personalities, history and culture of Greater Manchester as chosen by the public. The names chosen in 1987 were Sylvia Pankhurst, Sir Matt Busby, Ben Brierley, The Lancashire Fusilier, Sir John Barbirolli, Pat Seed, John Greenwood, Squire Clark, Our Gracie, and C. P. Scott. Despite assurances they would all be applied, few were ever used,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=26–27[/tpl] with a sponsorship naming scheme (to provide additional income for Metrolink) taking preference (for example, vehicle 1002 was named the "Manchester Arndale Voyager" to promote Manchester Arndale and its Voyager food court).[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=48[/tpl] 
In 1999, Metrolink's passenger fleet was bolstered by six new vehicles to run on the Eccles Line. Numbered 2001 through to 2006, these T-68A vehicles were based on the original T-68s, but had modifications replacing destination rollblinds with dot matrix displays, and retractable couplers and covered bogies necessary for the high proportion of on-street running close to motor traffic. Three of the earlier T-68 fleet were similarly equipped, and were known as T-68Ms.[tpl]sfn|Coward|Henderson|2014|p=29[/tpl] Mechanically and electrically the T-68M vehicles remained essentially a T-68, but had modifications to its brakes, mirrors, and speed limiters to suit the Eccles Line.[tpl]sfn|Coward|Henderson|2014|p=29[/tpl] Initially only these vehicles were permitted to operate the Eccles line but the entire fleet was modified between 2008 and 2012 for universal running, under a program known as the T-68X Universal Running programme.[tpl]sfn|Coward|Henderson|2014|pp=31-32, 59[/tpl] The T-68As were retired on 30 April 2014.
Built by Bombardier Transportation and Vossloh Kiepe, and costing £2,000,000 each, the M5000 vehicles were introduced to Metrolink in December 2009, driven by increased passenger demand. They are part of the Flexity Swift range of light rail vehicles, and have a design similar to the K5000 vehicle used on the Cologne Stadtbahn,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/manchester-plays-catch-up-with-metrolink-expansion.html |title= Manchester plays catch-up with Metrolink expansion |first=Nick |last=Kingsley |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2013 |work=Railway Gazette International |location= London[/tpl] in a yellow and silver livery.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/transport/public_transport/s/1186881_2m_tram_is_up_and_running |date=21 December 2009 |title=£2m tram is up and running |work=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1125664_futures_yellow_for_trams |date=13 July 2009 |title=Future's yellow for trams |work=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl] Originally eight M5000s were planned to provide additional capacity, which increased to 12 with the approval of the spur to MediaCityUK. A total of 94 M5000s were procured by TfGM for the phase 3 extensions and fleet replacement. They will be given fleet numbers from 3001 to 3094. Built to the requirements of the 2010 Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, the nominal capacity of each M5000 is 206 passengers, of whom 52–60 are seated.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.metrolink.co.uk/futuremetrolink/Pages/new-trams.aspx |title=A new generation of trams for Greater Manchester |accessdate=20 January 2013 |publisher=Metrolink[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Metrolink's next trams to have extra seats following passenger plea |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1589695_metrolinks-next-trams-to-have-extra-seats-following-passenger-plea |work=Manchester Evening News |date=26 September 2012 |first=Dean |last=Kirby |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl] In July 2012, TfGM announced that the Greater Manchester Combined Authority had agreed that all T-68s and T-68As would be retired and replaced by M5000 vehicles, which are lighter, quieter, more energy-efficient and four times more reliable than the older T-68 models.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/transport/public_transport/s/1583611_happy-birthday-metrolink-old-trams-axed-as-network-turns-20 |date=17 July 2012 |title=Happy birthday Metrolink: Old trams axed as network turns 20 |work=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=29 January 2013[/tpl] This replacement plan would provide Metrolink with a uniform fleet by 2014. In October 2013, the authority agreed to procure a further ten M5000s in 2014 to facilitate the construction of the proposed Trafford Park line, while in the interim supporting a service between MediaCityUK and Manchester city centre. A press release from Bombardier, dated 20 December 2013, stated that Metrolink had ordered a further ten vehicles. The M5000s became the exclusive passenger vehicle of Metrolink on 1 May 2014.
Metrolink has one Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) from 1991.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=48[/tpl] It is numbered 1027 and its wagon numbered 1028. It is a bespoke diesel-powered vehicle with a crane, inspection platform, mobile workshop, and capacity for a driver and three passengers.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=48[/tpl] It was designed to assist with vehicle recovery and track and line repairs.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=48[/tpl]

===Depots===

Metrolink House at Queens Road in Cheetham Hill is the headquarters of Metrolink.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=79[/tpl] Constructed during Phase 1, it served jointly as a control centre, HQ, office space, and depot for the storage, maintenance and repair of vehicles.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=79[/tpl] Under the original proposals, Metrolink House was much larger, with a design which would support network expansion, but this design did not obtain the necessary planning permission from Manchester City Council.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=79[/tpl] Consequently, Metrolink House was scaled down to a [tpl]convert|4|ha|acre|adj=on[/tpl] £8,000,000 site with finite capacity,[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|p=79[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ogen|Senior|1991|p=43[/tpl] and, in light of Phase 3a network expansion, Metrolink built a second depot at Elsinore Road in Old Trafford in 2011.[tpl]sfn|GMPTE|2010|p=6[/tpl][tpl]sfn|TfGM|2012|p=23[/tpl] This second depot occupies the site of a former warehouse, and can house up to 96 vehicles.[tpl]sfn|TfGM|2012|p=23[/tpl] On 7 May 2013 Metrolink completed the transfer of its main operational functions from Cheetham Hill to Old Trafford, meaning its control room – known as the Network Management Centre – is housed jointly with the Customer Services team by its newer depot.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/News/Metrolink-Completes-Move-To-Old-Trafford |work= Manchester Confidential |title=Metrolink Completes Move To Old Trafford |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2013[/tpl]

===Wi-Fi===

In July 2013, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee announced that it planned to enhance the experience of travelling on Metrolink by tapping in to Manchester City Council's grant from the UK Urban Broadband Fund and using it to provide Metrolink passengers with free Wi-Fi when on board. The scheme began with a trial on a single tram - number 3054 - connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network with the intention of rolling it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015.[tpl]cite news|url=http://manchestergazette.co.uk/manchester-unveils-revised-superconnected-cities-plans/|title=Manchester unveils revised Superconnected Cities plans|accessdate=7 July 2013|date=7 July 2013|work=The Manchester Gazette[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://manchestergazette.co.uk/wi-fi-tram-test-trial-on-track-for-metrolink/|title=Wi-Fi tram test-trial on track for Metrolink|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=23 August 2013|work=The Manchester Gazette[/tpl]

===Service and hours of operation===

Before inauguration, GMPTE's original concept was for Metrolink's operator to provide a service every ten minutes from Bury-to-Piccadilly and Altrincham-to-Piccadilly [tpl]FormatTime|6|00|24|00[/tpl], Monday to Saturday.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=124–127[/tpl] Greater Manchester Metrolink Limited, the system's original operator, argued for adjustments, citing the need to provide an efficient and commercially viable operation in line with vehicle running times and passenger demand.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=124–127[/tpl] Due to power limitations, this pattern was modified to a twelve-minute service throughout the day, doubling to a six-minute service in peak periods, resulting in a "ten trams per hour" service pattern on routes running from Altrincham and Bury to Manchester every six minutes.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|pp=124–127[/tpl] Operators are required to provide this level of service at least 98% of the time, or incur a financial penalty charge.[tpl]sfn|Ogden|Senior|1992|p=124[/tpl] This six-minute service pattern has been adopted on the rest of the network as the system has grown.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.metrolink.co.uk/extension/ORL_Extension_line_guide.pdf |title=Brightening up your day |year=2012 |accessdate=23 January 2013 |publisher= Metrolink[/tpl] Heavy snowfall during the winter of 2009/10 impaired Metrolink services and the operator was criticised for failing to have cold weather procedures.

A survey in 2012 revealed that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised that the older vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — are outdated and the cause of much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2014 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom - Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway - Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stations and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.[tpl]Cite web |title=Manchester's Metrolink does not give value for money, say passengers |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchesters-metrolink-not-give-value-6941968 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-09[/tpl]

==Patronage==

According to TfGM, more than 21 million passenger journeys were made in 2011,[tpl]sfn|TfGM|2012|p=23[/tpl][tpl]sfn|TfGM|2012|p=38[/tpl] and the Department for Transport placed passenger journeys for the 2011/12 fiscal year at 21.8 million. Patronage has risen steadily since its opening, from a start-point of 8.1 million in the 1992/93 fiscal year. Travel increased from 18.2 million journeys in 2001/02 to 20 million journeys in 2008/09; numbers fell to 18.7 million in 2009 while parts of the system were closed for upgrades, but recovered[tpl]sfn|TfGM|GMCA|2011|p=27[/tpl] to 19.6 million for the 2009/10 fiscal year. Metrolink revised its method for calculating passenger boardings in 2010/11, meaning figures are not directly comparable with previous years. TfGM predicts around 22 million passenger journeys on Metrolink in 2012, and an increase of 46% by 2026.
A survey in 2012 revealed that 12%, or around one in 10 people in Greater Manchester use Metrolink to travel to work, and 8% use the system every day. The system is most commonly used by 21 to 30-year olds, and was used most markedly by residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury — accounting for around a third of their commuter journeys.[tpl]cite news |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/transport/public_transport/s/1586048_the-tram-its-great-apart-from-when-it-breaks |work=Manchester Evening News |title=The Tram: It's great ... apart from when it breaks |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=18 January 2013[/tpl]
