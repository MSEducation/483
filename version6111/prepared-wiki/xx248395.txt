==1910 season==

Derbyshire played twenty two matches, all in the County Championship and won two and lost fourteen. Their two victories were courtesy of Leicestershire. John Chapman was in his first year as captain. Ernest Needham scored most runs, and  Arthur Morton took most wickets.
Among the draws, the season produced one of the most memorable matches against Warwickshire at Blackwell in 1910 and not just a Derbyshire record 9th wicket partnership, but a world record 9th wicket partnership of 283 which still stands.  At lunch time on the last day  Derbyshire with eight second innings wickets down, were far behind Warwickshire's first innings score and Warwickshire looked certain of a comfortable win. Chapman and Arnold Warren were batting. William Taylor wrote "In view of their strong position, Warwickshire, I knew, were hoping to catch an early afternoon train, and, in conversation during the interval, I remarked to their fast bowler, Frank Field: You look like catching your train all right, Frank. The reply was, I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Taylor. These chaps are pretty good bats, you know. How right he was. Chapman and Warren made their runs in less than three hours and Warwickshire had to be content with a draw." W.T. Taylor History of Derbyshire cricket Wisden 1953 Chapman  scored 165 and Arnold Warren 123.
