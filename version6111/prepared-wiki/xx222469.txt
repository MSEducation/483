==3D Game and Graphics Engines Database==

DevMaster.net's 3D Game and Graphics Engines Database, also known as the 3D Engines Databases, is the most comprehensive web directory and product ranking site for 3D Engines - covering full-featured game engines, toolsets, and libraries as well as more general purpose3D graphics engines libraries (or APIs). 
DevMaster.net created this engine database, initially known as the "3D Engines Database," on August 6, 2006.  It was  based on the 3dengines.net engine  database,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=262110&whichpage=1 | title=DevMaster.net Presents the 3D Engines Database | publisher=DevMaster.net  | accessdate=2008-09-26[/tpl] founded by 3D engine expert Alexey Busygin.  The 3dengines.net engine database was merged into DevMaster.net's database the following month,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.devmaster.net/news/index.php?storyid=384 | title=3D Engines Database Receives an Official Editor | publisher=DevMaster.net | accessdate=2008-09-26[/tpl] with 3dengines.net founder Alexey Busygin becoming the new editor for the combined database.
Unlike GameDeveloperTools.com - which covers a broader range of game development-related products, also including related Tools (such Game development tools), modeling tools, and other Digital Content Creation Tools), Middleware (e.g. for Physics and AI), and Books - DevMaster.net's database focuses exclusively on Game Engines and 3D Graphics Engines (aka. Libraries or APIs).

==Daily Information==

DevMaster.net allows users to submit news announcements, code gems (coding tips and examples), and images (screenshots of games, tools, and 3D rendering techniques).  New features images often appearing every several days, and new code gems averaging about one or two per month.  posted, on average, closer to once or twice per month.  However, submissions for news, images, and code gems are reviewed daily, hence their description as "The Daily Code Gem" and "The Daily Featured Image" on DevMaster.net home page.

==Hosted Sites==

Similar to GameDev.net, DevMaster.net offers hosting services for sub-sites with their own subdomain at DevMaster.net.  Currently, there is only one site, Tripple Buffer Software team. Subsites are offered their own forums under the Hosted Sites forum group on the main DevMaster.net site.

==DmWiki==

DevMaster.net hosts DmWiki as an open, community-driven repository of information for game developers. It specializes in offering information for new teams and developers looking to get started, but also covers tutorials and other more advanced or specialized topics.  More complete, peer reviewed articles and tutorials can be found in their Articles/Tutorials section.
