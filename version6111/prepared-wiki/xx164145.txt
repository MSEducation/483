The Florida Citrus Tower is a [tpl]convert|226|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] structure built in 1956 in Clermont, Florida. Once the most famous landmark of the Orlando area, it was built to allow visitors to observe the miles of orange groves surrounding it; developments in the citrus industry since its construction have left it providing a view of suburban neighborhoods today. At more than 500 feet above sea level, it is the highest observation point in Florida.Frommer's Florida '93 by Springer, George McDonald, Marylyn Springer, Don A Schultz
