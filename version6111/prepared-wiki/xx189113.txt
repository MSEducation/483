Notes to You is a 1941 Looney Tunes American cartoon featuring Porky Pig and an unnamed alley cat (who resembles Clampett's cat from The Hep Cat). This cartoon would be remade in 1948, as Back Alley Oproar, with Elmer Fudd in Porky's role and Sylvester as the musical cat.

==Plot==

When Porky tries to go to sleep a cat (claimed by some to be a prototypical version of Sylvester the cat) starts singing in his back yard. Porky then starts throwing objects at the cat. Porky finally hits him with a vase. The cat starts singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling at Porky, and Porky shuts the window. Porky's phone rings and he answers it. It's the cat finishing the song. Furious, Porky grabs a shotgun and claims "I'll get rid of that c-cat once and for all!" and lays a saucer of milk on the porch, Porky then falls asleep as the cat drinks the milk and wakes Porky up.
Porky then chases the cat with the shotgun until the cat sings Rock-a-Bye Baby, which lulls Porky to sleep. The cat then wakes Porky up by conducting the loud music playing on the radio (Frat), before running out and singing the song The Umbrella Man, an American hit recorded in 1938 by Kay Kyser's dance orchestra. Porky locks down the window, but the cat reopens the door and sings Jeepers Creepers. Porky chases him out again. When the cat is outside singing Make Love With a Guitar, Porky grabs his gun and shoots the cat, who manages to gasp out a chorus of Aloha 'Oe, and dies. As Porky feels guilt over the cat's death, he's startled to hear the cat's nine lives outside his window singing the Sextet from the opera Lucia di Lammermoor.
As the picture irises out, a crash is heard (presumably, Porky, at his wits' end, jumped out of the window).
