==Career==

British experimental musician David Tibet of Current 93 heard a demo and offered to release Antony's music through his Durtro label. Antony started the band, its name inspired by the transgender rights activist Marsha P. Johnson."Marsha P. Johnson (1944 - 1992) Activist, Drag Mother." A Gender Variance Who's Who. May 2, 2009. Under Creative Commons License: Attribution The debut album, Antony and the Johnsons, was released in 1998. In 2001, Hegarty released a short follow-up EP, I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy, which, in addition to the title track, included a cover of "Mysteries of Love", a David Lynch/Angelo Badalamenti song and "Soft Black Stars", a Current 93 cover.
Producer Hal Willner heard the EP and played it to Lou Reed, who immediately recruited him for his project The Raven. Now gaining more attention, Hegarty signed to US-based record label Secretly Canadian, and released another EP, The Lake, with Lou Reed guest-performing on one of the tracks. Secretly Canadian also re-released Hegarty's debut album in the United States to wider distribution in 2004.
Antony's second full-length album, 2005's I Am a Bird Now, was greeted with positive reviews and significantly more mainstream attention. The album featured guest appearances by Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright, Boy George and Devendra Banhart, and circled themes of duality and transformation. I Am a Bird Now featured arrangements by Maxim Moston and Julia Kent and was mixed by Doug Henderson. In September 2005 Antony and the Johnsons were awarded the Mercury Prize"Antony and Johnsons win Mercury". BBC News, 7 September 2005. Retrieved on 25 October 2008. for the best UK album of 2005. Rival Mercury nominees, and favorites for the prize, the Kaiser Chiefs suggested that Antony got in on a technicality; despite the fact he was born in the United Kingdom he spent much of his time in the US – although they later apologized for the suggestion that he wasn't a deserving winner.
Antony and the Johnsons collaborated with experimental film-maker Charles Atlas and presented TURNING in November 2006 in Rome, London, Paris, Madrid, and Braga. Thirteen women from New York City were presented in intimate live video portraits during the course of the concert.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] The Guardian called the piece "fragile, life affirming, and truly wonderful (five stars)". Le Monde in Paris hailed TURNING as "Concert-manifeste transsexuel".

Ann Powers wrote of The Crying Light for the LA Times online, "it's the most personal environmentalist statement possible, making an unforeseen connection between queer culture's identity politics and the green movement. As music, it's simply exquisite – more controlled and considered than anything Antony and the Johnsons have done and sure to linger in the minds of listeners."[tpl]cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/antony_and_the_johnsons/ | work=Los Angeles Times | title='Wretches and Jabberers' documentary on autism draws support (and music) from Scarlett Johansson, Antony, Bob Weir, others Updated[/tpl]
After touring throughout North America and Europe in support of their new album, Antony and the Johnsons presented a unique staging of The Crying Light with the Manchester Camerata at the Manchester Opera House for the 2009 Manchester International Festival.

In interviews around the world in 2010, Antony described his work on Swanlights and The Crying Light as "a collision between joy and a sense of hopelessness".  Antony said he was struggling to come to terms with the idea that he was part of a society that was having a "virulent" impact on the earth.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/music-theatre-cinema/2010/10/antony-and-the-johnsons-swanlights | work=Vogue Italy | title=Antony and the Johnsons | date=27 October 2010[/tpl] He suggested that the degradation of nature was partially a result of the subjugation of women and earth-based spiritual systems. Antony also blamed the collapse of humanity's sustainable relationship with the earth in part on the rise of patriarchal religions that suggest the destiny of humanity to be "a paradise elsewhere".  Interview Magazine describes Swanlights as "an emotional personal call for global, collective change".[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/music/2010-11-02/antony-swanlights-lincoln-center/ | work=Interview Magazine | title=Antony Sees the Swanlight | date=2 November 2010[/tpl]
