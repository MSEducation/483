Open admissions (sometimes called open enrollment) is a type of unselective and non-competitive college admissions process in the United States in which the only criterion for entrance is a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.Peterson's Guide: Glossary of terms
This form of "inclusive" admissionsCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: Undergraduate Profile Technical Details is used by many public junior colleges and community colleges, and differs from selective admission policies held by most private liberal arts colleges and research universities in the United States, which often take into account standardized test scores as well as other academic and character-related criteria.
The open admissions concept was heavily promoted in the 1960s and 70s as a way to reduce discrimination in college admissions and promote education of the underprivileged, the first major application being at City University of New York,[tpl]cite journal|title=Education: Open Admissions: American Dream or Disaster?|date=19 Oct 1970|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944161-5,00.html|work=Time[/tpl]  CUNY later applied this policy only to 2-year Community Colleges which are better prepared for remedial education. Critics argue the open admissions forces an institution either to raise tuition to limit enrollment (which denies opportunities for some students), obtain increased subsidies from government or other sources (as happens with typical community college systems), or else lower standards and limit offerings to lower costs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
