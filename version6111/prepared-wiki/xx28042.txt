==Population==

The first true estimate of the population of Bolivia came in 1826, which 997,427 inhabitants were estimated. This number was calculated from the 1796 census organized by Francisco Gil de Taboada, which consisted of several Bolivian cities. The first modern census was completed in 1831, and ten have been completed since then. The organizer of Bolivian's censuses has changed throughout the years—Andrés de Santa Cruz (1831), The Bolivian Statistical Office (1835, 1854, 1882), The Bolivian Statistical Commission (1845), The National Immigration Bureau and The Statistics and Geographic Propaganda (1900), and The Department of Statistics and Censuses (1950)—with the INE conducting the census since 1976. The national census is supposed to be conducted every ten years, however, the 2012 census was late because of "climatic factors and the financing." The 2012 census data was conducted on 21 November 2012, in which 10,027,254 inhabitants were in the country. The estimated cost of the census was $50 million.[tpl]Cite news | url=http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20120419/el-gobierno-realizara-el-censo-2012-el-21-de_168476_353682.html | title=El Gobierno Realizará el Censo 2012 el 21 de Noviembre | trans_title=The Government will make the 2012 Census on 21 November | language=Spanish | date=19 April 2013 | newspaper=Los Tiempos | accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | url=http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20130123/censo-2012-bolivia-tiene-10389913-habitantes_199802_426380.html | title=Censo 2012: Bolivia Tiene 10.389.913 habitantes | trans_title=Census 2012: Bolivia has 10,389,913 inhabitants | language=Spanish | newspaper=Los Tiempos | date=23 January 2013 | accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl]
