Eric Steven Raymond (born December 4, 1957), often referred to as ESR, is an American computer programmer, author and open source software advocate. After the 1997 publication of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Raymond was for a number of years frequently quoted as an unofficial spokesman for the open source movement.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1002-5067743.html | title=Hackers cut off SCO Web site | date=August 25, 2003 | accessdate=August 22, 2009 [/tpl] He is also known for his work on the popular Roguelike game Nethack for which he wrote the Guidebook, in addition to being a member of the "Dev-Team". More recently, he is recognized in certain circles for his 1990 edit and later updates of the Jargon File, currently in print as the The New Hacker's Dictionary.Eric S.

==Biography==

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, USA 1957, Raymond lived in Venezuela as a child. His family moved to Pennsylvania, USA in 1971.[tpl]cite web | url = http://laweekly.com/art+books/cyber/man-against-the-fud/6614/  | title =  Man Against the FUD | accessdate = July 7, 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.laweekly.com/1999-05-27/art-books/man-against-the-fud/ |archivedate = October 13, 2007[/tpl] Raymond said in an interview that his cerebral palsy motivated him to go into computing.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.salon.com/1998/03/30/feature947788266/ | date = April 1998 | title = Let my software go! | first = Andrew | last = Leonard | work = Salon.com | publisher = Salon Media Group | location = San Francisco | accessdate = November 23, 2009 [/tpl]  Raymond has spoken in more than fifteen countries on six continents[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl], including a lecture at Microsoft.Open Source Advocate Invited To Microsoft
He wrote CML2, a source code configuration system; while originally intended for the Linux kernel, it was rejected by kernel developers.[tpl]cite web | url = http://kerneltrap.org/node/17 | title = CML2, ESR, & The LKML | work = KernelTrap | date = February 17, 2002 [/tpl] Raymond attributed this rejection to "kernel list politics".[tpl]cite web | url= http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-ivesr.html?ca=dgr-lnxw09EricRaymond | title = Interview: Eric Raymond goes back to basics | work = IBM developerWorks | first = Rob | last = McMillan [/tpl] Linus Torvalds on the other hand said in a 2007 mailing list post that as a matter of policy, the development team preferred more incremental changes.
In 2000–2002 Raymond wrote a number of HOWTOs still included in the Linux Documentation Project. His personal archive also lists a number of non-technical and very early non-Linux FAQs. His books, The Cathedral and the Bazaar and The Art of Unix Programming, discuss Unix and Linux history and culture, and user tools for programming and other tasks. In 1998 he received and published a Microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open-source software.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/11/biztech/articles/03memo.html |title=Internal Memo Shows Microsoft Executives' Concern Over Free Software |last=Harmon |first=Amy |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 1998|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] Eric named this and other documents subsequently leaked, "the Halloween Documents". Noting that the Jargon File had not been maintained since about 1983, he adopted it in 1990 and currently has a third edition in print. Paul Dourish maintains an archived original version of the Jargon File, because, he says, Raymond's updates "essentially destroyed what held it together."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html  | title = The Original Hacker's Dictionary | work = dourish.com | accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]

==Open source==

Raymond says he began his programming career with writing proprietary software, between 1980 and 1985. In a 2008 essay he "defended the right of programmers to issue work under proprietary licenses because I think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it, it's neither my business nor anyone else's but his customer's what the terms of sale are".[tpl]cite web | url = http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=556 | title = Why I Hate Proprietary Software | first = Eric S. | last = Raymond |date = October 1, 2008 | accessdate = November 5, 2011 [/tpl] In the same essay he also said that the "logic of the system" puts developers into "dysfunctional roles", with bad code the result.
Raymond also coined an aphorism he dubbed "Linus' Law", inspired by Linus Torvalds: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", that first appeared in The Cathedral and the Bazaar.Raymond, Eric S.; The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary, O'Reilly Media 2001, 241pp. ISBN 0-596-00108-8. p30
Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement and co-founded the Open Source Initiative in 1998, taking on the self-appointed role of ambassador of open source to the press, business and public. The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the Mozilla (then Netscape) source code in 1998 cited The Cathedral and the Bazaar as "independent validation" of ideas proposed by Eric Hahn and Jamie Zawinski.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html| title = Interview: Frank Hecker | last = Suarez-Potts | first = Louis | year = 2001 |accessdate = November 5, 2011[/tpl] Hahn also described the book as "clearly influential".Moody, Glyn; Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Basic Books 2002, 344 pages. ISBN 0-7382-0670-9. p. 190
Raymond has refused to speculate on whether the "bazaar" development model could be applied to works such as books and music, not wanting to "weaken the winning argument for open-sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/afterword/ | title = Afterword: Beyond Software? | last = Raymond | first = Eric S. | year = 2000 |accessdate = July 24, 2007[/tpl]
Raymond has had a number of public disputes with other figures in the free software movement. As head of the Open Source Initiative, he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products. The "very seductive" moral and ethical rhetoric of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation fails, he said, "not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language ... simply does not persuade anybody".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=June 28, 1999-023-10-NW-SM | title = Shut Up And Show Them The Code | last = Raymond | first = Eric S. | work = Linux Today | date = July 28, 1999 |accessdate = November 23, 2009 [/tpl] Raymond stepped down as the president of the Open Source Initiative in February 2005.[tpl]cite web | url = http://opensource.org/pressreleases/expansion.php | title = Open Source Initiative (OSI) Announces expanded programs, counsel, AND board | last = Raymond | first = Eric S. | date = January 31, 2005 |accessdate = January 14, 2010 [/tpl]

==Political activism==

Raymond is a member of the Libertarian Party. He is a gun rights advocate.Richard Stallman, Free Software, and Copyleft 2011 He has endorsed Defense Distributed and its efforts, calling Defense Distributed "friends of freedom" and writing "I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force. As 3D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous, this could be a major step in the right direction."[tpl]cite web|url=http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4521|title=Defense Distributed|first=Eric|last=Raymond|publisher=Armed and Dangerous|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Kopstein|first=Joshua|title=Guns want to be free: what happens when 3D printing and crypto-anarchy collide?|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4209364/guns-want-to-be-free-what-happens-when-3d-printing-and-crypto-anarchy|journal=The Verge|date=April 12, 2013[/tpl]
