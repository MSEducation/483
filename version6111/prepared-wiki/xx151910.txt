[[Water salute]]

CATEGORIES: Firefighting, Greetings, Salutes, Fire service awards and honors

A water salute occurs for ceremonial purposes when a vehicle travels under plumes of water expelled by one or more fire fighting vehicles. 
At an airport, typically an even number of vehicles will line up perpendicular on the sides of the taxiway or apron, and the plumes of water will form a series of arches.  Symbolically the procession would look similar to a bridal party walking under a wedding arch or the Arch of Sabres at a military wedding.
Water salutes are also used for ships and other watercraft, with water being delivered by fireboats.   
Water salutes have been used to mark the retirement of a senior pilot, air traffic controller or the first or last flight of an airline to an airport, or for other notable events.  When the Concorde flew its last flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport blue, white and red coloured plumes were used.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3211053.stm
