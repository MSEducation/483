==Motto and vision==

To learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind.
The above is derived from the Chinese motto, quoted from the great Chinese classic Yijing (Book of Changes) and two ancient treatises, one from Han dynasty and the other from pre-Qin times.
The original Chinese text can be paraphrased as follows: "Learn every truth and use the knowledge learned to accomplish every task" and "to learn; to serve".
Be a leading university that excels in professional education, applied research and partnership for the betterment of Hong Kong, the nation and world.

==History==

The school was founded in 1937 as the Government Trade School. Located in Wood Road, Wan Chai, the School was the first publicly funded, post-secondary technical institution in Hong Kong.
After World War II, the school became the Hong Kong Technical College in 1947, offering both full-time and part-time courses. The year 1957 saw the opening of the new premises of the College in Hung Hom. The College offered the first accounting education program in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Polytechnic was formally established on 1 August 1972, taking over the campus and staff of the Hong Kong Technical College. Its mandate was to provide professionally-oriented education.
Having gained approval from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee for self-accreditation of degree programmes, the Institution assumed full university status on 25 November 1994, changing its name to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
Today, PolyU is an institution of higher learning and offers more than 130 postgraduate, undergraduate and sub-degree programmes, supported by more than 1,000 academic and research staff members from different parts of the world.

==Library==

Pao Yue-kong Library[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.polyu.edu.hk/ |title=lib.polyu.edu.hk |publisher=lib.polyu.edu.hk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl] was established on 1 August 1972 to serve the then Hong Kong Polytechnic. Between 1973 and 1976, library services were provided at two centres, one at the present University site at Hung Hom and one at the Quarry Bay Centre. The two centres were consolidated when they were moved to the present Library Building in 1976. On 25 November 1994, the Polytechnic assumed full university status and was renamed The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. On 20 December 1995, the University Library was officially named after the late Sir Yue-kong Pao in appreciation of a generous donation to the University by his family.
Opened by Princess Alexandra on 7 February 1977, the Library Building is a six-storey purpose-designed building with an area of 16,662 square metres, providing approximately 3,623 study places. The Library also houses a 24-Hour Study Centre, group discussion rooms, a seminar room for library instruction classes, AV carrels and group rooms for use of audio-visual materials, study carrels for private study, and a special room for the visually disabled.
The Library comprises one of the largest collections of scientific, engineering and business materials in East Asia. Other areas of strength are information technology, computing, nursing, textiles and design. The present holdings exceed 2.2 million, to which more than 40,000 volumes are added annually. Over 4,100 active print serial titles are held in the Library. The Library also provides Internet access to over 32,610 unique full-text e-journal titles, almost 225,100 e-books, and a wide array of multi-media and e-learning programmes.
The Library also maintains several special collections and self-developed databases, including a comprehensive Standards Collection, the PolyU Examination Paper Database, the PolyU Course Scheme Database, the Senate Paper Database, a Digital Image Gallery, and a Slide Collection. In addition, a unique and heavily used collection of over 24,000 local Chinese and English language television programmes and the Hongkongiana Online database (an index to Hong Kong information found in periodicals published in Hong Kong) all constitute important resources for the study and research of Hong Kong.
