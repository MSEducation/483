A prion ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=Pronunciation prion.ogg|ˈ|p|r|iː|ɒ|n[/tpl][tpl]OED|Prion[/tpl]) in the Scrapie form (PrPSc) is an infectious agent composed of protein in a misfolded form.[tpl]cite book |editors=Ryan KJ, Ray CG, et al |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-8385-8529-9 |pages=624–8[/tpl] This is the central idea of the Prion Hypothesis, which remains debated.[tpl]cite journal |author=Somerville RA. |title=TSE agent strains and PrP: reconciling structure and function |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=606–612 year=2002 |pmid=12468229 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(02)02212-0[/tpl] This would be in contrast to all other known infectious agents (virus/bacteria/fungus/parasite)—which must contain nucleic acids (either DNA, RNA, or both).  The word prion, coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner, is derived from the words protein and infectious.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/prusiner-autobio.html |title=Stanley B.

In humans, prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and kuru.http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/prions/ All known prion diseases affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue and all are currently untreatable and universally fatal.[tpl]cite journal |author=Prusiner SB |title=Prions |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=23 |pages=13363–83 |year=1998|pmid=9811807 |pmc=33918 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.23.13363|bibcode = 1998PNAS...9513363P [/tpl] In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.http://www.nature.com/news/one-in-2-000-uk-people-might-carry-vcjd-proteins-1.13962
Prions are not considered living organisms but may propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state.  If a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form; the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form.  These newly formed prions can then go on to convert more proteins themselves; this triggers a chain reaction that produces large amounts of the prion form.[tpl]cite journal |author=Aguzzi A |title=Unraveling prion strains with cell biology and organic chemistry |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=11–2 |year=2008 |pmid=18172195 |pmc=2224168 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0710824105 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105...11A [/tpl] All known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets. Amyloid aggregates are fibrils, growing at their ends, and replicating when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication, which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-4622(99)00016-2 |author=Masel J, Jansen VAA, Nowak MA |title=Quantifying the kinetic parameters of prion replication |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |volume=77 |issue=2–3 |pages=139–152 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10326247[/tpl]  (Note that the propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding; animals that do not express the normal form of the prion protein can neither develop nor transmit the disease.)
This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Christopher M. Dobson |title=The structural basis of protein folding and its links with human disease |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Prions come in different strains, each with a slightly different structure, and, most of the time, strains breed true. Prion replication is nevertheless subject to occasional epimutation and then natural selection just like other forms of replication.[tpl]cite journal |author=Li J, Browning S, Mahal SP, Oelschlegel AM, Weissmann C |title=Darwinian evolution of prions in cell culture |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=869–72 |year=2010 |pmid=20044542 |pmc=2848070 |doi=10.1126/science.1183218 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..869L [/tpl]
All known mammalian prion diseases are caused by the so-called prion protein, PrP.  The endogenous, properly folded form is denoted PrPC (for C'''ommon'' or Cellular''), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Sc'rapie'', after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.)[tpl]cite journal |author=Laurén J, Gimbel DA, Nygaard HB, Gilbert JW, Strittmatter SM |title=Cellular prion protein mediates impairment of synaptic plasticity by amyloid-beta oligomers |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7233 |pages=1128–32 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19242475 |pmc=2748841 |doi=10.1038/nature07761|bibcode = 2009Natur.457.1128L [/tpl] The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reaction.
Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lindquist S, Krobitsch S, Li L, Sondheimer N |title=Investigating protein conformation-based inheritance and disease in yeast |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Discovery==

During the 1960s, two London-based researchers, radiation biologist Tikvah Alper and mathematician John Stanley Griffith, developed the hypothesis that some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by an infectious agent consisting solely of proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alper T, Cramp WA, Haig DA, Clarke MC |title=Does the agent of scrapie replicate without nucleic acid? |journal=Nature |volume=214 |issue=5090 |pages=764–6 |date=May 1967 |pmid=4963878 |doi=10.1038/214764a0  |url= |bibcode = 1967Natur.214..764A [/tpl][ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Griffith JS |title=Self-replication and scrapie |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5105 |pages=1043–4 |date=September 1967 |pmid=4964084 |doi=10.1038/2151043a0 |url= |bibcode = 1967Natur.215.1043G [/tpl]
[/ref] Earlier investigations by E. J. Field into scrapie and the kuru had identified the transfer of pathologically inert polysaccharides that only become infectious in the host.[tpl]cite journal|author=Field EJ|journal=Br. Med. J|volume=2|issue=564|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5513.564|year=1966[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Adams DH, Field EJ|title=The Infective Process in Scrapie|journal=The Lancet|volume=292|issue=7570|pages=714–716[/tpl] Alper and Griffith wanted to account for the discovery that the mysterious infectious agent causing the diseases scrapie and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease resisted ionizing radiation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Field|first=EJ|coauthors=Farmer F,Caspary EA,Joyce G|title=Susceptibility of scrapie agent to ionizing radiation.|journal=Nature|date=Apr 5, 1969|volume=222|series=5188|issue=90|page=1|pmid=4975649[/tpl]  (A single ionizing "hit" normally destroys an entire infectious particle, and the dose needed to hit half the particles depends on the size of the particles. The data suggested that the infectious agent was too small to be a virus.)
Francis Crick recognized the potential importance of the Griffith protein-only hypothesis for scrapie propagation in the second edition of his "Central dogma of molecular biology" (1970): While asserting that the flow of sequence information from protein to protein, or from protein to RNA and DNA was "precluded", he noted that Griffith's hypothesis was a potential contradiction (although it was not so promoted by Griffith).  The revised hypothesis was later formulated, in part, to accommodate reverse transcription (which both Howard Temin and David Baltimore discovered in 1970).[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In 1982, Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco announced that his team had purified the hypothetical infectious prion, and that the infectious agent consisted mainly of a specific protein – though they did not manage to isolate the protein until two years after Prusiner's announcement.[ref]

While the infectious agent was named a prion, the specific protein that the prion was composed of is also known as the Prion Protein (PrP), though this protein may occur both in infectious and non-infectious forms. Prusiner won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his research into prions.

==Structure==

===Isoforms===

The protein that prions are made of (PrP) is found throughout the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc — the C refers to 'cellular' or 'common' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep.[tpl]cite journal |author=Priola SA, Chesebro B, Caughey B |title=Biomedicine. A view from the top—prion diseases from 10,000 feet |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5621 |pages=917–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12738843 |doi=10.1126/science.1085920[/tpl] While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, and their relationship to the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.

====PrPC====

PrPC is a normal protein found on the membranes of cells. It has 209 amino acids (in humans), one disulfide bond, a molecular mass of 35–36 kDa and a mainly alpha-helical structure. Several topological forms exist; one cell surface form anchored via glycolipid and two transmembrane forms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hegde RS, Mastrianni JA, Scott MR, et al. |title=A transmembrane form of the prion protein in neurodegenerative disease |journal=Science |volume=279 |issue=5352 |pages=827–34 |year=1998|pmid=9452375 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5352.827 |bibcode = 1998Sci...279..827H [/tpl] The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning that it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques.[tpl]cite book |author=Krull, Ira S.; Brian K. Nunnally |title=Prions and mad cow disease |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2004 |page=6 |isbn=0-8247-4083-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WjeuaHopV5UC&pg=PA6[/tpl] Its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated. PrPC binds copper (II) ions with high affinity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brown DR, Qin K, Herms JW, et al. |title=The cellular prion protein binds copper in vivo |journal=Nature |volume=390 |issue=6661 |pages=684–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9414160 |doi=10.1038/37783|bibcode = 1997Natur.390..684B [/tpl] The significance of this finding is not clear, but it is presumed to relate to PrP structure or function. PrPC is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycolipid anchor.[tpl]cite journal |author=Weissmann C |title=The state of the prion |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=861–71 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15494743 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1025[/tpl]  PrP has been reported to play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo, and may therefore be involved in cell-cell communication in the brain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Málaga-Trillo E, Solis GP, Schrock Y, et al. |title=Regulation of embryonic cell adhesion by the prion protein |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e55 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19278297 |pmc=2653553 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000055 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000055 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |editor1-last=Weissmann |editor1-first=Charles[/tpl]

====PrPres====

An isoform of PrP known as PrPres because of its resistance to proteolytic digestion by Proteinase K, a surrogate marker of prion infectivity. PrPres may be infectious. This term is used to distinguish Proteinase K-resistant PrP isoforms that have been demonstrated to contain infectivity by transmission and those that have not been proven infectious. For example, PrPC can be denatured or fibrilized in vitro and these preparations may "convert" into Proteinase K-resistant isoforms.   However, upon transmission into susceptible hosts, no prion disease develops.

====PrPSc====

The infectious isoform of PrP, known as PrPSc, is able to convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has a higher proportion of β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pan KM, Baldwin M, Nguyen J, et al. |title=Conversion of alpha-helices into beta-sheets features in the formation of the scrapie prion proteins |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=90 |issue=23 |pages=10962–6 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7902575 |pmc=47901 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.90.23.10962|bibcode = 1993PNAS...9010962P [/tpl] Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process.Baker, Harry F., and Rosalind M. Ridley, eds. Prion diseases. Totowa, N.J: Humana, 1996 The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.

==Prion replication mechanism==

The first hypothesis that tried to explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen FE, Pan KM, Huang Z, Baldwin M, Fletterick RJ, Prusiner SB |title=Structural clues to prion replication |journal=Science |volume=265 |issue=5178 |pages=530–531 |year=1994 |pmid=7909169 |doi=10.1126/science.7909169|bibcode = 1994Sci...264..530C [/tpl] This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing the rate of the conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eigen M |title=Prionics or the kinetic basis of prion diseases |journal=Biophysical Chemistry| volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=A1–18 |year=1996 |pmid=8981746  |doi=10.1016/S0301-4622(96)02250-8 [/tpl] This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.
An alternative model assumes that PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then the quantity of prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-72-12-2905 |author=Bolton DC, Rudelli RD, Currie JR, Bendheim PE |title=Copurification of sp33-37 and scrapie agent from hamster brain prior to detectable histopathology and clinical-disease |journal=Journal of General Virology| volume=72 | pages=2905–2913 |year=1991 |pmid=1684986 |issue=12[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Jendroska K, Heinzel FP, Torchia M, Stowring L, Kretzschmar HA, Kon A, Stern A, Prusiner SB, DeArmond SJ |title=Proteinase-resistant prion protein accumulation in syrian-hamster brain correlates with regional pathology and scrapie infectivity |journal=Neurology| volume=41 |issue=9 | pages=1482–1490 |year=1991| url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/9/1482?ck=nck |pmid=1679911 |doi=10.1212/WNL.41.9.1482[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-77-8-1925 |author=Beekes M, Baldauf E, Diringer H |title=Sequential appearance and accumulation of pathognomonic markers in the central nervous system of hamsters orally infected with scrapie |journal=Journal of General Virology| volume=77 | pages=1925–1934 |year=1996 |pmid=8760444 |issue=8[/tpl] This can be explained by taking into account fibril breakage.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bamborough P, Wille H, Telling GC, Yehiely F, Prusiner SB, Cohen FE |title=Prion protein structure and scrapie replication: theoretical, spectroscopic, and genetic investigations |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology| volume=61 | pages=495–509 |year=1996| pmid=9246476 |doi=10.1101/SQB.1996.061.01.050[/tpl] A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1178250 |author=Knowles TPJ, Waudby CA, Devlin GL, Cohen SIA, Aguzzi A, Vendruscolo M, Terentjev EM, Welland ME, Dobson CM |title=An Analytical Solution to the Kinetics of Breakable Filament Assembly |journal=Science| volume=326 |issue=5959 | pages=1533–1537 |year=2009 |pmid=20007899|bibcode = 2009Sci...326.1533K [/tpl]
The mechanism of prion replication has implications for designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug does not need to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that the most effective way to achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.[tpl]cite journal |author=Masel J, Jansen VAA |title=Designing drugs to stop the formation of prions and other amyloids | journal=Biophysical Chemistry| volume=88 |issue=1–3 | pages=47–59 |year=2000 |pmid=11152275 |doi= 10.1016/S0301-4622(00)00197-6 [/tpl]

==PrP function==

The physiological function of the prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In recent research done in mice, it was found that the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann Cells and that the lack of PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.[tpl]cite journal  | title= Healthy prions protect nerves | journal=Nature | author=Abbott A | doi=10.1038/news.2010.29 | date=2010-01-24 [/tpl]

===PrP and long-term memory===

A review of evidence in 2005 suggested that PrP may have a normal function in maintenance of long-term memory.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shorter J, Lindquist S |title=Prions as adaptive conduits of memory and inheritance |journal=Nature Reviews.

===PrP and stem cell renewal===

A 2006 article from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research indicates that PrP expression on stem cells is necessary for an organism's self-renewal of bone marrow.  The study showed that all long-term hematopoietic stem cells express PrP on their cell membrane and that hematopoietic tissues with PrP-null stem cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cell depletion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhang CC, Steele AD, Lindquist S, Lodish HF |title=Prion protein is expressed on long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells and is important for their self-renewal |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=7 |pages=2184–9 |year=2006|pmid=16467153 |pmc=1413720 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510577103|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.2184Z [/tpl]

==Prion disease==

Prions cause neurodegenerative disease by aggregating extracellularly within the central nervous system to form plaques known as amyloid, which disrupt the normal tissue structure. This disruption is characterized by "holes" in the tissue with resultant spongy architecture due to the vacuole formation in the neurons.[tpl]cite book |editor=Robbins SL, Cotran RS, Kumar V, Collins T |title=Robbins pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-7335-X [/tpl] Other histological changes include astrogliosis and the absence of an inflammatory reaction.[tpl]cite journal |author=Belay ED |title=Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in humans |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=53 |issue= |pages=283–314 |year=1999 |pmid=10547693 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.283[/tpl] While the incubation period for prion diseases is relatively long (5 to 20 years), once symptoms appear the disease progresses rapidly, leading to brain damage and death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/prions/|title=Prion Diseases| date=2006-01-26 | accessdate = 2010-02-28 | publisher=US Centers for Disease Control[/tpl] Neurodegenerative symptoms can include convulsions, dementia, ataxia (balance and coordination dysfunction), and behavioural or personality changes.
All known prion diseases, collectively called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gilch S, Winklhofer KF, Groschup MH, et al. |title=Intracellular re-routing of prion protein prevents propagation of PrP(Sc) and delays onset of prion disease |journal=The EMBO Journal |volume=20 |issue=15 |pages=3957–66 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11483499 |pmc=149175 |doi=10.1093/emboj/20.15.3957[/tpl] However, a vaccine developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans.[tpl]cite web | author = New York University Medical Center and School of Medicine | title = Active Vaccine Prevents Mice From Developing Prion Disease| work = Science Daily | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050514111648.htm |date=2005-05-14 | accessdate = 2010-02-28 [/tpl] Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production – thus theoretically making them immune to BSE,[tpl]cite news |first= Rick|last=Weiss |title=Scientists Announce Mad Cow Breakthrough. |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/31/AR2006123100672.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2007-01-01|quote=Scientists said yesterday that they have used genetic engineering techniques to produce the first cattle that may be biologically incapable of getting mad cow disease. |accessdate=2010-02-28[/tpl] building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein.[tpl]cite journal |author=Büeler H, Aguzzi A, Sailer A, et al. |title=Mice devoid of PrP are resistant to scrapie |journal=Cell |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=1339–47 |year=1993|pmid=8100741 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90360-3 [/tpl]
Many different mammalian species can be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Collinge J |title=Prion diseases of humans and animals: their causes and molecular basis |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=24 |issue= |pages=519–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11283320 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.519[/tpl] Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, however, is believed caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ironside JW |title=Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: risk of transmission by blood transfusion and blood therapies |journal=Haemophilia : the Official Journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia |volume=12 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=8–15; discussion 26–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16445812 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2516.2006.01195.x[/tpl]

===Transmission===

It has been recognized that prion diseases can arise in three different ways: acquired, familial, or sporadic.[ref]
</ref> It is often assumed that the diseased form directly interacts with the normal form to make it rearrange its structure. One idea, the "Protein X" hypothesis, is that an as-yet unidentified cellular protein (Protein X) enables the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by bringing a molecule of each of the two together into a complex.<ref>
</ref>
Current research suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.[ref]

A University of California research team, led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner, has provided evidence for the theory that infection can occur from prions in manure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tamgüney|first=Gültekin|coauthors=Miller, Michael W., Wolfe, Lisa L., Sirochman, Tracey M., Glidden, David V., Palmer, Christina, Lemus, Azucena, DeArmond, Stephen J., Prusiner, Stanley B.|title=Asymptomatic deer excrete infectious prions in faeces|journal=Nature|date=9 September 2009|volume=461|issue=7263|pages=529–532|doi=10.1038/nature08289|pmid=19741608|pmc=3186440|bibcode = 2009Natur.461..529T [/tpl]  And, since manure is present in many areas surrounding water reservoirs, as well as used on many crop fields, it raises the possibility of widespread transmission.  It was reported in January 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles, in an animal testing experiment focusing on scrapie infection in laboratory mice.[ref]
