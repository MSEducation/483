==History==

===1996-2012===

In 1996, Inae Piercy founded Soundview School to provide education for her young son and other children in the community. The previous school (The Stein School) had closed, and Ms. Piercy took to rebuilding a new school with  a new campus. Ms. Piercy built and ran Soundview School for seventeen years.
Ms. Piercy was born in Seoul, Korea in the aftermath of the Korean war. Community and family support were critical in the difficult times, educational effort was part of the culture, and her family's background in music performance instilled in her a love for the arts. She came to the United States, a few weeks before she was to graduate from the prestigious Ewha Girl's High School in Seoul. She obtained degrees in nuclear medicine (B.S.) and computer science (M.S.), and spent twenty years working in health care and high tech corporations.
