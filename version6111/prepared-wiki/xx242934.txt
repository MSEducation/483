==History==

Started in 2002, AVCon (then A/V Connection, now commonly known to stand for Anime and Video Games Convention) began as a joint convention supported by volunteers from the University of South Australiaâ€™s Adelaide Japanese Animation Society (AJAS) and the Adelaide University Video Gamers Association (AUVGA). After four successful annual conventions, Team AVCon Inc was established as an independent entity to run and sustain the annual convention.
In 2008, owing to continuing growth in attendee numbers, Team AVCon moved the 2009 convention from the University of Adelaide to the Adelaide Convention Centre. This resulted in double the previous year's ticket sales, with an attendance of just over 4,000 people.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1717 | title = AVCon 2009 Information | publisher = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2009-11-30[/tpl] In 2010 the convention was once again held at the Adelaide Convention Centre with 8,000 attendees,[tpl]cite web | last = Harris | first = Leigh | date = 21 July 2011 | title = AVCon to have record year this weekend | work = MCV | url = http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/avcon-to-have-record-year-this-weekend/082383 | accessdate = 26 July 2011 [/tpl] and the numbers increased once more to an attendance of over 14,000 in 2011.[tpl]cite news | last = Kelton | first = Sam | date = 25 July 2011 | title = Chewie on footpath a comic moment | work = The Advertiser | location = Adelaide, South Australia | url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/chewie-on-footpath-a-comic-moment/story-fn6bqphm-1226100875303 | accessdate = 26 July 2011 [/tpl]
