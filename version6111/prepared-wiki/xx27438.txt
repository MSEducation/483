English translation
On 22 October 1899, Hans Kamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended—Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons—and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.Ball, Phil p. 89.
FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancuphist.html |title=Spain – List of Cup Finals |author=Carnicero, José Vicente Tejedor |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] Kamper—now known as Joan Gamper—became club president in 1908, finding the club in financial difficulty after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_1.html |title=History part I|publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 March 2010[/tpl]
On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, a logo contest was held the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears [tpl]as of | 2012 | lc = on[/tpl], with some minor changes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html|title=The crest|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl]
With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was generally considered the most prestigious in that era.Murray, Bill; Murray, William J. p. 30 From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.Closa et al. p. 62–63 The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/pyrenees.html |title=Coupe des Pyrenées – Copa de los Pirineos |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |date=19 June 2001|accessdate=12 June 2010|author= Ferrer , Carles Lozano[/tpl]
During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.Spaaij, Ramón. p. 279 On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/centre_de_documentacio/annexes/castellano/24_._PARTIDOS_DE_HOMENAJE_A_JUGADORES.pdf |title=Partidos de homenaje a jugadores |format=PDF |language=Catalan |publisher=Center for Documentation, FC Barcelona |accessdate=24 August 2010 [/tpl]

Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club-members, and, by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 22,000, and was later[tpl]when|date=July 2012[/tpl] expanded to 60,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_2.html |title=History part II |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010[/tpl]
Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After he was hired, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campeonato de Cataluña, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first "golden age".

===Rivera, Republic and Civil War (1923–1957)===

On 14 June 1925, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Spanish national anthem and then gave ovation to God Save the King in a spontaneous protest against Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship. The ground was closed for six months as a reprisal, and Gamper was forced to relinquish the club presidency.Shubert, Adrian. p. 200. This coincided with the club's transition to professionalism; in 1926 the directors of Barcelona publicly declared Barcelona a professional side for the first time.Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 103. The club's 1928 victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled "Oda a Platko", written by a member of the Generation of '27, poet Rafael Alberti, who was inspired by the "heroic performance" of the Barcelona keeper.[tpl]cite web|title=Football, European Integration, National Identity: The Case of FC Barcelona|author=Roy, Joaquín|year=2001|publisher=European Community Studies Association (paper)|page=4[/tpl] On 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.
Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club entered a period of decline in which political conflict overshadowed sport throughout society.Burns, Jimmy. pp. 111–112. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, success at a national level (with the exception of a disputed title in 1937) evaded them. A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising.Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 104. On 6 August, Josep Sunyol, the club president and representative of a pro-independence political party, was murdered by Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama.Spaaij, Ramón. p. 280. Dubbed the martyrdom of barcelonisme, the murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona.Ball, Phil. pp. 116–117. In the summer of 1937, the squad went on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. That tour secured the club financially, but also resulted in half the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France. On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment, resulting in over 3,000 deaths; one of the bombs hit the club's offices.Raguer, Hilari. pp. 223–225. Catalonia came under occupation a few months later. As a symbol of 'undisciplined' Catalanism, the club, down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions.Raguer, Hilari. pp. 232–233. After the Civil War, the Catalan flag was banned and football clubs were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its club shield.
In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo. Their first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Before the second leg, Barcelona's players had a changing room visit from Franco's director of state security. He "reminded" them that they were only playing due to the "generosity of the regime". Real Madrid dominated the match, winning 11–1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=70557.html|title=Barça—Much more than just a Club|date=10 December 1998|accessdate=1 May 2011|publisher=FIFA|last=Aguilar|first=Paco|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100527222642/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=70557.html|archivedate=27 May 2010[/tpl] Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as managers and players like César, Ramallets, and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added to this total in 1948 and again in 1949. They also won the first Copa Latina that year. In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an influential figure at the club.
On a rainy Sunday in 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander on foot, refusing to catch any trams and surprising the Francoist authorities. A tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, which received the support of blaugrana fans. Events such as this made the club represent much more than just Catalonia; many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.Ferrand, Alain; McCarthy, Scott. p. 90.Witzig, Richard. p. 408.
Managers Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey), the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.

===Club de Fútbol Barcelona (1957–1978)===

With Helenio Herrera as manager, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961 they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in European Cup competition, but lost 3–2 to Benfica in the final.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/ec1.html |title=European Champions' Cup |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=Karel |last=Stokkermans[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html |title=European Competitions 1960–61 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=James M. |last=Ross[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_3.html |title=History part III |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]
The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The building of the Camp Nou, completed in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. On the positive side, the decade saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barça restored some of its former pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Bernabéu, in front of Franco, with former republican pilot Salvador Artigas as manager. The end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974 saw the club changing its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverting the crest to its original design, again including the original letters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |title=The Crest |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.MacWilliam, Rab; MacDonald, Tom. p. 180. Already an established player in the Netherlands, Cruyff quickly won over the Barça fans when he told the European press he chose Barça over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he chose the Catalan name Jordi, after the local saint, for his son.Ball, Phil. pp. 83–85. Next to players of quality like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach, and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the La Liga title in 1973–74 for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Bernabéu along the way.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lfp.es/?tabid=113&Controltype=tres&t=073&idDivision=1 |title=La Liga season 1973–74 |publisher=Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP) |accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player ever to do so) in 1974 while he was still with Barcelona.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/europa-poy.html|date=11 December 2009|author=Moore, Rob; Stokkermans, Karel |title=European Footballer of the Year ("Ballon d'Or") |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]

===Núñez and the stabilisation years (1978–2000)===

Beginning with Josep Lluís Núñez in 1978, the president of FC Barcelona has been elected by the club members. This decision was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. Núñez's main objective was to develop Barça into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. On recommendation from Cruyff, Núñez inaugurated La Masia as Barcelona's youth academy on 20 October 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/20100818/masia-como-laboratorio/840127.shtml |title=La Masia, como un laboratorio |publisher=SPORT.es |accessdate=19 August 2010 |language=Spanish |author=Perarnau, Martí |date=18 August 2010[/tpl] His presidency was to last for 22 years and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting players such as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo go rather than meeting their demands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]Ball, Phil p. 85.
On 16 May 1979, the club won its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final that was watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. In June 1982 Maradona was signed for a then-world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.Dobson, Stephen; Goddard, John A. p. 180. In the following season, under manager Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barça was short-lived; he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season Terry Venables was hired as manager, and he won La Liga with notable displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season Venables took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua Bucureşti during a dramatic evening in Seville.
After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, English top scorer Gary Lineker was signed along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success as Schuster was excluded from the team. Venables was fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The players rebelled against president Núñez in an event that became known as the Hesperia mutiny, and ended the season with a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.

====Dream Team====

In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called Dream Team. He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, and Txiki Begiristain while signing international stars such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.Ball, Phil. pp. 106–107. Under his guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992, and three Supercopa de España. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager, until being overtaken by Guardiola in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/88/spain/2011/08/18/2625001/pep-guardiola-enters-barcelona-history-books-with-record|title=Pep Guardiola enters Barcelona history books with record 11th title as coach|publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving 8 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/palmares/palmares.html |title=Honours |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=12 March 2010[/tpl] Cruyff's fortune changed in his final two seasons, when he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Núñez, resulting in his departure.
Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. The club signed Ronaldo and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, Cup Winners' Cup, and the Supercopa de España, and finished runner-up in La Liga by two points. Despite his success Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_5.html |title=History part V |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2010[/tpl] Barça won the UEFA Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund and won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its 'centenari', winning the Primera División title. Rivaldo became the fourth Barça player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to extend that success to the Champions League led to Van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.

===Exit Núñez, enter Laporta (2000–2008)===

The departures of Núñez and van Gaal were nothing compared to that of Luís Figo. As well as club vice-captain, Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barça fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, he was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.Ball, Phil. p. 19. President Núñez was replaced by Joan Gaspart in 2000, and the three years he was in charge saw the club decline and managers came and went; van Gaal served a second term. Gaspart did not inspire confidence off the field either and in 2003, he and van Gaal resigned.Ball, Phil. pp. 109–110.

After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the club bounced back with the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch player Frank Rijkaard. On the field, an influx of international players combined with home-grown Spanish players led to the club's return to success. Barça won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and the team's midfielder, Ronaldinho, won the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4486166.stm |title=Ronaldinho wins world award again |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl]

Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies apart from the 2006 Supercopa de España victory against local rivals RCD Espanyol. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=248388/news/newsid=108718.html#internacional+make+japan |title=Internacional make it big in Japan |publisher=FIFA |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl] A pre-season US tour and open feud between the player Samuel Eto'o and Rijkaard was later blamed for the lack of trophies.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6353861.stm |title=Barcelona will not punish Eto'o |publisher=BBC News |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.soccerway.com/news/2007/August/03/barcelona-defends-asian-tour/ |title=Barcelona defends Asian tour |publisher=soccerway.com|agency=AFP |accessdate=11 March 2010[/tpl] In La Liga, Barça were in first place for much of the season, but their inconsistency in the new year caused them to be overtaken by Real Madrid on 12 May 2007; Barça tied Madrid on points but lost the title on head-to-head superiority. In the Champions League, Barça narrowly managed to advance from Group A by winning 2–0 over SV Werder Bremen, but they were eliminated in the round of 16 by 2005 winners Liverpool on away goals.
The 2007–08 season ended without any titles, as Barça finished third in La Liga and were defeated in the Champions League semi-finals 1–0 by eventual winners Manchester United.

===Guardiola era (2008–2012)===

FC Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/destacades/n080508104104.html|title=Rijkaard until 30 June; Guardiola to take over|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process Guardiola sold Ronaldinho  and Deco, and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Iniesta and Messi.
Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season. Barça finished the season by beating the previous year's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=646187&sec=europe&root=europe&&cc=5739|title=One title closer to the treble|date=14 May 2009|publisher=ESPN|first=Eduardo|last=Alvarez|accessdate=30 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8060878.stm|title=Barcelona 2–0 Man Utd|date=27 May 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2009/05/pep-guardiola-barcelona/|title=Pep Guardiola's love affair with Barça continues|date=19 May 2009|publisher=Thesportreview.com|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[tpl]Cite news|title=Messi leads Barcelona to Spanish Supercup win|publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated.

===Last years (2012–)===

It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at FC Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only 2 losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in the League, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013 Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with 4 games left to play. Ultimately Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/champions|title=Champions!|date= 11 May 2013|accessdate=11 May 2013|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl] They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively.

==Club rivalries==

===El Clásico===

There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barça and Real Madrid is known as El Clásico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.Ghemawat, Pankaj. p. 2.
During the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and especially of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.Kleiner-Liebau, Désirée. p. 70.[tpl]Cite news|author=Phil Ball |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/apr/21/championsleague.sport |title=The ancient rivalry of Barcelona and Real Madrid|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media |date= 21 April 2002|accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London[/tpl] Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.Spaaij, Ramón. p. 251.
On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond (Santiago Bernabeu, the former club president for whom the Merengues stadium is named, fought with los nacionales).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1697027,00.html|title=Barcelona vs. Real Madrid: More Than a Game|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=Time|last=Abend|first=Lisa[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=The Guardian|last=Lowe|first=Sid[/tpl] However, during the Spanish Civil War, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.
During the 1950s the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo di Stéfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.Burns, Jimmy. pp. 31–34. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice at the knock-out rounds of the European Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/barcamadrid.html |title=FC Barcelona vs Real Madrid CF since 1902 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=21 August 2010 |author=García, Javier[/tpl]

===El derbi Barceloní===

Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.Shubert, Arthur. p. 199. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1901/04/09/pagina-2/33398307/pdf.html |title=Edición del martes, 09 abril 1901, página 2 – Hemeroteca – Lavanguardia.es |language=Spanish|publisher=Hemeroteca Lavanguardia|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rcdespanyol.cat/principal.php?modulo=estatico&idcontenido=8&idmenu=2&idsubmenu=22&nombremodulo=dates&idlinkchk=21 |title=History of Espanyol|publisher=RCD Espanyol |accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl]
Traditionally, especially during the Franco regime, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iss.europa.eu/index.php?id=18&no_cache=1&L=1&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=41&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=697&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=232&tx_ttnews%5Bpage%5D=1&cHash=2becc765c6|title=European football cultures and their integration: the 'short' Twentieth Century|date=March 2002|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=Europa (web portal)|last=Missiroli|first=Antonio[/tpl] In 1918 Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.Ball, Phil. pp. 86–87. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish civil war, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.
Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951. Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html |title=Matchday 24|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl]

==Crest and shirt==

Since its foundation the club has played with a crest. The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html|title=The crest|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl] In 1910 the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.
The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.Ball, Phil p. 90. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.Ball, Phil pp. 90–91. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. The team's current away kit features the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia.
Prior to the 2011–2012 season, Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement has the club donate €1.5 million per year to UNICEF (0.7 percent of its ordinary income, equal to the UN International Aid Target, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/Fundacio/english/nacions_unides/convenis/unicef/continguts/carta_laporta.html|title=Open letter from Joan Laporta|accessdate=21 February 2010|year=2010|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl] The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company.Desbordes, Michel p. 195. In 2004, a company could become one of 25 "Honorary members" by contributing between £40,000–60,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]inflation|UK|40000|2004|r=-2[/tpl][/tpl]–[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]inflation|UK|60000|2004|r=-2[/tpl][/tpl])[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl] per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]inflation|UK|14000|2004|r=-2[/tpl][/tpl])[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl] and an unlimited number of "patronages" for the cost of £4,000 per year (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]inflation|UK|4000|2004|r=-2[/tpl][/tpl]).[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl] It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is "unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club".King, Anthony pp. 123–24.
Barcelona ended their refusal of corporate sponsorship prior to the commencement of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year €150m deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation"Barcelona agree €150m shirt sponsor deal with Qatar Foundation".

==Stadiums==

Barcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/catala/noticies/club/temporada08-09/03/n090314107593.html|publisher=FC Barcelona|title=Cent anys del camp de la Indústria|accessdate=11 September 2010|date=14 March 2009|author=Santacana, Carles|language=Catalan[/tpl]
In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/intro_historica.html|title=Brief history of Camp Nou |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=30 July 2010[/tpl]
After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of in June 1950 of László Kubala, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.Farred, Grant. p. 124.Eaude, Michael. p. 104. The club began to make plans for a new stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.
In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.Ball, Phil pp. 20–21.Ball, Phil pp. 121–22.Murray, Bill; Murray, William J.. p. 102. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Games two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.Snyder, John. pp. 81–2. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.
There are also other facilities, which include:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/castellano/noticies/club/temporada09-10/07/n090728107768.html|title=El proyecto Barça Parc, adelante|accessdate=28 July 2009|year=2009|language= Spanish|publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl]

==Honours==

As of 28 August 2013, Barcelona has won 22 La Liga, 26 Copa del Rey, 11 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva DuarteThe Copa Eva Duarte was only recognised and organised with that name by the RFEF from 1947 until 1953, and therefore Barcelona's "Copa de Oro Argentina" win of 1945 is not included in this count, i.e. only the 1948, 1952 and 1953 trophies are. and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions.

Barcelona is the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955, and one of three clubs to have never been relegated from La Liga, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first club in Spain to win the treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. That same year, it also became the first football club ever to win six out of six competitions in a single year, thus completing the sextuple, comprising the aforementioned treble and the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.

==Players==

Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.
