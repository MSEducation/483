Gramercy Pictures was a film distributor launched in May 1992, a joint venture of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Universal Pictures. Gramercy, a so-called "mini-major," was the distributor of PolyGram movies in the United States and Canada. In January 1996, PolyGram brought the 50% stake owned by Universal, thus assuming full control of Gramercy.http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/business/gramercy-sold-to-polygram.html When Seagram acquired PolyGram in 1999, it reacquired Gramercy as it controlled Universal. In turn, Seagram sold Gramercy and another specialty division, October Films, to Barry Diller's USA Networks, and merged both companies into USA Films.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aEJFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wLsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6746,3385144&dq=gramercy+pictures+barry+diller&hl=enhttp://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/28/business/fi-14956 USA Films then transformed into Focus Features in 2002.
