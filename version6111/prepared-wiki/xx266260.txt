The Esso Cup is the Canadian national women's midget ice hockey championship, sponsored by Esso. It is an annual event, sanctioned by Hockey Canada, that takes place each April with six teams competing for the national title.  The current champions are the Weyburn Gold Wings of Saskatchewan, who captured the 2014 Esso Cup in Hamilton, Ontario.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/193569/la_id/1/|title=NR.064|publisher=Hockey Canada|date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-05-04[/tpl]

==History==

The forerunner to the Esso Cup was the Esso Women's Hockey Nationals, which was the Canadian senior women's championship from 1982 to 2008.  With the evolution of the Nationals into a professional tournament, Hockey Canada decided to discontinue it in 2008 and replace it with a national female midget championship known as the Esso Cup.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/58687/la_id/1.htm|title=NR.156|publisher=Hockey Canada|date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2012-01-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/Living/People/2010-06-04/article-1298375/Midget-female-hockey-nationals-coming-to-P.E.I./1|title=Midget female hockey nationals coming to P.E.I.|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-20[/tpl] 
The inaugural Esso Cup was played in April 2009 in Calgary, Alberta, with the Westman Wildcats from Souris, Manitoba being the first gold medalists.  The Quebec region did not compete in the first tournament, but has participated in every one since.

==Format==

The Esso Cup's format is similar to the one Hockey Canada has used for the Telus Cup since 1984, with a few minor differences.  Branch champions compete in their respective region's playdowns with the winners of the five regions qualifying for the national championship, along with the host team.
The national tournament begins with a round robin with points being awarded using the IIHF world championship format: three for a win in regulation, two for a win in overtime, and one for a loss in overtime.  After the round robin is complete, the top four teams qualify for the semi-finals, with the winners of those games playing for the championship.
Each year's gold medal game is televised nationally on TSN and RDS, Hockey Canada's official broadcasters.  All games are broadcast online at fasthockey.com
