Victor S Pascall (1886 – 7 July 1930) was a Trinidadian cricketer who represented the West Indies in the days before they achieved Test status. His primary role was as a left-arm spinner, but was regarded as a reasonable batsman. Pascall was related to the Constantine family; he was the maternal uncle of Elias and Learie Constantine and was a possible coaching influence on the latter.Howat, p. 28. At the time he played, critics considered him the best left-arm spinner in the West Indies.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52732.html| title = Victor Pascall (ESPNCricinfo profile)| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 26 September 2011[/tpl]James, p. 54.
Pascall was born in Diego Martin, Trinidad, at some time in 1886. His parents were Yoruba from West Africa who were brought to South America as slaves. According to family legend, Pascall's father, Ali, escaped as a child and sailed to Trinidad. Ali lived to be around 100 years old and maintained some African traditions in the family.Howat, pp. 19–20.
Pascall first played for Trinidad in 1906, making his first-class debut and taking a wicket in the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=23987&opponentmatch=exact&playername=&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason=| title = Player Oracle VS Pascall| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 26 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/23/23987/First-Class_Matches.html| title = First-Class Matches played by Victor Pascall| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 26 September 2011[/tpl] From 1909, he played regularly in the team and appeared in the Inter-Colonial tournament until 1927.

Then in 1923, he was chosen as part of the West Indies team which toured England. Pascall played 19 matches on the tour and took 52 wickets at an average of 24.30.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/23/23987/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-Class Bowling in Each Season by Victor Pascall| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 26 September 2011[/tpl] His best figures were five for 67 against Cambridge University and six for 77 against MCC at Lord's Cricket Ground. His final appearances for West Indies came in 1926. In 22 games for teams styled "West Indies" or "West Indians", Pascall hit 268 runs at an average of 10.31 and took 59 wickets at 25.20. In all first-class cricket, he 859 runs at 13.63, with a top score  of 92 against Barbados in 1922, and took 171 wickets at 20.09, with best figures of six for 26 against British Guiana, also in 1922.
In Trinidad, Pascall represented the Shannon team and was used as the third bowler. The Shannon club was made up of members of the black lower-middle classes,James, p. 50. and contained several international players. The team played in a highly competitive manner and were passionately supported by their spectators and, according to C. L. R. James, socially "represented the great mass of black people in the island."James, pp. 54–55. Shannon players took part in games in a serious manner and were not given to smiling on the field, but Pascall, while a formidable opponent, was more friendly.James, p. 55. The people of Trinidad regarded Pascall with great affection,James, p. 80. and James described him as "a most charming person and a great popular favourite with all classes" on the island.James, p. 103. On one occasion in 1921, Pascall bowled particularly effectively in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, which was held in Trinidad that year, and James wrote some comic verses about how good his bowling was; these were well received by the public.James, p. 89.
Pascall died on 7 July 1930.
