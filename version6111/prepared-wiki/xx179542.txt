[[Cognitive Abilities Test]]

CATEGORIES: Cognitive tests

The Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT, CAT) is a K–12 assessment designed to measure students’ learned reasoning abilities in the three areas most linked to academic success in school: Verbal, Quantitative and Nonverbal. Although its primary goal is to assess students’ acquired reasoning abilities, CogAT can also provide predicted achievement scores when administered with the Iowa Tests. The CogAT is not an IQ test although there is a correlation between innate ability and one's performance.
The author of the test is David F. Lohman, professor emeritus at the University of Iowa.
CogAT is often used to help educators make student placement decisions for Gifted and Talented programs.

==Tests==

Each level of CogAT offers test batteries in the three aforementioned categories. CogAT can be administered in whole or in part; however, the most complete view of a student will be provided through administration of all three batteries.
