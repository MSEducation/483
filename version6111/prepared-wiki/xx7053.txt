==History==

The area was originally called Banks and Braes.
Paul Shoup, an executive of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and his colleagues formed the Altos Land Company in 1906 and started the development of Los Altos.  The company acquired 140 acres of land from Sarah Winchester. Shoup wanted to link Palo Alto and Los Gatos by making Los Altos a commuter town.  It continued a train a day operation to and from San Francisco.
In 1908, Southern Pacific Railroad began running steam train service through Los Altos (April 19, 1908) with five trains per day.  Two freight cars served as train depot. Also, the first commercial building, Eschenbruecher’s Hardware, was built in downtown.
In 1913, the craftsman-style Los Altos train station was built at 288 First Street.
By 1949, many residents were dissatisfied with the zoning policy of Santa Clara county.  Also, there was a constant threat of being annexed by neighboring Palo Alto and Mountain View, so they decided to incorporate.  Los Altos became the eleventh city in Santa Clara county on December 1, 1952.
Train service stopped its operation in January, 1964, and the train track became Foothill Expressway. 
In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, along with others including Ronald Wayne, built the first 50 Apple I's in Jobs's garage in Los Altos. Jobs, Wozniak, and Wayne founded Apple Computer, Inc on 1 April, 1976.

==Parks and conservation==

Adobe Creek flows through Redwood Grove, a [tpl]convert|5.9|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] nature preserve off University Avenue in Los Altos purchased by the city in 1974. In October 2009 Los Altos contracted with Acterra to remove non-native plants and revitalize the redwood, oak woodland, riparian and grassland ecosystems by installing native plants, improving soil conditions, and creating habitat for wildlife such as bird houses and native bee boxes.[tpl]cite news |title=City council signs agreement to restore Redwood Grove |first=Jana |last=Seshadri |date=October 8, 2009 |work=Los Altos Town Crier |url=http://www.losaltosonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19125&Itemid=46 |accessdate=2012-11-14[/tpl] The Coast Redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) were transplanted by the Halsey family from a location on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains and replaced the native willows. The historic Halsey House, built in the late 1920s by Theodore and Emma Halsey, is a good example of Spanish Revival architecture. The city designated Halsey House a local landmark in 1981 and until recently it housed the Florence Fava collection of Coastanoan or Ohlone Indian artifacts from a nearby archeological excavation in Los Altos Hills (now moved to the Los Altos History House).[tpl]cite news |title=Science learning, restoration in works for Redwood Grove |first=Eliza |last=Ridgway |date=June 3, 2009 |work=Los Altos Town Crier |url=http://www.losaltosonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17743&Itemid=46 |accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl] On June 16, 2010 the Los Altos City Council finalized the purchase of [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of creekside property from Delbert and Marlene Beumer, who wanted to provide a safe pathway connecting Shoup Park and Redwood Grove.[tpl]cite news |title=City purchases land to connect Shoup Park, Redwood Grove |first=Nicholas |last=Luther |date=June 22, 2010 |work=Los Altos Town Crier |url=http://www.losaltosonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21584&Itemid=46 |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl]
Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) occurred historically in Adobe Creek. However, tidal gates at the mouth of Adobe Creek as well as culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses probably preclude the passage of migrating salmonids, even though the reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout habitat.[tpl]cite web |title=Historical distribution and current status of steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in streams of the San Francisco Estuary, California. |last=Leidy |first=R.A. |first2=G.S. |last2=Becker |first3=B.N. |last3=Harvey |url=http://www.cemar.org/pdf/santaclara.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Center for Ecosystem Management and Restoration, Oakland, CA. |year=2005 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

===Sports===

[tpl]dead link |date=November 2012[/tpl][/ref]
Players in the El Camino YMCA Youth Basketball League know the score and a lot more thanks to 200 coaches and referees who volunteer their time each season to teach children in kindergarten through eighth grade. The program serves more than 1,200 children. Participants learn basic basketball skills, as well as the YMCA's core values. All children play at least two-quarters per game. "It's a great opportunity for children to learn a sport in a non-competitive setting," said El Camino YMCA Program Director Heidi Lisbona. "Everyone is a star whether they are scoring a basket or just learning how to dribble. We strive to make everyone feel special." Volunteers coach the teams, referee the games, register the players and help schedule the games.

===Media===

The Los Altos Town Crier, a weekly, is the primary newspaper for the town, "serving the Hometown of Silicon Valley since 1947." The San Jose Mercury News is the primary daily newspaper serving the town, delivering a Peninsula Section to Los Altans and locations north in lieu of the Local section delivered to those in San Jose and other communities closer to San Jose.

==Design and planning==

Los Altos strives to maintain a semi-rural atmosphere. Los Altos has few sidewalks except in commercial zones and along arterial roads. Minimum lot size for most residential housing is one-quarter of an acre. Most roads have broad dirt shoulders and little or no street lighting. The civic center sits in the middle of an orchard, a remnant of those that once covered the area. The downtown is a triangle with arterials on all sides that enable most through traffic to bypass Main Street. Many Los Altos homes fetch $2 million and higher, putting the city (along with neighboring Los Altos Hills, with which it shares ZIP codes) at numbers 24 and 28 on Forbes' "Most Expensive ZIP Codes in America" list in 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/7/forbeslife-cx_07zip_Most-Expensive-ZIP-Codes_Rank.html |title=Most Expensive ZIP Codes |work=Forbes |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]
Since the mid-1990s, downtown Los Altos has experienced mild economic difficulties due to competition from nearby shopping centers and chain stores, as well as its lack of a hotel or movie theater. Revitalizing downtown is a major issue in city politics.
Los Altos may have a legitimate claim to having the first scientifically designed sound baffle in the year 1970. Santa Clara County undertook a seminal study to calculate the effects of alternate soundwall designs along Foothill Expressway. The resulting wall brought about the predicted reduction of seven to ten decibels in noise pollution levels experienced by adjacent homes.

==Los Altos History Museum==

Located in one of Santa Clara Valley's few remaining apricot orchards, the Los Altos History Museum explores the rich history of local people and how the use of the land over time has transformed the agricultural paradise once known as the "Valley of Heart's Delight" into the technology hub that is today's Silicon Valley.
Opened in spring of 2001 adjacent to the Los Altos Library, the Los Altos History Museum occupies an [tpl]convert|8200|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] building – built entirely with private donations; ownership went to the town in 2002. The Museum features a changing exhibits gallery as well as the permanent exhibit, "Crown of the Peninsula".
With the mission to "collect, preserve and interpret the history of the Los Altos area," the Museum includes interactive exhibits and hands-on activities to encourage children and adults to learn about the community. Other programs include third and fourth grade tours and curricula for local school children, oral history collections, a traveling Ohlone kit, and much more.
There's more history just across the lushly landscaped courtyard in the landmark J. Gilbert Smith House. Built in 1905 and refurbished, the home nestles under majestic heritage oaks and replicates a 1930s farmhouse. Visitors are welcome to enjoy the gardens and picnic tables even when the House and Museum are closed.
