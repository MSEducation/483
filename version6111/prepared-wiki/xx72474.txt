Papandreou from the Greek Government website via Internet Archive|publisher=pPrime Ministry|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-el|ʝeˈoɾʝios papanˈðreu|[/tpl]; born 16 June 1952), commonly anglicised to George and shortened to [tpl]lang|el|Γιώργος[/tpl] in Greek, is a Greek politician who served as Prime Minister of Greece following his party's victory in the 2009 legislative election. Belonging to a political dynasty of long standing, he previously served as Minister for National Education and Religious Affairs (1988–1989 and 1994–1996) and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2004. Following his grandfather Georgios Papandreou and his father Andreas Papandreou, he was the third member of the Papandreou family to serve as the country's prime minister. Papandreou was leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party from February 2004 until March 2012, and President of the Socialist International since January 2006. George Papandreou became the 182nd Prime Minister of Greece on 6 October 2009. He resigned on 11 November 2011 to make way for a national unity government charged with tackling the Greek government debt crisis.
==Early life and education==	
He was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, where his father, Andreas Papandreou, held a university post. His mother is American-born Margaret Papandreou, née Chant. He was educated at schools in Toronto (King City Secondary School), at Amherst College in Massachusetts (where he was a friend and dormitory roommate of fellow Greek Antonis Samaras[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_04/12/2009_113043|title=As good as it gets|date=4 December 2009|publisher=ekathimerini|accessdate=8 December 2009[/tpl]), at Stockholm University, the London School of Economics and Harvard University. He has a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from Amherst and a Μaster's degree in sociology from the LSE. He was a researcher on immigration issues at Stockholm University in 1972–73. He was also a Fellow of the Foreign Relations Center of Harvard University in 1992–93.
In 2002 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Amherst College and in 2006 he was named Distinguished Professor in the Center for Hellenic Studies by Georgia State College of Arts and Science.
Papandreou's father studied and worked as professor of economics from 1939 to 1959. His paternal grandfather, Georgios Papandreou, was three times Prime Minister of Greece.

==Political career==

The younger George Papandreou came to Greece after the restoration of Greek democracy in 1974. He then became active in the political party his father had founded, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He joined the Central Committee of PASOK in 1984.
Papandreou was elected to the Greek Parliament in 1981, the year his father became Prime Minister, as MP for the constituency of Achaea. He became Under Secretary for Cultural Affairs in 1985, Minister of Education and Religious Affairs in 1988, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1993, Minister for Education and Religious Affairs again in 1994, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs again in 1996 and Minister of Foreign Affairs in February 1999. He was also Minister Responsible for Government Coordination for the Bid for 2004 Olympic Games in 1997.
In his second term as Minister of Education, Papandreou was the first politician in Greece to introduce affirmative action, allocating 5% of university posts for the Muslim minority in Thrace. He was also instrumental in initiating the Open University in Greece.
Papandreou received numerous awards and honorary degrees in recognition of his work for human rights. As Foreign Minister he  fostered closer relations with Turkey and Albania. He worked to solve the dispute over Cyprus. Papandreou also worked to resolve tensions regarding the Macedonia naming dispute.
In December 2003 European Voice shortlisted him for nomination of the Europeans of the Year award as "Diplomat of the Year",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/ev50-europeans-of-the-year-2003/48225.aspx|title=EV50: Europeans of the Year 2003|newspaper=European Voice|accessdate=3 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/page/the-evawards-europeans-of-the-year-winners-in-2003/2764.aspx |title=EV award winners: Europeans of the Year 2003|newspaper=EuropeanVoice|accessdate=3 December 2011[/tpl] naming him as "The Bridge-Builder" and quoting Le Monde that dubbed him the "architect of Greek-Turkish rapprochement".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.papandreou.gr/papandreou/content/Document.aspx?d=6&rd=7739474&f=1354&rf=1290836267&m=3822&rm=22164866&l=1|title=George A. Papandreou Personal Site|publisher=Papandreou|accessdate=4 November 2011[/tpl] He is a founding member of the Helsinki Citizens Assembly.

==Party leadership==

In anticipation of the 2004 national elections in Greece, polls indicated that PASOK was very likely to lose as the conservative New Democracy party was heading towards a landslide. In January 2004, the incumbent PM Costas Simitis announced his resignation as leader of PASOK, and passed the leadership to Papandreou by recommending him as the new leader.
On 8 February 2004 PASOK introduced for the first time the procedure of open primaries for the election of party leadership. Even if Papandreou had no opponent, this was a move designed to solidify the open primaries, democratise the party, and make a clean break with a tradition of “dynastic politics.”
In May 2005, Papandreou was elected Vice President of the Socialist International following a proposal by the former President, António Guterres. In January 2006, Papandreou was unanimously elected President of the Socialist International.
In the 2007 general election, PASOK again lost to the incumbent New Democracy party of Kostas Karamanlis and Papandreou’s leadership was challenged by Evangelos Venizelos and Kostas Skandalidis. Papandreou, however, retained his party's leadership at a leadership election in November.
In June 2009 and under his leadership, his party won the 2009 European Parliament election in Greece.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/e2009/pages/index.html?lang=en|title=European election results 2009 for Greece|work=Results of the 2009 European Elections|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|accessdate=6 October 2009[/tpl] Four months later, PASOK won the October 2009 general elections with 43.92% of the popular vote to ND's 33.48%, and 160 parliament seats to 91.[tpl]cite web|title=Greek legislative election, 2009 results| url=http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html?lang=en| work=Results of the 2009 Greek legislative elections|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|accessdate=6 October 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
