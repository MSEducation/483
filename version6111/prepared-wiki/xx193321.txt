==Background==

Founded in 1926, the Columbia Graphophone Company studios were one of the oldest established in the world. In 1954 they relocated and were given a new name, EMI Studios. In 1978 they were renamed again as Studios 301 and completely re-equipped. Now privately owned, 301 have one of the largest recording rooms and mastering facilities in the Southern hemisphere. In 1996 Studios 301 was purchased by the management team at the time, then was sold again in 1998 when producer/engineer Tom Misner took ownership and underwent a multi million dollar relocation & re-build. Up to early 2011, Studios 301 were part of the SAE Technology College group, until SAE were sold and Tom Misner retained ownership of Studios 301.Smart Company
