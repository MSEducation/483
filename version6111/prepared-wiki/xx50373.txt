[[Currawong]]

CATEGORIES: Strepera, Bird genera, Birds of Australia, Cracticidae, Australian Aboriginal words and phrases

Currawongs are three species of medium-sized passerine birds belonging to the genus Strepera in the family Cracticidae native to Australasia. These are the  Grey Currawong (Strepera versicolor), Pied Currawong (S. graculina), and Black Currawong (S. fuliginosa). The common name comes from the call of the familiar Pied Currawong of eastern Australia and is onomatopoeic. They were formerly known as Crow-shrikes or Bell-magpies. Despite their resemblance to crows and ravens, they are only distantly related to the corvidae, instead belonging to an Afro-Asian radiation of birds of superfamily Malaconotoidea.
The true currawongs are a little larger than the Australian Magpie, somewhat smaller than most ravens, but broadly similar in appearance. They are easily distinguished by their yellow eyes, in contrast to the red eyes of a magpie and white eyes of Australian crows and ravens. Currawongs are also characterised by the hooked tips of their long, sharply pointed beaks.Amazing Facts about Australian Birds, by Karin Cox and Steve Parish, Steve Parish Publishing, 2008.
They are not as terrestrial as the Magpie and have shorter legs. They are omnivorous, foraging in foliage, on tree trunks and limbs, and on the ground, taking insects and larvae (often dug out from under the bark of trees), fruit, and the nestlings of other birds. They are distinguishable from magpies and crows by their comical flight style in amongst foliage, appearing to almost fall about from branch to branch as if they were inept flyers.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe held that currawongs were more closely related to crows and ravens than the Australian Magpie and butcherbirds, and duly placed them in the Corvidae.[tpl]cite book|last=Sharpe|first=Richard Bowdler|title=Catalogue of the Passeriformes, or Perching Birds, in the Collection of the British Museum.

The family Cracticidae has its greatest diversity in Australia, which suggests that the radiation of its insectivorous and scavenger members to occupy various niches took place there. The butcherbirds became predators of small animals, much like the northern hemisphere shrikes, while the Australian Magpie became a predominantly ground-hunting omnivore, with the currawongs generally hunting in both living and fallen trees, scavenging and hunting insects and small vertebrates, and occupying in Australia the niche of many Eurasian corvids.[tpl]cite book|author=Schodde, Richard; Mason,  Ian J.|year= 1999|title=The Directory of Australian Birds: Passerines.

Currawongs and indeed all members of the broader Artamidae are part of a larger group of African shrike-like birds including bushshrikes (Malaconotidae), helmetshrikes (Prionopidae), ioras (Aegithinidae), and  vangas (Vangidae), which were defined as the superfamily Malaconotoidea by Cacraft and colleagues in 2004.[tpl]cite book |author=Cracraft, Joel; Barker F.

===Species and races===

Although there are several distinct forms, the number of species has varied between two and seven, with three currently recognised. Several subspecies of the Grey Currawong are fairly distinctive and described on that species page.

===Etymology===

The term currawong itself is derived from the call of the Pied Currawong.[tpl]cite book |title= Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds.

==Description==

The three currawong species are sombre-plumaged dark grey or black birds with large bills. They resemble crows and ravens, although are slimmer in build with longer tails, booted tarsi and white pages on their wings and tails.[tpl]cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated|author=Wade Peter (ed.) |year=1977 |page=292|publisher=Rigby|location=Adelaide, South Australia|isbn=0-7270-0009-8[/tpl] Their flight is undulating. Male birds have longer bills than females, the reason for which is unknown but suggests differentiation in feeding technique.

==Distribution and habitat==

Currawongs are protected in Australia under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.

==Behaviour==

Currawongs are dominant birds that can drive off other species, especially when settling around an area used or inhabited by people. They have been known to migrate to towns and cities during the winter.[tpl]cite book |title=A Field Guide to Australian Birds:Non-passerines |last=Slater |first=Peter|year=1974 |publisher=Rigby |location=Adelaide, South Australia |isbn=0-85179-813-6|page=277[/tpl] Birds congregate in loose flocks.
The female builds the nest and incubates the young alone, although both parents feed them. The nests are somewhat flimsy for birds their size.
