Since You Went Away is a 1944 American film directed by John Cromwell for Selznick International Pictures and distributed by United Artists. It is an epic about the American home front during World War II which was adapted and produced by David O. Selznick from the 1943 novel Since You Went Away: Letters to a Soldier from His Wife by Margaret Buell Wilder.[tpl]OCLC|1397161[/tpl] The music score was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Stanley Cortez, Lee Garmes, George Barnes (uncredited) and Robert Bruce (uncredited).
The movie is set in a mid-sized American town, where people with loved ones in the military try to cope with their changed circumstances and make their own contributions to the war effort. The main characters are a housewife whose husband is away in the service and her two daughters who are just growing into womanhood. The story runs from early January to late December 1943; the film itself was made in late 1943 and early 1944.[tpl]cn|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Though sentimental, Since You Went Away is more somber and realistic about the carnage of war and the pain of separation than some[tpl]specify|date=December 2011[/tpl] other homefront movies made during World War II.

==Reception==

According to Bosley Crowther, Since You Went Away, Selznick's first screen production in four years, features a script with an "excess of exhausting emotional detail"; Crowther was impressed with the performances but had issues with the film as a whole:Since You Went Away, a Film of Wartime Domestic Life, With Claudette Colbert and Others, Opens at the Capitol, a July 21, 1944 review from The New York Times
 As the mother and center of the family, Claudette Colbert gives an excellent show of gallantly self-contained emotion, and Jennifer Jones is surpassingly sweet as a well-bred American daughter in the first bloom of womanhood and love. Robert Walker is uncommonly appealing as the young soldier whom she tragically adores, and Shirley Temple, now grown to 'teen-age freshness, is pert as the young sister. Monty Woolley makes a full-blown character of the man who comes to lodge; Joseph Cotten is droll as the Navy playboy, and Hattie McDaniel does an Andy-act quite well....No doubt, this would have been a sharper picture if Mr. Selznick had played it in much less time, and it would have been considerably more significant had he kept it somewhat closer to average means. Two hours and fifty-one minutes is a lot of time to harp upon one well-known themeâ€”lonesomeness and anxiety. And that is all this picture really does. 
Since You Went Away won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Max Steiner) (Original lyrics by Maud M. Clark ;National Copy write Archieves) and was nominated for Best Picture,  Best Actress in a Leading Role (Claudette Colbert), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Jennifer Jones), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Monty Woolley), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Lee Garmes), Best Film Editing (Hal C.

==Cultural influence==

The farewell scene between Jones and Walker at the railway station is often cited as an example of a Hollywood tearjerker scene. It was parodied in the 1981 film Airplane!. Jones and Walker played young sweethearts in Since You Went Away, but in real life they were married at the time and going through a bitter breakup. They divorced not long after the movie was completed,[tpl]cn|date=December 2011[/tpl] and Jones later married the film's producer, David O. Selznick.
