[[Sheddase]]

CATEGORIES: EC 3.4, Membrane proteins

Sheddases are membrane-bound enzymes that cleave extracellular portions of transmembrane proteins, releasing the soluble ectodomains from the cell surface. Many sheddases are members of the ADAM or aspartic protease (BACE) protein families.[tpl]cite web | author = R&D Systems | title = Need help at the cell surface?

These enzymes can activate a transmembrane protein if it is a receptor (e.g., HER2), or cut off the part of the transmembrane protein which has already bound an agonist (e.g., in the case of EGFR), allowing this agonist to go and stimulate a receptor on another cell. Hence, sheddases demultiply[tpl]what|...does this word mean?|date=September 2012[/tpl] the yield of agonists. Sheddase inhibitors active on ADAM10 and ADAM17 can potentiate anti-cancer therapy.Healthvalue: Sheddases and ADAMs
