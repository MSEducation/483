Saint Alypius the Stylite (Αλύπιος ο Στυλίτης) was a seventh-century ascetic saint.  He is revered as a monastic founder, an intercessor for the infertile, and a protector of children.  During his lifetime he was a much sought-after starets (guide in the Christian spiritual life).  
Alypius was born in the city of Hadrianopolis in Paphlagonia. His mother, who had been widowed early, was very pious. She sent her son to be educated by the bishop Theodore, gave all of her livelihood to the poor, and herself became a deaconess and lived an ascetic life. Alypius built a church in honour of the Great Martyr Saint Euphemia the All-Praised on the site of a dilapidated pagan temple. He erected a pillar beside the church and lived atop it for the majority of his adult life.  Two monasteries were built beside his pillar, one for monks and one for nuns, and Saint Alypius served as spiritual director of both.  According to his hagiography for the last fourteen years of his life he was unable to stand, and had to lie on his side. He died in 640, at the age of 118. He is recognised as one of the three great stylite ascetics along with Simeon Stylites the Elder and Daniel the Stylite.
