==Team history==

The Brazil National Baseball team is controlled by the Confederação Brasileira de Beisebol e Softbol. The team represents the nation of Brazil in senior-level men's international competition and is a member of the COPABE or Pan American Baseball Confederation. Though not a major competitor  in the world scene, Brazil has steadily been improving and managed to provide a scare for both the Cuba national baseball team and the United States national baseball team in the first decade of the 21st Century. The Brazilian team is composed in large part of Japanese-Brazilian players with Portuguese first names and Japanese last names, resulting in some unique combinations. Jo Matumoto, a Brazilian team pitcher, got a chance at Organized Baseball in 2007 where he flourished in the Toronto Blue Jays AA system. http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=tor

After a deep triple and a two run game-winning home run, the Brazilian team are crushed and stunned at their 4-3 loss. In their next game the team suffered a lopsided defeat to the United States 14-3, a game in which they were forced to use 5 different pitchers. .

Brazil had a 3-run lead going into the seventh inning of the contest. Next up for Brazil were the South Africa national baseball team. Behind a strong pitching performance and sturdy defensive play, the Brazilian team one-hit South Africa and improved to 1-1. The success did not last however, as the team faced a powerful team Cuba in their next game. The final score was 11-1 in Cuba's favor and Brazil was left sitting 1-1. The woes continued to pile up for Brazil as they lost the following three games 7-0 to the Netherlands, 4-0 to South Korea and 8-5 over Panama. In the latter game of the skid Brazil actually found itself in the lead with just four innings to play. However the bats for the Panama national baseball team came alive and they rallied for the victory. Brazil finally was able to find its stroke against an unsuspecting Sweden team and took and 11-4 victory while scoring all of their runs in each of the first three innings. The victory gave Brazil a record of 2-4 in the games and a hope to finish with a win and boost their winning percentage.

===2007===

In 2007 Brazil competed in its very first Pan American Games for baseball. The team opened up pool play with an impressive 1-0 win over Nicaragua. Pitchers Claudio Yamada and Kleber Ojima combined for the four hit shutout while the lone run was scored on a home run by Tiago Magalhaes. Brazil had put themselves in the drivers seat with a huge game 1 win, but took a step back with a 14-2 spanking handed to them by the Dominican Republic national baseball team. This loss put the teams record at 1-1 and meant that the next and final game of pool play was make it or break it for Brazil. In the matchup between Brazil and a powerful United States team, Things were extremely close for the majority of the game. Brazil took an early one-run lead in the first inning but saw it quickly taken away in the second as the U.S. pulled even. The game would stay deadlocked until the fifth when the U.S. would gain a one run advantage, and later in the seventh would tack on what proved to be a decisive five runs. Despite late efforts by Brazil, who came up with two runs in the eighth and one in the ninth, the American team shut the door for the win and finished pool play undefeated on the 7-5 victory. This loss dropped Brazil to 1-2, a record which proved not good enough to make advance to the medal rounds. The United States would end up making it all the way to the championship where they were beaten by Cuba 3-1. http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2007_Pan-American_Games
