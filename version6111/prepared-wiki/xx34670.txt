Some bands that formed in the United States during the late 1990s and remained active throughout the 2000s, such as Thursday, Thrice, and Poison the Well made screamo much more popular. Many of these bands took influence from the likes of post-hardcore bands like Refused and At the Drive-In. By the mid-2000s, the over-saturation of the screamo scene caused many bands to purposefully expand past the genre's trademarks and incorporate more experimental elements. Even bands that weren't necessarily screamo would often use the style's characteristic guttural vocal style. Derek Miller, guitarist for the post-hardcore band Poison the Well, claimed that the term screamo "describes a thousand different genres."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jimdero.com/OtherWritings/OtherScreamoGW.htm |title=Screamo |publisher=Jimdero.com |accessdate=2011-07-30[/tpl]
According to Jeff Mitchell of Iowa State Daily, "there is no set definition of what screamo sounds like but screaming over once deafeningly loud rocking noise and suddenly quiet, melodic guitar lines is a theme commonly affiliated with the genre."[tpl]cite web| last = Mitchell| first = Jeff| title = A Screamin' Scene| work = Iowa State Daily| date = July 26, 2001| url = http://www.iowastatedaily.com/article_7c9f7210-850e-5905-af02-9bcdb2b07f3e.html| accessdate = September 11, 2010[/tpl] Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre, alleged that the term "has been kind of tainted in a way, especially in the States."[tpl]cite web|author=info@yellowisthenewpink.com |url=http://yellowisthenewpink.com/articles_detail.php?idno=21 |title=Jan, "Yellow is the new pink", 18-04-07 |publisher=Yellowisthenewpink.com |accessdate=2011-07-30[/tpl]

Emoviolence is a style of screamo and powerviolence.

Other screamo acts have often incorporated post-rock into their music. This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace, atmospheric, harmonic instrumentation, and low-volume vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pinnaclemagazine.tv/?p=155|title=Single State of Man – s/t LP|author=Benjamin|publisher=Pinnacle Magazine|accessdate=September 1, 2011|date=January 10, 2009[/tpl] Pianos Become the Teeth,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/reviews/article/pianos-become-the-teeth-old-pride|title=Pianos Become The Teeth - Old Pride Reviews Rock blood on the dance floor is an example of screamo sound|author=Andrew Kelham|publisher=Rock Sound|date= January 21, 2010|accessdate= September 1, 2011[/tpl] City of Caterpillar, Envy, Funeral Diner, and Le Pre Ou Je Suis Mort[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=155110&|title=Interpunk.com - The Ultimate Punk Music Store!

==Fashion==

Today emo is commonly tied to both music and fashion as well as the emo subculture.[tpl]cite video | url = http://www.3news.co.nz/TVShows/Nightline/Archive/tabid/227/articleID/10701/cat/17/Default.aspx#video | title = Emo Culture - Why The Long Fringe? | work = Nightline | publisher = 3news | time = 1:17–1:22 | date = 2006-07-05 [/tpl] Usually among teens, the term "emo" is stereotyped with wearing jeans, sometimes in bright colors and may often be close-fitting, and t-shirts (usually short-sleeved) which often bear the names of emo bands. Studded belts and black wristbands can be associated in emo fashion. Some males can also be often wearing thick, black horn-rimmed glasses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Jan/08/il/il01a.html |title=Geek chic look is clean cut |publisher=The.honoluluadvertiser.com |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2011-07-30[/tpl]Emo Clothing - Emo-FeverFashion: How to Go Emo - Kidz World
The emo fashion is also recognized for its hairstyles. Popular looks include thin, flat and smooth hair with lots of hair on the sides and back of the head with long side-swept bangs, sometimes covering one or both eyes. Also, another thing that was popular is hair that is straightened or dyed black. Bright colors, such as blue, pink, red, or bleached blond, are also typical as highlights in emo hairstyles. Short, choppy layers of hair are also common.Emo Hair - Emo-Fever This fashion has at times been characterized as a fad.[tpl]cite web | last=Poretta | first=JP | date=2007-03-03 | title=Cheer up Emo Kid, It's a Brand New Day | work=The Fairfield Mirror | url=http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2007/03/08/Entertainment/Cheer.Up.Emo.Kid.Its.A.Brand.New.Day-2762635.shtml | accessdate=2007-03-08[/tpl] However, in the early 2000s, emo fashion was associated with a clean cut look instead, but changed as it spread to teens.

====Suicide and self harm====

Emo music has been blamed for the suicide by hanging of teenager Hannah Bond by both the coroner at the inquest into her death and her mother, Heather Bond, after it was claimed that emo music glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with My Chemical Romance was said to be linked to her suicide. The inquest heard that she was part of an Internet "emo cult"  and her Bebo page contained an image of an "emo girl" with bloody wrists. It also heard that she had discussed the "glamour" of hanging online and had explained to her parents that her self-harming was an "emo initiation ceremony".[ref]
