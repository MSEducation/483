Oxford has a diverse economic base.  Its industries include motor manufacturing, education, publishing, and a large number of information technology and science-based businesses.
The city is known worldwide as a university town, home to both the University of Oxford (the oldest university in the English-speaking world) and Oxford Brookes University.[tpl]harvnb|Sager|2005|p=36[/tpl].
Buildings in Oxford demonstrate examples of every English architectural period since the arrival of the Saxons, including the iconic, mid-18th-century Radcliffe Camera. Oxford is known as the "city of dreaming spires", a term coined by poet Matthew Arnold in his poem Thyrsis.

==History==

===Medieval===

Oxford was first settled in Saxon times and was initially known as "Oxenaforda", meaning "Ford of the Oxen"; fords were more common than bridges at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Great_Britain/England/Oxfordshire/Oxford/_Texts/FLEOXF/2*.html#hijinks |title=A Handy Guide to Oxford, ch. 2 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl] It began with the establishment of a river crossing for oxen around AD 900. In the 10th century, Oxford became an important military frontier town between the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex and was on several occasions raided by Danes.
Oxford was heavily damaged during the Norman Invasion of 1066. Following the conquest, the town was assigned to a governor, Robert D'Oyly, who ordered the construction of Oxford Castle to confirm Norman authority over the area. The castle has never been used for military purposes[tpl]dubious|date=November 2012[/tpl] and its remains survive to this day. D'Oyly set up a monastic community in the castle consisting of a chapel and living quarters for monks (St George in the Castle). The community never grew large but it earned its place in history as one of the oldest places of formal education in Oxford. It was there that in 1139 Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his History of the Kings of Britain, a compilation of Arthurian legends.Chris Andrews, David Huelin; Oxford. Introduction & Guide; Oxford 1986
In 1191, a city charter stated in Latin,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/oxford_charter_1191#incoming-2650 |title=Oxford charter 1191 |publisher=whatdotheyknow.com |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl]

Oxford's prestige was enhanced by its charter granted by King Henry II, granting its citizens the same privileges and exemptions as those enjoyed by the capital of the kingdom; and various important religious houses were founded in or near the city. A grandson of King John established Rewley Abbey for the Cistercian Order; and friars of various orders (Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustinians, and Trinitarians) all had houses of varying importance at Oxford. Parliaments were often held in the city during the 13th century. The Provisions of Oxford were instigated by a group of barons led by Simon de Montfort; these documents are often regarded as England's first written constitution.

====University of Oxford====

The University of Oxford is first mentioned in 12th-century records. As the University took shape, tension between the hundreds of students living where and how they pleased led to a decree that all undergraduates would have to reside in approved halls.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Of the hundreds of Aularian houses that sprang up across the city, only St Edmund Hall (c. 1225) remains. What put an end to the halls was the emergence of colleges. Oxford's earliest colleges were University College (1249), Balliol (1263) and Merton (1264). These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology. The relationship between "town and gown" has often been uneasy – as many as 93 students and townspeople were killed in the St Scholastica Day Riot of 1355.
The sweating sickness epidemic in 1517 was particularly devastating to Oxford and Cambridge where it killed half of both cities' populations, including many students and dons.The Sweating Sickness[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]. Story of London.
Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford is unique in combining a college chapel and a cathedral in one foundation. Originally the Priory Church of St Frideswide, the building was extended and incorporated into the structure of the Cardinal's College shortly before its refounding as Christ Church in 1546, since when it has functioned as the cathedral of the Diocese of Oxford.
The Oxford Martyrs were tried for heresy in 1555 and subsequently burnt at the stake, on what is now Broad Street, for their religious beliefs and teachings. The three martyrs were the bishops Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley, and the Archbishop Thomas Cranmer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The Martyrs' Memorial stands nearby, round the corner to the North on St. Giles.

===Early Modern===

====English Civil War====

During the English Civil War, Oxford housed the court of Charles I in 1642, after the king was expelled from London, although there was strong support in the town for the Parliamentarian cause. The town yielded to Parliamentarian forces under General Fairfax in the Siege of Oxford of 1646. It later housed the court of Charles II during the Great Plague of London in 1665–66. Although reluctant to do so, he was forced to evacuate when the plague got too close. The city suffered two serious fires in 1644 and 1671.[tpl]cite book | last=Cockayne | first=Emily | title=Hubbub: Filth Noise & Stench in England | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-300-13756-9 | pages=134–136 [/tpl]

===Late Modern===

In 1790, the Oxford Canal connected the city with Coventry. The Duke's Cut was completed by the Duke of Marlborough in 1789 to link the new canal with the River Thames; and, in 1796, the Oxford Canal company built its own link to the Thames, at Isis Lock. In 1844, the Great Western Railway linked Oxford with London via Didcot and Reading,[tpl]sfn|Simpson|1997|p=59[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2001|p=9[/tpl] and other rail routes soon followed.
In the 19th century, the controversy surrounding the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church drew attention to the city as a focus of theological thought.
Oxford Town Hall was built by Henry T. Hare; the foundation stone was laid on 6 July 1893 and opened by the future King Edward VII on 12 May 1897. The site has been the seat of local government since the Guild Hall of 1292 and though Oxford is a city and a Lord Mayoralty, the building is still called by its traditional name of "Town Hall".

===20th and 21st centuries===

By the early 20th century, Oxford was experiencing rapid industrial and population growth, with the printing and publishing industries becoming well established by the 1920s. Also during that decade, the economy and society of Oxford underwent a huge transformation as William Morris established Morris Motors Limited to mass-produce cars in Cowley, on the south-eastern edge of the city. By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and Pressed Steel Fisher plants. By this time, Oxford was a city of two halves: the university city to the west of Magdalen Bridge and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that "Oxford is the left bank of Cowley". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of British Leyland, but is now producing the successful Mini for BMW on a smaller site. A large area of the original car manufacturing facility at Cowley was demolished in the 1990s and is now the site of the Oxford Business Park.Oxford Business Group
During World War II, Oxford was largely ignored by the German air raids during the Blitz, perhaps due to the lack of heavy industry such as steelworks or shipbuilding that would have made it a target, although it was still affected by the rationing and influx of refugees fleeing London and other cities.Exhibition remembers refugees who fled to Oxford before and during World War II It has been claimed that Adolf Hitler ordered that Oxford not be bombed, as he was impressed by the city's architecture and had plans for it to be his capital should Germany win World War II.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordcityguide.com/ee2/index.php?/FunStuff/FunFacts/ |title=Fun Facts |publisher=oxfordcityguide.com |accessdate=21 March 2013[/tpl] The University's colleges served as temporary military barracks and training areas for soldiers before deployment.College life in wartime
The influx of migrant labour to the car plants and hospitals, recent immigration from south Asia, and a large student population, have given Oxford a notably cosmopolitan character, especially in the Headington and Cowley Road areas with their many bars, cafes, restaurants, clubs, ethnic shops and fast food outlets, and the annual Cowley Road Carnival. Oxford is one of the most diverse small cities in Britain with the most recent population estimates for 2005.[tpl]cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/instanceSelection.do?JSAllowed=true&Function=&24ph=60_61&CurrentPageId=61&step=2&datasetFamilyId=1809&instanceSelection=121810&Next.x=4&Next.y=4 |title=ONS Population Estimates 2005 |publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl] showing that 27% of the population were from ethnic minority groups, including 16.2% from non-white ethnic minority ethnic groups (ONS). These figures do not take into account more recent international migration into the city, with over 10,000 people from overseas registering for National Insurance Numbers in Oxford in 2005/06 and 2006/07.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/niall/nino_allocation.asp |title=Department for Work and Pensions |publisher=Dwp.gov.uk |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
On 6 May 1954, Roger Bannister, a 25-year-old medical student, ran the first authenticated four-minute mile at the Iffley Road running track in Oxford.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Although he had previously studied at Oxford University, Bannister was studying at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London at the time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Oxford's second university, Oxford Brookes University, formerly the Oxford School of Art, then Oxford Polytechnic, based at Headington Hill, was given its charter in 1991 and for the last ten years has been voted the best new university in the UK.Oxford Brookes University, 'Awards and Rankings'. Retrieved 19 August 2013. It was named to honour the school's founding principal, John Henry Brookes.

==Geography==

===Location===

Oxford's latitude and longitude are [tpl]Coord|51|45|07|N|1|15|28|W|type:city_region:GB|display=inline,title[/tpl] or [tpl]gbmapping|SP513061[/tpl] (at Carfax Tower, which is usually considered the centre).
Oxford is [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] north-west of Reading, [tpl]convert|26|mi|km[/tpl] north-east of Swindon, [tpl]convert|36|mi|km[/tpl] east of Cheltenham and [tpl]convert|43|mi|km[/tpl] east of Gloucester,  [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] south-west of Milton Keynes, [tpl]convert|38|mi|km[/tpl] south-east of Evesham, [tpl]convert|43|mi|km[/tpl] south of Rugby and [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] north-west of London. The rivers Cherwell and Thames (also sometimes known as the Isis locally from the Latinised name Thamesis) run through Oxford and meet south of the city centre.

===Climate===

Oxford has a maritime temperate climate ("Cfb" by the Köppen system). Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year and is provided mostly by weather systems that arrive from the Atlantic. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oxford was [tpl]convert|-16.6|°C|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in January 1982. The highest temperature ever recorded in Oxford is [tpl]convert|35.6|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in August 2003 during the 2003 European heat wave.
The average conditions below are from the Radcliffe Meteorological Station. It boasts the longest series of temperature and rainfall records for one site in Britain. These records are continuous from January, 1815. Irregular observations of rainfall, cloud and temperature exist from 1767.

===Suburbs===

Aside from the City Centre, there are several suburbs and neighborhoods within the borders of city of Oxford, including:

==Economy==

Oxford has a diverse economy, which includes manufacturing, publishing and science-based industries as well as education, research and tourism.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Oxford City Council|title=Economic Profile of Oxford|url=http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decB/Economic_Profile_of_Oxford_occw.htm|accessdate=2011-12-09[/tpl]

===Carmaking===

Oxford has been an important centre of motor manufacturing since Morris Motors was established in the city in 1910.  The principal production site for Mini cars, now owned by BMW, is in the Oxford suburb of Cowley.

===Publishing===

Oxford University Press, a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house.  The city is also home to the UK operations of Wiley-Blackwell, and several smaller publishing houses.

===Science and technology===

The presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including Oxford Instruments, Research Machines and Sophos.  The university established Isis Innovation in 1987 to promote technology transfer.  The Oxford Science Park was established in 1990, and the Begbroke Science Park, owned by the university, lies north of the city.

===Brewing===

There is a long history of brewing in Oxford. Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at Brasenose, survived until 1889. In the 16th century brewing and malting appear to have been the most popular trades in the city. There were breweries in Brewer Street and Paradise Street, near the Castle Mill Stream.
The rapid expansion of Oxford and the development of its railway links after the 1840s facilitated expansion of the brewing trade.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Woolley |first1=Liz |year=2010 |title=Industrial Architecture in Oxford, 1870 to 1914 |journal=Oxoniensia |volume=LXXV |page=78 |publisher=Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society |issn=0308-5562[/tpl] As well as expanding the market for Oxford's brewers, railways enabled brewers further from the city to compete for a share of its market. By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers' agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere. The nine breweries were: Flowers & Co in Cowley Road, Hall's St Giles Brewery, Hall's Swan Brewery (see below), Hanley's City Brewery in Queen Street, Le Mills's Brewery in St. Ebbes, Morrell's Lion Brewery in St Thomas Street (see below), Simonds's Brewery in Queen Street, Weaving's Eagle Brewery (by 1869 the Eagle Steam Brewery) in Park End Street and Wootten and Cole's St. Clement's Brewery.
The Swan's Nest Brewery, later the Swan Brewery, was established by the early 18th century in Paradise Street, and in 1795 was acquired by William Hall.[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=W.H. |editor-link=William Henry Page |series=Victoria County History |title=A History of the County of Oxford, Volume 2: Industries: Malting and Brewing |year=1907 |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co |pages=225–277|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12[/tpl]  The brewery became known as Hall's Oxford Brewery, which acquired other local breweries. Hall's Brewery was acquired by Samuel Allsopp & Sons in 1926, after which it ceased brewing in Oxford.[tpl]cite book|last=Richmond|first=Lesley|last2=Turton|first2=Alison|year=1990|title=The Brewing industry: a guide to historical records|isbn=978-0-7190-3032-1|page=165|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NB8NAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq[/tpl]

==Landmarks==

Oxford has numerous major tourist attractions, many belonging to the university and colleges. As well as several famous institutions, the town centre is home to Carfax Tower and the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, both of which offer views over the spires of the city. Many tourists shop at the historic Covered Market. In the summer punting on the Thames/Isis and the Cherwell is popular.

===The University of Oxford===

The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English speaking worldA brief history of the University - University of Oxford and one of the most famous and prestigious higher education institutions of the world, averaging five applications to every available place, and attracting 40% of its academic staff and 15% of undergraduates from overseas.Facts and Figures - University of Oxford It is currently ranked as fifth-best university in the world, according to QS World Rankings,QS World University Rankings - Topuniversities behind its main UK rival, Cambridge, in first place.
Oxford is renowned for its tutorial-based method of teaching, with students attending an average of one one-hour tutorial a week.

===The city centre===

As well as being a major draw for tourists (9.1 million in 2008, similar in 2009),[tpl]cite web | last=Hearn |first=Dan | title=Oxford tourism suffers triple whammy | publisher=Oxford Mail | date=19 August 2009 | url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/4555044.Oxford_tourism_suffers_triple_whammy/ |accessdate=1 March 2010 [/tpl] Oxford city centre has many shops, several theatres, and an ice rink. The historic buildings make this location a popular target for film and TV crews.
The city centre is relatively small, and is centred on Carfax, a cross-roads which forms the junction of Cornmarket Street (pedestrianised), Queen Street (semi-pedestrianised), St Aldate's and The High. Cornmarket Street and Queen Street are home to Oxford's various chain stores, as well as a small number of independent retailers, one of the longest established of which is Boswells, which was founded in 1738.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boswells-online.co.uk//mall/infopageviewer.cfm/Boswells/AboutUs |title=About Boswells |publisher=Boswells-online.co.uk |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] St Aldate's has few shops but has several local government buildings, including the Town Hall, the city police station and local council offices. The High (the word street is traditionally omitted) is the longest of the four streets and has a number of independent and high-end chain stores, but mostly University and College buildings.
There are two small shopping centres in the city centre: The Clarendon Centre[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clarendoncentre.co.uk/ |title=Clarendon Shopping Centre |publisher=Clarendoncentre.co.uk |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] and The Westgate Centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfordcity.co.uk/shops/westgate/ |title=Visit Oxford's premier shopping centre — the Westgate Shopping Centre |publisher=Oxfordcity.co.uk |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] The Westgate Centre is named for the original West Gate in the city wall, and is located at the west end of Queen Street. It is quite small and contains a number of chain stores and a supermarket. The Westgate Shopping Centre is to undergo a large and controversial refurbishment; the plans involve tripling the size of the centre to [tpl]convert|750000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl], a new 1,335 space underground car park and 90 new shops and bars, including a [tpl]convert|230000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] John Lewis department store. There is to be a new and improved transport system, a complete refurbishment of the existing centre and the surrounding Bonn Square area. The development plans include a number of new homes, and completion is expected in 2011, although this is being delayed due to the current financial climate.
Blackwell's Bookshop is a large bookshop which claims the largest single room devoted to book sales in the whole of Europe, the cavernous Norrington Room (10,000 sq ft).

===Other attractions===

The first was opened at Grandpont in 1844,[tpl]sfn|MacDermot|1927|pp=180–181[/tpl] but this was a terminus, inconvenient for routes to the north;[tpl]sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=300[/tpl] it was replaced by the present station on Park End Street in 1852 with the opening of the Birmingham route.[tpl]sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=327[/tpl] Another terminus, at Rewley Road, was opened in 1851 to serve the Bletchley route;[tpl]sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=Historical Background[/tpl] this station closed in 1951.[tpl]sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=fig. 8[/tpl] There have also been a number of local railway stations, all of which are now closed. 
Oxford railway station is half a mile (about 1 km) west of the city centre. The station is served by numerous routes, including CrossCountry services to as far away as Manchester and Edinburgh, First Great Western (who operate the station) services to London Paddington and other destinations such as Worcester, Banbury and occasional Chiltern Railways services to Birmingham. The present station opened in 1852. Oxford is the junction for a short branch line to Bicester, which is being extended to form the East West Rail Link.http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/ The East West Rail Link is planning to once again connect Oxford to London Marylebone by building 400 metres of extra track between Bicester Town and southwards joining the Chiltern Main Line southwards (of Bicester North which is not on the new line)- serving High Wycombe to London Marylebone avoiding London Paddington and Didcot Parkway. The East West Rail Link is proposed to continue through Milton Keynes, Bedford,http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/western-section Cambridge,http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/central-section and ultimately Ipswich and Norwich,http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/eastern-section thus providing alternative to connecting within London. The Varsity Line between Oxford and Cambridge is planned to link Bedford with a short gap to be reconstructed to Sandy then a rail link between the two cities will be restored via Hitchin.

===River and canal===

Oxford was historically an important port on the River Thames, with this section of the river being called The Isis; the Oxford-Burcot Commission in the 17th century attempted to improve navigation to Oxford.[tpl]cite book |title=The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs |author=Thacker, Fred. S. |location= Newton Abbot |publisher=David and Charles |origyear= 1920 |year=1968 |isbn= |oclc= [/tpl] Iffley Lock and Osney Lock lie within the bounds of the city. In the 18th century the Oxford Canal was built to connect Oxford with the Midlands.[tpl]cite book | title = The Oxford Canal | first = Hugh J | last = Compton | location = Newton Abbot | publisher=David & Charles | year = 1976 | isbn =  | oclc = 76-54077 [/tpl]
Commercial traffic has given way to recreational use of the river and canal. Oxford was the original base of Salters Steamers and there is a regular service from Folly Bridge downstream to Abingdon and beyond.

===Roads===

Oxford's central location on several transport routes means that it has long been a crossroads city with many coaching inns.
The Oxford Ring Road surrounds the city centre and close suburbs Marston, Iffley, Cowley and Headington; it consists of the A34 to the west, a 300m section of the A44, the A40 north and north-east, A4142/A423 to the east. It is a dual carriageway, except for a 300m section of the A40 where two residential service roads adjoin, and was completed in 1966.

====A roads====

The main roads to/from Oxford are:

====Motorway====

The city is served by the M40 motorway, which connects London to Birmingham. The M40 approached Oxford in 1974 leading from London to Waterstock where the A40 continued to Oxford. When the M40 extension to Birmingham was completed in January 1991, it curved sharply north and a mile of the old motorway became a spur. The M40 comes no closer than [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] away from the city centre, curving to the east of Otmoor. The M40 meets the A34 to the north of Oxford.

==Education==

===Schools===

Oxford is home to wide range of schools, many of which educate pupils from around the world. There are two University choral foundation schools, Christ Church Cathedral School and New College School, established to educate the boy choristers of the chapel choirs, which have kept the tradition of single sex education. Magdalen College School still educates the boy choristers of Magdalen College, Oxford, but became a grammar school and is now an independent school for ages 7–18. St Edward's is another leading independent HMC member school and is one of the few fully co-educational public schools in the county. Other independent schools in Oxford include Oxford High School, Rye St Antony School and Headington School, Wychwood School (girls only), St. Clare's, Oxford (co-ed, international school), Greene's Tutorial College (post-GCSE) and two prep schools, Dragon School and Emmanuel Christian School.
Examination results in state-run Oxford schools are consistently below the national average and regional average. However, results in the city are improving, with 44% of pupils gaining 5 grades A*-C in 2006. The city and its suburbs are served by six secondary schools.

==Sport==

The town's leading football club, Oxford United, are currently in League Two, the fourth tier of league football, though they enjoyed some success in the past in the upper reaches of the league. They were elected to the Football League in 1962, reached the Third Division after three years and the Second Division after six, and most notably reached the First Division in 1985 – a mere 23 years after joining the Football League. They spent three seasons in the top flight, winning the Football League Cup a year after promotion. The 18 years that followed relegation in 1988 saw their fortunes decline gradually, though a brief respite in 1996 saw them win promotion to the new (post Premier League) Division One in 1996 and stay there for three years. They were relegated to the Football Conference in 2006, staying there for four seasons before returning to the Football League in 2010. They play at the Kassam Stadium (named after former chairman Firoz Kassam), which is situated near the Blackbird Leys housing estate and has been their home since relocation from the Manor Ground in 2001. The club's notable former managers include Ian Greaves, Jim Smith, Maurice Evans, Brian Horton and Denis Smith. Notable former players include John Aldridge, Ray Houghton, Tommy Caton, Matt Elliott, Nigel Jemson and Dean Whitehead.
