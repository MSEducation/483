The Australian Business Number, or ABN, is a unique identifier issued by the Australian Business Register (ABR) which is operated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).  The ABN is a component of the reform known as A New Tax System introduced by John Howard's Liberal government on 1 July 2000.

==Australian Business Register==

The Australian Business Register (ABR) is maintained by the Registrar of the ABR, who is also the Commissioner of Taxation.Section 28 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth).  The Registrar registers entities and, in doing so, issues them with an ABN.Section 11 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth).

==Entitlement to an ABN==

The Registrar issues ABNs only to entities who are entitled to an ABN.Section 8 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth).  Entities do not have to be individuals (natural persons) or companies (legal persons).  An entity can be:

Whether or not an entity is carrying on an enterprise is a question of fact and there are many circumstances where an entity will be carrying on an enterprise.  Without being exhaustive, an entity will be carrying on an enterprise if:
The Registrar of the ABR can refuse an entity's application to be registered.Section 13 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth).  Equally, the Registrar can cancel an entity's registration and thus their ABN.Section 18 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth).  Both of these decisions are reviewable taxation decisions.

==Applying for an ABN==

==Format of the ABN==

The ABN is an eleven digit number where the first two digits are a checksum. Unlike with the Tax File Number (TFN), the ATO has publicised the formula for checking and creating valid ABN checksums.  Also, the nature of the ABN algorithm means that any 9-digit number can be made into a valid ABN.
In the case of companies, the ATO determines the ABN by using the company's Australian Company Number (ACN) to which is prefixed the two-digit checksum.
