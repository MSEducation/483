[[On Things Heard]]

CATEGORIES: Works by Aristotle

On Things Heard (or De audibilibus) is a work which was formerly attributed to Aristotle, but is now generally believed to be the work of Strato of Lampsacus. Our extant version  of On Things Heard is made up of long extracts included in Porphyry's Commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics, and is thus partial. The extracts are concerned with the nature of sound production.
