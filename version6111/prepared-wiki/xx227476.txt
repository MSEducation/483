==Biography==

Jamie Hall was born in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada.  He graduated from St. James Collegiate in 1999 and with a degree in Business for the University of Winnipeg Continuing Education as well as the Canadian Youth Business Foundation School of Business.  Later he sat on the board of the Canadian Youth Business Foundation. His background in business has led to his ownership and management of several companies.
Jamie's first love was music.  He started out as a DJ and then moved into promotions.  He then owned a record label called Urbnrg Records which was distributed by Sunshine Records.  The label was known for the events it promoted, a TV show called Def 11 9https://vimeo.com/88726996] which was produced for Shaw TV, the DJ Fin-S Live Video Mix Show and the World Record Attempt by 12seven rapper The Hafrican.  Citing the internet as having a destructive power over the industry, Jamie sold his record label and worked on teen promotions full-time under the company name Feel Tha Heat Entertainment http://foofind.is/en/download/Fq3HJpV!u9VuVKGT/Feel%20Tha%20Heat%20-%20Girlicious%20-%20Aug%2028,%2008.html.
During the time that Jamie owned Feel Tha Heat he was the face of the company and hosted some of Winnipeg's biggest shows sans celebrity attendees.  Feel Tha Heat was sponsored by MTS http://mts.ca and Rogers http://rogers.ca.  His time owning FTH Entertainment lasted only 4 years until he decided to move into TV full-time when his concept show Club Life was picked up by Citytv.  Jamie sold FTH Entertainment during the summer of 2008 and moved to Las Vegas to produce Season 2 of Club Life.
While in Las Vegas Jamie began volunteering for the Barack Obama campaign.  He worked on every aspect of the campaign that he could from canvassing to event and press coordination.  In a shocking move Jamie gave up the taping of Club Life Season 2 to volunteer at Barack Obama's Inauguration.  With both happening at the same time a decision had to be made and Jamie was cited as saying that he couldn't pass up working history and only Club Life could be revisited.  Much of his involvement with the campaign was documented in a portfolio video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuSB7qkhwCM.
Since his time on the US campaign trail Jamie has continued to work in nightlife, opening Mystique http://www.winnipegsun.com/videos/featured/winnipeg-and-manitoba/5828786001/a-night-club-with-plenty-of-mystique/42861024001, Area http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150296366785433 and being involved in the launch of Opera http://operaultralounge.ca.
In February 2012 Jamie released his first novel entitled 7 Deadly Women http://7deadlywomen.com.  The full story about how the novel came about was covered by CTV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UWRyuya8yM.  The book has since gone on to sell largely in the Winnipeg market and modestly in the US and overseas.  Jamie has blogged http://jamieianhall.wordpress.com/ about many subjects including that he is writing his next novel currently.
Currently, Jamie has reported via his company's Facebook page that he will be launching a new business app called SocialForce http://socialforce.com. The app is an off-shoot of his brand Immediate Media http://immediatemb.ca. Jamie and his team at Immediate produce The Winnipeg Show http://thewinnipegshow.ca for MTS TV.

==Television==

His third show, Club Life (TV series) was false National on Citytv and was seen late night.  The show featured a look inside the world of Winnipeg nightlife.  Most recently, Jamie produced The Winnipeg Show season one for MTS TV http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihQSjw4Ql17R2em_THuK9cQKH45ujKXW.

==Promotions==

While Jamie has worn many hats and can be seen as a jack of many trades he has been a promoter for the longest span of time.  Jamie started by throwing small events at a local legion then moved on to large events.  He has promoted everything from foam parties to elegant New Year's Eve events, record labels to politicians.  Jamie's expansive career in promotions landed him the title of Director of Nightclub Promotions for Canad Inns.  He was let go from the company in 2011.http://jamieianhall.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/a-tale-of-corporate-canaduhhhhh/  As Jamie's interests in promotions evolved, he became entrenched in digital marketing. Today, he continues to promote for clients and his own brands with his "digital solutions agency", Immediate Media.

==Writing==

7 Deadly Women http://7deadlywomen.com is the first literary offering by Jamie.  The book, which has been self-described as "inspired fiction", and a sarcastic, dark look at dating, follows the exploits of Jason Mytez. Having sold largely in Canada, 7 Deadly Women has sold 10,000+ copies and is available in most major book stores. Jamie has stated many times in his blog that he is in the process of writing a couple of books, and whichever one he finishes first, will be his second novel.

==Media==

Jamie is no stranger to media coverage, both good and bad.
Jamie is also known to Winnipeg residents for his battle with the media and Mayor Sam Katz in February and March 2008 http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Winnipeg/2008/02/24/4871878-sun.html.  The battle was over whether or not any incidents involving weapons and drug use took place at a FTH event http://mikeoncrime.com/article/7062/mayor-embarrassed-by-nightclub-event in February 2008 at the Sonar Club.  One youth was detained by FTH security and later arrested by city police for hiding a machete outside the club. The Mayor pulled his endorsement of FTH and was blasted by Hall for having no backbone and Hall was quoted as saying in the Winnipeg Sun "not waiting to examine the facts before speaking out against a positive force in teen's lives in Winnipeg."  One of the nightclub owners was quoted in the Winnipeg Sun as having removed a teen for cocaine use. Hall claimed the entire media frenzy was brought on without fact or investigation and offered video evidence and testimonials from parents and teens to back up his side of the story. http://winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4128660p-4722242c.html Sonar Nightclub later closed its doors and Hall dropped a lawsuit against the owners due to a corporate bankruptcy.  After the event Feel Tha Heat went on to host several successful shows including a huge concert featuring Girlicious. Of the situation, Hall had this to say in an interview years later at a corporate speaking engagement, "The Sonar incident woke me up so to speak. I learned the destructive force of the media. When I was originally confronted by the allegations, I reacted poorly. It seemed absurd that after all those years of clearly protecting teens at my events, I would be accused of such horrible things. I was put on blast in the media with zero evidence against FTH. Our name was run through the mud without any proof. It disgusted me."
FTH also came under fire in March 2007 when the Winnipeg Convention Centre and Jamie decided not to let a teen perform at an event after being tipped by the Police that gangs were going to "rush the security" in an effort to hurt the teen.  Jamie and FTH were later praised for their decision to keep 2,500 youth safe.  Hall is quoted on the FTH Entertainment website http://www.fthentertainment.com as saying this about the incident, "Cody's mom called me, asking for her son to perform at my event.  We later learned of a mixtape he made calling out gangs which led to them wanting to hurt him.  We put the safety of thousands of teens before a small performance at our preparty."
FTH was criticized on these occasions, however the company did host 4 years of sold out events, graduations, provide scholarships and grad dress programs for povern youth.  During the duration of Hall's ownership of FTH, there were zero injuries, deaths and/or incidents that could be cited as major.
Jamie has seen positive press coverage for FTH as well. http://www.winnipegfirst.ca/article/2007/09/09/positivity_will_breed_positivity
Jamie also appeared in the media many times for his work with the Obama campaign, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCahgq2oiws for the release of his first book http://metronews.ca/news/winnipeg/226618/winnipeggers-first-novel-an-intimate-look-into-the-dating-scene/ and Urbnrg Records http://www.manitobamusic.com/news/read,article/1353/winnipeg-spawns-new-urban-label

==Politics==

Jamie Hall worked on two Mayoral campaigns for the current Mayor of Winnipeg Sam Katz.  He also volunteered with the Nevada campaign team for Barack Obama as a press and event coordinator http://www.chrisd.ca/blog/3489/winnipegger-rollin-with-the-dnc/.  During a Michelle Obama rally Jamie Hall blogged his reasons for being a part of a USA election and gave a behind the scenes look to his Canadian peers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqnB0Xbbpq4.
