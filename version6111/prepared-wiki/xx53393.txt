[[USS Boone (FFG-28)]]

CATEGORIES: 1980 ships, Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates of the United States Navy

USS ''Boone'' (FFG-28) is the twentieth ship in the United States Navy's Oliver Hazard Perry class of guided missile frigates.
The frigate was named for Vice Admiral Joel Thompson Boone, M.D. (1889–1974).  FFG-28, the first U.S. ship to bear the admiral's name, was ordered 23 January 1978, launched 16 January 1980 by Todd Pacific Shipyards, and commissioned 15 May 1982. She has since earned numerous awards and commendations.
The rudder fell off Mayport-based frigate USS Boone while on deployment in the western Mediterranean. The mishap forced the ship to send out a call for help to which Canadian destroyer HMCS Iroquois responded, providing divers who inspected the ship's underside. Within 24 hours, Boone was being towed to Rota for repairs by the German Navy's replenishment oiler Spessart. The ship was not adrift or totally dead in the water because its two 350-horsepower auxiliary propulsion units provided a “limited amount of maneuverability.” The lost rudder was replaced Dec. 27 and, after a day of operational testing, Boone got underway again Dec. 28.http://www.seawaves.com/newsletters/TDIH/november/30nov [tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
