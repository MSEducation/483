Miles turned professional in 1969. He first gained recognition in 1974, when he reached the final of the World Championship. Although he lost 22–12 to Ray Reardon, this turned out to be the highlight of his career. He won Pot Black in 1974 (after entering as a late replacement for Fred Davis, who withdrew because of illness), and again in 1975, but had little subsequent success. Other notable moments in Miles's career included the runner-up spot in the 1976 Masters, again losing to Reardon.
1978/9 represented something of a purple patch for Miles. At the UK Championship, Miles defeated Rex Williams 9-8 and then hammered Willie Thorne 9-1 which included what was then a championship record break of 139 in the last frame.
However, he was then dispatched 9-1 by eventual winner Doug Mountjoy.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, January 1978, pp23-27.
This form continued in January 1979, when he reached the final of the Holsten Lager International by defeating John Pulman, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins. He led John Spencer 7-6 in the final, having made a break of 107, but eventually lost 11-7, to take £2000 as runner up.Everton Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1979, pp13-15.
Miles led defending champion Ray Reardon 3-0 and 5-3 in the first round of the 1979 World Championship, but a dose of flu overcame him and he lost 13-8.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1979, p13. Straight after this, Miles defeated Doug Mountjoy 4-3 and Perrie Mans 5-2 in the group stages of the Pontins Professional Event. Miles then beat Steve Davis 4-0 in the semi-final, but lost 8-4 in the final to Doug Mountjoy.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1979, p21.  
At the inaugural World Team Cup, Miles represented England along with John Spencer and Fred Davis, where they reached the final, only to be beaten 14-3 by Wales.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1979, pp5-9. His last major title was the Tolly Cobbold Classic in 1981, when he beat Cliff Thorburn 5–1 in Ipswich. During the 1980s, he slid down the rankings and he last played at the World Championship in 1984.
Miles is left-eyed and has a large chin, so had one of the most distinctive styles in snooker to line up his left eye with the cue. The cue runs beneath his left ear, his chin hanging far over his cue; as he strikes the cue ball, the cue brushes his left cheek. He retired in 1992. After stopping playing, he ran two snooker clubs at Sandwell, West Midlands,Birmingham snooker pundit pays tribute to 'Hurricane' Higgins. - Birmingham News - News - Birmingham Mail and one at Crewe, Cheshire. However, he did play at the Seniors Pot Black competition in 1997.
