[[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996]]

CATEGORIES: United States presidential primaries, 1996, Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries

The 1996 Republican presidential primaries were the selection process by which voters of the Republican Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1996 U.S. presidential election. Former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, former Senate Majority Leader was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1996 Republican National Convention held from August 12 to August 15, 1996 in San Diego, California.

==Background==

Following the 1994 midterm elections, many prominent candidates entered what would be a crowded field.  This was expected as Democratic President Bill Clinton was very unpopular in his first two years in office, eventually leading to the Republican Revolution.  However, as Clinton became increasingly popular in his third year in office, several withdrew from the race or decided not to run. Former U.S. Army Gen. Colin L. Powell was widely courted as a potential Republican nominee. However, on November 8, 1995, Powell announced that he would not seek the nomination. Former Secretary of Defense and future Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney was touted by many as a possible candidate for the presidency, but he declared his intentions not to run in early 1995. Then-Texas Governor George W. Bush was also urged by some party leaders to seek the Republican Party nomination, but opted against doing so.

==Primary race overview==

Going into the 1996 primary contest, Senate Majority Leader and former vice-presidential nominee Bob Dole was widely seen as the front runner. Dole had significant name recognition, as he was a two time presidential candidate - in 1980 and 1988, and was expected to win the nomination against underdog candidates such as the more conservative U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and more centrist U.S. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. The fragmented field of candidates, which also included journalist and 1992 presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and magazine publisher Steve Forbes, debated issues such as a flat tax and other tax cut proposals, and a return to supply-side economic policies popularized by Ronald Reagan. More attention was drawn to the race by the budget stalemate in 1995 between the Congress and the President, which caused temporary shutdowns and slowdowns in many areas of federal government service.
On January 29, Buchanan won a non-binding straw poll in Alaska. Most pundits dismissed Buchanan's showing as insignificant.Anchorage Daily News. Jan. 31, 1996. p. 1b Buchanan later said that future Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin worked on his 1996 Alaska campaign.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9rZkJfKoEU On February 6, Buchanan won the Louisiana caucus. Buchanan and Gramm had made several trips to the state to campaign. Gramm was expected to win, due to being from neighboring Texas and having the support of many of the Louisiana party regulars.The Advocate Rouge. Feb.7, 1996. p. A1
Dole won the Iowa Caucus with 26% of the vote, a considerably smaller margin of victory than was expected.
Gramm's poor showing in Louisiana plus placing 5th in Iowa's caucuses resulted in his withdrawal from the contest on the Sunday before the New Hampshire primary.
In the New Hampshire Primary, Buchanan recorded a surprising victory over Dole, who finished in second place.
Buchanan's early victories and Forbes' victories in Delaware and Arizona put Dole's expected front runner status in doubt during the formative months of the primary season. Dole won every primary after including North and South Dakota; this eventually gave him enough delegate commitments to claim status as the GOP presidential presumptive nominee.
Having collected only 21 percent of the total votes in Republican primaries and won 4 states, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared however that, if Dole were to choose a pro-choice running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now Constitution Party) candidate.[tpl]Citation | author-link = Skipp Porteous| last = Porteous | first = Skipp | url = http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html | date = April 1996 | title = Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan | journal = Freedom Writer | publisher = Public Eye[/tpl].

Dole resigned his Senate seat on June 11 in order to focus more intently on his presidential campaign.
