Al Futaisi ([tpl]lang-ar|الفطيسي[/tpl]) is an island about eight kilometres southwest of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates with a size of approximately [tpl]convert|50|km2|acre|sing=on[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The largest part of the island, which is [tpl]convert|10|km|miles|sing=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|5|km|miles|sing=on[/tpl] wide, is covered by a wildlife sanctuary but also a resort for ecotourism was built on Futaisi.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The discovery of old wells, an ancient mosque and a graveyard showed that the original settlement of Futaisi dates back several hundred years.http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/02/01/13/37650.html Although the island does currently not have any fresh water, it supports a diverse flora and fauna with Dugong, Osprey, lizards (Uromastyx) and Gazelles.http://www.uaeinteract.com/maps/et_14.asp
Futaisi is not connected to the mainland by bridges but has a small airport and a boat dock.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
A special sign of the owner of the island Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan was the construction of a waterway formed by Latin letters in the south of the island "at [tpl]coord|24|20|48.32|N|54|19|57.42|E||[/tpl]", which produced the word 'HAMAD'. The individual letters were almost 500 meters long, the channel width was 44 meters and the total width of the word extended over 1700 meters which allowed the word to be read from air or satellite images like Google Maps. The project was abandoned and the waterway filled in during 2013.http://news.msn.com/world/sheiks-name-gouged-on-island-mysteriously-disappears
