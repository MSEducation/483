Boy in a Box is a solo album by Johnny Goudie, released in 2005. It was the debut release for F+M records and was originally to be a "best of" album. In addition to new material, it also includes songs from Johnny's previous solo album I Love Elke as well as Goudie's final album ...Effects of Madness, both of which Johnny didn't think received a proper audience since Goudie broke up soon after the release of ...Effects of Madness, and Johnny joined Endochine soon after the release of I Love Elke.
