Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! was the second album by the Icelandic alternative rock-pop band The Sugarcubes, released in October 1989.
The name of the album was inspired by Mr. Toad from the famous children's book by Kenneth Grahame The Wind in the Willows.
A version of the album sung in Icelandic was also released, titled Illur Arfur ("bad legacy").
Contrary to their debut album Life's Too Good, Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! was not well received by critics.
