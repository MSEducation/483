The Lockyer Valley Region is a local government area in the West Moreton region of South East Queensland, Australia, between the cities of Ipswich and Toowoomba. It was created in 2008 from a merger of the Shire of Gatton and the Shire of Laidley.
It has an estimated operating budget of A$35m.

==History==

Prior to European settlement, the Lockyer Valley area was home to the Kitabul Aboriginal people.
Tarampa Divisional Board was created on 15 January 1880 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879, and held its first meeting on 20 February 1880. On 25 April 1888, the Laidley area broke away and separately incorporated, and on 25 January 1890, the Forest Hill area moved from Tarampa to Laidley.Queensland Government Gazette, 25 April 1888, p.1403. On 1 July 1902, the town of Laidley was created as a separate municipality with its own Borough Council.
With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, the borough and divisions became a town and shires respectively on 31 March 1903. The town council was dissolved on 8 February 1917, and Laidley absorbed part of the Shire of Rosewood.
On 3 September 1938, Tarampa was renamed the Shire of Gatton.[tpl]Gazette QLD|title=Order in Council|date=3 September 1938|volume=151|page=794[/tpl] On 19 March 1949 it grew to incorporate part of the former Shires of Drayton and Highfields, while losing some of its original area to the City of Toowoomba and Shire of Crows Nest.[tpl]Gazette QLD|volume=172|page=981–985|date=17 March 1949[/tpl]
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that Gatton and Laidley amalgamate, uniting the major farming, cropping and horticultural production area of South East Queensland under one local authority. While both councils opposed the amalgamation, they identified each other as preferred partners if it had to go ahead.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission|author=Queensland Local Government Reform Commission|volume=2|pages=182–186|isbn=1-921057-11-4|date=July 2007|url=http://www.dlgp.qld.gov.au/resources/map/reform/lockyer-valley-rationale.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] On 15 March 2008, the two Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect six councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.
