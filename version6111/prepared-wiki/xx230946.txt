When dairy farming was proving difficult in the early 1980s, Inder moved to Lavender farming and manufacture of herbal products which proved more profitable.Eliza Wood, Bumper lavender crop, ABC Rural, 10 February 2006. Accessed October 8, 2008 A childhood dream of establishing a hedge maze proved initially difficult, so he developed a model town called the Village of Lower Crackpot. A gift shop, pancake parlour, and honey tasting soon followed making Tasmazia the largest commercial tourism attraction on the North West Coast.
When the nearby town of Sheffield was facing commercial decline, Inder was instrumental in establishing Sheffield as a town of murals with a mural fest. Other festivals he played a leading role in establishing include the Blooming Tasmania festival and the Lavender festival.
Brian Inder has served as a board member of the West North-West Regional Tourism Association and vice-president of the Kentish Association of Tourism.
