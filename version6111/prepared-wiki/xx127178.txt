==History==

The route was commissioned in 1932 with the southern half running along a slightly different alignment than the current route. In the 1920s, this route had been known as State Highway 318. The original path of Route 137 consisted only of High Ridge Road. Its southern terminus was located at the intersection of Long Ridge Road (Route 104), Summer and Bedford Streets, also known as "Bull's Head", in Stamford.  Since 1976, Route 137 follows High Ridge Road south onto Cold Springs Road and onto Washington Boulevard and ends at Tresser Boulevard (US 1) in front of the Stamford Government Center. Route 104, which originally extended south into downtown Stamford using Bedford and Summer Street, was cut back to end at its current southern terminus at the same time.
A freeway upgrading of Route 137 was proposed in 1969 connecting downtown Stamford and the town center of Pound Ridge but was never implemented due to local opposition. The road also might have continued south to a proposed bridge to Long Island (see Long Island Crossing).Connecticut Routes, Route 137
