==Description==

Kanabō and the other related types of these club like weapons were constructed out of heavy wood, or made entirely from iron, with iron spikes or studs on one end. One or both ends of the wooden type clubs could be sheathed in iron.  Kanabō type weapons came in all sizes and shapes with the largest ones being as tall as a man and a two-handed weapon while the smaller lighter ones were primarily one-handed and the length of a forearm. 
The shape could be that of a baseball bat with a thick heavy end tapering towards a slender handle or they could be straight all the way from the handle to the end, with the shaft being round or multi faceted.Secrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan By Oscar Ratti, Adele Westbrook p.305Classical weaponry of Japan: special weapons and tactics of the martial arts By Serge Mol p.91Heroes of the Grand Pacification: Kuniyoshi's Taiheiki eiyū den p.184

==Mythology==

The kanabō was also  a mythical weapon, often used in tales by oni (Japanese demon) since they were reputedly  extremely strong.Tigers, Devils, and Fools: A Guide to Japanese Proverbs By Edward Trimnell p.115The Oriental economist, Volume 43 Tanzan Ishibaship.45 Today there is a saying in Japanese: "Like giving a kanabō to an oni" — which means to give an extra advantage to someone who already has the advantage (the strong made stronger).The netsuke handbook Reikichi Ueda p.175 A western rendering might be, 'like adding fuel to a fire'.

==Use==

It has been said that one purpose of the kanabō type of weapons was to smash enemies' armor, bones and the legs of their warhorses.Advanced Stick Fighting - Page 50 Masaaki Hatsumi - 2005 The art of using this cumbersome weapon, kanabō-jutsu or tetsubo-jutsu,Tuttle dictionary of the martial arts of Korea, China & Japan - Page 277 Daniel Kogan, Sun-Jin Kim - 1996Comprehensive Asian fighting arts By Donn F. Draeger, Robert W. Smith p.83 consisted of a mastery of both balance and strength; it required great skill to recover from a miss with the heavy club, which could leave a wielder open to a counter-attack.
