It is the band's first album with guitarist/keyboardist Brian Southall who joined the band after the departure of guitarist/vocalist Casey Crescenzo.

As of August 2, 2007, the retail version of the album was posted for streaming on the band's Myspace page.  The album peaked at #130 on the Billboard 200, #3 on Top Heatseekers, and #15 on Top Independent Albums.

==Album Background & Inspiration==

From the album press release via Absolutepunk.net:
 "The title, The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi was taken from a book written by a late 16th century astronomical theorist by the name of Johannes Kepler Mundi'' and the publication just fascinated the band. Kepler’s theory suggested that each of the 9 planets in our solar system produced tones as they orbited the sun. Throughout the orbit, Venus would stay a consistent note that was considered the 6th in relation to the rest of the planets. As Earth would shift its tonality, it would create the effect of the notes moving from the major 6th to the minor 6th and back and forth. This is where the “Mi Fa Mi” comes into action, symbolizing the corresponding syllables when singing a scale in relation to the notes of the earth {Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do}. Kepler further concurred that the Earth “singing” Mi Fa Mi could truly stand for Misery, Famine, Misery and ultimately, that is the song the Earth and Venus continued to sing. Misery[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl], referring to an empty place and Famine, referring to the appetite or thirst for things."http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=241591 

==Behind the Record==

Through the band's album website, in a section called "Behind The Record," TREOS discussed a different song from their new record each day, leading up to the release on August 7 - occurring in the same order as the track listing. Each band member put together their personal account of writing and recording each song, which helped fans gain insight into lyrical, song, and conceptual meanings. Along with the entries about each song, 30 second clips of the day's song were uploaded so that fans could listen as they read.

==Critical reception==

The critical response to The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi was extremely favorable. Allmusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and praises them stating that "Not many bands could conceive of building an album around the twin poles of family breakdown and astronomer Johannes Kepler's tonal theory of the planets".[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r1110674|pure_url=yes[/tpl]
However AbsolutePunk's Steve Henderson describes that the individual songs lack a "standalone punch" but "within the context of the album and its corresponding story, it all sort of clicks".http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=257481
