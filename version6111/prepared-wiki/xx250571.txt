Sierra de Juárez is  a subdivision of the mountain range Cordillera Baja California which is an extension of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/108/bc.html

==Climate==

A temperate subhumid climate cool winters and warm summers. Winter is considered the wet season; several rainstorms and a few snowstorms allow several lakes to appear on the Hansen Plain. During the winter, many of the lakes freeze over due to shallow depths and low temperatures at night. During the summer the rate of evaporation and low humidity dry most of the lakes that appeared during the wet season.
