Many awards and honors were showered on Waksman after 1940, most notably the Nobel Prize in 1952; the Star of the Rising Sun, bestowed on him by the emperor of Japan, and the rank of Commandeur in the French Légion d'honneur.[[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080418134324/http://waksman.rutgers.edu/Waks/Waksman/DrWaksman.html |title=Dr. Selman Waksman |publisher=The Waksman Institute at Rutgers website (No further authorship information available) |accessdate= January 17, 2008[/tpl]
Selman Waksman died on August 16, 1973 and was interred at the Crowell Cemetery in Woods Hole, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. His tombstone is inscribed simply as Selman Abraham Waksman: Scientist, followed by his dates of birth and death, and the phrase "The earth will open and bring forth salvation" in Hebrew and English, which is a reference to Isaiah 45:8.This verse is significantly different from the original text of Isaiah 45:8 which states, in the King James Version, as "Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it."
He was the father of Byron Waksman, involved in Multiple sclerosis research .
Other little known contributions of Selman Waksman include anti-fouling paints for the Navy, the use of enzymes in detergents, and the use of Concord grape root stock to protect the French Vineyards from fungal infection.

==Streptomycin==

Waksman had been studying the Streptomyces family of organism since his college student days and had, for a time, been studying the organism Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin was isolated from S. griseus and found effective against tuberculosis by one of Waksman's graduate students, Albert Schatz.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/63042d06-83c2-11e1-82ca-00144feab49a.html#axzz1s0Q17zi3 |title=Germ warfare |date=April 14, 2012 |publisher=Financial Times |author=Andrew Jack[/tpl]

===Controversy===

The details and credit for the discovery of streptomycin and its usefulness as an antibiotic were strongly contested by Schatz, eventually leading to litigation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/njh/SciANDTech/Waksman/schatz.htm |title=The Schatz v. Waksman Lawsuit – 1950 |publisher=scc.rutgers.edu[/tpl] Waksman and Rutgers settled out of court with Schatz, resulting in financial remuneration and entitlement to "legal and scientific credit as co-discoverer of streptomycin."[tpl]cite news |first= Veronique|last= Mistiaen|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Time, and the great healer. |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,823114,00.html |quote=The story of streptomycin – of scientific triumphs, all-too-human scientists and a long quest for justice – lies somewhere between these two men. |publisher=The Guardian |date= November 2, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2010 | location=London[/tpl]
Systematic experiments to test several strains of antibiotic against several different disease organisms were under way in Waksman's laboratory at the time. Their classic approach was to explore a complete matrix with rows consisting of antibiotics and columns consisting of different diseases. The bacteria which produced the antibiotic streptomycin was discovered by Schatz in the farmland outside his lab, and tested by him. Waksman, however, eventually came to claim sole credit for the discovery.[tpl]cite news |first = Peter|last=Pringle|title=Notebooks Shed Light on a Discovery, and a Mentor's Betrayal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/science/notebooks-shed-light-on-an-antibiotic-discovery-and-a-mentors-betrayal.html?ref=science|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2012[/tpl]

==Neomycin==

Neomycin is derived from actinomycetes and was discovered by Waksman and Hubert A. Lechevalier, one of Waksman's graduate students. The discovery was published in the journal Science.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800002,00.html |title=Man of the Soil |journal= Time (magazine) |date= April 4, 1949[/tpl]

==Nobel Prize==

Waksman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1952 "for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis."Official Notice of Award In the award speech, Waksman was called "one of the greatest benefactors to mankind," as the result of the discovery of streptomycin.Award Ceremony Speech Schatz protested being left out of the award, but the Nobel committee ruled that he was a mere lab assistant working under an eminent scientist.
In 1951,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.waksmanfoundation.org/html/foundation_history.html |title=Foundation History [/tpl] using half of his personal patent royalties, Waksman created the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.waksmanfoundation.org/ |title=Waksman Foundation for Microbiology homepage [/tpl] At a meeting of the board of Trustees of the Foundation, held in July 1951 he urged the building of a facility for work in microbiology, named the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, which is located on the Busch campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. First president of the Foundation, Waksman was succeeded in this position by his son, Byron H. Waksman, from 1970 to 2000.
The Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology of the National Academy of Sciences is given in his honor.[tpl]cite web|title=Selman A Walksman Award|url=http://nas.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_waksman|accessdate=July 29, 2012[/tpl]
