===Schools programming===

Schools programming on the network began in 1957 in some regions and expanded as more regions began broadcasting. It is a contractual obligation for the ITV company to broadcast schools programming, and this was initially broadcast as part of the normal scheduling. The programmes were moved into a segment for broadcast during the day in the 1960s, under the banner Independent Television for Schools and Colleges and from 1987 were broadcast on Channel 4 in the ITV Schools on Channel 4 segment. In 1993, this segment became Channel 4 Schools and later in 2000 4Learning. These strands of programming consisted of schools programming from all the ITV companies or from independent sources. The schools strand itself is now defunct, with no particular branding segment used.

It is also available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

==Criticism==

Since the launch of ITV, there have been concerns from politicians and the press that ITV faced a conflict concerning programme audiences and advertisers. As advertisers are reluctant to buy advertising space around low viewing programmes there is a pressure on ITV to broadcast more of these programmes in peak times. This has become more profound in recent years following a relaxation in regulation and significantly more competition in the advertising market following the huge increase in commercial channels. In recent years, programmes have started to dominate from the reality television genre including the celebrity and talent show sub-genres. This has led to accusations of ITV 'dumbing down' their programmes and appealing to the 'lowest common denominator', accusations that are at odds with the network's status as a public service broadcaster.[tpl]cite news|last=Murray-Watson|first=Andrew|title=ITV 'dumbing down' threatens ad revenues|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2947061/ITV-dumbing-down-threatens-ad-revenues.html|accessdate=6 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 September 2006|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Thomas|first=Liz|title=ITV has dumbed down and appeals to 'lowest common denominator' say its bosses|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1325962/ITV-dumbed-appeals-lowest-common-denominator-say-bosses.html|accessdate=6 January 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=3 November 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=ITV Cultures: Independent Television over Fifty years|year=2005|publisher=Open University Press|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780335217298|pages=159â€“176|author=Sherryl Wilson|editor=Catherine Johnson and Rob Turnock|chapter=9[/tpl]
