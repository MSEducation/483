==Career==

===Rangers===

Ricksen, formerly of Fortuna Sittard, joined Rangers in 2000 from Dutch team AZ Alkmaar for a transfer fee of £3.75m.
Ricksen endured a difficult start to his Rangers career, culminating in him being substituted after a torrid 23 minutes against countryman Bobby Petta in a 6–2 defeat to Celtic. On his second trip to Celtic Park six months later, he was sent-off before half-time in another defeat. He had been dropped for the two intervening derbies.He's behind you
In November 2000 Ricksen became the first player in Scottish football to be banned retrospectively on television evidence. His Kung Fu-style kick on Darren Young had been missed by the referee but caught on camera, leading to a five game ban. Ricksen subsequently used his personal website to suggest Young required "straightening out."A relaxed Ricksen puts his Celtic troubles behind him
2003–04 proved to be a failed season for Rangers, with the departure of several players from the treble winning season most notably Barry Ferguson and Lorenzo Amoruso. Ricksen, however, proved to be an important member of the Rangers team which finished second, playing 42 games, despite several injury and disciplinary problems throughout the season. In October 2003 Ricksen threw Rangers chairman John F. McClelland into a swimming pool before a match against Panathinaikos in Athens. The same week he was banned from the Netherlands national team for smashing a hotel door down after a night out.McLeish warns troubled Ricksen After the events Rangers banned Ricksen from talking to the media and manager McLeish said "We would rather have Fernando on the back pages and we have told him that."
In March 2004 Ricksen was again banned by the SFA video review panel. He had elbowed Derek Riordan in a CIS Cup defeat to Hibernian, resulting in a four game ban and a £10,000 fine from his club.Ricksen gets four-game ban
The highlight of Ricksens career at Rangers came in the 2004/2005 season seeing him jointly win the SPFA player of the year award after scoring nine goals from midfield in his forty appearances for the club, helping Rangers to a league and league cup double.
It remained unclear whether Ricksen would be seen as a key member of the Rangers team under new manager Paul Le Guen for the 2006–07 season. An alcohol-fueled incident involving a stewardess on Rangers' outbound flight to their pre-season camp in South Africa, led to Ricksen being sent home by Le Guen, who later described his behaviour as "inappropriate and unacceptable for the way in which I have asked my players to conduct themselves."http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/5164284.stm
On 30 March 2014, Ricksen was inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame along with Lee McCulloch and Nacho Novo.  http://www.rangers.co.uk/news/headlines/item/6649-fame-awards-for-trio

===Zenit St Petersburg===

Ricksen moved on loan to Zenit St Petersburg on a season long loan on 9 August 2006, the Russian club's manager being Dick Advocaat, who signed Ricksen for Rangers. Two weeks later he returned to Ibrox in a friendly between Rangers and Zenit and was booed after injuring Chris Burke with what was described as a reckless tackle.Burke crocked by Ricksen tacklehttp://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid=17616377%26method=full%26siteid=66633-name_page.html Weeks later, Ricksen engaged in an on-field fist-fight with Zenit captain Vladislav Radimov.Fernando Ricksen
On 28 November 2006, Zenit St Petersburg announced that they bought out Ricksen's transfer from Rangers. Despite this, Ricksen again fought with Radimov during a match in January 2007. In January 2009, after two and a half years in Russia, Ricksen was demoted to Zenit's reserve side, having previously refused to leave the club. On 28 August 2009 FC Zenit terminated his contract because of Ricksen's constant disciplinary misbehaviours.Official FC Zenit St. Petersburg website (Russian)

After being without a club for more than a year, on 2 December 2010 Ricksen agreed to rejoin his childhood team Fortuna Sittard, involved in their battle to escape relegation from the Eerste Divisie, signing a contract till the end of the season.'Ricksen maakt vrijdag rentree bij Fortuna'
