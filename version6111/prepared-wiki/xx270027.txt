A list of tunnels in Germany longer than 10 metres.

==Baden-Württemberg==

===Road tunnels===

====Speed limit====

With few exceptions, Baden-Württemberg has a speed limit of 100 km/h for all road and motorway tunnels that have two tubes. It is the only German state where this is the case; other German states have had a speed limit of 80 km/h. Bavaria has been raising the speed limit in such tunnels from 80 km/h to 100 km/h since 2007, and North Rhine-Westphalia has been doing the same since 2008.

==Bavaria==

===Road tunnels===

====Speed limit====

In 2007, Bavaria became the second German state, after Baden-Württemberg, to start increasing the speed limit for road and motorway tunnels with two tubes from 80 to 100 km/h.  The first tunnel to have its speed limit increased from 80 to 100 km/h was the overhead noise barrier tunnel on the A3 auto Railway at Aschaffenburg. The Allach tunnel will be next, following the next scheduled maintenance. The AubingTunnel on the Munich motorway ring is already designed for speeds of 100 km/h and is scheduled to be re-classified.
