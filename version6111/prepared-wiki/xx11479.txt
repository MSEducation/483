</ref> There was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated, or, as [[Walter Burley]] postulated, whether a 'celestial agent' prevented the vacuum arising.  The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called ''[[horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]''.  Speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted to was shut down[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2011[/tpl] by the 1277 [[Paris condemnations]] of [[Bishop]] [[Etienne Tempier]], which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.<ref name=Barrow>

Jean Buridan reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open bellows when the port was sealed.
The 17th century saw the first attempts to quantify measurements of partial vacuum.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |title=The World's Largest Barometer |accessdate=2008-04-30 [/tpl] Evangelista Torricelli's mercury barometer of 1643 and Blaise Pascal's experiments that both demonstrated a partial vacuum.
In 1654, Otto von Guericke invented the first vacuum pumpEncyclopædia Britannica:Otto von Guericke and conducted his famous Magdeburg hemispheres experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated. Robert Boyle improved Guericke's design and with the help of Robert Hooke further developed vacuum pump technology. Thereafter, research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when August Toepler invented the Toepler Pump and Heinrich Geissler invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855, achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 Pa (0.1 Torr). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, which renewed interest in further research.
While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether. Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat.R. H. Patterson, Ess. Hist. & Art 10 1862  19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer Henry Pickering commented: "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, it is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there".[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Pickering | first1 = W.

In 1930, Paul Dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the Dirac sea. This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated Dirac equation, and successfully predicted the existence of the positron, confirmed two years later. Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle formulated in 1927, predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and momentum, or energy and time can be measured. This has far reaching consequences on the "emptiness" of space between particles. In the late 20th century, so-called virtual particles that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed.

==Measurement==

The quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its absolute pressure, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as temperature and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the mean free path (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply. This vacuum state is called high vacuum, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 nm, but at 100 mPa (~1×10−3 Torr) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes. The Crookes radiometer turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.
Vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it. These ranges do not have universally agreed definitions, but a typical distribution is shown in the following table.[tpl]Cite web| author=American Vacuum Society| title=Glossary | work=AVS Reference Guide | url=http://www.aip.org/avsguide/refguide/glossary.html#v | accessdate=2006-03-15[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| author=National Physical Laboratory, UK| title=What do 'high vacuum' and 'low vacuum' mean?
