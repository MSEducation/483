He was born in Massachusetts, the son of Phineas Lovett and Beulah Morse, and came to Nova Scotia with his family during the 1760s. He married Abigail Thayer in 1768. Lovett settled in Annapolis County. He owned a ship which traded in the West Indies. Lovett was high sheriff for the county, justice of the peace and lieutenant-colonel in the militia. In 1783, his seat in the provincial assembly was declared vacant due to non-attendance. He was elected to the provincial assembly for Annapolis County a second time in 1808 following the death of Henry Rutherford. In 1810, he was named a justice in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. He died at Annapolis Royal at the age of 83.
