The Kalaram temple is an old Hindu shrine dedicated to  lord Rama in the Panchavati area of Nasik city in Maharashtra, India. It is probably the most important Hindu shrine in the city. The temple derives its name from the statue of Lord Rama that is black. The literal translation of kalaram means black Rama. The sanctum sanctorum also houses the statues of goddess Sita and  Lakshmana. Thousands of devotees visit it every day.  The temple was funded by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar.
It was built around in 1788.
It was said that Odhekar had a dream that the statue of Rama in black colour is there in the river Godavari Odhekar took the status from river and built the temple and the place where status was found was named as Ramkund. â€“
The temple formed a pivotal role in Dalit movement in India. The famous Dr. Ambedkar once held a protest outside the temple for allowance of Dalits into the temple.
The main entrance has a Lord Hanuman deity which is black. There is also a very old tree that has Lord Dattatreya's footprint impressions marked on a stone. Pilgrims visit the Kapaleshwar Mahadev temple near Kalaram temple.
Authorised guides are available for reasonable price at Kalaram mandir who show around easily.
