[[Weighted arithmetic mean]]

CATEGORIES: Means, Mathematical analysis, Summary statistics

The weighted mean is similar to an arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), where instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.
If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean.  While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpson's paradox.

==Examples==

===Basic example===

Given two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students, the grades in each class on a test were:
The straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. The straight average of 80 and 90 is 85, the mean of the two class means. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class (20 versus 30); hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):
Or, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class (using a weighted mean of the class means):
Thus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available.

===Convex combination example===

Since only the relative weights are relevant, any weighted mean can be expressed using coefficients that sum to one. Such a linear combination is called a convex combination.
Using the previous example, we would get the following:

==Mathematical definition==

Formally, the weighted mean of a non-empty set of data
with non-negative weights
is the quantity
which means:
Therefore data elements with a high weight contribute more to the weighted mean than do elements with a low weight. The weights cannot be negative. Some may be zero, but not all of them (since division by zero is not allowed).

==Statistical properties==

If the observations have expected values 
then the weighted sample mean has expectation

==Dealing with variance==

The weighted mean in this case is:
and the variance of the weighted mean is:
The two equations above can be combined to obtain:
The significance of this choice is that this weighted mean is the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean of the probability distributions under the assumption that they are independent and normally distributed with the same mean.

===Correcting for over- or under-dispersion===

==Weighted sample variance==

For small samples, it is customary to use an unbiased estimator for the population variance. In normal unweighted samples, the N in the denominator (corresponding to the sample size) is changed to N − 1. While this is simple in unweighted samples, it is not straightforward when the sample is weighted.
The degrees of freedom of the weighted, unbiased sample variance vary accordingly from N − 1 down to 0.
The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance above.
As a side note, other approaches have been described to compute the weighted sample variance.Weighted Standard Error and its Impact on Significance Testing (WinCross vs. Quantum & SPSS), Dr. Albert Madansky

==Weighted sample covariance==

If they are not, divide the weights by their sum:
(if the weights are not normalized, an equivalent formula to compute the weighted mean is:)

==Vector-valued estimates==

The weighted mean in this case is:
(where the order of the matrix-vector product is not commutative), in terms of the covariance of the weighted mean:
For example, consider the weighted mean of the point 0 with high variance in the second component and 1 with high variance in the first component. Then 
then the weighted mean is:
which makes sense: the 0 estimate is "compliant" in the second component and the 1 estimate is compliant in the first component, so the weighted mean is nearly 1.

==Weighted averages of functions==

The concept of weighted average can be extended to functions.G. H. Hardy, J. E. Littlewood, and G. Pólya. Inequalities (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-35880-4, 1988. Weighted averages of functions play an important role in the systems of weighted differential and integral calculus.Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, Robert Katz.
