CATEGORIES: 438 BC

Year 438 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Macerinus, Iullus and Cincinnatus (or, less frequently, year 316 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 438 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
