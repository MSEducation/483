CATEGORIES: PH indicators, Triarylmethane dyes, Cresols, Lactones

Thymolphthalein is an acid-base (pH) indicator.  Its transition range is at approximately pH 9.3-10.5.  Below this pH, it is colorless; above this pH, it is blue.  The molar extinction coefficient for the blue thymolphthalein dianion is 38000 M-1cm-1 at 595 nm.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hahn HH, Cheuk SF, Elfenbein S, Wood WB |title= Studies on the Pathogenesis of Fever: Xix.
