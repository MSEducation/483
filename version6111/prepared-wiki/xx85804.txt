[[Hindgut]]

CATEGORIES: Colon (anatomy), Embryology of digestive system

The hindgut (or epigaster) is the posterior (caudal) part of the alimentary canal. In mammals, it includes the distal third of the transverse colon and the splenic flexure, the descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.

==Blood flow==

Arterial supply is by the Inferior mesenteric artery, and venous drainage is to the portal venous system. Lymphatic drainage is to the chyle cistern.

==Autonomic innervation==

The hindgut is innervated via the inferior mesenteric plexus. Sympathetic innervation is from the Lumbar splanchnic nerves (L1-L2), parasympathetic innervation is from S2-S4.
