[[Balkan temperate rainforests]]

CATEGORIES: Rainforests

Balkan temperate rainforests are a small portion of the southeastern Alps and Balkan region contain relatively low elevation (
==Stand Dynamics==

As with temperate rainforests elsewhere, fire has relatively less of an influence compared to many other forest types, such as the subalpine of the Western US or the boreal forests.  Instead, wind and insects are more important.  Small scale gap dynamics are common, as rainfall and storms combine to cause substantial uprooting of individual and small groups of trees.  Widespread windstorms occur with some regularity (e.g. less time between events than the lifespan of dominant treesNagal, Levanic, and Diaci.  2007.  A dendrochronological reconstruction of disturbance in an old-growth Fagus-Abies forest in Slovenia.) and cause extensive gap formation, although not complete mortality over large areas.  It is difficult to determine large scale disturbance dynamics, however, due to the few areas that have not been extensively modified by humans.

The Biogradska Gora National Park, in Montenegro, is typical of this region.  The unprotected remainder has been subject to extensive forestry and coppicing, although a substantial portion remains Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ed. DellaSala. Chapter 6.  Temperate and Boreal Relict of Europe.  Another location contains the virgin "Pecka" forest, with high geological variability.  This region is one of the few remaining Dinaric silver fir-beech forests (Omphalodo-Fagetum), on 60 ha on a located on a high karst plateau (45◦ 754’ N, 14◦ 995’ E).  Over the last 50 years, silver fir has been rapidly declining relative to beech through natural gap-forming, small scale disturbances.Rozenbergar and Diaci, Long Term Stand Structure Changes in Virgin Forest Remnant Pecka - Slovenia
