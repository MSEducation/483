Chiniquodon is a genus of carnivorous cynodont, which lived during the early Late Triassic in South America. Chiniquodon is closely related to a contemporary genus, Probelesodon, and close to the ancestry of mammals. 
Other contemporaries included early dinosaurs. As both groups filled a similar ecological niche, fairly large therapsid hunters such as Chiniquodon may have been outcompeted by dinosaurs.
