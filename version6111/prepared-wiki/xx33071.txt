Shada is an unaired serial of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.  It was intended to be the final serial of the 1979–80 season (Season 17), but was never completed due to strike action at the BBC during filming. In 1992, its recorded footage was released on video using linking narration by Tom Baker, who played the Doctor in the serial, to complete the story.
The script, with adaptations, was later produced by Big Finish Productions as an audio play, with animation and was made available on BBCi and the BBC website in 2003.  This version saw Paul McGann take on the role of the Doctor, with Lalla Ward reprising her role as Romana, with an otherwise different cast.
A novelisation of the story written by Gareth Roberts, returning the action to the Fourth Doctor and Romana, was released in March 2012.

==Synopsis==

The story revolves around the lost planet Shada, on which the Time Lords built a prison for defeated would-be conquerors of the universe. Skagra, an up-and-coming would-be conqueror of the universe, needs the assistance of one of the prison's inmates, but finds that nobody knows where Shada is any more except one aged Time Lord who has retired to Earth, where he is masquerading as a professor at St. Cedd's College, Cambridge. Luckily for the fate of the universe, Skagra's attempt to force the information out of Professor Chronotis coincides with a visit by the professor's old friend, the Doctor.

===Continuity===

In an unfilmed scene in Episode 5, a listing of prisoners kept on Shada included a Dalek, a Cyberman, and a Zygon.  In 1983, clips from Shada were used in The Five Doctors, the 20th-Anniversary special. Tom Baker, the fourth actor to play the Doctor, had declined to appear in the special, and the plot was reworked to explain the events in the clips.  The later audio drama version of Shada, featuring the Eighth Doctor, asserts that the manipulation of time seen in The Five Doctors prevented the original version of events from occurring, which meant that Skagra was never defeated and the Eighth Doctor had to return to that time to rectify the problem.

==Production==

===Original television version===

The original story, as written by Adams, was scheduled to be 6 episodes. It is estimated that only about 50% of the story was filmed. Location filming in Cambridge and the first of three studio sessions at BBC Television Centre were recorded as scheduled. The second studio block was affected by a long-running technicians' dispute. The strike was over by the time rehearsals began for the third recording session, but this was lost to higher-priority Christmas programming. Attempts were made by new producer John Nathan-Turner to remount the story, but for various reasons it never happened and the production was formally dropped in June 1980.
Nathan-Turner was eventually able to complete the story (so far as was possible) by commissioning new effects shots, a score and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing scenes to create six shortened episodes of between 14 and 22 minutes each. The result was released on video in 1992 as a 111 minute VHS tape,

Douglas Adams himself did not regard the story highly and was content for it to remain permanently unseen in any form. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the 1992 release, it had been part of a pile of other papers presented to him by his agent to sign and he wasn't fully aware of what he was agreeing to.
Graham Williams had intended this story be a discussion about the death penalty, more specifically how a civilisation like the Time Lords would deal with this and how they treat their prisoners.

===Big Finish version (2003)===

====Cast====

Broadcast date: 10 December 2005
In 2003, the BBC commissioned Big Finish Productions to remake Shada as an audio play which was then webcast in six episodic segments, accompanied by limited Flash animation, on the BBC website using illustrations provided by comic strip artist Lee Sullivan. The play starred Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Lalla Ward as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station BBC 7, on 10 December 2005 (as a 2[tpl]1/2[/tpl]-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor's summer season which began on 16 July 2006.
Tom Baker was originally approached to reprise the role of the Doctor, but declined. The Eighth Doctor was then substituted and the story reworked accordingly. Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked by Gary Russell to make the story fit into Doctor Who continuity. This included a new introduction, and a new explanation for the Fourth Doctor and Romana being "taken out of time" during the events of The Five Doctors; the Eighth Doctor has come to collect Romana and K-9 because he has begun to have a feeling that there was something they should have done at that time.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] When Skagra is investigating the Doctor, clips from three other Big Finish productions can be heard, exclusively on the CD version – The Fires of Vulcan, The Marian Conspiracy and Phantasmagoria. The original serial was to have used clips from The Pirate Planet, The Power of Kroll, The Creature from the Pit, The Androids of Tara, Destiny of the Daleks, and City of Death.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

====Outside references====

In Episode 2 of the webcast version, when Chris is in his lab showing Clare the book, a vending machine-like object in the background is labelled "Nutrimat", a reference to a similar device in Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Two other references are a sequence where Skagra steals a Ford Prefect and when images of Hitchhiker's Guide characters appear as inmates on Shada itself.

===Levine animated version===

In 2010, Ian Levine decided to fund a project to complete the original Shada story using animation and the original voice actors, minus Tom Baker and David Brierley, to complete the parts of the story that were never filmed. John Leeson would replace Brierley as the voice of K9, and Paul Jones would replace Tom Baker as the Doctor. In October 2010, Dan Hall of 2 Entertain confirmed that a DVD release of Shada was in production and intended to release it with another title.
The completed story was finished in late 2011 and announced by Levine, via his Twitter account, on 8 September 2011. J. R. Southall, writer for the science fiction magazine Starburst, reviewed Levine's completed version and scored it 10 out of 10 in an article published on 15 September 2011. On 26 October 2011, 2 Entertain announced that only the 1992 VHS version would be released on DVD, along with the 1993 documentary More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS and other assorted extras in January 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2012/10/legacy-shada-181012095008.html |title=Legacy for January |publisher=Doctor Who News |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl] Southall confirmed the news that same day writing that Dan Hall, 2 Entertain's commissioning editor, was not going to release Levine's completed version. The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites almost two years later, on October 12, 2013.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

Elements of the story were reused by Adams for his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, in particular the character of Professor Chronotis who possesses a time machine. Adams did not allow Shada, or any of his other Doctor Who stories, to be novelised by Target Books. It is, therefore, one of only five serials from the 1963–1989 series not to be novelised by Target – along with Adams' other stories The Pirate Planet and City of Death, plus Eric Saward's two Dalek stories (Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks).
A six-part adaptation of the story by Jonathan V Way appeared in issues 13–18 of Cosmic Masque, the Doctor Who Appreciation Society's fiction magazine. Adams granted permission for the adaptation on condition that it was never published in collected form.
BBC Books published a novelisation of this serial on 15 March 2012, written by Gareth Roberts. Roberts has drawn on the latest versions of the scripts available, as well as adding new material of his own to "fix" various plotholes and unanswered questions. Nicholas Pegg, in his review of the book for Doctor Who Magazine heartily praised it, calling it a "successful duet".[tpl]cite journal|last=Pegg|first=Nicholas|date=4 April 2012 (cover date)|title=The DWM Review: Shada|journal=Doctor Who Magazine|publisher=Panini Comics|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=445|pages=pp72-73[/tpl]

Lalla Ward delivered an 11hr 30min unabridged reading of the Gareth Roberts novelisation for AudioGo; joining her, voicing K-9, was John Leeson.  The audio recording was released on 15 March 2012 and is available for download or on 10 CDs (CD ISBN 978144586732, Download ISBN 9781445867656).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.audiogo.com/doctor-who-shada |title=Doctor Who: Shada Audiobook on Audio CD, Audio Download, buy now from |publisher=AudioGO |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl]  Vanessa Bishop reviewed it favourably for Doctor Who Magazine, singling out Simon E Power's sound design for special praise.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Vanessa|date=30 May 2012 (cover date)|title=The DWM Review: Shada|journal=Doctor Who Magazine|publisher=Panini Comics|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=447|pages=pp72-73[/tpl]

===Home media===

The original television version of Shada was released in 1992 on VHS and featured linking narration by Tom Baker and was accompanied by a facsimile of a version of Douglas Adams's script (except in North America). The release was discontinued in the UK in 1996.
The webcast version (originally broadcast via BBCi's "Red Button") remains available from the BBC Doctor Who "classic series" website, and an expanded audio-only version is available for purchase on CD from Big Finish. This expanded version was the one broadcast on BBC7.
Ian Levine announced on 8 September 2011 that his personally-funded reconstruction of all six episodes of the serial, using animation and recently recorded vocal tracks to fill in missing parts of the story, had now been completed. On 7 January 2013, the 1992 VHS version of the story along with the 2003 BBCi/Big Finish version were released on DVD as part of The Legacy Collection.
