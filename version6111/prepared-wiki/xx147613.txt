He was a graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied chemistry and wrote a thesis on metaphenetidine. MC Nokes served in the Great War in the Royal Artillery in the trenches and then as an observer in the Royal Flying Corps. He was awarded a Military Cross for his service in the Great War, becoming MC Nokes MC. In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve while a schoolmaster.
He taught chemistry at Malvern College and later at Harrow School, where he was appointed Head of Science. His practical demonstrations of the reaction of sodium with water were popular and famous among his pupils. These often entailed an explosion as MC Nokes put more than the recommended quantity of sodium into the water, and as the smoke cleared and noise subsided, MC Nokes would say "Note the small report."  Later he worked at Harwell and then in the CENTO laboratory in Iran. In retirement he lived in Honiton, Devon, and then in Alton, Hampshire. His nicknames included "Glaxo" and "Stally."
