[[Stalemate]]

CATEGORIES: Chess terminology, Chess rules

Stalemate is a situation in the game of chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. The rules of chess provide that when stalemate occurs, the game ends as a draw (i.e. having no winner).
During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game. In more complicated positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.
The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn.
Some regional chess variants have not allowed a player to play a stalemating move. In different versions of suicide chess, another chess variant, stalemate may or may not be treated as a draw.
The word stalemate is also used for a metaphor when a conflict has reached an impasse and resolution seems difficult or impossible (i.e. a no-win situation).

==Simple examples==

With Black to move, Black is stalemated in diagrams 1 to 4. Stalemate is an important factor in the endgame – the endgame set-up in diagram 1, for example, quite frequently is relevant in play (see King and pawn versus king endgame). The position in diagram 1 occurred in an 1898 game between Amos Burn and Harry PillsburyBurn vs. Pillsbury, 1898 and also in a 1925 game between Savielly Tartakower and Richard Réti.Tartakower vs. Réti 1925  The same position, except shifted to the e-file occurred in a 2009 game between Gata Kamsky and Vladimir Kramnik.Kamsky vs. Kramnik
The position in diagram 4 is an example of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position (see Queen versus pawn endgame). In that position, even if it were White's move, there is no way to avoid this stalemate without allowing Black's pawn to promote. (White may be able to win the resulting queen versus queen ending, however, if the white king is close enough).

==Stalemate in the endgame==

As the previous section suggests, stalemate is a typical element of the endgame [tpl]harvcol|Pachman|1973|p=17[/tpl], often enabling the player with the inferior position to draw the game [tpl]harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=387[/tpl]. Concerning chess, below are some examples of this from actual play.

===Anand versus Kramnik===

In this game between Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship,Anand vs. Kramnik, 2007 Black must capture the pawn on f5, causing stalemate [tpl]harvcol|Benko|2008|p=49[/tpl]. (Any other move by Black loses.)

===Korchnoi versus Karpov===

An intentional stalemate occurred on the 124th move of the fifth game of the 1978 World Championship match between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi.Karpov vs. Korchnoi The game had been a theoretical draw for many moves [tpl]harvcol|Károlyi|Aplin|2007|p=170[/tpl], [tpl]harvcol|Griffiths|1993|pp=43–46[/tpl]. (The white bishop is useless; it cannot defend the queening square at a8 nor attack the black pawn on the light a4 square. If the white king heads towards the black pawn, the black king can move towards a8 and set up a fortress.) However the players were not on speaking terms so neither would offer a draw by agreement. Korchnoi said that it gave him pleasure to stalemate Karpov and that it was slightly humiliating [tpl]harvcol|Kasparov|2006|p=120[/tpl]. (Incidentally, as of 2008 this is the longest game played in a World Chess Championship final match, and also the only World Championship game to end in stalemate before 2007 [tpl]harvcol|Fox|James|1993|p=236[/tpl].)

===Bernstein versus Smyslov===

Sometimes a surprise stalemate saves a game. In the game between Ossip Bernstein and Vasily Smyslov,Bernstein vs. Smyslov Black should win by sacrificing the f-pawn and using the king to support the b-pawn. However, Smyslov thought it was good to advance the b-pawn, because of the skewer of the rook if it captures the pawn once it is on b2. Play went:
Now if 2... Rh2+ 3. Kf3! Rxb2 is stalemate. Smyslov moved 2... Kg4 and the game was drawn after 3. Kf1 (see Rook and pawn versus rook endgame) [tpl]Harvcol|Minev|2004|p=21[/tpl].

===Matulović versus Minev===

In the Bernstein-Smyslov game, the possibility of stalemate arose because of a blunder. It can arise without one, as in the game Milan Matulović versus Nikolay Minev (at right). Play continued:
and now 4.Rxa6 would be stalemate. White played 4. Rc5+ instead and the game was drawn several moves later [tpl]Harvcol|Minev|2004|p=22[/tpl].

===Williams versus Harrwitz===

In the game between Elijah Williams and Daniel Harrwitz,Williams vs. Harrwitz Black was up a knight and a pawn in an endgame. This would normally be a decisive material advantage, but Black could find no way to make progress because of various stalemate resources available to White. The game continued:
Now the players agreed to a draw, since 84...Kxb3 or 84...Rxb3 is stalemate, as is 84...Ra8 85.Rxc3+! Kxc3.
Black could still win the game until his critical mistake 82...Nc3??. Instead, 82...Nb4 wins – for example: 83.Rc8 Re3 84.Rb8+ Kc5 85.Rc8+ Kd5 86.Rd8+ Kc6 87.Ra8 Re1+ 88.Kb2 Kc5 89.Kc3 a1=Q and wins.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Carlsen versus van Wely===

This 2007 game between Magnus Carlsen and Loek van Wely ended in stalemate.Carlsen vs. van Wely Sixteen-year-old Carlsen had adroitly used the "second-rank defense" in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame for 46 moves. The fifty-move rule was about to come into effect, under which Carlsen could claim a draw. The game ended with
stalemate [tpl]harvcol|Nunn|2009|p=200[/tpl].

==More complicated examples==

Stalemate can also occur with more pieces on the board. Outside of relatively simple endgame positions, such as those above, stalemate occurs rarely, usually when the side with the superior position has overlooked the possibility of stalemate [tpl]harvcol|Pachman|1973|p=17[/tpl]. This is typically realized by the inferior side's sacrifice of one or more pieces in order to force stalemate. A piece that is offered as a sacrifice to bring about stalemate is sometimes called a desperado.

===Evans versus Reshevsky===

One of the best-known examples of the desperado is a game by Larry Evans versus Reshevsky,Evans vs. Reshevsky which was dubbed "The Swindle of the Century".Larry Evans, Chess Catechism, Simon and Schuster, 1970, p. 66. SBN 671-21531-0. It appears that Evans himself was the first to refer to the game as the "Swindle of the Century" in print, in his annotations in American Chess Quarterly magazine, of which he was the Editor-in-Chief. American Chess Quarterly, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Winter, 1964), p. 171. Hans Kmoch referred to the conclusion of the game less grandiosely as "A Hilarious Finish". Hans Kmoch, "United States Championship", Chess Review, March 1964, pp. 76-79, at p. 79. Also available on DVD (p. 89 of "Chess Review 1964" PDF file). Evans sacrificed his queen on move 49 and offered his rook on move 50. White's rook has been called the eternal rook. Capturing it results in stalemate, but otherwise it stays on the seventh rank and checks Black's king ad infinitum (i.e. perpetual check). The game would inevitably end in a draw by agreement, by threefold repetition, or by an eventual claim under the fifty-move rule [tpl]harvcol|Averbakh|1996|pp=80–81[/tpl].

===Gelfand versus Kramnik===

The position at right occurred in Gelfand–Kramnik, FIDE Candidates match, game 6, Sanghi Nagar 1994.Gelfand vs. Kramnik Kramnik (Black), down two pawns and on the defensive, would be very happy with a draw. Gelfand (White) has just played 67. Re4–e7?, a strong-looking move that threatens 68.Qxf6, winning a third pawn, or 68.Rc7, further constricting Black. Black responded 67... Qc1! If White takes Black's undefended rook with 68.Qxd8, Black's desperado queen forces the draw with 68...Qh1+ 69.Kg3 Qh2+!, compelling 70.Kxh2 stalemate (second diagram). If White avoids the stalemate with 68.Rxg7+ Kxg7 69.Qxd8, Black draws by perpetual check with 69...Qh1+ 70.Kg3 Qg1+ 71.Kf4 Qc1+! 72.Ke4 Qc6+! 73.Kd3!? (73.d5 Qc4+; 73.Qd5 Qc2+) Qxf3+! 74.Kd2 Qg2+! 75.Kc3 Qc6+ 76.Kb4 Qb5+ 77.Ka3 Qd3+. Gelfand played 68. d5 instead, but still only drew.

===Troitzky versus Vogt===

In Troitzky–Vogt, 1896, the famous endgame study composer pulled off an elegant swindle in actual play. After Troitzky's 1. Rd1!, Black fell into the trap with the seemingly crushing 1... Bh3?, threatening 2...Qg2#. The game concluded 2. Rxd8+ Kxd8 3. Qd1+! Qxd1 stalemate. White's bishop, knight, and f-pawn are all pinned and unable to move.

==Stalemate in studies==

|}
Stalemate is a frequent theme in endgame studies [tpl]harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=388[/tpl] and other chess compositions. An example is the "White to Play and Draw" study at right, which was composed by the American master Frederick RhineUnited States Chess Federation rating card for Frederick S. Rhine in 2005 and published in 2006 [tpl]harvcol|Benko|2006|p=49[/tpl]. White saves a draw with 1.Ne5+! Black wins after 1.Nb4+? Kb5! or 1.Qe8+? Bxe8 2.Ne5+ Kb5! 3.Rxb2+ Nb3. 1... Bxe5 After 1...Kb5? 2.Rxb2+ Nb3 3.Rxc4! Qxe3 (best; 3...Qb8+ 4.Kd7 Qxh8 5.Rxb3+ forces checkmate) 4.Rxb3+! Qxb3 5.Qh1! Bf5+ 6.Kd8!, White is winning. 2. Qe8+! 2.Qxe5? Qb7+ 3.Kd8 Qd7#. 2... Bxe8 3. Rh6+ Bd6 3...Kb5 4.Rxb6+ Kxb6 5.Nxc4+ also leads to a drawn endgame. Not 5.Rxb2+? Bxb2 6.Nc4+ Kb5 7.Nxb2 Bh5! trapping White's knight. 4. Rxd6+! Kxd6 5. Nxc4+! Nxc4 6. Rxb6+ Nxb6+ Moving the king is actually a better try, but the resulting endgame of two knights and a bishop against a rook is a well-established theoretical draw [tpl]harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|p=524[/tpl] [tpl]harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|p=403[/tpl] [tpl]harvcol|Staunton|1847|p=439[/tpl].This can be confirmed, as to this position, by the Shredder Six-Piece Database. 7. Kd8! (rightmost diagram) Black is three pieces ahead, but if White is allowed to take the bishop, the two knights are insufficient to force checkmate. The only way to save the bishop is to move it, resulting in stalemate. A similar idea occasionally enables the inferior side to save a draw in the ending of bishop, knight, and king versus lone king.
At right is a composition by A. J. Roycroft which was published in British Chess Magazine in 1957. White draws with 1. c7! after which there are two main lines:

==Stalemate in problems==

Some chess problems require "White to move and stalemate Black in n moves" (rather than the more common "White to move and checkmate Black in n moves"). Problemists have also tried to construct the shortest possible game ending in stalemate. Sam Loyd devised one just ten moves long: 1.e3 a5 2.Qh5 Ra6 3.Qxa5 h5 4.Qxc7 Rah6 5.h4 f6 6.Qxd7+ Kf7 7.Qxb7 Qd3 8.Qxb8 Qh7 9.Qxc8 Kg6 10.Qe6 (diagram at left). A similar stalemate is reached after: 1.d4 c5 2.dxc5 f6 3.Qxd7+ Kf7 4.Qxd8 Bf5 5.Qxb8 h5 6.Qxa8 Rh6 7.Qxb7 a6 8.Qxa6 Bh7 9.h4 Kg6 10.Qe6 (Frederick Rhine).
Loyd also demonstrated that stalemate can occur with all the pieces on the board: 1.d4 d6 2.Qd2 e5 3.a4 e4 4.Qf4 f5 5.h3 Be7 6.Qh2 Be6 7.Ra3 c5 8.Rg3 Qa5+ 9.Nd2 Bh4 10.f3 Bb3 11.d5 e3 12.c4 f4 (diagram at right). A variation of this game has even occurred in a tournament game.Hohmeister vs. Frank 1993

===Double stalemate===

There are peculiar chess compositions featuring double stalemate. At left and at right are double stalemate positions, in which neither side has a legal move. Such positions are not seen in practical play. There is also a bizarre chess variant, Patt-schach,Patt-schach by Hans Bodlaender, The Chess Variant Pages that begins from a double stalemate position.

The fastest known game ending in a double stalemate position was discovered by Enzo Minerva and published in the Italian newspaper l'Unità on 14 August 2007: 1.c4 d5 2.Qb3 Bh3 3.gxh3 f5 4.Qxb7 Kf7 5.Qxa7 Kg6 6.f3 c5 7.Qxe7 Rxa2 8.Kf2 Rxb2 9.Qxg7+ Kh5 10.Qxg8 Rxb1 11.Rxb1 Kh4 12.Qxh8 h5 13.Qh6 Bxh6 14.Rxb8 Be3+ 15.dxe3 Qxb8 16.Kg2 Qf4 17.exf4 d4 18.Be3 dxe3.[ref]The previous record (37 ply, i.e. 18.5 moves) was held by the German composer Eduard Schildberg, and was published in the Deutsches Wochenschach in 1915.

==History of the stalemate rule==

The stalemate rule has had a convoluted history [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|p=61[/tpl]. Although today stalemate is universally recognized as a draw, for much of the game's history that has not been the case. In the forerunners to modern chess, such as Chaturanga, stalemate was a win for the side administering it [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|pp=229,267[/tpl]. This practice persisted in chess as played in early 15th-century Spain [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|p=781[/tpl]. However, Lucena (c. 1497) treated stalemate as an inferior form of victory [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|p=461[/tpl], which in games played for money won only half the stake, and this continued to be the case in Spain as late as 1600 [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|p=833[/tpl]. The rule in England from about 1600 to 1800 was that stalemate was a loss for the player administering it, a rule that the eminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray believes may have been adopted from Russian chess [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|pp=60–61,466[/tpl]. That rule disappeared in England before 1820, being replaced by the French and Italian rule that a stalemate was a drawn game [tpl]Harvcol|Murray|1913|p=391[/tpl].
Assume that Black is stalemated. Throughout history, a stalemate has at various times been:

==Proposed rule change==

Periodically, writers have argued that stalemate should again be made a win for the side causing the stalemate. Grandmaster Larry Kaufman writes, "In my view, calling stalemate a draw is totally illogical, since it represents the ultimate zugzwang, where any move would get your king taken" [tpl]harvcol|Kaufman|2009[/tpl]. The British master T. H. Tylor argued in a 1940 article in the British Chess Magazine that the present rule, treating stalemate as a draw, "is without historical foundation and irrational, and primarily responsible for a vast percentage of draws, and hence should be abolished" [tpl]harvcol|Reinfeld|1959|pp=242–44[/tpl]. Years later, Fred Reinfeld wrote, "When Tylor wrote his attack on the stalemate rule, he released about his unhappy head a swarm of peevish maledictions that are still buzzing." [tpl]harvcol|Reinfeld|1959|p=242[/tpl] Larry Evans calls the proposal to make stalemate a win for the stalemating player a "crude proposal that ... would radically alter centuries of tradition and make chess boring" [tpl]harvcol|Evans|2007|p=234[/tpl]. This rule change would cause a greater emphasis on material; an extra pawn would be a greater advantage than it is today.

===Effect on endgame theory===

If stalemate were a loss for the player unable to move, the outcome of some endgames would be affected. In some situations the superior side can force stalemate but not checkmate. In others, the defending player can use stalemate as a defensive technique to avoid losing (under the current rule). If the proposed rule change were made, both of these situations would become wins for the superior side instead of draws.

==Chess variants==

In suicide chess, stalemate is not necessarily a draw [tpl]harvcol|Alexander|1973|p=107[/tpl]. Depending on the variant, stalemate can be a draw, or a win for either the player with fewer pieces (a draw results if the players have the same number of pieces) or for the stalemated player. In xiangqi, a stalemated player loses.

==Stalemate as a metaphor==

Stalemate has become a widely used metaphor for other situations where there is a conflict or contest between two parties, such as war or political negotiations, and neither side is able to achieve victory, resulting in what is also called an impasse or deadlock or Mexican standoff. Chess writers note that this usage is a misnomer since, unlike in chess, the situation is often a temporary one that is ultimately resolved, even if it seems currently intractable [tpl]harvcol|Golombek|1977|p=304[/tpl] [tpl]harvcol|Soltis|1978|p=54[/tpl].Golombek wrote, "The word 'stalemate' has been taken into the English language to mean (wrongly) a temporary state of impasse." Soltis wrote: There is a world of difference between no choice ... and a poor choice. Editorial writers often talk about a political stalemate when the analogy they probably have in mind is a political "zugzwang". In stalemate a player has no legal moves, period. In zugzwang he has nothing pleasant to do.
