Based in Toulouse, Southern France, Les Siestes électroniques is a summer festival dedicated to emerging artists from the field of music & digital culture. Its motley line-up mainly focuses on electronic musicians and aims at a professional audience as well as the general public. The fact that its open air concerts are free of charge makes Les Siestes électroniques a rare occurrence within the landscapes of European festivals. Les Siestes offers an opportunity to experience contemporary music though concerts, club nights, workshops and sometimes exhibitions.

The festival runs for four or five days, usually starting on a Wednesday or a Thursday in the last week of June. Next edition of the festival will be held June 26-29 2014.

Les Siestes Electroniques has been an event by Rotation since 2002.
Since 2011 the festival falls into two editions. One takes place in Toulouse and the other in Paris at the Musée du quai Branly. Born of a reflection around the themes of the cultural diversity, the parisian edition proposes to musicians an exceptional access to the audio collection of the museum (dedicated to non-occidental cultures). These musicians will thus be invited to sample a set of resources of an unsuspected wealth, and then to replay it during an ultimate public event which is free and open-air
