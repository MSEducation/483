Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus (died 190-192) was a Roman consul that lived in the 2nd century and was one of the sons-in-law of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
Mamertinus came from a wealthy, well-connected family of African Roman origins possibly from Egypt. His father Marcus Petronius Mamertinus was suffect consul in 150 and his mother was an unnamed African Roman noblewoman.  He had a brother Marcus Petronius Sura Septimianus who served as consul in 190 and had a sister who had married the illustrious Roman Senator Marcus Antoninus Antius Lupus. Mamertinus was a kinsman of the Roman Grammarian Marcus Cornelius Fronto. 
During the reign of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180) and The Roman Empress Faustina the Younger (161-175), Mamertinus was betrothed to and later married Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor, one of the daughters of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger in Rome.
Sometime after 173, Cornificia Faustina bore Mamertinus a son, Petronius Antoninus. Mamertinus with his family could have been at the winter camp of Marcus Aurelius in early 180.
When Marcus Aurelius died in 180, the brother of Cornificia Faustina, Commodus succeeded her father as Roman Emperor. In 182, Mamertinus had served as consul. Between 190-192, Commodus had ordered the deaths of Mamertinus, his son, his brother and his sisterâ€™s family. Cornificia Faustina survived the political persecutions of her brother and later remarried.
