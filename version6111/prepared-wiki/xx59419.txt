Mauna Kea ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɔː|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|m|aʊ|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-haw|ˈmɔunə ˈkɛjə|lang[/tpl]) is a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. Standing [tpl]convert|13,803|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, its peak is the  highest point in the U.S. state of Hawaii. However, much of Mauna Kea is below sea level; when measured from its oceanic base, its height is [tpl]convert|10100|m|-2|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl]—more than twice Mount Everest's base-to-peak height of [tpl]convert|11980|to|15260|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl]. Mauna Kea is about one million years old, and thus hundreds of thousands of years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much smoother appearance than its neighboring volcanoes: contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones, the decentralization of its rift zones, the glaciation on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 4,600 years ago.  According to the USGS, as of January 2012, the Volcanic Alert Level is "Normal".[tpl]cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/about/volcanoes/hawaii/maunakea.php|title=Volcano Information – Mauna Kea|publisher=USGS|accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl]
In Hawaiian mythology, the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred, and Mauna Kea (which means "white mountain" in Hawaiian[tpl]cite book|last1=Pukui|first1=Mary Kawena|last2=Elbert|first2=Samuel H.|title=Hawaiian dictionary|year=1986|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=242[/tpl]) is one of the most sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking tribal chiefs to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecology. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhi[tpl]okina[/tpl]a) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.
With its high altitude, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation, and one of the most controversial. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to radio, and comprise one of the world's largest telescope facilities of their type. In April 2013, the Thirty Meter Telescope project was approved, and will be the largest telescope ever built.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Massive-telescope-to-be-built-in-Hawaii/tabid/1160/articleID/294296/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Massive telescope to be built in Hawaii| date=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Their construction on a "sacred landscape", replete with endangered species and ongoing cultural practices, continues to be a topic of debate and protest. Studies are underway to determine their effect on the summit ecology, particularly on the rare Wēkiu bug.  It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1972.[tpl]cite web|title=National Natural Landmark|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/site.cfm?Site=MAKE-HI|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=12 December 2012[/tpl]

Mauna Kea is one of five hotspot volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii, the largest and youngest island of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.[tpl]cite web|last=Watson|first=Jim|title=The long trail of the Hawaiian hotspot|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/Hawaiian.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 26, 2010|date=May 5, 1999[/tpl] Of these five volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|title=Hawaiian hotspot dynamics as inferred from Hf and Pb isotope evolution of Mauna Kea volcano|journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=4|issue=2|page=8704|author=Blichert-Toft, J.; Weis, D.; Maerschalk, C.; Agranier, A.; and Albarède, F.|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003.../2002GC000340.shtml|doi=10.1029/2002GC000340|date=February 19, 2003|accessdate=May 22, 2002|bibcode = 2003GGG.....4.8704B [/tpl] Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000 years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.
Mauna Kea is over [tpl]convert|3200|km3|cumi|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, Mauna Loa, depress the ocean crust beneath it by [tpl]convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|last=Wolfe|first=E.W.|author2=Wise, W.S.|author3=Dalrymple, G.B.|title=The geology and petrology of Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii : a study of postshield volcanism|url=http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/djvu/PP/pp_1557.djvu|series=Professional Paper 1557|year=1997|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl]
The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than [tpl]convert|0.2|mm|inch|2|abbr=on[/tpl] per year. Much of its mass lies east of its present summit.

Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea has been created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are merely the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the [tpl]convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]-long Hawaiian Ridge – Emperor Seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well-understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.[tpl]Cite book|year=1987|title=Volcanism in Hawaii: papers to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Hawaii Volcano Observatory |editor1-first=Robert W. |editor1-last=Decker |editor2-first=Thomas L. |editor2-last=Wright |editor3-first=Peter H. |editor3-last=Straffer|chapter=The Hawaiian-Emperor Volcanic Chain – Geological Evolution|publisher=Volcano Hazards Team, United States Geological Survey, United States Government Printing Office|location= Washington, D.C.|volume=1|series=Professional Paper 1350|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1987/1350/pp1350_vol1.pdf |format=PDF|page=32 |last1=Clague|first1=David A.|last2=Dalrymple|first2=G.

Lava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism.[tpl]cite web|title=Complete Report for Mauna Kea Volcano (Class B) No. 2601|url=http://gldims.cr.usgs.gov/webapps/cfusion/sites/qfault/qf_web_disp.cfm?disp_cd=C&qfault_or=5107&ims_cf_cd=cf|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 9, 2010|author1= Cannon, E.C.|author2= Bürgmann, R.Roland|date=October 26, 2009[/tpl] Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once believed to be a part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.[tpl]cite web|title=What in the world is the Hilo Ridge?|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1998/98_01_08.html|publisher=Hawaii Volcano Observatory – United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 26, 2010|date=January 8, 1998[/tpl]
The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Loa, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust.[tpl]cite journal| last = Herzberg| first = Claude| title = Petrology and thermal structure of the Hawaiian plume from Mauna Kea volcano| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7119/abs/nature05254.html| journal = Nature| publisher = Nature Publishing Group| volume = 444| issue = 7119| pages = 605–9| date = November 30, 2006| pmid = 17136091| doi = 10.1038/nature05254 |bibcode = 2006Natur.444..605H [/tpl] They are covered by the oldest exposed rock strata on Mauna Kea, the post-shield alkali basalts of the Hāmākua Volcanics, which erupted between 250,000 and 70–65,000 years ago.

The Laupāhoehoe lavas are more viscous and contain more volatiles than the earlier tholeiitic basalts; their thicker flows significantly steepened Mauna Kea's flanks. In addition, explosive eruptions have built cinder cones near the summit. These cones are the most recent eruptive centers of Mauna Kea. Its present summit is dominated by lava domes and cinder cones up to [tpl]convert|1.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and hundreds of meters tall. 
Mauna Kea is the only Hawaiian volcano with distinct evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering the formation of an ice cap.[tpl]cite web|last=Hon|first=Ken|title=GEOL205 – Fire and Ice – Mauna Kea: Lecture Notes|url=http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/~kenhon/GEOL205/glaciers/default.htm|publisher=University of Hawaii at Hilo|accessdate=September 17, 2010[/tpl] There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Pōhakuloa (180–130 ka), Wāihu (80–60 ka) and Mākanaka (40–13 ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks.

Mauna Kea is home to Lake Waiau, the highest lake in the Pacific Basin.[tpl]cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Harold Thornton|last2=Macdonald|first2=Gordon Andrew|title=Geology and ground-water resources of the island of Hawaii|series=Bulletin|volume=9|year=1946|publisher=United State Geological Survey|page=245[/tpl] At an altitude of [tpl]convert|3969|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it lies within the Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u Waiau cinder cone and is the only alpine lake in Hawaii. The lake is very small and shallow, with a surface area of [tpl]convert|0.73|ha|acre|2|abbr=on[/tpl] and a depth of [tpl]convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Radiocarbon dating of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600 years ago. Hawaiian lavas are typically permeable, preventing the formation of lakes due to infiltration. Here, either sulfur-bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low-permeability clays, or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water (phreatic eruptions) formed exceptionally fine ash that also would reduce the permeability of the lake bed.[tpl]cite web|title=Impermeable beds trap rain and snow at Mauna Kea's Lake Waiau|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2003/03_06_19.html|publisher=Hawaii Volcano Observatory – United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 9, 2010|date=June 19, 2003[/tpl]

===Future activity===

The last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago; because of this inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which is given to the extinct volcano Kohala). Twenty percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.[tpl]cite web|last=Watson|first=John|title=Lava Flow Hazard Maps: Kohala and Mauna Kea|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/maunakea-kohala.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 9, 2010|date=July 18, 1997[/tpl]
Despite its dormancy, Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again, although there would be sufficient warning to evacuate. The telescopes on Mauna Kea's summit would be the first to detect the minute amounts of deformation resulting from the volcano's swelling, acting like expensive tiltmeters. Based on previous eruptions, such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano's upper flanks and would likely produce extended lava flows, mostly of a'a, of [tpl]convert|15|-|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source. Although not likely in the next few centuries, such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|title=The next eruption of Mauna Kea|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2000/00_06_01.html|publisher=Hawaii Volcano Observatory – United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 10, 2010|date=June 5, 2000[/tpl]

==Human history==

===Native history===

The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations.[tpl]cite web|title=Final Environmental Statement for the Outrigger Telescopes Project: Volume II|url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090421000952/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archivedate=April 21, 2009|format=PDF|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 22, 2010|page=C–9|date=February 2005[/tpl] The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.[tpl]cite web|title=Culture: The First Arrivals: Native Hawaiian Uses|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/5_culture.pdf|format=PDF|work=Mauna Kea Mountain Reserve Master Plan|publisher=University of Hawaii|accessdate=August 17, 2010[/tpl]
Early settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kirch|first=Patrick V.|title=The Impact of the Prehistoric Polynesians on the Hawaiian Ecosystem|journal=Pacific Science|date=January 1982|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/406|accessdate=October 24, 2010|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press[/tpl]
The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) Rat.[tpl]cite journal|last=Athens|first=Stephen|author2=Tuggle, H.

The summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains; and Mauna Kea's summit, being the highest, is one of the most sacred. For this reason, a kapu (ancient Hawaiian law) restricted visitor rights to high-ranking tribal chiefs. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the sky father Wākea marries the earth mother Papa, giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands. In many of these genealogical myths, Mauna Kea is portrayed as the pair's first-born son. The summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the "region of the gods", a place where benevolent spirits reside. Poli[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, deity of snow, also resides there. In Hawaiian, Mauna Kea means "white mountain", a reference to its summit, which is usually snow-capped in winter.[tpl]cite web|title=Mauna Kea|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/maunakea.html|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|accessdate=August 10, 2010|last1=Doo |first1=Brandon |first2=Ken |last2= Rubin|date=February 25, 2008[/tpl] The mountain is also known as Mauna o Wākea ("Mountain of deity Wākea").[tpl]cite web|title=Visitor Information Station – Bulletin|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/bulletins.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090918034616/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/bulletins.html|archivedate=September 18, 2009|publisher=Institute for Astronomy – University of Hawaii|accessdate=August 9, 2010[/tpl]
Around AD 1100, natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt—generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions—for use in the manufacture of tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD 1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.
Lake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers. Native chiefs would  dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, to give them the strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.
This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupua[tpl]okina[/tpl]a generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupua[tpl]okina[/tpl]a of Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humu[tpl]okina[/tpl]ula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the [tpl]okina[/tpl]Ua[tpl]okina[/tpl]u (Pterodroma sandwichensis), Nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and Palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhi[tpl]okina[/tpl]a forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.

===Modern era===

The first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook, in 1778. The earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.
In 1793, cattle were brought by George Vancouver as a tribute to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended Kamehameha I, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugar plantations and houses.
The Saddle Road, named for its crossing of the saddle-shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably.
The Pohakuloa Training Area on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii. The [tpl]convert|108863|acre|ha|0|abbr=on|sing=on[/tpl] base extends from the volcano's lower flanks to [tpl]convert|2070|m|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] elevation, on state land leased to the US Army since 1956. There are 15 threatened and endangered plants, 3 endangered birds, and 1 endangered bat species in the area.
Mauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27 percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76 shrines, 4 adze manufacturing workshops, 3 other markers, 1 positively identified burial site, and 4 possible burial sites. By 2009, the total number of identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.

===Ascents===

In pre-contact times, natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as no evidence of the latter have been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.
In the early 19th century, the earliest notable recorded ascents of Mauna Kea included the following:

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the movement of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction of a road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted.[tpl]cite web|title=Recreation: Enjoying Mauna Kea's Unique Natural Resources|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/7_recreation.pdf|format=PDF|work=Mauna Kea Mountain Reserve Master Plan|publisher=Institute for Astronomy – University of Hawaii|accessdate=August 17, 2010[/tpl] Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.

==Ecology==

===Background===

Hawaii's geographical isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands).[ref]
