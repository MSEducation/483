Before becoming an MNTV affiliate, KXTS-LD was a UPN affiliate. It broadcast MyNetworkTV from September 2006 until September 2011 after the UPN and WB merger into The CW.
KXTS-LD is part of a combo of six Victoria-area television stations owned by Saga Communications, anchored by KAVU-TV. KXTS-LD, before becoming a UPN affiliate was part of the NBC network (that network is now seen on sister station KMOL-LP).
On September 12, 2011, KXTS-LD dropped MyNetworkTV completely (vowing that MyNetworkTV became a programming service in 2009 instead of a full TV network) and became the first CBS affiliate in the Victoria area.[tpl]cite web|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=CBS, Saga Launch New Affiliate in Victoria, Texas|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/472549-CBS_Saga_Launch_New_Affiliate_in_Victoria_Texas.php?rssid=20065|work=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=August 18, 2011|date=August 18, 2011[/tpl]
