It is one of six colleges in the United States sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Joseph as well as one of the sixteen institutions of higher education that form the Hudson/Mohawk Association of Colleges and Universities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/download.aspx?libitemid=38176&file=STUDENT%20HANDBOOK%202011%20-%2012%20revision%20draft%20(Repaired).pdf |title=College of Saint Rose Student Handbook 2011-12 |format=PDF |publisher=The College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 21, 2012[/tpl] The College enrolls a total of approximately 4,863 students (2,931 undergraduates and 1,932 postgraduates).
The College is broadly divided into four schools: the School of Arts and Humanities (which includes the Music, Art, and Communications Departments), the School of Mathematics and Sciences, the School of Business, and the School of Education. These schools offer a total of over 50 degrees at the certificate, undergraduate, and graduate levels.

==History==

The idea for The College of Saint Rose was conceived by Monsignor Joseph A. Delaney, the vicar-general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany in 1920. He aimed to create a Catholic college for women in the large swath of land between the two nearest Catholic colleges, those in New York City and Buffalo. With this idea in mind, Delaney contacted Sr. Blanche Rooney, a member of the local chapter of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, located in the Provincial House on Eighth Street in Troy, New York. Rooney and her sisters were conducive to the idea and, with the permission and support of Bishop Edmund F. Gibbons, bishop of Albany, Sr. Blanche Rooney, CSJ, and Monsignor Delaney purchased the William Keeler estate at 979 Madison Avenue. Upon application and granting of a provisional charter from the Board of Regents The College of Saint Rose was officially established as a Roman Catholic college for women with a liberal arts curriculum in Albany, New York on June 28, 1920.Manory, RoseMarie. Of Glory, Of Praise: A 75-Year History of The College of Saint Rose. Albany, NY: The College of Saint Rose, 1994. p. 4-5.
Its founders selected the name of Saint Rose to honor the first canonized saint in the Americas, Saint Rose of Lima. Initially, emphasis was placed on the professional training of teachers, but quickly expanded to include preparation for business and other professions.
As needs in the Albany area increased, the College expanded and revised its programs to meet those needs. An evening division was developed in 1946 to meet the needs of World War II veterans and was re-instituted in 1974 to respond to continuing education needs. In 1949, a graduate school was added to provide master’s degree programs.
Men were admitted to both the original evening and graduate divisions, and in 1969 the College became fully co-educational yet male housing was not available until the 1970s.
In 1970, the Board of Trustees was expanded to include laypersons in addition to the Sisters of Saint Joseph. At the time this expansion created a board composed of nineteen members including a president, eight sisters, and ten laypersons. With the formal transfer of control to this board, The College of Saint Rose became an independent college sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet.Manory, Of Glory, Of Praise, p. 147

==Campus==

===Pine Hills Campus===

The main campus of The College of Saint Rose is located in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany, New York, the capital city of New York State. The 46-acre campus is bounded by Western Avenue to the north, Partridge Street to the east, Morris Street to the south, and Main Avenue to the west, although there is college property north of Western and east of Partridge. Because of the College's urban location all new expansion of the main Pine Hills campus' footprint occurs either through acquisition of existing structuresHalligan, Lauren (February 14, 2012) [tpl]cite web |url=http://strosechronicle.com/wordpress/new-guesthouse-announced-other-properties-acquired/ |title=New Guesthouse Announced, Other Properties Acquired |publisher=The Chronicle at the College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl]  Vl. 80, Issue 22 or demolition and construction of new structures.Benjamin, Ian and Branfalt, TG, Jr. (June 18, 2011) [tpl]cite web |url=http://strosechronicle.com/wordpress/construction-of-centennial-hall-begins-with-deconstruction/ |title=Construction of Centennial Hall Begins with Deconstruction |publisher=The Chronicle at the College of Saint Rose  |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl] Vl. 80, Issue 1 Over the years the College has gradually acquired many of the Victorian-era homes adjacent to the main campus. Many of these structures, most of which are located on Partridge St. and Western and Madison avenues, have been converted into offices and student housing. The slow expansion of the College into the surrounding neighborhood has occasionally led to conflict with local neighborhood and historic conservation associations.Benjamin, Ian (March 2, 2011) [tpl]cite web|url=http://issuu.com/thesaintrosechronicle/docs/chroniclemarch2#download |title=At Common Council Community in Favor of New Dorm |publisher=The Chronicle at The College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl] Vl. 79, Issue 19Carleo-Evangelist, Jordan (November 4, 2012) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/College-expansion-concerns-neighbors-798553.php |title=College expansion concerns neighbors |publisher=Times Union |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl] Some of this conflict is due to the College's status as a not-for-profit organization in New York State which, as such, is exempt from paying property taxes in the city of Albany.
The first college building was 979 Madison Avenue, a large Victorian-era house that was acquired by the College in 1920 and served as the only College building during the 1920-1921 academic year. The house was known as Saint Rose Hall up until 1970, when the name was changed to Moran Hall in honor of Sister John Joseph Moran. The building is currently occupied by the Alumni Relations office and faculty offices of the History and Political Science Department.>Hubert, Brian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.strose.edu/archives_buildingHistories |title=Building Histories |publisher=The College of Saint Rose Archives and Special Collections |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl]
Albertus Hall, at 432 Western Avenue, is one of the major academic facilities on the campus, housing the many of the classes during the academic year. The brick, steel and stone building was designed by Frank J. Morgan with the aim of creating classroom, laboratory and administrative space for the College. Construction of the building commenced in 1932 and finished in 1933. Renovations in 2006 gave the building its current interior, and also added seven new classrooms among other changes. It is connected to the Science Center (993 Madison Avenue) through shared hallways.
St. Joseph's Hall is a four-story English brick building with limestone trim fronted by six Corinthian columns. It is located at 985 Madison Avenue between the Science Center to the west and Moran Hall to the east. The structure was built in 1922 at a cost of half a million dollars due to a need for classroom and dining space to house the growing student body. As the first academic building constructed specifically for the College, St. Joseph Hall originally auditorium, classrooms, chapel, dormitory, a dining area, and kitchens in the basement.Manory, Of Glory, Of Praise, P. 7-8 Since its construction the auditorium has held and continues to hold campus events including visiting professors, club-sponsored events, and awards ceremonies. The campus chapel was previously located on the third and fourth floors, but that space is currently occupied by numerous campus offices. Specifically, the third floor is now home to the Career Center and the Student Support Center, the latter of which includes the Bursar's, Golden Knights Card Services, and the Office of Financial Aid. Likewise, the Office of the Registrar is located on the fourth floor, beside several other offices.
The primary social, dining, and restaurant center on at Saint Rose is the Events and Athletics Center (EAC), located at 420 Western Avenue. The eastern side of the EAC houses athletic facilities including the Daniel P. Nolan Gymnasium, the Robert Bellizzi Fitness Center, locker rooms, and a four lane swimming pool. The western side contains social and dining facilities such as the Main Dining Room, the Camelot Room, a Starbucks, the Commuter Lounge, the Campus Book Store, the Mail Room and Copy Center, as well as the Offices of Student Affairs, Physical Education, Athletics, Dining Services, the Student Association (SA), and the Student Events Board (SEB).
The Massry Center for the Arts features the Kathleen McManus Picotte Recital Hall, the Esther Massry Gallery, and the William Randolph Hearst Music Wing. This building serves as the primary venue for concerts and exhibitions by the College’s students and faculty, and a performance and exhibition space for artists, musicians, vocalists and orchestras.
It is one of the college's most recent and major attempts at building green. Some of the green features of the Massry Center are:
In 1994, the College discussed the need to build a new "sacred space" for the college community. Considering the changes that had occurred at Saint Rose and in the world since 1920, the College decided to build an interfaith space. This space was christened the Hubbard Interfaith Sanctuary
On the northwestern side of the Sanctuary is the Catholic Christian prayer room. This space celebrates the College's heritage as a Roman Catholic College. There are visible stained glass windows from a residence hall on campus that once housed a community of Christian Brothers. On the northeastern side of the Sanctuary there is interfaith prayer room. The prayer books of the major non-Christian traditions are here. Members of the College  community from the Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist and Muslim traditions can go there for private prayer. The room faces east toward Mecca and Jerusalem for Muslim and Jewish prayer. Prayer rugs are available for Muslim prayer.
The Saint Rose Campus Theatre at 996A Madison Avenue (behind 1000 Madison Avenue) once housed the third and fourth grades of Vincentian CCD and the building was called "The Barn." Also, the parking lot behind the Massry Center was once the football practice field for Vincentian Institute.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Student Housing===

Students choosing to attend The College of Saint Rose have a variety of housing options from which to pick. Available choices depend upon the number of preferred roommates, preferred housing, and class status.
The Office of Residence Life makes all room assignments. Prior to move-in, all residents are required to pay a room deposit fee: for first year and transfer students the fee is paid upon acceptance; for returning students a higher fee is paid prior to the room reservation deadline. In addition, the College requires that all prospective residents review and choose to abide by the Residence Hall Occupancy Agreement. This form prohibits certain behaviors, all pets (excluding fish in 10 gallon tanks or less), and includes numerous standard stipulations. One of the provisions in the Agreement allows the College to make use of resident's rooms during vacation periods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/download.aspx?libitemid=3517&file=term%20and%20conditions.doc |title=2009-2010 Residence Hall Occupancy Agreement Further Terms and Conditions |format=doc |publisher=The College of Saint Rose Office of Residence Life |accessdate=July 21, 2012[/tpl] The College employs a lottery system for housing assignments. The type of lottery system used differs depending upon whether the prospective resident is a first-year, returning, transfer, or graduate-level student. Prospective residents can choose from singles, doubles, suite-style living, or apartments. Due to increased demand some years for a limited supply of residencies the College occasionally turns some standard freshman doubles into forced triples to compensate for a high number of resident applicants. As at many colleges, every student that moves into a College residence is provided with a bed, desk, chair, dresser, and wardrobe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/officesandresources/residence_life/article1189 |title=First Year Student Housing Assignment |publisher=The College of Saint Rose Office of Residence Life |accessdate=July 21, 012[/tpl]

===Safety and Security===

The campus employs a Security force that is on-call twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. Although headquartered in the Security Office at 340 Western Avenue, at the corner of Partridge Street and Western Avenue, Security officers can often be spotted making continuous rounds of the campus grounds. In addition to the main office, Security desks are maintained in the largest student residences—Lima, Brubacher, and Centennial Hall. Additional desks are manned throughout the campus when the College is in session.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/officesandresources/campus_security |title=Department of Safety and Security |publisher=College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl] Security officers also provide traffic and parking enforcement; a 24 hours a day, seven days a week escort service to students and staff upon request; as well as evening bus transportation for students living in Brubacher Hall or studying in Picotte Hall.Manory, Of Glory, Of Praise, p. 231.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/officesandresources/residence_life/article800 |title=Picotte and Brubacher Shuttle Service |publisher=The College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl]
Although the Saint Rose campus is open during classes, residence halls can only be—at any time—accessed by students with appropriate electronic identification cards. Security cameras are mounted along the outside of many of the residence halls, as well as in all major stairwells. The security cameras are monitored live by the college's Security officers. All residence halls are also equipped with hardwired fire detectors and sprinklers.
Per the Clery Act of 1998, campus Security prepares a report each year that is released on the College website on October 1. The Security Report for 2010 found that there were 146 liquor law violations, 26 drug law violations, 2 aggravated assaults, 15 burglaries, 1 motor vehicle theft, 1 arson, and 3 robberies on campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strose.edu/officesandresources/campus_security/safetyreportandcleryact |title=The College of Saint Rose Campus Safety Report 2010 |publisher=The College of Saint Rose |accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl] The report included violations which  occurred in on-campus or off-campus facilities, in property owned or controlled by the College, or on public property within or immediately adjacent to the campus.

==Environmental Policies==

===Sustainability House===

The College of Saint Rose, in conjunction with other Capital Region colleges and universities, signed a pact to reduce their carbon footprint and continue to pursue environmentally friendly policies.
In spring of 2009 McCormick Hall was established as the Sustainability House. The dormitory aimed to reduce its carbon footprint through decreasing electrical usage by unplugging unused appliances and forgoing use of personal refrigerators in favor of a standard kitchen refrigerator, among other sustainable practices.
