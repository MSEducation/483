Aynho Junction is a railway junction in Northamptonshire, England, a few miles south of [tpl]rws|Banbury[/tpl]. The junction is a flying junction, with the down line from [tpl]stnlnk|Bicester North[/tpl] grade separated from the up and down lines from [tpl]stnlnk|Oxford[/tpl]. The junction is the point where the Great Western Railway's New North Main Line of 1910 ends. This line is also known as the Bicester cut-off line. Until closure by British Railways in 1963 Aynho Park railway station stood close to the junction on the new line. On the old line Aynho for Deddington railway station was closed the following year.

==Train services==

Today it is the point where Chiltern Railways' services to [tpl]stnlnk|Birmingham Snow Hill[/tpl] join the same route used by First Great Western's services to Banbury, CrossCountry services between [tpl]stnlnk|Reading[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|Birmingham New Street[/tpl] and freight traffic.

==Signalling==

Until the resignalling scheme in 1992, which transferred control to Banbury South signal box, the junction was controlled by Aynho Junction signal box. This was located between the down lines from Oxford and Bicester North. The signal box was decommissioned in 1992 and eventually demolished ten years later.

==Planned upgrade==

Despite the improvements that occurred with the re-doubling of the Aynho to Bicester section, there remain some concerns over the relative low speed limits on the Chiltern Line. During this re-signalling the up main line speeds were raised to [tpl]convert|90|mph|km/h[/tpl] and a new control panel was fitted to Banbury South signal box. The existing layout is planned to be improved as part of the Chiltern Railways Evergreen 3 upgrade.
