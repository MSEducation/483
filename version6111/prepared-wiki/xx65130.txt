"furnace") is sometimes translated as Forno, meaning furnace in Italian.

===Climate===

===Rugova Mountains===

Rugova is a mountain region located in the North-West of the city of Peja. It is the third region of “Bjeshkët e Nemuna” (The Cursed Mountains), also known as The Albanian Alps. In 2013 it was announced as a National Park by the Parliament of Republic of Kosovo.
Rugova is an ethnographic region,[tpl]citation|title=Fjalor enciklopedik shqiptar|year=1958|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave e RPSSH|publication-place=Tiranë, Shqipëri|page=9[/tpl] with a great importance for the literary branches such as lexicology, etymology and onomastics. Rugova is a suitable region for hiking, skiing, mountaineering, paragliding, picnics, etc.
It was ranked as the fourth most important center for winter sports by the International Ski Federation (ISF) with the base in Lucerne. Furthermore, in April 2013, Peja won the award of “Tourism for Tomorrow” for the project “Peaks of the Balkans”.www.wttc.org
Rugova is rich with many landform elements such as caves, waterfalls, glacial lakes, high peaks, tunnels, etc. The highest peak is Hajla (2403 m), however "Qafa e Qyqes" (Cuchoo's Neck) also has an equal importance, because one can observe the whole city of Peja from it. From Guri i Kuq (1522 m) we can also observe places such as: Gjeravica, Boriqe (Three border region), Maja e Mariashit (Peak of Mariashi), Maja e Hekurave (Iron Peak), Shkëlzeni and the lake of Plava. Volujaku is also a high peak (2014 m).

==Education==

Education in Peja is a system with no tuition fees, mandatory for all children between the ages of 6-18. It consists of a nine-year basic comprehensive school (starting at age six and ending at the age of fifteen) secondary general and professional education commonly known as high school and higher education (University). It also includes non-mandatory daycare programs for babies and toddlers and a one-year "preschool". The school year runs from early September to late June of the following year. Winter break runs from late December to early January, dividing the school year into two semesters. Peja is the only city in Kosovo that offers high school education in arts and general education for the visually impaired.

==History==

The city is located in a strategic position on the Pećka Bistrica river, a tributary of the White Drin to the east of the Prokletije. The city was known as Pescium during the Roman era; or as reported by Ptolemy in his Geography, Siparantum.
Between 1180 and 1190, Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja conquered Peć with its surrounding župa (district) of Hvosno from the Byzantine Empire, thus establishing Serbian rule over the city of Peć for next 300 years.John VA Fine,The Late Medieval Balkans, p.7 at In 1220, Serbian King Stefan Nemanjić donated Peć and several surrounding villages to his newly founded monastery of Žiča.F.Miklosich,Monumenta Serbica,Viennae 1858, p.11 at As Žiča was the seat of a Serbian archbishop, Peć came under direct rule of Serbian archbishops and later patriarchs who built their residences and numerous churches in the city starting with the church of Holy Apostles built by archbishop Saint Arsenije I Sremac. After the Žiča monastery was burned by the Cumans (between 1276 and 1292) the seat of Serbian archbishop was transferred to a more secure location in Peć where it remained until the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1766.
The city became a major religious center of medieval Serbia under the Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan, who made it the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1346. It retained this status until 1766, when the Patriarchate of Peć was abolished. Today, Peć holds the Patriarchate of Serbia. The city and its surrounding area are still revered by adherents of Serbian Orthodoxy; the city is the site of the patriarchal monastery, which stands above the city and consists of four fresco-decorated churches, a library, and a treasury. The 14th century Visoki Dečani monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, lies about [tpl]convert|19|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south, in nearby Dečani.
Peć was captured by the Ottomans in 1455,[tpl]cite book|title=Prilozi za orijentalnu filologiju: Revue de philologie orientale, Volume 37|year=1988|publisher=Orijentalni institut u Sarajevu|location=Sarajevo|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c05pAAAAMAAJ&dq=turci+osvojili+pe%C4%87+1455&q=%22Poslije+pada+juznih+dijelova+Despotovine+pod+osmansku+vlast+1455.+godine%22#search_anchor|accessdate=1 August 2011|page=174|quote=Poslije pada juznih dijelova Despotovine pod osmansku vlast 1455. godine, oba sjedista srpske patrijarsije, Peć i Ziča više nisu bili pod srpskom vlašću[/tpl] and underwent major changes under their rule, including a change of name to Ipek. After the Ottoman Empire captured Peć the Sanjak of İpek was established with Mahmut Pasha Dukagjini as its first sanjakbey (lord).[tpl]cite book|last=Altimari|first=Francesco|title=Albanci|year=1984|publisher=Cankarjeva založba|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=Dh03TsqSBcOdOpr22fEL&ct=result&id=HNJBAAAAYAAJ&dq=Sanjak+of+Dukagjin&q=%22Mahmut+pa%C5%A1a+Dukagjini%22#search_anchor|coauthors=Janez Stanič|accessdate=1 August 2011|page=41|language=Slovenian|quote=Z zavzetjem Peči je bil ustanovjjen du- kagjinski sandžak s sedežem v Peči, za sandžakbega pa postavljen Mahmut paša Dukagjini.[/tpl] The Sanjak of Dukagjin had four kazas: Peć, Đakovica, Gusinje and Berane.[tpl]cite book|last=Samardžić|first=Radovan|title=Istorija srpskog naroda: pt. 1.

It also gained an Islamic character with the construction of a number of mosques, many of which still remain. One of these is the Bajrakli Mosque, built by the Ottomans in the 15th century and located in the center of the city.
The city increased its political importance through the League of Peja, established in 1899 by Albanian patriots led by Haxhi Zeka. The League inherited the traditions and character of the League of Prizren to defend the rights of the Albanians and give them autonomous status within the Ottoman Empire. After an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces in 1900 the League ended its operations.Bep Jubani et al., Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme (Libri Shkollor: Pristina, 2002) 182-185.
The 500 years of Ottoman rule came to an end in the First Balkan War of 1912-1913, when Montenegro took control of the city. In the late 1915, during World War I, Austria-Hungary took the city. Peć was retaken in October 1918. After World War I, the city became part of Yugoslavia (at first officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes). Between 1931 and 1941 the city was part of Zeta Banovina. During the World War II Peć was occupied by Albania. After the war, Peć again became part of Yugoslavia as part of Kosovo and Metohija, an autonomous province within the People's Republic of Serbia.
Relations between Serbs and Albanians, who were the majority population, were often tense during the 20th century. They came to a head in the Kosovo War of 1999, during which the city suffered heavy damage and mass killings.Crimes Of War, Time Magazine, June 28, 1999 More than 80 percent of the total 5280 houses in the city were heavily damaged (1590) or destroyed (2774).HRW report It suffered further damage in violent inter-ethnic unrest in 2004.

==Economy==

The economy was inevitably badly affected by the war, but historically it has centered on agricultural activities and craftworks produced by the city's traditional craftsmen—coppersmiths, goldsmiths, slipper makers, leather tanners, saddle makers, etc.
Kosovo Railways serve Pejë railway station.

==Tourism==

Peć has undeveloped tourist areas such as the Rugova Canyon and Rugova Mountains. Skiing is possible in the mountains nearby.

===Peja Bath===

Peja Bath is a township located in the municipality of Istog, Kosovo. To many people it is known with the name Ilixhe. It is a touristic-health center with services in Istog and in the region, offering quality for inhabitation, highly developed infrastructure and every service needed for living.PLANI ZHVILLIMOR URBAN I SUB QENDRËS—BANJË

==Culture==

===Architecture===

The architecture of Peja describes a large mixture of architectural structures which are a reflection of the influential foreign rule all across the city. The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were build with an architectural influence of the Byzantine architecture, Serbo-Byzantine architecture, Ottoman architecture, Stalinist architecture (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The foreign rule of the Otoman and Serbian empires and the historical influence of former Yugoslavia (Communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures.
