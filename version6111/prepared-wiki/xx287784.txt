The 1937–38 NBL season was the inaugural season of the National Basketball League (NBL).  This league is the evolution of the Midwest Basketball Conference Championship, a league that had a duration of two years before becoming the NBL.  The league launched with 9 franchises, it was irregular because the teams were the ones that had to chose the day and the hour of the match, even the duration (4 quarters of 10 minutes or 3 parts of 15 minutes) was chosen by the local team before the match. The season ended with the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots becoming the NBL's first champions.
