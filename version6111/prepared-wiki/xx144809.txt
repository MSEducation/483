The Agua Caliente Casino is a gambling facility, run by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, in Rancho Mirage, California. The facility has over [tpl]convert|45000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of gambling floor. The casino completed a 16-story, [tpl]convert|173|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] hotel tower which opened on April 18, 2008. The tower is the second-tallest building in the Inland Empire.
The paved and landscaped parking lot on the property was, nearly 40 years before, a sandy patch of desert, across which Jonathan Winters drove a moving van, in the film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
The Agua Caliente Band also runs the Spa Resort and Casino in nearby Palm Springs, California.
