Located in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii, the Izumo Taishakyo Mission is one of the few Shinto shrines in the United States. The wooden A-frame structure was inspired by Shimane Prefecture's classical Japanese shrine Taisha Machi. It was designed by architect Hego Fuchino and built by master carpenter Ichisaburo Takata.
The primary kami of this shrine is Ōkuninushi, and the Hiroshima Peace Bell is on view.
Seized by the city at the outset of World War II, the shrine did not reopen until 1968.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The shrine is the site of Shintoists' annual New Year's Day hatsumōde.
