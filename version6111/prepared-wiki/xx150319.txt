==History Behind the Name==

"The name goes back to about 1988, where in college Stefan & Henrik came up with the plan to make some music. So we did... with an Atari ST and a DX21 and DX7. Of course only one of the two could hack on the machine, so the other would have to do something else - in our case that was reading magazines. Stefan at the time was much into history, reading about the Vietnam war... he regularly bought a mag called "NAM" which was about this war. As we would alternate in reading and working, this became the first part of the name: NamNam.
The 'Bulu' has a totally different background. As we would use to go for a beer every now and then, we picked the BULU from an engraving that you could find on Swiss beer glasses from 'Cardinal' beer, just saying 3dl / BULU. What BULU means exactly, we have no clue, but we added it to the band name. There you go: NamNamBulu.
Well.... NNB never got far back then. Stefan made some instrunmental pieces, that I might still find on a MD (Minidisk) somewhere. But it wasn't until I met Vasi, that we picked up the name again - even though it might sound a bit funny still :).
By picking a band name away from the commonly used terminology, NNB is trying to avoid being stuck in a cliché, which would prevent the band from evolving in any musical direction that it might find applicable."
