Van Diemen's Land was the original name used by most Europeans for the island of Tasmania, now part of Australia. The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman was the first European to land on the shores of Tasmania.  Landing at Blackman's Bay and later having the Dutch flag flown at North Bay, Tasman named the island Anthoonij van Diemenslandt in honour of Anthony van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies who had sent Tasman on his voyage of discovery in 1642. Between 1772 and 1798 only the southeastern portion of the island was visited. Tasmania was not known to be an island until Matthew Flinders and George Bass circumnavigated it in the Norfolk in 1798-99.  
In 1803, the island was colonised by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen's Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Major-General Ralph Darling was appointed Governor of New South Wales In 1825, and in the same year he visited Hobart Town, and on December 3 proclaimed the establishment of the independent colony, of which he actually became Governor for three days.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29213910 |title=150TH ANNIVERSARY OF AUSTRALIA. |newspaper=The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954) |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=26 January 1938 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The demonym for Van Diemen's Land was 'Van Diemonian', though contemporaries used the spelling Vandemonian, perhaps in reference to the Tasmanian Devil, or possibly as a play on words relating to the colony's penal origins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Vandemonian |title=Vandemonian - definition of Vandemonian by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07[/tpl]
In 1856 the colony was granted responsible self-government with its own representative parliament, and the name of the island and colony was officially changed to Tasmania on 1 January 1856.Newman, Terry Becoming Tasmania.

==Penal colony==

From the 1800s to the 1853 abolition of penal transportation (known simply as "transportation"), Van Diemen's Land was the primary penal colony in Australia. Following the suspension of transportation to New South Wales, all transported convicts were sent to Van Diemen's Land. In total, some 75,000 convicts were transported to Van Diemen's Land, or about 40% of all convicts sent to Australia.
Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women's workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen's Land.
Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen's Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne. 
Tensions sometimes ran high between the settlers and the "Vandemonians" as they were termed, particularly during the Victorian gold rush when a flood of settlers from Van Diemen's Land rushed to the Victorian gold fields. 
Complaints from Victorians about recently released convicts from Van Diemen's Land re-offending in Victoria was one of the contributing reasons for the eventual abolition of transportation to Van Diemen's Land in 1853.Fletcher, B.

==Name==

Anthony Trollope used the term Vandemonian: -quoted by Patsy Adam Smith p.248 of Smith, Patsy Adam and Woodberry, Joan (1977)Historic Tasmania Sketchbook Rigby ISBN 0-7270-0286-4
  They are (the Vandemonians) united in their declaration that the cessation of the coming of convicts has been their ruin 
Eventually, in order to remove the unsavoury connotations with crime associated with its name (and its homophonic connection to "demon"), in 1856 Van Diemen's Land was renamed Tasmania in honour of Abel Tasman. The last penal settlement in Tasmania at Port Arthur finally closed in 1877.Australian Government, National Heritage site. Port Arthur Historic Site
The term is not used much, but in a review of a new book of the era the Australian newspaper chose the title of the review as Vandemonian vanity.Pybus, Cassandra (2008) review of Van Diemans Land] by James Boyce  – page 19 of the Australian Literary Review 2 April 2008.
