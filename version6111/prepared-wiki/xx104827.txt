The Allan Memorial Institute (AMI; also known colloquially as "The Allan") is located on the slope of Mount Royal by McGill University's campus in what was then the Golden Square Mile in Montreal, Quebec. It is named in memory of Sir Hugh Allan, whose former mansion, Ravenscrag, it occupies.
The Institute houses the Psychiatry Department of the Royal Victoria Hospital, part of the McGill University Health Centre. Although currently a respected psychiatric hospital, the Institute is also known for its darker role in the CIA's Project MKUltra, an initiative to develop drug-induced mind control. MKUltra experimentation was undertaken in the Institute between 1957 and 1964 by its founding director Donald Ewen Cameron.
