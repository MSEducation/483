==History==

In January 2006 the Sony BMG Strategic Marketing Group (SMG) announced the launch of its new record label, Burgundy Records."Burgundy records launches" Mixonline.com The new Sony BMG SMG imprint label, which was spearheaded by former Executive Vice President Joe DiMuro, now run by J.J. Rosen, previously an executive in Sony BMG's Digital Business Group, is set to sign multi-platinum artists and release new titles in conjunction with marketing campaigns that will promote the artists through traditional and non-traditional channels. Burgundy's first artists signed were musicians Chaka Khan and Aaron Neville.http://www.top40-charts.net/news.php?nid=20024&string=bmg
Burgundy Records is set to sign additional artists who have retained strong consumer affinity and produced a catalog of music that is still relevant and appreciated today. The label's primary target audience will be adult consumers who are fans of the artists' earlier work and are eager to hear new material. In tandem with this outreach to a loyal consumer base, the label will also bring widespread exposure for these artists and their new music to a contemporary audience.
Central to every project executed by SMG is the concept of a "360-Degree Approach." By operating like an agency, the Group analyzes artists from different angles and promotes them through a variety of channels, such as licensing, strategic partnerships, mobile applications, DRTV, tour marketing and publicity.http://www.top40-charts.net/news.php?nid=20024&string=bmg
As of January 2010, Burgundy Records may have been discontinued, since its official website is redirected to Legacy Recordings' website. But in the beginning Burgundy Records was formerly owned by C Henry Lewis before he passed away before the 21st century and other companies took the name of Burgundy Records.
