The Unvanquished ([tpl]lang-fr|L'Insoumis[/tpl], literally "Missing without leave")http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058232/ is a 1964 film noir directed by Alain Cavalier and starring Alain Delon opposite Lea Massari.[tpl]cite web|author=Neil Coffey |url=http://www.french-linguistics.co.uk/dictionary/ |title=French Dictionary |publisher=French-linguistics.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-07[/tpl]filmsdefrance.com Quote: It also features Alain Delon at his near best, bringing pathos and humanity to a typically hard man role. and It was Alain Delon’s first real taste of failure. and The experience was not an entirely happy one – Delon sustained a number of physical injuries whilst making the film, the censors insisted on a number of cuts which compromised the film’s artistic integrity, and, on its release, the film received a distinctly lukewarm reception.  It was Alain Delon’s first real taste of failure. The film’s subject matter may have been to blame for its less than stunning box office receipts.  The Algerian War had dragged on for so long that virtually everyone in France was fed up with it and the outcome of the conflict was a humiliating defeat for a proud nation. The film's background is the Algerian War and Alain Delon plays Thomas Vlassenroot, a deserter of the French Foreign Legion in Algeria during the 1961 uprising.New York Times review Quote: In this drama that alludes to the Algerian War with France of the 1960s, Thomas (Alain Delon) is a deserter from the French Foreign Legion who is on the run from authorities. When a former lieutenant who now works for the OAS proposes to him to kidnap lawyer Dominique Servet (played by Massari), who is in Algiers to defend some Algerian nationalists, Thomas agrees. However Thomas falls in love with Dominique and helps her escape back to France. In doing so he comes into inevitable conflict with his OAS colleagues who subsequently hunt them down. The film was not a completely happy experience for Alain Delon. He sustained physical injuries while filming and the reception of the picture by the French public was not good probably because it reminded the French of their defeat in the Algerian war while the censors insisted on a number of cuts which compromised the artistic integrity of the film. Alain Delon along with Georges Beaume were the two producers of the film. Despite Alain Delon's great performance, the film is considered his first failure.

==Synopsis==

Thomas Vlassenroot, a citizen of Luxembourg, after his divorce, decides to enlist in the French Foreign Legion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cinema-francais.fr/les_films/films_c/films_cavalier_alain/l_insoumis.htm |title=cinema-francais.fr |publisher=cinema-francais.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-07[/tpl]  He is posted to Algeria but during the 1961 uprising he becomes disllusioned and deserts. While in hiding he receives a visit from his former lieutenant played by Georges Géret, who is also a defector but now works for the OAS, a group opposing Algerian independence. Lieutenant Fraser entices Thomas to join the OAS and also to take part in a plan to kidnap lawyer Dominique Servet by promising him enough money to enable him to return to his home in Luxembourg. Dominique Servet is in Algiers defending Algerian nationalists in court and this has made her a target. Thomas soon finds himself conflicted as he falls in love with his prisoner and helps her escape back to France. While Dominique finally escapes and goes back to France alone, Thomas  gets injured during a fight with another OAS member and makes a difficult trip back home. While in France he takes the train back to his hometown but during a stop in Lyon he disembarks because he needs to see Dominique again. He finds her at her home and she nurses him when she discovers how badly injured he is but his enemies are not far behind and finally track him down and they threaten both of them with death. In the ensuing confrontation he escapes and Dominique drives him in her Citroën DS. On the way back to his home they go through roadblocks, get shot at and finally with the help of Dominique's understanding husband he finally crosses the road to Luxembourg and reaches his farm. He enters his home and finds his little girl sitting at the table. He finally collapses on the floor from his unattended wounds and dies while passing his hand over his face as if to close his eyes. Dominique still waiting outside the fence cries out his name. The film closes on a silent black screen with Thomas Vlassenroot's name and dates of birth and death.
