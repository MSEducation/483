==Compilation Released Without Ashanti‘s Consent==

The tapes resurfaced in September 2004 and was re-mixed and mastered by Genard Parker and Ernie Lake.[tpl]cite web | url=http://24hourhiphop.com/ | title=Ashanti "Can't Stop" | author=GMajor | accessdate=2011-02-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~mroyen/News/2006/News_February_5_2006.htm | title=Ashanti Files Lawsuit Over Early Demos | date=2006-02-05 | accessdate=2011-02-06[/tpl]
Ashanti claims she recorded the material for demo-shopping purposes and never intended the recordings to be released to the public.  
 "I was just a teenager following my dreams when I signed with Parker. Me and my mother went to his house to work on some songs hoping to launch my career. Genard couldn't deliver for me and he signed a release permitting me to go to another record company."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.blastro.com/news/ashanti-sued-for-millions.html | title=Ashanti Sued For Millions | author=Gregory, E. | date=2006-09-19 | accessdate=2011-02-06[/tpl] 
Further, on two of the tracks she only sings background vocals, while on another she is not performing at all. 
Ashaniti filed suit to stop distribution.  In addition to Genard Parker (and possibly Ernie Lake), Big Records Australia, Farm Records, Unique Corp., Simply Vinyl, Team Entertainment, ZYX Music and others are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The album has a street date of February 21, 2005.

==Further Lawsuits==

Genard Parker, sued Ashanti for breach of contract and the jury awarded $630,000. When Ashanti got a record deal, he let her out of the contract she signed with him, with the understanding that he'd get to produce some songs for her and earn royalties. Although the jury took Parker’s side, they didn’t give him everything he asked for. He had sued Ashanti for $2.2 million.[tpl]cite web | url=http://wedr.com/features/dadirtjul05.html | title=Ashanti Ordered to Pay Up | author=Supa Cindy | date=2005-07-22 | accessdate=2011-02-06[/tpl]
Of the $630,000 awarded by the jury, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected all but $50,000 of the award on the grounds that the jurors did not have adequate facts to determine damages so they were left to speculate.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hiphoparea.com/news/ashanti-settles-contract-case.html | title=Ashanti Settles Contract Case | accessdate=2011-02-06[/tpl]
