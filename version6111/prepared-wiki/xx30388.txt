Bornholm disease's or epidemic pleurodynia or epidemic myalgia[tpl]cite journal |author=HOPKINS JH |title=Bornholm disease |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=4664 |pages=1230–2 |date=May 1950 |pmid=15420445 |pmc=2038054 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4664.1230|url=[/tpl] is a disease caused by the Coxsackie B virus or other viruses.[tpl]DorlandsDict|six/000083496|epidemic pleurodynia[/tpl]
It is named after the Danish island Bornholm where early cases occurred.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side.[tpl]cite journal |author=WARIN JF, DAVIES JB, SANDERS FK, VIZOSO AD |title=Oxford epidemic of Bornholm disease, 1951 |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=4824 |pages=1345–51 |date=June 1953 |pmid=13042253 |pmc=2016648 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4824.1345|url=[/tpl] The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike "out of the blue" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as 'The Devil's grip' (see also "other names" below) reflect this symptom.

==Cause==

Inoculation of throat washings taken from people with pleurodynia into the brains of newborn mice revealed that enteroviruses in the Coxsackie B virus group were likely to be the cause of pleurodynia,[tpl]cite journal |author=WELLER TH, ENDERS JF, BUCKINGHAM M, FINN JJ |title=The etiology of epidemic pleurodynia: a study of two viruses isolated from a typical outbreak |journal=J.

==Epidemiology==

Coxsackie B virus is spread by contact and epidemics usually occur during warm weather in temperate regions and at any time in the tropics. As is typical with this virus family, it is shed in large amounts in the feces of infected persons.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chong AY, Lee LH, Wong HB |title=Epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) outbreak in Singapore.

==Treatment and prognosis==

The illness lasts about a week and is rarely fatal. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles.  Relapses during the weeks following the initial episode are a characteristic feature of this disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vogelsang TM |title=The occurrence of Bamble Disease (epidemic pleurodynia) in Norway |journal=Med Hist |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=86–90 |date=January 1967 |pmid=5341038 |pmc=1033670 |doi= |url=[/tpl]

==History==

In 1872, Daae-Finsen reported an epidemic of "acute muscular rheumatism" occurring in a community called Bamble, giving rise to the name "Bamble disease" in Norway.  Subsequent reports, published only in Norwegian, referred to the disease by this name.  In 1933, Ejnar Sylvest gave a doctoral thesis describing a Danish outbreak of this disease on Bornholm Island entitled, "Bornholm disease-myalgia epidemica", and this name has persisted.

==Other names==

It is also known as Bamble disease, the devil's grip, devil's grippe, epidemic myalgia, epidemic pleurodynia, epidemic transient diaphragmatic spasm or The Grasp of the Phantom.
