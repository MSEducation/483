Travis Wade Kvapil ([tpl]IPAc-en |ˈ|k|w|ɑː|p|ə|l[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KWAH|pəl[/tpl]) (born March 1, 1976 in Janesville, Wisconsin[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/news/headlines/cup/kvapil.bio/|title=Travis Kvapil's Biography|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-06-18[/tpl]) is an American stock car racing driver. He competes in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driving the No. 32 Ford for Go FAS Racing, and in the Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 50 Chevrolet for MAKE Motorsports.

==Early career==

Kvapil grew up working on cars in his father’s garage, and racing was a natural progression for the Wisconsin native. Kvapil began racing in 1992 at the age of 16 at Rockford Speedway, competing in the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series. He went on to win the American Short Tracker division track championship in 1994 at Rockford.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.wirace.com/news.html|title=Rockford Speedway is a "NASCAR home track"|last=Ramsell|first=Kevin|publisher=wirace.come|date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl]  In 1995, he moved up to super late models at Madison International Speedway, ‘Wisconsin’s Fastest Half-Mile,” and was named the track Rookie of the Year. He also became the track’s Late Model Champion a year later in 1996. This honor made Kvapil the youngest to ever capture the title at the track at the age of 20.
Kvapil moved to the ARTGO Series, a Midwest asphalt short-track motor-racing touring series. He finished in the top-10 in points from 1998-2000.

In 2002, Kvapil managed to match his win total by winning the O’Reilly Auto Parts 200 at Memphis Motorsports Park. He finished the season with 14 top-10s and finished ninth in the final driver points standings.
Funding issues at Addington caused Kvapil to switch to the No. 16 IWX MotorFreight Chevrolet for Steve Coulter's Xpress Motorsports team in 2003. He won one race during the season at Bristol Motor Speedway for the O'Reilly 200 presented by Valvoline Maxlife.

Kvapil came away with his first win of the season during the Line-X Spray-on Truck Bedliners 200 at Michigan International Speedway. The win gave Toyota their first win in the top-tiers of NASCAR. Two months later, Kvapil won at New Hampshire International Speedway. The same season, Kvapil won his first Bud Pole Award in the Craftsman Truck Series[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/races/truck/2004/20/data/results_official.html|title=2004 Official Race Results: American Racing Wheels 200|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=2004-10-02|accessdate=2008-06-18[/tpl] at the American Racing Wheels 200 at California Speedway.

===2005–present===

At the end of the 2004 season, Kvapil made his first NEXTEL Cup Series start at Martinsville Speedway. Kvapil drove the No. 06 Mobil 1  Dodge, the fourth car on the track from Penske Racing.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/10/20/tkvapil_martinsville/index.html|title=Kvapil gets Nextel Cup ride for Martinsville|last=Rodman|first=Dave|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=2004-10-20|accessdate=2008-06-14[/tpl] Prior to the 2005 Sprint Cup Series, Kvapil was chosen by Penske Racing to drive the No. 77 Eastman Kodak Dodge, replacing Brendan Gaughan.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/official/12/10/tkvapil_qa/index.html|title=Q&A: Travis Kvapil|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=2004-12-10|accessdate=2008-06-14[/tpl]

The two top-10 finishes pushed Kvapil to finish 33rd in the point standings during his first season in the series. When the season ended, the Penske Racing No. 77 team disbanded when Kodak pulled out of the sponsorship deal.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=40977|title=Waltrip meets with France, prospective sponsors|last=Spencer|first=Lee|publisher=Sporting News|date=2005-12-04|accessdate=2008-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/2005/news/headlines/cup/12/08/tkvapil_opportunities/index.html|title=Kvapil free to explore other opportunities|publisher=Team Press Release|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2008-06-14[/tpl]

In 2007, Jack Roush, owner of Roush Racing, offered Kvapil a seat in the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil replaced Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/truck/11/14/tkvapil.roush.2007/index.html|title=Kvapil will return to Trucks with Roush in '07|publisher=Team Press Release|date=2006-11-15|accessdate=2008-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.racingone.com/article.aspx?artnum=32161|title=2007 MB2 Lineup Complete|publisher=RacingOne Report|date=2006-11-10|accessdate=2008-06-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.racingone.com/article.aspx?artnum=31568|title=Ragan Tabbed for No. 6|publisher=RacingOne Report|date=2006-10-11|accessdate=2008-06-18[/tpl] Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure that we were able to get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight top-5s and 12 top-10s.

In 2009, Kvapil returned to the No. 28, but the team was forced to close after six races due to lack of funding. Kvapil qualified in place of Bob Jenkins and part-time off-road-racer Robby Gordon.
Kvapil returned to the seat of a full-time Sprint Cup ride, driving the No. 34, 37, 38 Long John Silver's Ford for Front Row Motorsports. Kvapil returned to FRM, but signed up to compete for the Camping World Truck Series championship with Randy Moss Motorsports in their #5 Toyota. However, after 10 races Kvapil was released in favor of defending Truck champion Todd Bodine, whose Germain Racing team partnered with RMM to continue running Bodine for 2011. Kvapil stuck with FRM in the Cup Series, driving their #38 for most races until J.J. Yeley swapped rides with Kvapil, with the latter driving FRM's start and park #55.
Leaving FRM after the end of the 2011 season, Kvapil was signed by BK Racing to compete in the Sprint Cup Series for 2012.
