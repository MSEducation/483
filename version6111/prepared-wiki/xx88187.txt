==History==

Sunbury station opened on 10 February 1859 as a terminus, the line not being extended north for two more years. The three track yard dated back from this time, and was unique in Victoria. There was a large goods shed on the southern side a large silo on the northern side as well as sheep/cattle ramp and yards. There were housing for railway staff including two houses in Horne Street and the Station Masters house in Brook Street, all demolished in the 1980s.
Proper interlocking of the signals and point work did not exist until 1981, and the station was not fully interlocked until 1998 when a Solid State Interlocking was provided. The layout of the station was again altered with the Regional Fast Rail works in 2005.
On 18 November 2012 the station was added to the metropolitan network when the line from Watergardens was electrified.[tpl]cite web|title=Sunbury Electrification Overview|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/projects/pt/sunbury/|publisher=Victorian State Government Department of Transport|accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sunbury Electrification Station Improvements|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/projects/pt/sunbury/project-overview/station-upgrades-as-part-of-the-sunbury-electrification-project|publisher=Victorian State Government Department of Transport|accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl]
