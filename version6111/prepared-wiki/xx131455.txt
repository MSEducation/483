[[Corner (route)]]

CATEGORIES: American football plays

A corner route is a pattern run by a receiver in American football, where the receiver runs up the field and then turns at approximately a 45-degree angle, heading away from the quarterback towards the sideline.[tpl]Cite book |title=Football skills & drills |first=Tom |last=Bass |page=96 |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7360-5456-0[/tpl] Usually, the pass is used when the defensive back is playing towards the inside shoulder of the receiver, thus creating a one on one vertical matchup. The corner route is less likely to be intercepted when compared to the slant route, because it is thrown away from the middle of the field. The pass is used frequently in the West Coast offensive scheme, where quick, accurate throwing is key.[tpl]Cite book |title=Football's West Coast offense |first1=Frank |last1=Henderson |first2=Mel |last2=Olson |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=1997 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-88011-662-6[/tpl] The pass may also be used closer to the goal line in what is called a "fade". The quarterback will lob the ball over a beaten defender to a wide receiver at the back corner of the end zone.
