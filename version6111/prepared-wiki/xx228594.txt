==Critical reception==

The album was positively received by critics, with Artistdirect giving its 4.5 out of 5, calling it music "you throw on when the only passengers in your car are two recently emptied cans of Red Bull and a woofer". Remix called it a "wild romp through present-day breaks and bass".  Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated "each track comes across as fairly unexpected: you know it's going to be funky, you know the beats are probably going to lurch around crazily with lots of squelchy synth and frequent reggae vocal samples, but beyond that there's no telling what's going to happen. At its best, the result is thrilling".
