The Northern Pacific Railroad Completion Site is the location of the golden spike ceremony for the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883.  The site is located near Independence Creek in Powell County, Montana off of Interstate 90,Nolan, Waldron, p. 1. approximately [tpl]convert|59|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Missoula and [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] west of Helena.Google Maps
The Northern Pacific Railway began building a transcontinental railroad route across the northern United States from Minnesota to the Pacific Coast in 1870.  Crews built from both the eastern and western ends, progressing towards a yet undetermined meeting point somewhere in between.  The two crews finally met near the Independence Creek in Western Montana on August 22, 1883, which is near Gold Creek where gold was first discovered in Montana.Gold Creek:  Historical Context  At this point the track was connected, completing the transcontinental line; however, the "golden spike" completion ceremony would not occur until September 8, 1883.Nolan, Waldron, p. 3.  Four trains carried 300 guests from the east, including the Northern Pacific's president, Henry Villard, and visiting dignitaries from the United States, England, and Germany.  A fifth train arrived from the west coast.Northern Pacific Railroad Company, p. 266.  The track which had been laid earlier was temporarily torn up to be relaid ceremoniously during the event.  The final "golden spike" driven was not actually made of gold, but was the same spike that was driven to begin the construction of the Northern Pacific in Carlton, Minnesota thirteen years earlier.  The spike was driven by Villard, former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant, and Henry C. Davis, who had helped drive the first spike.Lubetkin 2006, p. 286.Minnesota Historical Society
The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1983.  A wooden sign erected by the Northern Pacific marking the location still exists and can be seen from Interstate 90 near where the Independence Creek runs into the Clark Fork River.Nolan, Waldron, p. 2.  The [tpl]convert|2.5|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] site includes the site of the final spike, as well as the location where pavilions were constructed for the 1883 celebrations.
