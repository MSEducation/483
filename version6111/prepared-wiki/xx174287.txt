Milton House, also known as Joseph Goodrich House and Cabin, is a historic building in Milton, Wisconsin. It is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad, which was an informal means of escape for slaves. In addition, the building is believed to be the first grout building built in the United States. It is also known for its hexagonal shape.http://www.miltonhouse.org/
Joseph Goodrich, known for his anti-slavery sentiments, built the Milton House Inn, which is located near a once frequently traveled stagecoach line. Because of its proximity to this transportation route, it was a popular rest stop for travelers and runaway slaves. A tunnel connects the main building to a nearby cabin. The circumstances in which the tunnel was constructed are unknown, though it may have been used to hide slaves.
In 1937 the house was in poor condition, uninhabited, and was threatened with being demolished. The Milton Historical Society acquired and restored the building. In 1996, an addition was constructed to restore the exterior to its 1885 appearance.
The house and cabin are open to the public via guided tours.
Milton House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: Milton House|405 KB[/tpl]|date=December 1, 1997 |author=Miller, Elizabeth L.|publisher=National Park Service|postscript=[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying 9 photos, exterior and interior, from 1997.|1.80 MB[/tpl]
