The Scharnebeck twin ship lift is on the Elbe-Seitenkanal, which connects the Elbe (at Artlenburg) and the Mittellandkanal (near Wolfsburg).
The boat lift was built in Scharnebeck to the North-east of LÃ¼neburg in 1974 and was at that time the largest ship lift in the world. The first ship passed through the lift on 1975-12-05.
There is a museum at the site which can be visited by walkers.
