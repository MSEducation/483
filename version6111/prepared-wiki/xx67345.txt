==Solar activity and irradiance measurement==

Direct irradiance measurements have only been available during the last three cycles and are based on a composite of many different observing satellites.http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi/composite/SolarConstant  However, the correlation between irradiance measurements and other proxies of solar activity make it reasonable to estimate past solar activity.  Most important among these proxies is the record of sunspot observations that has been recorded since ~1610.  Since sunspots and associated faculae are directly responsible for small changes in the brightness of the sun,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] they are closely correlated to changes in solar output.  Direct measurements of radio emissions from the Sun at 10.7 cm also provide a proxy of solar activity that can be measured from the ground since the Earth's atmosphere is transparent at this wavelength.  Lastly, solar flares are a type of solar activity that can impact human life on Earth by affecting electrical systems, especially satellites.  Flares usually occur in the presence of sunspots, and hence the two are correlated, but flares themselves make only tiny perturbations of the solar luminosity.
Recently it has been claimed that the total solar irradiance is varying in ways that are not duplicated by changes in sunspot observations or radio emissions, though Willson, DeWitte, and others have pointed out that these shifts in irradiance may be no more than the result of calibration problems in the measuring satellites.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002GL016038|title=Secular total solar irradiance trend during solar cycles 21–23|author=Richard C.

===Sunspots===

Sunspots are relatively dark areas on the radiating 'surface' (photosphere) of the Sun where intense magnetic activity inhibits convection and cools the photosphere. Faculae are slightly brighter areas that form around sunspot groups as the flow of energy to the photosphere is re-established and both the normal flow and the sunspot-blocked energy elevate the radiating 'surface' temperature. Scientists have speculated on possible relationships between sunspots and solar luminosity since the historical sunspot area record began in the 17th century.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eddy, J.A. |title=Samuel P. Langley (1834–1906) |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=21 |issue= |pages=111–20 |year=1990 |url=http://www.hao.ucar.edu/Public/education/bios/langley.html |bibcode = 1990JHA....21..111E [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first1=P.

The modulations were later confirmed in the results of the ERB experiment launched on the Nimbus 7 satellite in 1978,[tpl]cite journal |author=J. R. Hickey, B. M. Alton, H. L. Kyle and E. R. Major |title=Observation of total solar irradiance (TSI) variability from Nimbus satellites |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=5–10 |year=1988 |doi=10.1016/0273-1177(88)90164-0 |bibcode = 1988AdSpR...8....5H [/tpl] and satellite observation of solar irradiance continues today with ACRIM-3 and other satellite measurements. Sunspots in magnetically active regions are cooler and 'darker' than the average photosphere and cause temporary decreases in TSI of as much as 0.3%. Faculae in magnetically active regions are hotter and 'brighter' than the average photosphere and cause temporary increases in TSI.
The net effect during periods of enhanced solar magnetic activity is increased radiant output of the sun because faculae are larger and persist longer than sunspots.  Conversely, periods of lower solar magnetic activity and fewer sunspots (such as the Maunder Minimum) may correlate with times of lower terrestrial irradiance from the sun.Rodney Viereck, NOAA Space Environment Center. The Sun-Climate Connection
There had been some suggestion that variations in the solar diameter might also cause significant variations in output. But recent work, mostly from the Michelson Doppler Imager instrument on SOHO, shows these changes to be small, about 0.001%, much less than the effect of magnetic activity changes (Dziembowski et al., 2001).
Various studies have been made using sunspot number (for which records extend over hundreds of years) as a proxy for solar output (for which good records only extend for a few decades). Also, ground instruments have been calibrated by comparison with high-altitude and orbital instruments. Researchers have combined present readings and factors to adjust historical data. Other proxy data – such as the abundance of cosmogenic isotopes – have been used to infer solar magnetic activity and thus likely brightness.  Sunspot activity has been measured using the Wolf number for about 300 years. This index (also known as the Zürich number) uses both the number of sunspots and the number of groups of sunspots to compensate for variations in measurement. A 2003 study by Ilya Usoskin of the University of Oulu, Finland found that sunspots had been more frequent since the 1940s than in the previous 1150 years.
Sunspot numbers over the past 11,400 years have been reconstructed using carbon-14-based dendrochronology (tree ring dating). The level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional – the last period of similar magnitude occurred around 9,000 years ago (during the warm Boreal period).[tpl]Cite journal | first1=Sami K.| last1=Solanki | author-link=Sami Solanki | first2=Ilya G.| last2=Usoskin | first3=Bernd  | last3=Kromer | first4=Manfred| last4=Schüssler | first5=Jürg   | last5=Beer | title=Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years | journal=Nature | volume=431 | year=2004 | pages=1084–7 | url=http://cc.oulu.fi/%7Eusoskin/personal/nature02995.pdf | format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature02995 | accessdate=17 April 2007 |  pmid=15510145 | issue=7012 | bibcode=2004Natur.431.1084S[/tpl], [tpl]cite web | title=11,000 Year Sunspot Number Reconstruction | work=Global Change Master Directory | url=http://gcmd.nasa.gov/KeywordSearch/Metadata.do?Portal=GCMD&KeywordPath=%5BParameters%3ACategory%3D%27EARTH+SCIENCE%27%2CTopic%3D%27SUN-EARTH+INTERACTIONS%27%2CTerm%3D%27SOLAR+ACTIVITY%27%2CVariable%3D%27SUNSPOTS%27%5D&OrigMetadataNode=GCMD&EntryId=NOAA_NCDC_PALEO_2005-015&MetadataView=Brief&MetadataType=0&lbnode=gcmd3b | accessdate = 2005-03-11[/tpl] The Sun was at a similarly high level of magnetic activity for only ~10% of the past 11,400 years, and almost all of the earlier high-activity periods were shorter than the present episode.

===Solar cycles===

The sun undergoes various quasi-periodic changes, the principal one referred to as the solar cycle has an 11-year quasi-period. Only the 11 and closely related 22-year cycles are clear in the observations.

===Hypothesized cycles===

Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the sunspot cycle has been proposed.  Some of these proposed longer cycles include:
Other patterns have been detected:
The sensitivity of climate to cyclical variations in solar forcing will be higher for longer cycles due to the thermal inertia of the oceans, which acts to damp high frequencies. Using a phenomenological approach, Scafetta and West (2005) found that the climate is 1.5 times as sensitive to 22-year cyclical forcing relative to 11-year cyclical forcing, and that the thermal inertia of the oceans induces a lag of approximately 2.2 (± 2) years in cyclic climate response in the temperature data.[ref]
</ref>

====Predictions based on patterns====

[/ref]
Solar irradiance and insolation are measures of the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth. The equipment used might measure optical brightness, total radiation, or radiation in various frequencies. Historical estimates use various measurements and proxies.

===Solar irradiance of Earth and its surface===

There are two common meanings for solar irradiance:
Various gases within the atmosphere absorb some solar radiation at different wavelengths, and clouds and dust also affect it. Measurements above the atmosphere are needed to determine variations in solar output, to avoid the confounding effects of changes within the atmosphere. There is some evidence that sunshine at the Earth's surface has been decreasing in the last 50 years (see global dimming) possibly caused by increased atmospheric pollution, whilst over roughly the same timespan solar output has been nearly constant.

====Milankovitch cycle variations====

Some variations in insolation are not due to solar changes but rather due to the Earth moving closer or further from the Sun, or changes in the latitudinal distribution of radiation. These orbital changes or Milankovitch cycles have caused variations of as much as 25% (locally; global average changes are much smaller) in solar insolation over long periods. The most recent significant event was an axial tilt of 24° during boreal summer at near the time of the Holocene climatic optimum.

==Solar interactions with Earth==

There are several hypotheses for how solar variations may affect Earth. Some variations, such as changes in the size of the Sun, are presently only of interest in the field of astronomy.

===Changes in total irradiance===

===Changes in ultraviolet irradiance===

===Changes in the solar wind and the Sun's magnetic flux===

Research Council">Committee on the Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate; Space Studies Board; Division on Engineering and Physical Science; National Research Council, 2012[/ref]

===Effects on clouds===

Changes in ionization affect the abundance of aerosols that serve as the nuclei of condensation for cloud formation. During periods of low solar activity (during solar minima), more cosmic rays reach Earth, potentially creating ultra-small aerosol particles which are precursors to cloud condensation nuclei.[tpl]cite pressrelease | title= CERN’s CLOUD experiment provides unprecedented insight into cloud formation | publisher=CERN | url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR15.11E.html |date=25 August 2011| accessdate=3 November 2011 [/tpl]
Clouds formed from greater amounts of condensation nuclei are brighter, longer lived, and likely to produce less precipitation.  It has been speculated that a change in cosmic rays could cause an increase in certain types of clouds, affecting Earth's albedo.

==Other effects due to solar variation==

Interaction of solar particles, the solar magnetic field, and the Earth's magnetic field, cause variations in the particle and electromagnetic fields at the surface of the planet. Extreme solar events can affect electrical devices. Weakening of the Sun's magnetic field is believed to increase the number of interstellar cosmic rays which reach Earth's atmosphere, altering the types of particles reaching the surface.

===Geomagnetic effects===

The Earth's polar aurorae are visual displays created by interactions between the solar wind, the solar magnetosphere, the Earth's magnetic field, and the Earth's atmosphere. Variations in any of these affect aurora displays.  Solar coronal mass ejections, associated with high solar activity, will produce enhanced auroral activity, and visible aurorae at lower latitudes than usual.
Sudden changes can cause the intense disturbances in the Earth's magnetic fields which are called geomagnetic storms.

===Solar proton events===

Energetic protons can reach Earth within 30 minutes of a major flare's peak. During such a solar proton event, Earth is showered in energetic solar particles (primarily protons) released from the flare site. Some of these particles spiral down Earth's magnetic field lines, penetrating the upper layers of our atmosphere where they produce additional ionization and may produce a significant increase in the radiation environment.

===Galactic cosmic rays===

An increase in solar activity (more sunspots) is accompanied by an increase in the "solar wind," which is an outflow of ionized particles, mostly protons and electrons, from the sun. The Earth's geomagnetic field, the solar wind, and the solar magnetic field deflect galactic cosmic rays (GCR). A decrease in solar activity increases the GCR penetration of the troposphere and stratosphere. GCR particles are the primary source of ionization in the troposphere above 1 km (below 1 km, radon is a dominant source of ionization in many areas).
Levels of GCRs have been indirectly recorded by their influence on the production of carbon-14 and beryllium-10. The Hallstatt solar cycle length of approximately 2300 years is reflected by climatic Dansgaard-Oeschger events. The 80–90-year solar Gleissberg cycles appear to vary in length depending upon the lengths of the concurrent 11-year solar cycles, and there also appear to be similar climate patterns occurring on this time scale.

===Carbon-14 production===

The production of carbon-14 (radiocarbon: 14C) also is related to solar activity. Carbon-14 is produced in the upper atmosphere when cosmic ray bombardment of atmospheric nitrogen (14N) induces the Nitrogen to undergo β+ decay, thus transforming into an unusual isotope of carbon with an atomic weight of 14 rather than the more common 12. Because cosmic rays are partially excluded from the Solar System by the outward sweep of magnetic fields in the solar wind, increased solar activity results in a reduction of cosmic rays reaching the Earth's atmosphere and thus reduces 14C production. Thus the cosmic ray intensity and carbon-14 production vary inversely to the general level of solar activity.[ref]
</ref>
Therefore, the atmospheric 14C concentration is lower during sunspot maxima and higher during sunspot minima. By measuring the captured 14C in wood and counting tree rings, production of radiocarbon relative to recent wood can be measured and dated. A reconstruction of the past 10,000 years shows that the 14C production was much higher during the mid-Holocene 7,000 years ago and decreased until 1,000 years ago. In addition to variations in solar activity, the long term trends in carbon-14 production are influenced by changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field and by changes in carbon cycling within the biosphere (particularly those associated with changes in the extent of vegetation since the last ice age)[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Solar variation and climate==

Both long-term and short-term variations in solar activity are hypothesized to affect global climate, but it has proven extremely challenging to directly quantify the link between solar variation and the earth's climate.Joanna D. Haigh "The Sun and the Earth’s Climate", Living Reviews in Solar Physics (access date 31 January 2012  The topic continues to be a subject of active study.
As discussed above, there are three suggested mechanisms by which solar variations may have an effect on climate:
Early research attempted to find a correlation between weather and sunspot activity, mostly without notable success.  Later research has concentrated more on correlating solar activity with global temperature.
Crucial to the understanding of possible solar impact on terrestrial climate is accurate measurement of solar forcing. Unfortunately accurate measurement of incident solar radiation is only available since the satellite era, and even that is open to dispute: different groups find different values, due to different methods of cross-calibrating measurements taken by instruments with different spectral sensitivity.http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-7-1-1.html Scafetta and Willson found significant variations of solar luminosity between 1980 and 2000.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Nicola |last1=Scafetta |first2=Richard |last2=Willson |title=ACRIM-gap and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) trend issue resolved using a surface magnetic flux TSI proxy model |journal=Geophysical Research Letter |volume=36 |pages=L05701 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2008GL036307 |bibcode=2009GeoRL..3605701S |issue=5[/tpl] But Lockwood and Frohlich[tpl]cite journal |first1=Mike |last1=Lockwood |first2=Claus |last2=Fröhlich |title=Recent oppositely directed trends in solar climate forcings and the global mean surface air temperature.

===Effect on global warming===

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR) concluded that the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the amplification effect due to greenhouse gases but acknowledges in the same report that there is a low level of scientific understanding with respect to solar variation.[tpl]AR4|WG1|chapter=2|section=2.9.1 Uncertainties in Radiative Forcing | section-url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-9-1.html#table-2-11 [/tpl][ref]
</ref>
Estimates of long-term solar irradiance changes have decreased since the TAR. However, empirical results of detectable tropospheric changes have strengthened the evidence for solar forcing of climate change. The most likely mechanism is considered to be some combination of direct forcing by changes in total solar irradiance, and indirect effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the stratosphere. Least certain are indirect effects induced by galactic cosmic rays.Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis: 2.7.1	Solar Variability

They conclude that because of this, "long-term climate change may appear to track the amplitude of the solar activity cycles," but that "Solar radiative forcing of climate is reduced by a factor of 5 when the background component is omitted from historical reconstructions of total solar irradiance ...This suggests that general circulation model (GCM) simulations of twentieth century warming may overestimate the role of solar irradiance variability." More recently, a study and review of existing literature published in Nature in September 2006 suggests that the evidence is solidly on the side of solar brightness having relatively little effect on global climate, with little likelihood of significant shifts in solar output over long periods of time.[tpl]Cite journal | first1=P. | last1=Foukal | first2=C. | last2=Fröhlich | first3=H. | last3=Spruit | first4=T.

A paper by Benestad and Schmidt concludes that "the most likely contribution from solar forcing a global warming is 7 ± 1% for the 20th century and is negligible for warming since 1980." This paper disagrees with the conclusions of a Scafetta and West study, who claim that solar variability has a significant effect on climate forcing. Based on correlations between specific climate and solar forcing reconstructions, they argue that a "realistic climate scenario is the one described by a large preindustrial secular variability (e.g., the paleoclimate temperature reconstruction by Moberg et al.)[tpl]cite journal |last1=Moberg |title=Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data |journal=Nature |volume=433 |pages=613–7 |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/moberg2005/moberg2005.html |doi=10.1038/nature03265 |pmid=15703742 |year=2005 |first1=A |last2=Sonechkin |first2=DM |last3=Holmgren |first3=K |last4=Datsenko |first4=NM |last5=Karlén |first5=W |last6=Lauritzen |first6=SE |issue=7026 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..613M[/tpl] with the total solar irradiance experiencing low secular variability (as the one shown by Wang et al.).[tpl]Cite journal |title=Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=625 |pages=522–38 |date= May 2005|doi=10.1086/429689 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/429689 |last1=Wang |first1=Y.‐M. |last2=Lean |first2=J.

===Solar variation theory===

A 1994 U.S. National Academy of Sciences study concluded that variations in total solar irradiance (TSI) were the most likely cause of significant climate change in the pre-industrial era, before significant human-generated carbon dioxide was put into the atmosphere.
A 2007 paper by Scafetta and West correlating solar proxy data and lower tropospheric temperature for the preindustrial era, before significant anthropogenic greenhouse forcing, suggested that TSI variations may have contributed to 50% of the global warming observed between 1900 and 2000 (although they conclude "our estimates about the solar effect on climate might be overestimated and should be considered as an upper limit.")[tpl]cite journal |last1=Scafetta |first1=N. |first2=B.

They found that "solar effects may have contributed significantly to the warming in the first half of the century although this result is dependent on the reconstruction of total solar irradiance that is used. In the latter half of the century, we find that anthropogenic increases in greenhouses gases are largely responsible for the observed warming, balanced by some cooling due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols, with no evidence for significant solar effects." Stott's team found that combining all of these factors enabled them to closely simulate global temperature changes throughout the 20th century. They predicted that continued greenhouse gas emissions would cause additional future temperature increases "at a rate similar to that observed in recent decades". It should be noted that their solar forcing included "spectrally resolved changes in solar irradiance" but not indirect effects mediated through cosmic rays (discussed above and in the following section); these ideas are still being fleshed out.[ref][tpl]Cite journal | first1=K.S. | last1=Carslaw | first2=R.

Sami Solanki, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany said:
 The sun has been at its strongest over the past 60 years and may now be affecting global temperatures... the brighter sun and higher levels of so-called "greenhouse gases" both contributed to the change in the Earth's temperature, but it was impossible to say which had the greater impact.[tpl]cite news | first=Michael | last=Leidig | publisher=The Washington Times | date=18 July 2004 | accessdate=2007-04-18 | title=Hotter-burning sun warming the planet | url=http://www.washtimes.com/world/20040718-115714-6334r.htm [/tpl] 
Nevertheless, Solanki agrees with the scientific consensus that the marked upswing in temperatures since about 1980 is attributable to human activity.
 "Just how large this role solar variation is, must still be investigated, since, according to our latest knowledge on the variations of the solar magnetic field, the significant increase in the Earth's temperature since 1980 is indeed to be ascribed to the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide."[tpl]cite pressrelease | title=How Strongly Does the Sun Influence the Global Climate? — Studies at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research reveal: solar activity affects the climate but plays only a minor role in the current global warming | publisher=Max Planck Society | date=2 August 2004 | accessdate=2007-04-16 | url=http://www.mpg.de/english/illustrationsDocumentation/documentation/pressReleases/2004/pressRelease20040802/ [/tpl] 

===Maunder Minimum===

One historical long-term correlation between solar activity and climate change is the 1645–1715 Maunder minimum, a period of little or no sunspot activity which partially overlapped the "Little Ice Age" during which cold weather prevailed in Europe.  The Little Ice Age encompassed roughly the 16th to the 19th centuriesH. H. Lamb, "The cold Little Ice Age climate of about 1550 to 1800," in Climate: present, past and future, London: Methuen. p. 107 (1972).

The Spörer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period between 1460 and 1550.[tpl]cite book|title=The general crisis of the seventeenth century|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HGLs23umDXAC&pg=PA287&dq=Sp%C3%B6rer+Minimum+little+ice+age&cd=4#v=onepage&q=|author=Geoffrey Parker, Lesley M. Smith|publisher=Routledge|pages=287, 288|isbn=978-0-415-16518-1|year=1997[/tpl]
Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Crowley |first=Thomas J. |journal=Science |date=14 July 2000 |volume=289 |issue=5477 |pages=270–7 |title=Causes of Climate Change Over the Past 1000 Years |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5477/270 |pmid=10894770 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5477.270|bibcode = 2000Sci...289..270C [/tpl]
On the other hand, in a 2012 paper, Miller et al. link the Little Ice Age to an "unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions," and notes "large changes in solar irradiance are not required."Miller et al. 2012.

Recent research had suggested that a new 90-year Maunder minimum would result in a reduction of global average temperatures of about 0.3 °C, which would not be enough to offset the ongoing and forecasted average global temperature increase due to increased forcing from rising levels of carbon dioxide (generally referred to as global warming).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527494.700-a-quiet-sun-wont-save-us-from-global-warming.html|title=A quiet sun won't save us from global warming|date=26 February 2010|work=New Scientist|accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl]

===Correlations to solar cycle length===

In 1991, Eigil Friis-Christensen and Knud Lassen of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen claimed to see a strong correlation of the length of the solar cycle with temperature changes throughout the northern hemisphere.[tpl]cite journal |first1=E. |last1=Friis-Christensen |first2=K. |last2=Lassen |title=Length of the Solar Cycle: An Indicator of Solar Activity Closely Associated with Climate |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5032 |pages=698–700 |date=1 November 1991 |doi=10.1126/science.254.5032.698 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/254/5032/698.abstract |pmid=17774798|bibcode = 1991Sci...254..698F [/tpl] as PDF Initially, they used sunspot and temperature measurements from 1861 to 1989, but later found that climate records dating back four centuries supported their findings. They reported that the relationship appeared to account for nearly 80 per cent of the measured temperature changes over this period.
Although correlations often can be found, the mechanism behind these correlations is a matter of speculation. In a 2003 paper "Solar activity and terrestrial climate: an analysis of some purported correlations"[tpl]Cite journal |last=Laut |first=Peter |title=Solar activity and terrestrial climate: an analysis of some purported correlations |journal=J Atmos Sol Terr Phys |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=801–12 |date= May 2003|doi=10.1016/S1364-6826(03)00041-5 |bibcode = 2003JASTP..65..801L [/tpl] Peter Laut demonstrates problems with some of these correlation analyses. Damon and Laut report in Eos[tpl]Cite journal | title=Pattern of Strange Errors Plagues Solar Activity and Terrestrial Climate Data | url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/DamonLaut2004.pdf | accessdate=5 October 2005| journal=Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union| volume=85| issue=39September|date= 28 2004| pages=370–4| first=Paul E.| last=Damon| coauthors=Paul Laut | doi=10.1029/2004EO390005|format=PDF | bibcode=2004EOSTr..85..370D[/tpl]; see also discussion and references at skeptical science that
 the apparent strong correlations displayed on these graphs have been obtained by incorrect handling of the physical data. The graphs are still widely referred to in the literature, and their misleading character has not yet been generally recognized. 
Damon and Laut stated that when the graphs are corrected for filtering errors, the sensational agreement with the recent global warming, which drew worldwide attention, has totally disappeared.
On 6 May 2000, New Scientist magazine reported that Lassen and astrophysicist Peter Thejll had updated Friis-Christensen and Lassen's 1991 research (which originally only went to 1989) and found that while the solar cycle still accounts for about half the temperature rise since 1900, it fails to explain a rise of 0.4 °C since 1980. "The curves diverge after 1980," Thejll said, "and it's a startlingly large deviation. Something else is acting on the climate.... It has the fingerprints of the greenhouse effect."[tpl]cite journal | first=Robert | last=Adler | title=Don't blame the Sun | publisher=New Scientist | issue=2237 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg16622370.800 | date=6 May 2000 | accessdate=2007-04-19[/tpl] Likewise a 2005 review by Benestad[tpl]cite journal |first=R.E. |last=Benestad |title=A review of the solar cycle length estimates |journal=Geophys. Res. Let. |volume=32 |issue= 15|pages=L15714 |date=13 August 2005 |doi=10.1029/2005GL023621 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005.../2005GL023621.shtml|bibcode = 2005GeoRL..3215714B [/tpl] found that the solar cycle length does not follow Earth's global mean surface temperature.

===Solar variation and weather===

There are some suggestions that  there may also be regional climate impacts due to the solar activity.  Measurements from NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment show that solar UV output is more variable than the total solar irradiance. Climate modelling suggests that low solar activity may result in, for example, colder winters in the US and northern Europe and milder winters in Canada and southern Europe, with little change in globally averaged temperature.  More broadly, links have been suggested between solar cycles, global climate and events like El Nino.Solar Cycle Linked to Global Climate In other research, Daniel J. Hancock and Douglas N. Yarger found "statistically significant relationships between the double ~21-year sunspot cycle and the 'January thaw' phenomenon along the East Coast and between the double sunspot cycle and 'drought' (June temperature and precipitation) in the Midwest."[tpl]cite journal |author=Hancock DJ, Yarger DN |title=Cross-Spectral Analysis of Sunspots and Monthly Mean Temperature and Precipitation for the Contiguous United States |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=746–753 |year=1979 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1979)0362.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.solarstorms.org/USPrecip.html |issn=1520-0469|bibcode = 1979JAtS...36..746H [/tpl]
Recent research at CERN's CLOUD facility examined links between cosmic rays and cloud condensation nuclei, demonstrating the effect of high-energy particulate radiation in nucleating aerosol particles which are precursors to cloud condensation nuclei. Dr. Jasper Kirby, a team leader at CLOUD, said, "At the moment, it experiment actually says nothing about a possible cosmic-ray effect on clouds and climate, but it's a very important first step."[tpl]cite pressrelease | title=Cloud formation may be linked to cosmic rays | publisher=Nature News | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110824/full/news.2011.504.html |date=24 August 2011| accessdate=19 October 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| title=Role of sulphuric acid, ammonia and galactic cosmic rays in atmospheric aerosol nucleation |journal=Nature | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7361/full/nature10343.html |date=25 August 2011 |author=Kirkby J |volume=476 |issue=7361 |pages=429–433 |doi=10.1038/nature10343| author-separator=,| author2=Curtius J| author3=Almeida J| author4=Dunne E| author5=Duplissy J| display-authors=5| last6=Ehrhart| first6=Sebastian| last7=Franchin| first7=Alessandro| last8=Gagné| first8=Stéphanie| last9=Ickes| first9=Luisa| pmid=21866156 |bibcode = 2011Natur.476..429K [/tpl]
1983–1994 data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) showed that global low cloud formation was highly correlated with galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux; subsequent to this period, the correlation breaks down.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Pattern of Strange Errors Plagues Solar Activity and Terrestrial Climate Data | url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/DamonLaut2004.pdf | accessdate=5 October 2005| journal=Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union| volume=85| issue=39September|date= 28 2004| pages=370–4| first=Paul E.| last=Damon| coauthors=Paul Laut | doi=10.1029/2004EO390005|format=PDF | bibcode=2004EOSTr..85..370D[/tpl]  Changes of 3–4% in cloudiness and concurrent changes in cloud top temperatures have been correlated to the 11 and 22-year solar (sunspot) cycles, with increased GCR levels during "antiparallel" cycles.[tpl]Cite journal | first=Henrik | last=Svensmark | author-link=Henrik Svensmark | title=Influence of Cosmic Rays on Earth's Climate | journal=Physical Review Letters | year=1998 | volume=81 | issue=22 | pages=5027–5030 | url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/COSPAR02/00975/COSPAR02-A-00975.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5027 | accessdate=17 June 2011 | bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.5027S[/tpl]
Global average cloud cover change has been found to be 1.5–2%. Several studies of GCR and cloud cover variations have found positive correlation at latitudes greater than 50° and negative correlation at lower latitudes. However, not all scientists accept this correlation as statistically significant, and some that do attribute it to other solar variability (e.g. UV or total irradiance variations) rather than directly to GCR changes.[tpl]cite journal | author=E.
