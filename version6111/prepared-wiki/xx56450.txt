Helsinki City Transport or HKL (Finnish: Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos, Swedish: Helsingfors stads trafikverk, abbreviated HST) is the official city-owned public transport company in Helsinki, Finland. It operates the Helsinki metro, Helsinki tram and ferry boat traffic. Its bus operations were merged with another city-owned company, Suomen Turistiauto, to form a new bus company called Helsingin Bussiliikenne. Until the beginning January 2010, HKL was responsible for planning and organising all public transport in Helsinki. After that date Helsingin seudun liikenne (HSL) took over these responsibilities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hsl.fi/EN/ABOUTHSL/Pages/default.aspx |title=Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) |publisher=HSL |accessdate=24 April 2010[/tpl]
