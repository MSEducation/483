==Before the season==

The Pac-12 media picked Utah to finish third in the South Division. Four media members (out of 42 total) voted Utah first in the division. The media picked USC to finish first, but USC will be ineligible for the inaugural Pac-12 Championship Game due to NCAA sanctions. Arizona State came in second, and Arizona, UCLA, and Colorado finished fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively, in the South Division voting. The media also picked Oregon to win the North Division with 29 first place votes, and to win the Pac-12 Championship Game and thus be the Pac-12 Champion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700166032/Utah-Utes-football-Kyle-Whittingham-takes-preseason-prediction-in-stride.html |title=Utah Utes football: Kyle Whittingham takes preseason prediction in stride |author=Dirk Facer |work=Deseret News |publisher=deseretnews.com |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 26, 2011[/tpl]

===Coaching changes===

Kyle Whittingham made a few changes to his coaching staff for the 2011 season. Prior to Utah's appearance in the 2010 Maaco Bowl Las Vegas defensive line coach John Pease retired from coaching.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700086777/Utah-Utes-football-Assistant-coach-John-Pease-announces-retirement.html |title=Utah Utes football: Assistant coach John Pease announces retirement |author=Dirk Facer |work=Deseret News |publisher=deseretnews.com |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl] During the offseason, Whittingham replaced Pease with Chad Kauha[tpl]okina[/tpl]aha[tpl]okina[/tpl]a, a second team all-WAC defensive lineman for Utah in 1996. The previous two seasons he had been the defensive line coach for Utah State.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700107045/Utah-Utes-football-New-assistant-coach-coming-home.html |title=Utah Utes football: New assistant coach coming 'home' |author=Dirk Facer |work=Deseret News |publisher=deseretnews.com |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl]
The Utes also hired Norm Chow to be the Offensive coordinator and coach the tight ends. He had been an offensive coordinator at UCLA the three previous seasons.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/22/sports/la-sp-0123-ucla-football-20110123 |title=UCLA fires Norm Chow, hires Mike Johnson |author=Chris Foster |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl] In 2002, when he was the offensive coordinator at USC, Norm Chow won the Broyles Award.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/121102aab.html |title=Chow Wins Broyles Award For Top College Assistant |publisher=USC Trojans – Official Athletic Site |accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl]  Former co-offensive coordinators Aaron Roderick and Dave Schramm were reassigned to coach different positions in the offense. They will coach the receivers and the running backs, respectively, positions they have both previously coached for the program. Finally, Whittingham hired Tim Davis to coach the offensive line. Davis replaces Blake Miller who left the program to coach the same position with Memphis. Davis coached the offensive line the previous three seasons at Minnesota and has had a prior stint as Utah's offensive line coach 1990–1996 and worked under Chow at USC 2002–2004.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700100494/Utah-Utes-football-Utes-hire-Tim-Davis-Norm-Chow-still-at-UCLA-2-for-now.html? |title=Utah Utes football: Utes hire Tim Davis, Norm Chow still at UCLA – for now |author=Dirk Facer |work=Deseret News |publisher=deseretnews.com |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl]

Linebacker Brian Blechen set-up Utah's first touchdown when he returned an interception 39-yards to the 8-yard line; Montana State quarterback DeNarius McGhee threw the errant pass. Three plays later, Wynn connected with wide receiver DeVonte Christopher for the touchdown. Montana State punted on their next possession, and Utah's offense had its second scoring drive. This one resulted in a 5-yard touchdown pass from Wynn to White; the drive took nine plays and gained 62 yards.
Utah blocked MSU's next punt. Montana State blockers flipped Utah lineback Matt Martinez into the air, which caused Martinez to block the punt with his feet.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/photo/gallery/story/700175648/Utah-Utes-football-Utes-less-than-stellar-in-27-10-victory-over-Montana-State.html?photoId=579641 |title=Story photo gallery |author=Jeffrey D.
