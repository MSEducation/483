The White Palace located in the same complex as the Royal Palace, the official residence of the Karađorđević royal family. The palace was designed by architect Aleksandar Đorđević, in a neo-Palladian manner inspired by the 18th century English houses such as Ditchley Park. Its interior was decorated with  English Georgian and 19th century Russian antiques by the French design firm Jansen, which later decorated the White House during the administration of John F. Kennedy.James Archer Abbott, Jansen, New York: Acanthus Press, 2005

==History==

The palace was commissioned and built with the personal funds of King Alexander I for his three sons. Alexander was assassinated during a state visit to Marseille, France, the same year construction on the palace began. Supervision of construction was overtaken by the Prince Regent Paul until its completion in 1937. Queen Maria and her three sons, including the 11-year-old King Peter II, continued to reside in the Royal Palace during this time. Prince Paul was the only member of the royal family to reside in the palace before the outbreak of the Second World War and invasion of Yugoslavia."
Following the end of the war, the new communist government seized the assets and property of the royal family. Beli dvor was periodically used by presidents Josip Broz Tito and later by Slobodan Milošević for official state functions and foreign visits. Milošević received U.S. envoy Richard Holbrook at the palace before the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began; Milošević later officially resigned his presidency in front of the palace fireplace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stil-magazin.com/clanak/broj-217-02-maj-2011/cas-istorije-na-belom-dvoru|title=Čas istorije na Belom dvoru|publisher=Stil magazin|language=Serbian|accessdate=12 July 2013[/tpl]
