[[Elizabeth Tollet]]

CATEGORIES: English poets, 1694 births, 1754 deaths

Elizabeth Tollet (1694â€”1754) was a British poet. Her surviving works are varied; she produced translations of classical themes, religious and philosophical poetry and poems arguing for better education for women. Unusually, for a woman of her time, her poetry also includes scientific imagery.
She was the daughter of George Tollet who, observing her intelligence, gave her a thorough education in languages, history, poetry and mathematics. The Tollets' social circle included Isaac Newton, who also encouraged her to pursue her education.
In 1724 she published Poems on Several Occasions, which included her Hypatia, now seen as a feminist protest poem.
On Newton's death in 1727 Tollet produced an elegy, On the Death of Sir Isaac Newton.
She died in 1754 in the village of Westham, Essex (now known as West Ham) and is buried at All Saints church there.
