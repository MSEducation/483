[[Number theory]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory

Number theory (or arithmeticEspecially in older sources; see two following notes.) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers, sometimes called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).
Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects (e.g., the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, e.g., as approximated by the latter (Diophantine approximation).
The older term for number theory is arithmetic. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by "number theory".Already in 1921, T. L. Heath had to explain: "By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers." [tpl]harv|Heath|1921|p=13[/tpl]  (The word "arithmetic" is used by the general public to mean "elementary calculations"; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic, as in Peano arithmetic, and computer science, as in floating point arithmetic.) The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.Take, e.g. [tpl]harvnb|Serre|1973[/tpl]. In 1952, Davenport still had to specify that he meant The Higher Arithmetic. Hardy and Wright wrote in the introduction to An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers (1938): "We proposed at one time to change title to An introduction to arithmetic, a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book." [tpl]harv|Hardy|Wright|2008[/tpl] In particular, arithmetical is preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.

==History==

===Origins===

====Dawn of arithmetic====

The triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force. The heading over the first column reads: "The takiltum of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width..."[tpl]harvnb|Neugebauer & Sachs|1945|p=40[/tpl]. The term takiltum is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering "The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...".[tpl]harvnb|Robson|2001|p=192[/tpl]
It is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; Babylonian astronomy, for example, truly flowered only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.[tpl]sfn|Friberg|1981|p=302[/tpl][ref][tpl]harvnb|Robson|2001|p=201[/tpl]. This is controversial. See Plimpton 322. Robson's article is written polemically [tpl]harv|Robson|2001|p=202[/tpl] with a view to "perhaps ... knocking 322 off its pedestal" [tpl]harv|Robson|2001|p=167[/tpl]; at the same time, it settles to the conclusion that  ... the question “how was the tablet calculated?” does not have to have the
 same answer as the question “what problems does the tablet set?” The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems [tpl]harv|Robson|2001|p=202[/tpl]. 
Robson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 (who had to "work for a living", and would not have belonged to a "leisured middle class") could have been motivated by his own "idle curiosity" in the absence of a "market for new mathematics".[tpl]harv|Robson|2001|pp=199–200[/tpl][/ref]
While Babylonian number theory—or what survives of Babylonian mathematics that can be called thus—consists of this single, striking fragment, Babylonian algebra (in the secondary-school sense of "algebra") was exceptionally well developed.[tpl]sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=43[/tpl] Late Neoplatonic sources[ref]Iamblichus, Life of Pythagoras,(trans. e.g. [tpl]harvnb|Guthrie|1987[/tpl]) cited in [tpl]harvnb|van der Waerden|1961|p=108[/tpl]. See also Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras, paragraph 6, in [tpl]harvnb|Guthrie|1987|para=6[/tpl]
Van der Waerden [tpl]harv|van der Waerden|1961|pp=87–90[/tpl] sustains the view that Thales knew Babylonian mathematics.[/ref] state that Pythagoras learned mathematics from the Babylonians. Much earlier sourcesHerodotus (II. 81) and Isocrates (Busiris 28), cited in: [tpl]harvnb|Huffman|2011[/tpl]. On Thales, see Eudemus ap. Proclus, 65.7, (e.g. [tpl]harvnb|Morrow|1992|p=52[/tpl]) cited in: [tpl]harvnb|O'Grady|2004|p=1[/tpl]. Proclus was using a work by Eudemus of Rhodes (now lost), the Catalogue of Geometers. See also introduction, [tpl]harvnb|Morrow|1992|p=xxx[/tpl] on Proclus' reliabilty. state that Thales and Pythagoras traveled and studied in Egypt.
is irrational.[tpl]sfn|Becker|1936[/tpl] Pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even.[tpl]sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=109[/tpl]
in [tpl]harvnb|von Fritz|2004|p=212[/tpl]: "Theodorus was writing out for us something about roots, such as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable by the unit;..." See also Spiral of Theodorus.[/ref] By revealing (in modern terms) that numbers could be irrational, this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history; its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to Hippasus, who was expelled or split from the Pythagorean sect.[tpl]sfn|von Fritz|2004[/tpl] It is only here that we can start to speak of a clear, conscious division between numbers (integers and the rationals—the subjects of arithmetic) and lengths (real numbers, whether rational or not).
The Pythagorean tradition spoke also of so-called polygonal or figurate numbers.[tpl]sfn|Heath|1921|p=76[/tpl] While square numbers, cubic numbers, etc., are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers, square numbers, pentagonal numbers, etc., the study of the sums
of triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period (17th to early 19th century).
We know of no clearly arithmetical material in ancient Egyptian or Vedic sources, though there is some algebra in both. The Chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise Sun Zi, Suan Ching, Chapter 3, Problem 26. This can be found in [tpl]harvnb|Lam|Ang|2004|pp=219–220[/tpl], which contains a full translation of the Suan Ching (based on [tpl]harvnb|Qian|1963[/tpl]). See also the discussion in [tpl]harvnb|Lam|Ang|2004|pp=138–140[/tpl]. in Sun Zi's Suan Ching (also known as The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi (3rd, 4th or 5th century CE.)The date of the text has been narrowed down to 220–420 AD (Yan Dunjie) or 280–473 AD (Wang Ling) through internal evidence (= taxation systems assumed in the text). See [tpl]harvnb|Lam|Ang|2004|pp=27–28[/tpl]. (There is one important step glossed over in Sun Zi's solution:[ref]Sun Zi, Suan Ching, Ch. 3, Problem 26,
in [tpl]harvnb|Lam|Ang|2004|pp=219–220[/tpl]: 
 26 Now there are an unknown number of things. If we count by threes, there is a remainder 2; if we count by fives, there is a remainder 3; if we count by sevens, there is a remainder 2. Find the number of things. Answer: 23. 
Method: If we count by threes and there is a remainder 2, put down 140. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 3, put down 63. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 2, put down 30. Add them to obtain 233 and subtract 210 to get the answer. If we count by threes and there is a remainder 1, put down 70. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 1, put down 21. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 1, put down 15. When number exceeds 106, the result is obtained by subtracting 105.[/ref] it is the problem that was later solved by Āryabhaṭa's kuṭṭaka – see below.)
There is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics,[ref]See, e.g., Sun Zi, Suan Ching, Ch. 3, Problem 36, in [tpl]harvnb|Lam|Ang|2004|pp=223–224[/tpl]: 
 36 Now there is a pregnant woman whose age is 29. If the gestation period is 9 months, determine the sex of the unborn child. Answer: Male. 
Method: Put down 49, add the gestation period and subtract the age. From the remainder take away 1 representing the heaven, 2 the earth, 3 the man, 4 the four seasons, 5 the five phases, 6 the six pitch-pipes, 7 the seven stars the Dipper, 8 the eight winds, and 9 the nine divisions China under Yu the Great. If the remainder is odd, sex is male and if the remainder is even, sex is female.
This is the last problem in Sun Zi's otherwise matter-of-fact treatise.[/ref] but, unlike that of the Pythagoreans, it seems to have
led nowhere. Like the Pythagoreans' perfect numbers, magic squares have passed from superstition into recreation.

====Classical Greece and the early Hellenistic period====

Aside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period.[tpl]sfn|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=82[/tpl] In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, Plato and Euclid, respectively.
Plato had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By arithmetic he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what arithmetic or number theory have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues—namely,
Euclid devoted part of his Elements to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of Euclid's Elements). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the Euclidean algorithm; Elements, Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the infinitude of primes (Elements, Prop. IX.20).
In 1773, Lessing published an epigram he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by Archimedes to Eratosthenes.[tpl]sfn|Vardi|1998|p=305-319[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|pp=17–24[/tpl] The epigram proposed what has become known as
Archimedes' cattle problem; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed Pell's equation). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the Indian school. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.

====Diophantus====

One may say that Diophantus was studying rational points — i.e., points whose coordinates are rational — on curves and algebraic varieties; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say) 
Diophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves (elliptic curves, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry
(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)
While Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that every integer is the sum of four squares (though he never stated as much explicitly).

====Indian school: Āryabhaṭa, Brahmagupta, Bhāskara====

While Greek astronomy—thanks to Alexander's conquests—probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,[tpl]sfn|Plofker|2008|p=134[/tpl] it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural [tpl]harv|Plofker|2008|p=42[/tpl]. in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.[tpl]sfn|Mumford|2010|p=387[/tpl]
Brahmagupta (628 CE) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the misnamed Pell equation, in which Archimedes may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the chakravala, or "cyclic method") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II's Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).[tpl]sfn|Plofker|2008|p=194[/tpl]
Unfortunately, Indian mathematics remained largely unknown in the West until the late eighteenth century;[tpl]sfn|Plofker|2008|p=283[/tpl] Brahmagupta and Bhāskara's work was translated into English in 1817 by Henry Colebrooke.[tpl]sfn|Colebrooke|1817[/tpl]

====Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age====

In the early ninth century, the caliph Al-Ma'mun ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the Sindhind,
which may [ref][tpl]harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=lxv[/tpl], cited in [tpl]harvnb|Hopkins|1990|p=302[/tpl]. See also the preface in
[tpl]harvnb|Sachau|1888[/tpl] cited in [tpl]harvnb|Smith|1958|pp=168[/tpl][/ref] or may not[tpl]harvnb|Pingree|1968|pp=97–125[/tpl], and [tpl]harvnb|Pingree|1970|pp=103–123[/tpl], cited in [tpl]harvnb|Plofker|2008|p=256[/tpl]. be Brahmagupta's Brāhmasphuţasiddhānta), thus giving rise to the tradition of Islamic mathematics.
Diophantus's main work, the Arithmetica, was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820–912).
Part of the treatise al-Fakhri (by al-Karajī, 953 – ca. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajī's contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew[tpl]sfn|Rashed|1980|p=305–321[/tpl] what would later be called Wilson's theorem.

==Western Europe in the Middle Ages==

Other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci — who lived and studied in north Africa and Constantinople during his formative years, ca. 1175–1200 — no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus's Arithmetica (Bachet, 1621, following a first attempt by Xylander, 1575).

===Early modern number theory===

====Fermat====

Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes.[tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|pp=45–46[/tpl] He wrote down nearly no proofs in number theory; he had no models in the area.[tpl]harvnb|Weil|1984|p=118[/tpl]. This was more so in number theory than in other areas (remark in [tpl]harvnb|Mahoney|1994|p=284[/tpl]). Bachet's own proofs were "ludicrously clumsy" [tpl]harv|Weil|1984|p=33[/tpl]. He did make repeated use of mathematical induction, introducing the method of infinite descent.
One of Fermat's first interests was perfect numbers (which appear in Euclid, Elements IX) and amicable numbers;Perfect and especially amicable numbers are of little or no interest nowadays. The same was not true in medieval times – whether in the West or the Arab-speaking world – due in part to the importance given to them by the Neopythagorean (and hence mystical) Nicomachus (ca. 100 CE), who wrote a primitive but influential "Introduction to Arithmetic". See [tpl]harvnb|van der Waerden|1961|loc=Ch. IV[/tpl]. this led him to work on integer divisors, which were from the beginning among the subjects of the
correspondence (1636 onwards) that put him in touch with the mathematical community of the day.[tpl]harvnb|Mahoney|1994|pp=48, 53–54[/tpl]. The initial subjects of Fermat's correspondence included divisors ("aliquot parts") and many subjects outside number theory; see the list in the letter from Fermat to Roberval, 22.IX.1636, [tpl]harvnb|Tannery|Henry|1891|loc=Vol. II, pp. 72, 74[/tpl], cited in [tpl]harvnb|Mahoney|1994|p=54[/tpl]. He had already studied Bachet's edition of Diophantus carefully;[tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|pp=1–2[/tpl] by 1643, his interests had shifted largely to Diophantine problems and sums of squares[tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|p=53[/tpl] (also treated by Diophantus).
Fermat's achievements in arithmetic include:
Fermat's claim ("Fermat's last theorem") to have shown there are no solutions to

====Euler====

The interest of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateur[ref]Up to the second half of the seventeenth century, academic positions were very rare, and most mathematicians and scientists earned their living in some other way [tpl]harv|Weil|1984|pp=159, 161[/tpl]. (There were already some recognisable features of professional practice, viz., seeking correspondents, visiting foreign colleagues, building private libraries [tpl]harv|Weil|1984|pp=160–161[/tpl]. Matters started to shift in the late 17th century [tpl]harv|Weil|1984|p=161[/tpl]; scientific academies were founded in England (the Royal Society, 1662) and France (the Académie des sciences, 1666) and Russia (1724). Euler was offered a position at this last one in 1726; he accepted, arriving in St. Petersburg in 1727 ([tpl]harvnb|Weil|1984|p=163[/tpl] and
[tpl]harvnb|Varadarajan|2006|p=7[/tpl]).
In this context, the term amateur usually applied to Goldbach is well-defined and makes some sense: he has been described as a man of letters who earned a living as a spy [tpl]harv|Truesdell|1984|p=xv[/tpl]; cited in [tpl]harvnb|Varadarajan|2006|p=9[/tpl]). Notice, however, that Goldbach published some works on mathematics and sometimes held academic positions.[/ref] Goldbach, pointed him towards some of Fermat's work on the subject.[tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|pp=2, 172[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Varadarajan|2006|p=9[/tpl] This has been called the "rebirth" of modern number theory,[tpl]sfn|Weil|1984|pp=1–2[/tpl] after Fermat's relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries' attention for the subject.[tpl]harvnb|Weil|1984|p=2[/tpl] and [tpl]harvnb|Varadarajan|2006|p=37[/tpl] Euler's work on number theory includes the following:[tpl]harvnb|Varadarajan|2006|p=39[/tpl] and [tpl]harvnb|Weil|1984|pp=176–189[/tpl]

====Lagrange, Legendre and Gauss====

Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also
In his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.[tpl]sfn|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=14[/tpl]  The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory:
 The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong
 by itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.From the preface of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae; the translation is taken from [tpl]harvnb|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=16[/tpl]
In this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both Évariste Galois's work and algebraic number theory.

===Maturity and division into subfields===

Starting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:
Algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy, but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837),[tpl]sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|p=1[/tpl] whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.See the proof in  [tpl]harvnb|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|loc=section 1[/tpl] The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually
goes back to Euler (1730s),[tpl]sfn|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Varadarajan|2006|loc=sections 2.5, 3.1 and 6.1[/tpl] who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point;[tpl]sfn|Granville|2008|pp=322–348[/tpl] Jacobi's four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory (modular forms).See the comment on the importance of modularity in [tpl]harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1[/tpl]
The history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.

==Main subdivisions==

===Elementary tools===

The term elementary generally denotes a method that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg.[tpl]sfn|Goldfeld|2003[/tpl] The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems (e.g. Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.
Number theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.See, e.g., the initial comment in [tpl]harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1[/tpl].

===Analytic number theory===

Analytic number theory may be defined
Some subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, e.g., sieve theory,Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance, [tpl]harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004[/tpl] or [tpl]harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007[/tpl] are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the Brun sieve) rather than for large sieves; the study of the latter now includes ideas from harmonic and functional analysis. yet it is considered to be part of analytic number theory.
The following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures), the Waring problem and the Riemann Hypothesis. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, automorphic forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.
One may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers living in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, an all-important analytic object that describes the distribution of prime numbers.

===Algebraic number theory===

 (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields, or shortly number fields.
It could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in Disquisitiones arithmeticae can be restated in terms of ideals and
norms in quadratic fields. (A quadratic field consists of all
is a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)
For that matter, the 11th-century chakravala method amounts—in modern terms—to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither Bhāskara nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.
The grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ideal numbers, the theory of ideals and valuation theory were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals
are irreducible, and thus, in a naïve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by Kummer) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,[tpl]sfn|Edwards|2000|p=79[/tpl]i.e., generalisations of quadratic reciprocity.
Number fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field L is said to be an extension of a field K if L contains K.
(For example, the complex numbers C are an extension of the reals R, and the reals R are an extension of the rationals Q.)
Classifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions—that is, extensions L of K such that the Galois group[ref]The Galois group of an extension K/L consists of the operations (isomorphisms) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.
Thus, for instance, Gal(C/R) consists of two elements: the identity element
(taking every element x + iy of C to itself) and complex conjugation
(the map taking each element x + iy to x − iy).
The Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with Évariste Galois; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation f(x) = 0 can be solved by radicals
(that is, x can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together
with square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation f(x) = 0 has a Galois group that is  solvable
in the sense of group theory. ("Solvable", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.)[/ref] Gal(L/K) of L over K is an abelian group—are relatively well understood.
Their classification was the object of the programme of class field theory, which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by Kronecker and Eisenstein) and carried out largely in 1900—1950.
An example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is Iwasawa theory. The Langlands program, one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics,  is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.

===Diophantine geometry===

The central problem of Diophantine geometry is to determine when a Diophantine equation has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.
For example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface or some other such object in n-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any rational points (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or
integral points (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is: are there finitely
or infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface)? What about integer points?
we would like to study its rational solutions, i.e., its solutions
x and y are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions
same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve
