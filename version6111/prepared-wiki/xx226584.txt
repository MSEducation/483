Strawberry Hill is a Georgian style farmhouse near Thurmont, Frederick County, Maryland, built in 1783.  The house is substantially similar in plan to nearby Pennterra, but lacks Pennterra's later Victorian additions. The locally-quarried stone includes an unusual diamond pattern on the southeast side of the house.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=362&COUNTY=Frederick&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Frederick|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
