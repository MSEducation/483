Evgeny Mikhailovich LifshitzSome commonly encountered alternative transliterations of his names include Yevgeny or Evgenii and Lifshits or Lifschitz. ForMemRS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1990.0035[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ru|Евгений Михайлович Лифшиц[/tpl]; February 21, 1915 – October 29, 1985) was a leading Soviet physicist of Jewish origin and the brother of physicist Ilya Mikhailovich Lifshitz.  Lifshitz is well known in the field of general relativity for coauthoring the BKL conjecture concerning the nature of a generic curvature singularity.  [tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], this is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in the subject of classical gravitation.[tpl]MacTutor Biography|id=Lifshitz[/tpl]
With Lev Landau, Lifshitz co-authored Course of Theoretical Physics, an ambitious series of physics textbooks, in which the two aimed to provide a graduate-level introduction to the entire field of physics. These books are still considered invaluable and continue to be widely used.
Lifshitz was the second of only 43 people ever to pass Landau's "Theoretical Minimum" examination. He made many invaluable contributions, in particular to quantum electrodynamics, where he calculated the Casimir force in an arbitrary macroscopic configuration of metals and dielectrics.
