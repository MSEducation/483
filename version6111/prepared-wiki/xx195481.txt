Francis "Frank" Harris (born 5 April 1908, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. He was born in Catshill.
Harris began his football career at non-league sides Cradley Heath and Bromsgrove Rovers while working as a mechanic. In 1928 he signed for Cardiff City, scoring on his home debut in a 2-1 win over Leicester City. It took him several years to fully establish himself in the side as numerous minor injuries forced him in and out of the first team before missing just two games during the 1931-32 season. In 1933 he was sold to Charlton Athletic, who were also suffering from a slump in recent years but Harris was part of the team that helped the club win two consecutive promotions to return to the top flight. After leaving Charlton he finished his career at Brierley Hill Alliance.
