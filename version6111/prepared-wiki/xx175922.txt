WGCD (1490 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Gospel format. The station is licensed for
Chester, South Carolina, USA.  The station is currently owned by Frank Neely.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WGCD |title=WGCD Facility Record |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division [/tpl] This station, the first radio station in the county, was established in the 1940s by Morgan Jones Craig (1920-1964), a Chester native with a degree in engineering who, through his work as an aide-de-camp to a general in the Pacific theatre in World War II, had developed an interest in radio. The call letters stands for "Wonderful Guernsey Center of Dixie". At that time, Chester was well supplied with this variety of dairy cow and Morgan Craig's father, Alec Bell Craig, had guernseys on their family farm outside of Chester called "Craigbrow". WGCD was very much a family business and included much locally generated programming. Shortly after WWII Morgan's sister, Mary Craig, wrote a cooking/homemaking show called "Miss B".  Also, because the Craigs were staunch Presbyterians, the 11.15 am Sunday morning worship was broadcast free of charge directly over the radio from Purity Presbyterian Church every week for 40 years, until the 1980s. Morgan Craig also designed and built the building where WGCD was housed for many years.
