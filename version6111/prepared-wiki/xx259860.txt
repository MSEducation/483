[[Red tourism]]

CATEGORIES: Tourism in China, Communism

Red tourism (Hanzi: 红色旅游) is a subset of tourism in the People's Republic of China in which Chinese people visit locations with historical significance to Chinese Communism   "to rekindle their long-lost sense of class struggle and proletarian principles." The Government began actively supporting red tourism in 2005 to promote the "national ethos" and socioeconomic development in those areas, which are typically rural and poorer than East China. In July 2010, officials representing 13 Chinese cities signed a "China Red Tourism Cities Strategic Cooperation Yan'an Declaration" to develop red tourism; the cities are: Guang'an, Yan'an, Xiangtan, Jinggangshan, Ruijin, Zunyi, Baise, Shijiazhuang, Linyi, Anyang, Yulin, Qingyang, and Huining.[ref]
