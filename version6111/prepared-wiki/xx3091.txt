==Overview==

The Eindhoven University of Technology was founded as the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven (THE) on 23 June 1956 by the Dutch government. The University was acknowledged for its research in Automobile sector. It was the second institute of its kind in the Netherlands, preceded only by the Delft University of Technology. It is located on its own campus in the center of Eindhoven, just north of the central station. It is currently home to about 240 professors, 7200 students, 250 PDEng-students, 600 Ph.D. students, 200 post-doc students and 3000 regular employees. It supports about 100 student associations and 15 alumni associations.TU/e: Facts and figures URL accessed on 3 July 2006 Yearly, the Eindhoven University of Technology produces almost 3000 scientific publications, 140 PhD-awards, and 40 patents.
The Eindhoven University of Technology is main participant in the technological top institutes DPI and M2i. One of its former students is Gerard Kleisterlee, a former CEO of Philips.
The university is in an area where several companies active in technology are doing their research, like Philips, ASML and DAF. The university maintains close contacts with most of these companies.
As of 29 April 2005, Prof.dr.ir. C.J. van Duijn has the position of rector magnificus.
In 2006, the university celebrated its 50th birthday.
In a 2003 European Commission report,European Commission ranking of the 22 European universities with the highest scientific publication impact, (see  cordis.europa.eu for the full report) TU/e was ranked as 3rd among European research universities (after Cambridge and Oxford, at equality with TU Munich and thus making it the highest ranked Technical University in Europe), based on the impact of its scientific research. In 'The Times Higher Education Supplement World University Ranking 2005'.The worldâ€™s top 100 technology universities  URL accessed on 3 July 2006 it was ranked 74th among world universities, and 67th in 2006.
The university operates several international cooperations with other universities all over the world; the Brain Bridge with Zhejiang University, People's Republic of China, is an example of such a cooperation. Also, the university maintains partnerships with several Dutch universities and announced a "preferred partnership" with the Universiteit Utrecht on 3 January 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/nieuws/artikel/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=10380&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=361&cHash=81f593a9e9 |title= Strategische alliantie TU/e met Universiteit Utrecht en UMC Utrecht | trans_title=Strategic Alliance TU/e with University of Utrecht and the UMC |language=Dutch |date=3 January 2011 |publisher=Eindhoven University of Technology |accessdate=17 January 2011[/tpl]

===Strategic Vision 2020===

On 3 January 2011, ir. Arno Peels presented the university's strategic vision document for the period up to 2020, the "Strategic Plan 2020".[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/nieuws/artikel/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=10377&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=361&cHash=7cfc26c00c |title=Strategisch Plan 2020 vergt 700 miljoen euro |trans_title=Strategic Plan 2020 will take 700 million euro|date=3 January 2011 |publisher=Eindhoven University of Technology | language = Dutch|accessdate=17 January 2011[/tpl] Despite the economic crisis and the budget cutbacks announced by the Dutch government for the period up to 2014, the university has set itself an ambitious strategic vision for the period up to 2020. This vision includes establishing a University College to foster both in-depth and wide-interest, society-interest driven education for upcoming engineers; establishing a combined Graduate School to manage the graduate programs; an increase of the student body by 50 percent; a 50 percent increase in the number of annual Ph.D graduations; an increase of knowledge valorisation to a campus-wide score of 4.2; increasing the international position of the university to within the top-100 universities; and increasing the embedding of the university within the city and the Brainport region by transforming the campus into a high-grade science park with laboratories, housing facilities for 700 students and researchers and supporting facilities. Particularly the science park of the vision is costly, with an expected 700 million euro investment in the campus needed for realization of the plan.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]PDFLink|Strategisch Plan 2020|3.0Mb[/tpl]

==Organization==

The Eindhoven University of Technology is a public university of the Netherlands. As such its general structure and management is determined by the Wet op het Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (English: Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research). Between that law and the statutes of the university itself, the management of the university is organized according to the following chart:[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/organogram/ |title=Organogram |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=1 October 2010[/tpl]

===Executive college===

The day-to-day running of the university is in the hands of the Executive College (Dutch: College van Bestuur). The College provides oversight for the departments, the service organizations and the Innovation Lab, plus the local activities of the Stan Ackermans Institute. The College consists of three people, plus a secretary:

===Oversight of the executive college===

There are two bodies that provide oversight over the Executive College:

===Departments and service organizations===

Most of the work at the university is done in the departments and the service organizations.
Both for the departments and the service organizations, the staff (and students) are involved with the running of the body. For that reason both types of bodies have advisory councils which have advisory and co-decision authorities.

===TU/e Holding B.V.===

Over the past two decades, the TU/e has increasingly developed commercial interests and off-campus ties. These include commercial agreements and contracts directly between the university and external companies, but also interests in spinoff companies. In order to manage these kinds of contractual obligations the university started the TU/e Holding B.V. in 1997. The Holding is a limited company, dedicated to the commercial exploitation of scientific knowledge.[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/tue_holding_bv/ |title=TU/e Holding B.V. |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=1 October 2010[/tpl]

==Education==

===Departments===

The scientific departments (or faculties; Dutch: faculteiten) are the primary vehicles for teaching and research in the university. They employ the majority of the academic staff, are responsible for teaching and sponsor the research schools and institutions.
The vast majority of education is undergraduate education provided by the departments to students, who are adults with no other academic qualifications than a secondary education diploma. Some education is also provided to members of the postgraduate designer programs, but they are employed by the university and do not count as part of the student body.
Undergraduate education was given in four- or five-year programs until 2002, styled along the lines of the German system of education; graduates of these programs were granted an engineering title and allowed to prefix their name with the title ir. (an abbreviation of ingenieur; not to be confused with graduates of technical hogescholen, who were engineers abbreviated ing.). Starting in 2002, following the entry into force of the Bologna Accords, the university switched to the bachelor/master structure (students graduating in 2002 were given both an old-style engineering title and a new master's title). The undergraduate programs are now split into two programs each, a three-year bachelor program and a two-year master program. These programs are completely independent, in the sense that a bachelor can leave the university with his title and go to work, can enter a master's program at another university or continue on to the master's program of his department at the university. Of course bachelors from other universities can also enroll in the new master's programs.
The departments also offer Ph.D programs (Dutch: promotiefase) whereby a qualified master may earn a Ph.D. Unlike in anglo-saxon countries these are not educational programs, however; rather, a person working towards promotion is a research assistant, employed by the department, with teaching responsibilities in addition to his research work.
The TU/e has nine departments:

====Honors programs====

The university offers two honors programs for "top students": students who have proven to have a knack for studying, have the capacity to handle a higher academic load and have an interest in more depth in their programs. There are two honors programs, both aimed at the bachelor students:[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/ |title=Honors program |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 September 2010[/tpl]
Qualifying students can choose between the Honors programs, or follow both at the same time.

====Shared minors====

As of September 2010 the university offers bachelors in their third year a minor on sustainable energy. This minor will focus on providing students with skills needed to work in the sustainable energy industry, or to start their own company in this industry. For that reason the minor is driven entirely by problems supplied by industry and knowledge institutes, which minor students must solve in multidisciplinary teams. In addition, students must come up with an innovative plan and develop a start-up company.[tpl]Citation | year = 2010 | title = Nieuws:Onderwijs | periodical = Matrix, kwartaalblad van de Technische Universiteit Eindhoven | publication-place = Eindhoven | publisher = Eindhoven University of Technology | volume = 17 | issue = Fall 2010 | page = 15 | issn = 1380-247X | accessdate =30 September 2010[/tpl]

===Postgraduate designer programs===

The university started a number of postgraduate designer programs together with the other Dutch technical universities in 1986. These programs are currently managed by the Stan Ackermans Institute on behalf of the 3TU Federation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3tu.nl/en/education/sai/ |title=Stan Ackermans Institute |publisher=3tu.nl |date=2008-12-07 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl] Each program is two years in length and graduates earn a Professional Doctorate in Engineering and may call themselves "technical designers". There are a total of eleven program active, of which eight are available at the TU/e:Post MSc designer programs from the TU/e website
The post-MSc program as a whole graduated its 3.000th technical designer (Dipl.-Eng. Sissy Papatheologou, PDEng) on 16 September 2010.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/nieuws/artikel/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=9990&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=361&cHash=aa4682fb2a |title=TU's leveren 3000ste technologisch ontwerper af |date=17 September 2010 |publisher=Eindhoven University of Technology |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]

===Other educational programs===

The university hosts a number of other educational programs that are in some way related to the main educational programs. These include the teacher's program and an MBA program.

==Research==

The TU/e does not only host research in its departments. The TU/e participates in a large number of research institutes which balance in different ways between pure science and applied science research. Some of these institutes are bound strictly to the university, others combine research across different universities. Some have even been designated to be of national importance.

===Top in research partnerships with industry===

The TU/e is among the worldâ€™s ten best-performing research universities in terms of research cooperation with industry in 2011 (Number 1 in 2009). Ten to 20 percent of the scientific publications of these ten universities in the period 2006â€“2008 were the result of partnerships with researchers in industry. As well as TU/e and Delft University of Technology, the top 10 also includes two universities in Japan (Tokyo Institute of Technology and Keio University in Tokyo), two in Sweden (University of Gothenburg and  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm), and one each in Denmark (DTU Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby), Finland (University of Helsinki), Norway (Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim) and the USA (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/tue-among-world-top-in-research-partnerships-with-industry/ |title=TU/e among world top in research partnerships with industry |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]

===Technological Topinstitutes===

A Technological Topinstitute is a research institute that is a combined effort of different universities, commercial entities and the government. The Dutch government has identified a number of areas of research as "key areas" of vital, national interest and has commissioned a Top Institute for each of them. The TU/e hosts and manages two of them:

===Research schools===

The TU/e is commissioner and participant of a number of research schools:

==Off-campus activities==

The TU/e plays a central role in the academic, economic and social life of Eindhoven and the surrounding region. In addition the university maintains relations with institutions far beyond that region as well and participates in national and international events (sometimes through the student body).

===Economic and research motor===

The TU/e is enormously important to the economy of the Eindhoven region, as well as the wider areas of BrabantStad and the Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven. It provides highly skilled labor for the local knowledge economy and is a knowledge and research partner for technology companies in the area.
The historic basis for the university's role as an economy and research motor was the interaction with Philips. The university was founded primarily to address the need of Philips for local personnel with academic levels of education in electronics, physics, chemistry and later computer science. Later that interest spread to DAF and Royal Dutch Shell (which became the primary employer for graduates of the chemistry department). There was also a synergy with these companies in that senior personnel were hired from them to form the academic staff of the university (which led to the Eindhoven joke that the university trains the engineers and Philips trains the professors).
Changing economic times and business strategies changed the relationship during the 1980s and 1990s. As Philips started moving away from the region, its importance to the region and the university decreased. A struggle for economic survival forced the university to seek closer ties with the city and region of Eindhoven in the 1989â€“1995 period, resulting in the creation of the Brainport initiative to draw high tech business and industry to the region. The university started expending more effort in knowledge valorisation, in incubating technology startups, in providing direct knowledge support for local technology companies. Also the academic interests of the research shifted with the times, with more effort going into energy efficiency research, green technologies, and other areas of interest driven by social relevance (the call for better technology in the medical field, for example, led to cooperation with the Catharina Hospital and the University of Maastricht medical department and finally the creation of the Biomedical Technology department).
The TU/e is host (and in some cases also commissioner) of a number of highly successful research schools, including the ESI and the DPI. These research institutes are a source of high-tech knowledge for high-tech companies in the area, such as ASML, NXP and FEI. The university also plays a large role as knowledge and personnel supplier to other companies in the High Tech Campus Eindhoven and helps incubate startups through the Eindhoven Twinning Center. It is also a knowledge supporter of the automotive industry in the Helmond region.
In the extended region, the TU/e is part of the backbone of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle.ELAt.org The ELAt website This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the European Union (measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy); the agreement is based on the cooperative triangle that connects the three technical universities in those cities.

====Eindhoven Energy Institute====

As of the summer of 2010, the TU/e is host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute (EEI). The EEI is a virtual research institute (meaning that it doesn't have any actual offices or facilities), which manages and coordinates the activities of a large number of groups and subinstitutes in the general area of sustainable and alternative energy technologies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/research/research_schools_and_institutes/eindhoven_energy_institute/this_is_eei/ |title=This is EEI |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl]
The scientific director of the institute is prof.dr. RenÃ© Borst, who is also the dean of the Mechanical Engineering department. He is pro forma head of the research department, which is split into four key areas: Built Environment (energy usage and patterns in building, headed by prof.dr.ir. Jan Hensen from the Architecture and Building Department), Future Fuels (headed by prof.dr. Philip de Goey of Mechanical Engineering), Energy Conversion (headed by prof.dr.ir. RenÃ© Janssen from Chemical Engineering) and Fusion and Plasma (headed by prof.dr. Niek Lopes Cardozo from Physics). The EEI also incorporates the Graduate School on Sustainable Energy, which the TU/e had already established together with the TU Munich and DTU Lyngby. Secretarial services will be provided by the Center Technology for Sustainable Development (TDO) which also already existed at the TU/e (since 1994).[tpl]PDFLink|Matrix, the TU/e quarterly publication, summer edition 2010|2.3Mb; p.4-7[/tpl]
Energy research at the TU/e is among the best in academic Europe (a February 2010 study by Reed Elsevier puts it second only to Imperial College London).[tpl]PDFLink|Alternative Energy Leadership Study|1.6Mb[/tpl] This fact, as well as the unique attention to energy in the built-up environment, drew the attention of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The EEI is now a full co-location of EIT's KIC on Sustainable Energy (InnoEnergy).

===International cooperation and appeal===

The TU/e sets a lot of store by international contacts and cooperation. The university maintains active, academic cooperation with sister institutions in several different countries, for example:[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://stuvo.tue.nl/scholieren/studeren-aan-de-tue/where-innovation-starts/samenwerking.html |title=Samenwerking |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/education/studying-at-tue/why-study-at-tue/inter-national-partnerships/ |title=(Inter-)national partnerships |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]
The TU/e also provides education to an increasing number of foreign students and graduates. According to the 2009 annual report[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]PDFLink|Jaarverslag 2009|799.5kb[/tpl] in the academic year 2008â€“2009 there were 490 exchange students, 103 foreign nationals registered in a bachelor program, 430 in a master program, 158 in a professional doctorate program (79% of the total). In 2009 the university employed 37 foreign professors (15.9% of the total) and 16 foreign associate professors (12.8%). Overall, 29.5% of the university staff was non-Dutch.
In 2011/2012, the TU/e has Erasmus bilateral agreements with many universities in 30 countries across Europe in a diverse range of subjects for student exchange.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/education/exchange-programs/erasmus-and-leonardo-program/partner-institutions/ |title=Partner institutions |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]

===Technological sports===

In addition to the "regular" types of sports practiced among the student body and by the staff, the TU/e collaborates with the student body in a number of "technology sporting efforts". These usually take the form of cross-department projects, which makes them multidisciplinary efforts. Some examples include:

==Student organizations and facilities==

The university offers many different facilities for its student dy and hosts many different student organizations[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/navigatie/portals/studentenverenigingen/|title=TU Eindhoven associations for students|publisher=TU Eindhoven|accessdate=2010-09-19[/tpl] on campus as well.

===Student and study associations===

There are two main types of student clubs at Dutch universities: student associations (Dutch: studentenvereniging) and study associations (Dutch: studievereninging). The first are somewhat analogous to fraternities and sororities in the United States, except that they tend to be coed. The second are linked to the departments and educational programs.

====Study associations====

====Student associations====

There are three main student associations associated with the TU/e, plus a number of independent clubs:

===Culture, international association and spirituality===

There are several associations, clubs and circles associated with the TU/e, which are meant to help students and staff develop themselves in non-academic areas. Such areas include cultural development, building international contacts and investigating spiritual beliefs.

====Cultural activities====

The following associations organize activities with cultural or social/societal relevance:

====International associations====

====Spirituality and philosophy====

===Sport associations===

There are many sports associations within the university. They are overseen by the general sports council ESSF.

==Service organizations==

There university is more than just the departments, research bodies and the students. There are several ancillary activities necessary to the running of the university, activities that cross the boundaries and interests of the different departments. These activities are carried out by the universities' service organizations.
The university has the following service organizations:

==Distinguished alumni==

==Distinguished and otherwise notable faculty==

===Notable honors for research done at the university===

==Spinoffs==

Over the years several spin off companies have been started by TU/e graduates, based on some research done at the university. Examples include:

==International acclaim==

On the 2009 THEâ€“QS World University Rankings (From 2010 two separate rankings will be produced by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings)
