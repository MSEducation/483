Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released eight studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.
Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990's country rock sound to a current "eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres."[tpl]cite web |date=September 25, 2012 |title=Indie-Rockers Wilco Make First Appearance At The Cascade Theatre Sept 26 |url=http://anewscafe.com/2012/09/25/indie-rockers-wilco-make-first-appearance-at-the-cascade-theatre-sept-26/ |author=Press Release[/tpl]
Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."[tpl]cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|authorlink=David Fricke|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archivedate = September 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 18, 2007. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011.

==History==

===Formation===

Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy.[tpl]cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|publisher=No Depression|date=Fall 1995|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928002617/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 9, 2007. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, A.M..Undertownmusic.com[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band.[tpl]cite news|last=Sheridan|first=Phil|title=Roger, Wilco|publisher=Magnet|date=February 1995[/tpl] The group named itself "Wilco" after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for "will comply",Kot 2004. p. 89 a choice which Tweedy has called "fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves."Cynthia Bowers (August 23, 2009).

===A.M. and Being There===

After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song "The T.B. is Whipping Me" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994.[tpl]cite news|last=Dawne|first=Vanessa|title=Wilco (interview)|publisher=Pop Culture Press|year=1995[/tpl] A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract.Kot 2004. p. 92 Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's "It's Just That Simple"—appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.
Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."[tpl]cite news|last=Cameron|first=Keith|title=Last Twang in Town|publisher=Vox|date=May 1997[/tpl] A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt.[tpl]cite news|title=Heatseekers|publisher=Billboard|date=April 15, 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=The Billboard 200|publisher=Billboard|date=October 7, 1995[/tpl] The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll.[tpl]cite news|last=George-Warren|first=Holly|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/230153/review/5942185/am|title=Wilco: A.M.

Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure.Kot 2004. p. 97 Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.
Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as "Black Shampoo").[tpl]cite news|last=Kuelker|first=Michael|title=New Wilco Satisfies Tupelo Fans|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|date=November 19, 1994[/tpl] Last accessed September 2, 2007.
During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:Kot 2004. p. 110–1
 The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on "Misunderstood," where I'm playing guitar. 
A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including "Sunken Treasure" and "Hotel Arizona",Kot 2004. p. 112 however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M.[tpl]cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html|title=Being There, Doing That|publisher=No Depression|date=September 1996|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507025218/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html |archivedate = May 7, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 11, 2007. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on "Far, Far Away" and "Dreamer in My Dreams", and then became an official member in September 1996.Kot 2004. p. 115Kot 2004. p. 119
Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort.Kot 2004. p. 114 The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.Kot 2004. p. 116 Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone.[tpl]cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r241294|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Being There > Overview|publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Last accessed July 11, 2007.[tpl]cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there|title=Being There (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 24, 1996|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070619094452/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there |archivedate = June 19, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 11, 2007.

===Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions===

In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album.Kot 2004. p. 138 The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature.Kot 2004. p. 135 Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's "bold, but depressing" lyrics.Kot 2004. p. 140–1 Wilco recorded several songs, including "Via Chicago" and "She's a Jar," but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.
Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a "relic" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was "the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody." Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.Kot 2004. p. 143
Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols—Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a "freak weirdo". The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.Kot 2004. p. 144–5
Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded "you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker." Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.
Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.Kot 2004. p. 151–3 The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.[tpl]cite news|last=Marcus|first=Greil|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue|title=Mermaid Avenue (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=June 1, 1998|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071002102709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue |archivedate = October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 14, 2007.[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=2579&name=Billy+Bragg+%26+Wilco|title=CG: Billy Bragg & Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com[/tpl] Last accessed July 14, 2007.

After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.Kot 2004. p. 169
After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools.Kot 2004. p. 154–5 Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:Kot 2004. p. 158
 The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for. 
During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc..Kot 2004. p. 161 As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this "once and once only" and recorded a radio-friendly version of "Can't Stand It" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department.Kot 2004. p. 162–5 The single version of "Can't Stand It" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There.Kot 2004. p. 167 This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|publisher=The Village Voice[/tpl] Last accessed July 15, 2007.
After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. "Someday Some Morning Sometime," featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the "piece to the puzzle" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.Kot 2004. p. 175 The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol. III, also part of Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions.

===Yankee Hotel Foxtrot===

Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.Kot 2004. p. 168 The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur.Kot 2004. p. 177–9 Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.Kot 2004. p. 186–8
Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.Kot 2004. p. 195–6 Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as "Poor Places", only featured the Loose Fur trio.Kot 2004. p. 198–9 The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards.[tpl]cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|title=In from the Cold|publisher=Mojo|date=May 2002[/tpl] The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco.
Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.Kot 2004. p. 201 Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions.Kot 2004. p. 202 He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.Kot 2004. p. 203
Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.Kot 2004, p. 207 The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request.[tpl]cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|title=Wilco's Shot in the Arm|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=August 15, 2001|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010826133635/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|archivedate=August 26, 2001[/tpl] Last accessed via the Wayback Machine on July 15, 2007. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco "bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether" after Wilco was "unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'"Allmusic Wilco Biography allmusic.com To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked:Kot 2004. p. 209
 We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, "we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again." They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me! 
As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s.Kot 2004. p. 225–6 The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002.

===Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago===

While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day.Kot 2004. p. 220 Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to "create something good in the world right now" and record some material.Kot 2004. p. 221 Influenced by Bill Fay's Time of the Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down with Wilco was released in 2003.Kot 2004. p. 222 Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco, joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.
In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live.Kot 2004. p. 240–1 The album featured the song "Less Than You Think", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called "the track that everyone will hate". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:

===Sky Blue Sky===

Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.
Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song "What Light" as a free MP3 download.[tpl]cite web|last=Crock|first=Jason|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42415-interview-wilco|title=Interview: Wilco|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=May 7, 2007[/tpl] Last accessed July 16, 2007. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Inc. and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar).[tpl]cite web|url=http://wilcoworld.net/news/index.php|title=Wilco–News|publisher=wilcoworld.net[/tpl] Last accessed July 16, 2007.[tpl]cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051724/wilco-takes-a-spin-with-volkswagen-for-tv-ads|title=Wilco Takes a Spin with Volkswagen for TV Ads|publisher=Billboard|date=June 5, 2007[/tpl] Last accessed July 16, 2007.[tpl]cite news|last=Caro|first=Mark|url=http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/tv/mmx-0610_pop1jun10,0,2442800.story?coll=mmx-television_heds|title=Does VW Deal Make Wilco a Sellout?|publisher=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080117005346/http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/tv/mmx-0610_pop1jun10,0,2442800.story?coll=mmx-television_heds |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 26, 2007.

Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco "shines on a handful of the songs" on Sky Blue Sky, such as the "light, and straightforward" songs. While he calls the album "great traditional rock and folk album at times", he states that "once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances ... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.30music.com/rev.php?mode=revrec&rev=2030 |title= "Sky Blue Sky" (CD) |last=Brubaker |first=James |date=May 15, 2007 |work=30music.com [/tpl] Last accessed February 28, 2008. The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as "deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to" and noting its "impeccable sound quality," the reviewer claimed that "Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=25762 |title= Sky Blue Sky |last=Collette |first=Doug |date=June 9, 2007 |work=Allaboutjazz.com [/tpl] Last accessed February 28, 2008.
Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album's "breezy atmosphere and pacing," and noted that it is not "easily judged upon first listen." Overall, Hernandez stated that it "may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lostatsea.net/review.phtml?id=12361925304652f9100a2f1 |title= Sky Blue Sky |last=Hernandez |first=Pablo |date=May 22, 2007 |work=Lost at Sea Magazine [/tpl] Last accessed February 28, 2008.
Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as "one of the best albums of the year," calling it a "timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class" and "a lean, mean, soulful album."

They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the Oxfam-benefiting album including "You Never Know", "What Could Have Been", "Over and Done" and "Don't Forget Me". Jeff Tweedy co-wrote "Too Blue" with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John and Pat play on most tracks on the album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/07/29/neil-finn-recruits-wilco-radiohead-members-for-7-worlds-collides-the-sun-came-out/ |title=Rollingstone.com |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl]
Having enjoyed their time in New Zealand and the vibe of Finn's own Roundhead Studios, the four members stayed in Auckland through January to record the foundation tracks for their next album.  Jim Scott, who acted as engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions.  Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen would later add overdubs to these tracks at the band's Chicago Loft.

==Musical style and influence==

Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock.Ankeny, Jason & Johnson, Zac. Wilco > Overview. Allmusic. Retrieved August 28, 2007.

John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, "It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for—that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?"[tpl]cite news|last=Mulvey|first=John|title=Pet Sounds|publisher=Uncut|date=May 2002[/tpl]

Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry.Kot 2004. p. 136
