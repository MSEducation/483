[[Megaraptora]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods

Megaraptora is a group of large carnivorous theropod dinosaurs with controversial relationships. Phylogenetic studies conducted by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte (2010) and Carrano, Benson and Sampson (2012) recovered the group as a branch of the allosauroids (specifically within the family Neovenatoridae), part of a large group of carnosaurs that also includes the sinraptorids, carcharodontosaurids, and allosaurids. This would make megaraptorans the last surviving allosauroids; at least one megaraptoran, Orkoraptor, lived near the end of the Mesozoic era, dating to the early Maastrichtian stage of the latest Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = R.B.J. | last2 = Carrano | first2 = M.T | last3 = Brusatte | first3 = S.L. | year = 2010 | title = A new clade of archaic large-bodied predatory dinosaurs (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) that survived to the latest Mesozoic | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 97 | issue = 1| pages = 71–78 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0614-x | pmid=19826771 | bibcode=2010NW.....97...71B[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Matthew T.

(2012), while confirming that Neovenator was closely related to carcharodontosaurids, simultaneously found Megaraptor and related genera to be coelurosaurs closely related to tyrannosaurids.[tpl]cite journal | author=F.

==Classification==

The cladogram presented here follows the 2010 analysis by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte. Another study published later in 2010 also found the Australian theropod Rapator to be a megaraptoran extremely similar to Australovenator.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Agnolin | first1 = Ezcurra | last2 = Pais | first2 =  | last3 = Salisbury | first3 =  | year = 2010 | title = A reappraisal of the Cretaceous non-avian dinosaur faunas from Australia and New Zealand: Evidence for their Gondwanan affinities | url = | journal = Journal of Systematic Palaeontology | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 257–300 | doi=10.1080/14772011003594870[/tpl]
