Rural flight (or rural exodus) is the migratory pattern of peoples from rural areas into urban areas.  It is urbanization seen from the rural perspective.
In modern times, it often occurs in a region following the industrialization of agriculture—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.  Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.
This phenomenon was first articulated through Ernst Georg Ravenstein's Laws of migration in the 1880s, upon which modern theories are based.

==Historical trends==

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. Ancient Athens and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000 paling in comparison with their current populations.[tpl]cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353–391[/tpl]
The onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of the checks that had previously constrained urban populations. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers moved into place, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the beginning of rural flight on a massive scale. The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.[tpl]cite web|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl] While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in Western Europe and the United States, as industrialization spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and urbanization followed quickly behind. Today, rural flight is an especially distinctive phenomenon in some of the newer urbanized areas including China and more recently sub-Saharan Africa.[tpl]cite web|last=Juan|first=Shan|title=Rural exodus to cities continue|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-08/08/content_15652220.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]

===Dust bowl===

The shift from mixed subsistence farming to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century.  New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as Deere plows, mechanical reapers, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production.[tpl]cite book | last=Cronon| first=William| title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West| publisher=Norton| location=New York| year=1991[/tpl]  The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions.  Most homesteaders had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.
During the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the 1930s, large numbers of people fled rural areas of the Great Plains and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high debt loads exacerbated by several years of drought and large dust storms.[tpl]cite book | last=Cooper| first=Michael L.| title=Dust to eat: drought and depression in the 1930s| publisher=Clarion| location=New York| year=2004[/tpl] Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, such as John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath (1939), in which a family from the Great Plains migrates to California during the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.

===Modern rural flight===

Post-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of industrialized agriculture.  Small, labor-intensive family farms have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms.  While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products—all requiring substantial labor—large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced.  For example, Iowa State University reports the number of hog farmers in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=Iowa State University| accessdate=25 November 2009[/tpl]
The consolidation of the feed, seed, processed grain, and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas.  This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor.  Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults.  The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.

===Abandonment of small towns===

The loss of population in rural areas leads to the abandonment of small towns, turning their once thriving downtown areas into empty or underutilized storefronts.[tpl]cite book | last=Bauer| first=Douglas| title=Prairie City, Iowa: Three Seasons at Home|publisher=University of Iowa Press| location=Iowa City| date=2008 (1979)| url=http://uipress.uiowa.edu/books/2008-fall/bauer.htm[/tpl]  The rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retailed outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution."Changes in Iowa farm structure"; University of Iowa Extension;

==Determinants of rural flight==

There are several determinants, push and pull, that contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.

===Economic determinants===

Some migrants choose to leave rural communities out of the desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the Harris-Todaro Model, migration to urban areas will continue as long as “expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product” (127).[tpl]cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]  Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.[tpl]cite web|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2675947.pdf?&acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|publisher=International Migration Review|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl] At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates. The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as chain migration, migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.[tpl]cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]
Some families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.[tpl]cite web|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/4391333.pdf?acceptTC=true&acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|publisher=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]

===Social determinants===

In other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants.  A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Tarique|coauthors=Khan, Jabir|title=Determinants of Rural Out-Migration in India|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Management and Social Sciences|date=December 2012|volume=1|issue=12|url=http://www.academia.edu/5450848/DETERMINANTS_OF_RURAL_OUT-MIGRATION_IN_INDIA_INTRODUCTION|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl] 
Rural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms – demonstrating leadership and self-respect.[tpl]cite web|last=Min-Harris|first=C.|title=Youth migration and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: Empowering the Rural Youth|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/africa/YouthMigration.pdf|publisher=Disponible en ligne dans le site|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl] With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. 
Lastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States for example led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as 1 out of every 4 residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s.[tpl]cite web|title=Mass Exodus from the Plains|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-mass-exodus-plains/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]  More recently, drought in Syria from 2006-2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.[tpl]cite news|last=Aukalh|first=R.|title=A rural exodus as drought takes hold of Syria|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/03/16/a_rural_exodus_as_drought_takes_hold_of_syria.html|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=16 March 2013[/tpl]

==In the United States and Canada==

The terms are used in the United States and Canada to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the Great Plains and Midwest regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast.  It is also particularly noticeable in parts of Atlantic Canada (especially Newfoundland), since the collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields in 1992.

==China==

China, like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the hukou system, greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has slowly lifted the restrictions upon internal migration leading to a great increase in the number of internal migrants, especially towards the city.[tpl]cite journal|last=Liang|first=Zai|coauthors=Zhongdong Ma|title=China's floating population: new evidence from the 2000 census|journal=Population and development review|year=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=467–488|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_in_China#cite_note-Liang_2004_467.E2.80.93488-3|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl] However, even today, the hukou system limits the ability of rural migrants to receive full access to urban social services at the urban subsidized costs.
As with most examples of rural flight, several factors, both push and pull, have led towards China’s massive urbanization. Income disparity, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas.[tpl]cite web|title=Labour Migration|url=http://www.ilo.org/beijing/areas-of-work/labour-migration/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International labour organization|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl] Approximately, 250 million rural migrants now live in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.[tpl]cite web|title=China's cities: The Great Transition|url=http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21599360-government-right-reform-hukou-system-it-needs-be-braver-great|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]

==Germany==

===Middle ages===

Rural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century.  A corresponding principle of German law is Stadtluft macht frei ("city air makes you free"), in longer form Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag ("city air makes you free after a year and a day"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a serf who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.

===German Landflucht===

Landflucht ("flight from the land") refers to the mass migration of peasants into the cities that occurred in Germany (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.
In 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%.SchapiroShotwell; 1922, p. 300.  In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Posen, Silesia, and Pomerania lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities,Kirk1969, p. 139. where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class;Mises2006, p. 8.  One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.Shafir 1996, p. 150.
Landflucht resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture.  Mechanized agriculture and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachsenganger), became more common.  This was especially true in the province of Posen that was gained by Prussia when Poland was partitioned.  The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the "Polish corridor" after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland after World War II.  Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as game preserves.Drage 1909, p. 77.
The word landflucht has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.McLean, Kromkowski 1991, p. 56.

==Russia and the former Soviet states==

Rural flight began later for Russia and the former states of the USSR as compared to Western Europe. In 1926, only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War 2 and the decades immediately proceeding, rural migration proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians were living in urban areas.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wadekin|first=Karl-Eugen|title=Internal Migration and the Flight from the Land in USSR|journal=Soviet Studies|date=October 1966|volume=18|issue=2|pages=131–152|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.rice.edu/stable/pdfplus/149517.pdf?&acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid urbanization of the USSR. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sonin|first=M. Ya.|title=Vosproizvodstvo rabochei sily v SSSR i balans truda|date=March 1959|page=144[/tpl]  Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district.  Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the fall of the Soviet Union, rural flight has been reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wegren|first=Stephen K.|title=Rural Migration and Agrarian Reform in Russia: A Research Note|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|date=July 1995|volume=47|issue=5|pages=877–888|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.rice.edu/stable/pdfplus/152691.pdf?acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=30 March 2014[/tpl] 
Rural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and Ukraine experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like Central Asia, experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.
Rural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.  In particular, the Soviet kolkhoz system, the collective farms in the Soviet Union, aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the kolkhoz system replaced family farms throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government often unadjusted to inflation, living conditions were quite low for Russian peasants especially compared to urban life.[tpl]cite web|last=Editors of the Encyclopedia Britannica|title=kolkhoz|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]   While  Brezhnev's wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life was still suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated. 
Although migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.

==Mexico==

Rural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arizpe|first=Lourdes|title=The Rural Exodus in Mexico and Mexican Migration to the United States|journal=International Migration Review|date=Winter 1981|volume=15|issue=4|pages=626–649|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.rice.edu/stable/pdfplus/2545516.pdf?acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]
In the 1930s, President Cardenas implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940-1965 as the “Golden Era for Mexican Migration.”  During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in Mexico City demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.  Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for migration to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.
However, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to artificially regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.  This regulation severely undercut the market price of maize lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the Green Revolution had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of Norman Borlaug, farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.[tpl]cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|coauthors=Kilman, Scott[/tpl]  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shaw|first=R. Paul|title=Land Tenure and the Rural Exodus in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=October 1974|volume=23|issue=1|pages=123–132|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.rice.edu/stable/pdfplus/1153146.pdf?&acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]  A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population.[tpl]cite journal|last=Osorio|first=S.R|title=Estructura Agrariay Desarrollo Agricola en Mexico|journal=Mexico: Fondo de Cultura  Economica|year=1974[/tpl] The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.

==Consequences of rural flight==

Rural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights.  Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.
Additionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.
Women, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.
