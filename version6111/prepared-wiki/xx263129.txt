==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Steve Leggett awarded the album 4 stars stating "Nothing is particularly innovative with this set, but these tracks don't push or pull against themselves, either, and there's a clear joy coming off of the floor as these musicians, all in the early phases of their careers, do what they do with comforting assurance".Leggett, S.
