==Regulation==

Regulatory notes:

==Usage in domain hacks==

Domains within the .am ccTLD enjoy popularity due to the connection to AM radio (similar to the .fm and .tv ccTLDs), and the ability to form English words ending in "am" â€” e.g. the mobile photo sharing service Instagram uses the Armenian domain name Instagr.am.  American music artist and producer Will.I.Am uses the domain for his website. Financial company J. P. Morgan also uses a .am domain to stand for "Assessment Management". Such unconventional usage of TLDs in domain names are called domain hacks.
