==Professional career==

Šķēle started his pro career very early by debuting at age of 16 for Brocēni which at the time was top team in Latvia. In 2001 he moved to Poland where he signed multi-year contract (3+3) with Anwil Włocławek, where he played very well and began to attract attention from stronger clubs. At that time he was a highly rated prospect in Europe and his game was compared to Serbian star Aleksandar Đorđević.Terra.com [tpl]es icon[/tpl] In 2004 he was candidate for NBA Draft, but ultimately went undrafted.
Following experience in Poland he played two seasons in Belgium. In summer of 2006 he was bought out from contract with Anwil by Latvian side Barons LMT that reportedly cost them around 70 000 euros. With Barons he spent three seasons and most successful was in 2007–2008 when Šķēle won the FIBA EuroCup and the Latvian Basketball League championships.
After three seasons with Barons in 2009 off-season Šķēle's contract with Barons ended and he wanted to leave for a stronger team. He had multiple offers from Spain's ACB League clubs as well as few from Italian Lega A, but eventually they couldn't close an agreement and Šķēle was without club until late October when he moved to Lega A club Basket Napoli. Team in Naples had financial problems and after few months it went bankrupt and Šķēle had to look for a new team. At that period for a second time in his life he suffered meningitis. Surprisingly Šķēle made amazing comeback in the same season and returned to the court after being out only three months by joining Latvian squad BK Ventspils.
In summer of 2010 Šķēle's agent couldn't find a suitable team and he had to wait eight months till early 2011 when he signed with Ukraine's Ferro-ZNTU. After only one game Ukrainian club decided to break agreement, because they feared Šķēle wasn't healthy enough after previous health issues, although he practiced with team without any restrictions. Soon after his short stint in Ukraine Šķēle moved to Estonia by signing with BC Kalev/Cramo.
Šķēle has played three seasons for Kalev/Cramo, winning Estonian championship in each year. In summer of 2013 he re-signed with Kalev/Cramo for one more season.
