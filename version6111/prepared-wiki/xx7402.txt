His father was a clothes presser and an actor, and his mother was a seamstress and an actress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Martin-Scorsese.html|title=Martin Scorsese Biography (1942–2011)|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] His father's parents emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, in the province of Palermo, Sicily, and his mother was also of Italian descent. Her parents, too, were from Palermo. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment. As a boy, he had asthma and could not play sports or do any activities with other children and so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed passion for cinema. Scorsese has cited Sabu and Victor Mature as his favourite actors during his youth and has spoken of the influence of the 1947 Powell-Pressburger film Black Narcissus, whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4|title=Black Narcissus (The Criterion Collection) (2001) DVD commentary|publisher=Criterion|accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl] Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, Land of the Pharaohs and El Cid, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neo-realist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how Bicycle Thieves alongside Paisà, Rome, Open City inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini's Paisà, which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life. He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/new-wave-cinema-guide/nouvelle-vague-where-to-start.shtml|title=New Wave Film Guide: Nouvelle Vague & International New Wave Cinema - Where to Start|publisher=Newwavefilm.com|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl] He has also cited filmmakers including Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Federico Fellini as a major influence on his career.[tpl]cite web|author=Chris Ingui|publisher=Hatchet|url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2002/03/04/Arts/Martin.Scorsese.Hits.Dc.Hangs.With.The.Hachet-195598.shtml|title=Martin Scorsese hits DC, hangs with the Hachet|accessdate=June 6, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Raging Bull: A film review|author=Jay Antani|year=2004|publisher=Filmcritic.com|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Raging-Bull|accessdate=May 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Andre Soares|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/directors/martin-scorsese-on-michelangelo-antonioni/|title=Martin Scorsese on Michelangelo Antonioni|publisher=Altfg.com|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Ingmar Bergman Foundation|url=http://193.10.144.136/page.asp?guid=65BFD29C-045F-4C51-88B1-1A50F6173D26|title=Ingmar Bergman|publisher=193.10.144.136|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=uysS8EHrpB4|title=Martin Scorsese praises Federico Fellini and 'La Dolce Vita'|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl] His initial desire to become a priest[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1257300/Shutter-Island-Scorseses-Psycho-stylish-scary-masterpiece.html|title=Scorsese's Psycho is a stylish, scary masterpiece|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=March 11, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011|location=London|first=Chris|last=Tookey[/tpl] while attending Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx gave way to cinema and consequently, Scorsese enrolled in NYU's University College of Arts and Science, (now known as the College of Arts and Science), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964.

==Career==

===Early career===

Scorsese attended New York University's film school (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966)[tpl]Cite web |title=Martin Scorsese|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/scorsese/|work=sensesofcinema.com|first=Marc|last=Raymond|date=May 2002|publisher=Senses of Cinema|postscript=[/tpl] making the short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67.[tpl]Cite news|title=Finding the boy again|url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/Finding-the-boy-again.2317392.jp|newspaper=The Scotsman|author=Alistair Harkness|date=April 11, 2002[/tpl] Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian-American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.
In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at My Door with his fellow students actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semi-autobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included his later film, Mean Streets.

===1970s===

Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s: Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. It was Brian De Palma who introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro. During this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary Woodstock (1970) and met actor-director John Cassavetes, who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor. Scorsese is also credited as one of the cameramen who photographed the infamous late-1969 Altamont rock festival for the Rolling Stones film Gimme Shelter (1970).

====Mean Streets====

In 1972 Scorsese made the Depression-era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie producer Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with next to no money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with Mean Streets. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make rather than someone else's projects.
Championed by influential movie critic Pauline Kael, Mean Streets was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of Mean Streets was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller and early Jean-Luc Godard.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage|work=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1991|first=Hal|last=Hinson[/tpl]
In 1974, actress Ellen Burstyn chose Scorsese to direct her in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with Italianamerican, a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.

====Taxi Driver====

Taxi Driver followed in 1976 – Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's slow descent into insanity.
The film established Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer Michael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle. The film co-starred Jodie Foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, Matthew, called "Sport".
Taxi Driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin Arthur Bremer and Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson. Writer/director Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and Scorsese's later Bringing Out the Dead.[tpl]cite web|last=Thurman|first=John|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/37/taxi_driver/|title=Citizen Bickle, or the Allusive Taxi Driver: Uses of Intertextuality|publisher=Sensesofcinema.com|date=April 5, 1976|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl]
Already controversial upon its release, Taxi Driver hit the headlines again five years later, when John Hinckley, Jr. made an assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's Taxi Driver character (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1813797,00.html|title='I was in a bad place'|publisher=Guardian|date=July 6, 2006|location=London|first=Geoffrey|last=MacNab|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl]
Taxi Driver won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,[tpl]cite web|title=Festival Archives: Taxi Driver|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2123.html|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=February 14, 2008[/tpl] also receiving four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, although all were unsuccessful.
Scorsese was subsequently offered the role of Charles Manson in the movie Helter Skelter and a part in Sam Fuller's war movie The Big Red One, but he turned both down. However, he did accept the role of a gangster in exploitation movie Cannonball directed by Paul Bartel. In this period there were also several directorial projects that never got off the ground including Haunted Summer, about Mary Shelley and a film with Marlon Brando about the Indian massacre at Wounded Knee.

====New York, New York and The Last Waltz====

The critical success of Taxi Driver encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical New York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure.
New York, New York was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Liza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by Frank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison to his earlier work.
Despite its weak reception, the film is positively regarded by some critics. Richard Brody in The New Yorker wrote: "For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films."[tpl]cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2008/01/28/080128gomo_GOAT_movies_brody |title=Top of the Heap |work=The New Yorker |agency=DVD Notes (column) |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2013[/tpl]
The disappointing reception that New York, New York received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded The Last Waltz, documenting the final concert by The Band. It was held at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978.
Another Scorsese-directed documentary titled American Boy also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in Taxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health.
Scorsese also helped provide footage for the documentary Elvis on Tour.

===1980s===

====Raging Bull====

By several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded Scorsese to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film, Raging Bull. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, calling it a Kamikaze method of film-making.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,867652,00.html|title='Are we ever going to make this picture?'|publisher=Guardian|date=January 3, 2003|first=Alex|last=Williams|location=London[/tpl] The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's Sight & Sound magazine.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,,112416,00.html|title=Martin Scorsese: Raging Bull|publisher=Guardian|date=December 9, 1999|first=Derek|last=Malcolm|location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-02-07-dvd-raging-bull_x.htm|title='Raging Bull' returns to the ring|work=USA Today|date=February 7, 2005|first=Mike|last=Snider[/tpl] It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Robert De Niro, and Scorsese's first for Best Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went to Robert Redford for Ordinary People.
Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: Taxi Driver and New York, New York had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html|title=Raging Bull|publisher=Eufs.org.uk|date=March 5, 2001|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] Thematically too, the concerns carried on from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.
Although the screenplay for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote Mean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was re-written several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.[tpl]Cite news|title=Ageing bulls return|publisher=Observer|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,98151,00.html|date=October 31, 1999|first=Mark|last=Morris|location=London[/tpl]
The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the #1 American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked Raging Bull as the 24th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked Raging Bull as the 4th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.

====The King of Comedy====

Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). A satire on the world of media and celebrity, it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes.[tpl]cite web|author=evil jimi|url=http://www.ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/koc.html|title=The King of Comedy|publisher=Ehrensteinland.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] The expressionism of his recent work here gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however, such as its focus on a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (murder and kidnapping).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html|title=The King of Comedy Film Review|publisher=Timeout.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl]
The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favourite films.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm|title=The Official Site|publisher=Wim Wenders|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl]
Next Scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the movie Anna Pavlova (also known as A Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, Michael Powell. This led to a more significant role in Bertrand Tavernier's jazz movie Round Midnight.
In 1983 Scorsese began work on a long-cherished personal project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 (English translation 1960) novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis, who was introduced to the director by actress Barbara Hershey when they were both attending New York University in the late 1960s. The movie was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.)

====After Hours====

After the collapse of this project Scorsese again saw his career at a critical point, as he described in the documentary Filming for Your Life: Making 'After Hours[tpl]'-[/tpl] (2004). He saw that in the increasingly commercial world of 1980s Hollywood, the highly stylized and personal 1970s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status. Scorsese decided then on an almost totally new approach to his work. With After Hours (1985) he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style – his way of staying viable. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and featured cameos by such disparate actors as Teri Garr and Cheech and Chong. A bit of a stylistic anomaly for Scorsese, After Hours fits in well with popular low-budget "cult" films of the 1980s, e.g. Jonathan Demme's Something Wild and Alex Cox's Repo Man.

====The Color of Money====

Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video "Bad", in 1986 Scorsese made The Color of Money, a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman, which co-starred Tom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorcese's established style, The Color of Money was the director's first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: The Last Temptation of Christ. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories.

====The Last Temptation of Christ====

After his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal film-making with the Paul Schrader-scripted The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988. Based on Nikos Kazantzakis's controversial 1960 book, it retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Even prior to its release the film caused a massive furore, worldwide protests against its blasphemy effectively turning a low budget independent movie into a media sensation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html|title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.
Looking past the controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man).
Along with directors Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola, in 1989 Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film New York Stories, called "Life Lessons".

===1990s===

====Goodfellas====

After a decade of mostly mixed results, gangster epic Goodfellas (1990) was a return to form for Scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since Raging Bull. De Niro and Joe Pesci offered a virtuoso display of the director's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named Goodfellas "the best mob movie ever" and is ranked #1 on Roger's movie list for 1990, along with Gene Siskel and Peter Travers, the film is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023|title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml)|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089|title=GoodFellas|publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071011152454rn_2/www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089|archivedate=October 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html|title=GoodFellas (1990)|publisher=Filmsite.org|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl]
The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination for Goodfellas but again lost to a first-time director, Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves). Joe Pesci earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Goodfellas. Scorsese and the film won numerous awards, including five BAFTA Awards, a Silver Lion and more.
The American Film Institute put Goodfellas at #94 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version they moved Goodfellas up to #92 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and they put Goodfellas at #2 on their list of the top 10 Gangster films (after The Godfather).
In 1990, Scorsese acted in a cameo role as Vincent van Gogh in the film Dreams by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.

====Cape Fear====

1991 brought Cape Fear, a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name, and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter (1955). Cape Fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter did give Scorsese a chance to experiment with a dazzling array of visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning eighty million dollars domestically, it would stand as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until The Aviator (2004), and then The Departed (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

====The Age of Innocence====

The Age of Innocence (1993) was a huge departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a box office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted in Scorsese on Scorsese by editor/interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.
Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece". His friend Jay Cocks gave him the Wharton novel in 1980, suggesting that this should be the romantic piece Scorsese should film as Cocks felt it best represented his sensibility. In Scorsese on Scorsese he noted that:
Scorsese, who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that made an emotional impact on him. In Scorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti's Senso and his Il Gattopardo as well as Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons and also Roberto Rossellini's La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV. Although The Age of Innocence was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films.
It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar.
This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award winning actor, Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again in Gangs of New York.

====Casino====

1995's expansive Casino, like The Age of Innocence before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success,http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again being an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance.
During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.

====A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies====

Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995 offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career, stating "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as; (1) the director as storyteller, (2) the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on, (3) the director as a smuggler - filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films and (4) the director as an iconoclast.

====Kundun====

If The Age of Innocence alienated and confused some fans, then Kundun (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People's Liberation Army's entering of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not least a departure in subject matter, Kundun also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colourful visual images.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html|title=Kundun|publisher=Time Out|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl]
The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Disney, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kunduns commercial profile.
In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term however, it generally appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the director's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ.

====Bringing Out the Dead====

Bringing Out the Dead (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier Taxi Driver.[tpl]cite web|title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese’s Films   Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst|url=http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/|publisher=Screen Crush|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl] Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert|title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead|publisher=Film-philosophy.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of After Hours.)

It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette.

===2000s===

====Gangs of New York====

In 1999 Scorsese also produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known as My Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic Gangs of New York (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous Cinecittà film studios.
With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, Gangs of New York was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films.
The production was highly troubled with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,860378,00.html|title=Gangs of Los Angeles | News | Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=December 15, 2002|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London[/tpl] Despite denials of artistic compromise, Gangs of New York revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks, here surfaced in abundance.[tpl]Cite news|author=Peter Bradshaw|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,871400,00.html|title=Gangs of New York | Reviews | Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=January 10, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epinions.com/content_136317079172|title=Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Gangs of New York at|publisher=Epinions.com|date=July 1, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author=Xan Brooks|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,871715,00.html|title=Past master | Features | Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=January 9, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London[/tpl] The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator Elmer Bernstein was rejected at a late stage for a score by Howard Shore and mainstream rock artists U2 and Peter Gabriel.[tpl]cite web|title=Listening to the Academy Awards: Oscar-Nominated Film Scores|url=http://www.npr.org/news/specials/oscars2002/scores.html|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=18 April 2014|year=2002[/tpl] The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes in length. The film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 75% of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying "Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/|title=Gangs of New York|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl]
Nonetheless, the themes central to the film were consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and sub-cultural divisions down ethnic lines.
Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the Oscar season of late 2002.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,680795,00.html|title=In briefs: Gangs of New York release delayed again|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=April 8, 2002|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London[/tpl]
Gangs of New York earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, Gangs of New York received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, however it did not win in any category.
Scorsese also had uncredited involvement as executive producer with the 2002 film Deuces Wild, written by Paul Kimatian.[tpl]cite web|title=Deuces Wild (2002)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,201837,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=7 February 2002[/tpl]

====The Blues====

The following year Scorsese completed production of The Blues, an expansive seven part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, Clint Eastwood, Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled "Feel Like Going Home").

====The Aviator====

Scorsese's film The Aviator (2004), is a lavish, large-scale biopic of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul Howard Hughes and reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/aviator/ |title=The Aviator |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author=Brian Libby|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/salon/0,,1404293,00.html|title=Are you talking to me – again?|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=February 2, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Right-guy-wrong-film/2005/02/25/1109180100911.html|title=Right guy, wrong film|publisher=Theage.com.au|date=February 27, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=Melbourne[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=10596|title=Empire Reviews Central – Review of The Aviator|publisher=Empireonline.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=(Posted: December 15, 2004)|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6143001/review/6769078/the_aviator|title=Aviator : Review|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] The film also met with widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition.
The Aviator was nominated for six Golden Globe awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005, The Aviator became the most-nominated film of the 77th Academy Awards nominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all of the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Cate Blanchett), and Alan Alda for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Despite having a leading tally, the film ended up with only five Oscars: Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby (which also won Best Picture).

====No Direction Home====

No Direction Home is a documentary film by Martin Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformation from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident.
The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the PBS American Masters series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the BBC Two Arena series) on September 26–27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released that same month.
The film won a Peabody award and the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received an Emmy nomination for it.

====The Departed====

Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller The Departed, based on the Hong Kong police drama Infernal Affairs. Along with Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, The Departed was Scorsese's first collaboration with Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen.
The Departed opened to widespread critical acclaim with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990's Goodfellas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=reviews&id=7778|title=Review: Departed, The|publisher=Chud.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15256&reviewer=198|title=Movie Review – Departed, The|publisher=eFilmCritic|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/d/departed.html|title=Reel Views|publisher=Reel Views|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-departed-310756/review|title=All Movie – The Departed|publisher=Allmovie.com|date=October 6, 2006|accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl]
With domestic box office receipts surpassing $129,402,536, The Departed was Scorsese's highest grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010's Shutter Island.
Martin Scorsese's direction of The Departed earned him his second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his first Directors Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director. While being presented with the award, Scorsese said "Could you double-check the envelope?" It was presented to him by his longtime friends and colleagues Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The Departed also received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, her third win for a Scorsese film.

====Shine a Light====

Shine a Light is a concert film of rock and roll band The Rolling Stones' performances at New York City's Beacon Theater on October 29 and November 1, 2006, intercut with brief news and interview footage from throughout the band's career.
The film was initially scheduled for release on September 21, 2007, but Paramount Classics postponed its general release until April 2008. Its world premiere was at the opening of the 58th Berlinale Film Festival on February 7, 2008.
