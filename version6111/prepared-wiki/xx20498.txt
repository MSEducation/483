[[Insomnia]]

CATEGORIES: Sleep disorders, Psychiatric diagnosis

Insomnia, or sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep as long as desired.  While the term is sometimes used to describe a disorder demonstrated by polysomnographic evidence of disturbed sleep, this sleep disorder is often practically defined as a positive response to either of two questions: "Do you experience difficulty sleeping?" or "Do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?"
Insomnia is most often thought of as both a medical sign and a symptom[tpl]Cite book|last= Hirshkowitz |first= Max |editor= Stuart C. Yudofsky and Robert E.

Insomnia is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomnia can occur at any age, but it is particularly common in the elderly.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-148-1-200801010-01001|title= Insomnia|author=Wilson, Jennifer F.|year=2008|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=148|pages=ITC1  [/tpl] Insomnia can be short term (up to three weeks) or long term (above 3–4 weeks), which can lead to memory problems, depression, irritability and an increased risk of heart disease and automobile related accidents.[tpl]cite journal|author=Zahn, Dorothy|title=Insomnia: CPJRPC|journal=The Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal|year=2003[/tpl]
Those who are having trouble sleeping sometimes turn to sleeping pills, which can help when used occasionally but may lead to substance dependence or addiction if used regularly for an extended period.Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2010). Psychology. 2nd ed. p. 195. New york: Worth Publishers, ISBN 1429237198.
Insomnia can be grouped into primary and secondary, or comorbid, insomnia.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/17/application/Section24_GAD.pdf |title=Dyssomnias |accessdate=2009-01-25 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |pages=7–11[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last = Buysse | first = Daniel J. | year = 2008 | title = Chronic Insomnia | journal = Am J Psychiatry| volume = 165 | issue = 6| pages = 678–86 | pmid = 18519533 | pmc = 2859710| doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08010129 | quote = For this reason, the NIH conference 2005 commended the term "comorbid insomnia" as a preferable alternative to the term "secondary insomnia."

==Classification==

===DSM-5 criteria for insomnia"Sleep Wake Disorders ." Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.. 5th ed. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2013. -. Print.===

The DSM-5 criteria for insomnia include the following:
Predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:
In addition,
note: The DSM-5 criteria for insomnia is intended for use by general mental health and medical clinicians (those caring for adult, geriatric, and pediatric patients).

===Types of insomnia===

Insomnia can be classified as transient, acute, or chronic.

===Patterns of insomnia===

Sleep-onset insomnia is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, often a symptom of anxiety disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as insomnia as it causes a delayed period of sleep, spilling over into daylight hours.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/15402002.2011.557989[/tpl]
It is common for patients who have difficulty falling asleep to also have nocturnal awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep. Two thirds of these patients wake up in middle of the night, with more than half having trouble falling back to sleep after a middle of the night awakening.[tpl]cite book|last=Doghramji|first=Karl|title=Clinical Management of Insomnia|year=2007|publisher=Professional Communications, Inc.|location=Caddo, OK|isbn=978-1-932610-14-7|page=28[/tpl]
Early morning awakening is an awakening occurring earlier (more than 30 minutes) than desired with an inability to go back to sleep, and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression.[tpl]cite book|last=Morin|first=Charles|title=Insomnia: A Clinician's Guide to Assessment and Treatment|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-306-47750-5|page=16[/tpl]

===Poor sleep quality===

Poor sleep quality can occur as a result of, for example, restless legs, sleep apnea or major depression.  Poor sleep quality is caused by the individual not reaching stage 3 or delta sleep which has restorative properties.
Major depression leads to alterations in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing excessive release of cortisol which can lead to poor sleep quality.
Nocturnal polyuria, excessive nighttime urination, can be very disturbing to sleep.[tpl]Cite pmid|15994219[/tpl]

===Subjective insomnia===

Some cases of insomnia are not really insomnia in the traditional sense. People experiencing sleep state misperception often sleep for normal durations, yet severely overestimate the time taken to fall asleep. They may believe they slept for only four hours while they, in fact, slept a full eight hours.

==Causes and comorbidity==

Symptoms of insomnia can be caused by or be co-morbid with:
Sleep studies using polysomnography have suggested that people who have sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Mendelson WB|title=New Research on Insomnia: Sleep Disorders May Precede or Exacerbate Psychiatric Conditions|journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=7 |year=2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/insomnia/article/10168/1163082[/tpl]

===Steroid hormones and insomnia===

Studies have been conducted with steroid hormones and insomnia. Changes in levels of cortisol, progesterone in the female cycle, or estrogen during menopause are correlated with increased occurrences of insomnia. Those with differing levels of cortisol often have long-term insomnia, where estrogen is onset insomnia catalyzed by menopause, and progesterone is temporary insomnia within the monthly female cycle.

====Cortisol====

Cortisol is typically thought of as the stress hormone in humans, but it is also the awakening hormone.[tpl]cite journal|author=Teran-Perez, G.; Arana-Lechuga, Y.; Esqueda-Leon, E.; Santana-Miranda, R.; Rojas-Zamorano, J.A.; Velazquez Moctezuma|title=Steroid Hormones and Sleep Regulation|pmid=23092405|year=2012|volume=12|issue=11|pages=1040–8|journal=Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry|doi=10.2174/138955712802762167[/tpl] Analyzing saliva samples taken in the morning has shown that patients with insomnia wake up with significantly lower cortisol levels when compared to a control group with regular sleeping patterns.[tpl]cite journal|author=Backhaus, J.; Junghanns, K.; Hohagen, F. |title=Sleep disturbances are correlated with decreased morning awakening salivary cortisol|pmid=15219642|year=2004|volume=29|issue=9|pages=1184–91|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2004.01.010|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology[/tpl] Further studies have revealed that those with lower levels of cortisol upon awakening also have poorer memory consolidation in comparison to those with normal levels of cortisol.[tpl]cite journal|author=Backhaus, J.; Junghanns, K.; Born, J.; Hohaus, K.; Faash, F.; Hohagen, F. |title=Impaired Declarative Memory Consolidation During Sleep in Patients With Primary Insomnia: Influence of Sleep Architecture and Nocturnal Cortisol Release|pmid=16876140|year=2006|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1324–30|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.051|journal=Biological Psychiatry[/tpl] Studies support that larger amounts of cortisol released in the evening occurs in primary insomnia. In this case, drugs related to calming mood disorders or anxiety, such as antidepressants, would regulate the cortisol levels and help prevent insomnia.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rodenbeck, A.; Cohrs, S.; Jordan, W.; Huether, G.; Ruther, E.; Hajek, G. |title=The sleep-improving effects of doxepin are paralleled by normalized plasma cortisol secretion in primary insomnia: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study followed by an open treatment over 3 weeks|pmid=13680082 | doi=10.1007/s00213-003-1565-0|volume=170|issue=4|date=Dec 2003|journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl)|pages=423–8[/tpl]

====Estrogen====

Many postmenopausal women have reported changes in sleep patterns since entering menopause that reflect symptoms of insomnia. This could occur because of the lower levels of estrogen. Lower estrogen levels can cause hot flashes, change in stress reactions, or overall change in the sleep cycle, which all could contribute to insomnia. Estrogen treatment as well as estrogen-progesterone combination supplements as a hormone replacement therapy can help regulate menopausal women’s sleep cycle again.[tpl]cite journal|author=Saletu-Zyhlarz, G.; Anderer, P.; Gruber, G.; Mandl, M.; Gruber, D.; Metka, M.; Huber, J.; Oattel, M.; Graser, T.; Abu-Bakr, M.H.; Gratzhofer, E.; Saletu, B. |year=2003|title=Insomnia related to postmenopausal syndrome and hormone replacement therapy: Sleep laboratory studies on baseline differences between patients and controls and double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations on the effects of a novel estrogen-progesterone combination (Climodien, Lafamme) versus estrogen alone|journal= Journal of Sleep Research|pmid=12941063|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2003.00356.x|volume=12|issue=3|pages=239–54[/tpl]

====Progesterone====

Low levels of progesterone throughout the female menstruation cycle, but primarily near the end of the luteal phase, have also been known to correlate with insomnia as well as aggressive behavior, irritability, and depressed mood in women.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ziomkiewicz, A.; Pawlowski, B.; Ellison, P.T.; Lipson, S.F.; Thune, I.; Jasienska, G. |title=Higher luteal progesterone is associated with low levels of premenstrual aggressive behavior and fatigue|pmid=22906865|year=2012|volume=91|issue=3|pages=376–82|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.08.001|journal=Biological Psychology[/tpl] Around 67% of women have problems with insomnia right before or during their menstrual cycle.Michaud, E.; Bain, J. (2013). Menstrual Insomnia. Reader’s Digest. Lower levels of progesterone can, like estrogen, correlate with insomnia in menopausal women.
A common misperception is that the amount of sleep required decreases as a person ages. The ability to sleep for long periods, rather than the need for sleep, appears to be lost as people get older. Some elderly insomniacs toss and turn in bed and occasionally fall off the bed at night, diminishing the amount of sleep they receive.American Family Physician: Chronic Insomnia: A Practical Review. Aafp.org (1999-10-01). Retrieved on 2011-11-20.

===Risk factors===

Insomnia affects people of all age groups but people in the following groups have a higher chance of acquiring insomnia.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of the sleep disorder insomnia has multiple factors that come into play. A qualified sleep specialist should be consulted in the diagnosis of any sleep disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken. The diagnosis should start with looking at the patient’s past medical history and a physical examination to rule out insomnia being caused by any other medical conditions. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment.Passarella, S, Duong, M. “Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia.” 2008. The individual should keep a sleep diary for one or two weeks to help sleep specialist get an in-depth look at his/her sleep history. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening and subjective feelings in the morning. Some patients may need to do a sleep study to determine if insomnia is present. The sleep study will involve the assessment tools of a polysomnogram and the multiple sleep latency test and will be conducted in a sleep center or a designated hotel. Some sleep studies may be conducted at home and the results taken to the sleep specialist for review.
Specialists in sleep medicine are qualified to diagnose the many different sleep disorders. Patients with various disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome, are often mis-diagnosed with primary insomnia.  When a person has trouble getting to sleep, but has a normal sleep pattern once asleep, a circadian rhythm disorder is a likely cause.
In many cases, insomnia is co-morbid with another disease, side-effects from medications, or a psychological problem. Approximately half of all diagnosed insomnia is related to psychiatric disorders.  In depression in many cases "insomnia should be regarded as a co-morbid condition, rather than as a secondary one;" insomnia typically predates psychiatric symptoms.  "In fact, it is possible that insomnia represents a significant risk for the development of a subsequent psychiatric disorder."
Knowledge of causation is not necessary for a diagnosis.[tpl]Cite pmid| 20813762[/tpl]

==Treatment==

It is important to identify or rule out medical and psychological causes before deciding on the treatment for insomnia.[tpl]Cite pmid|12182689[/tpl] Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) "has been found to be as effective as prescription medications are for short-term treatment of chronic insomnia.  Moreover, there are indications that the beneficial effects of CBT, in contrast to those produced by medications, may last well beyond the termination of active treatment."[tpl]cite pmid|17308547[/tpl]  Pharmacological treatments have been used mainly to reduce symptoms in acute insomnia; their role in the management of chronic insomnia remains unclear.  Several different types of medications are also effective for treating insomnia. However, many doctors do not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for long-term use. It is also important to identify and treat other medical conditions that may be contributing to insomnia, such as depression, breathing problems, and chronic pain.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1653524|title=Isomnia|author=Merrigan, Jill M.; Buysse, Daniel J.; Bird, Joshua C. and Livingston, Edward H. |journal=JAMA|year= 2013|volume=309|issue=7|pages=733|doi=|pmid=23423421[/tpl]

===Non-pharmacological===

Non-pharmacological strategies have comparable efficacy to hypnotic medication for insomnia and they may have longer lasting effects. Hypnotic medication is only recommended for short-term use because dependence with rebound withdrawal effects upon discontinuation or tolerance can develop.National Prescribing Service (2010-02-01). "Addressing hypnotic medicines use in primary care". NPS News, Vol 67.
Non pharmacological strategies provide long lasting improvements to insomnia and are recommended as a first line and long term strategy of management. The strategies include attention to sleep hygiene, stimulus control, behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, paradoxical intention, patient education and relaxation therapy.[tpl]Cite pmid|10533351[/tpl] Reducing the temperature of blood flowing to the brain slows the brain's metabolic rate thereby reducing insomnia.[tpl]cite news|last=Hagan|first=Pat|title=The blast of cold air that cures insomnia.|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1199448/The-blast-cold-air-cures-insomnia.html|accessdate=14 July 2009|newspaper=MailOnline|date=14 July 2009[/tpl] Some examples are keeping a journal, restricting the time spending awake in bed, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule and a wake-up time. Behavioral therapy can assist a patient in developing new sleep behaviors to improve sleep quality and consolidation. Behavioral therapy may include, learning healthy sleep habits to promote sleep relaxation, undergoing light therapy to help with worry-reduction strategies and regularizing the biological clock.
EEG biofeedback has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia with improvements in duration as well as quality of sleep.[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Lake | first1 = James A. | title = Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Bt5euqMwbpYC&pg=PA313 | date = 31 October 2006 | publisher = Thieme Medical Publishers | isbn = 1-58890-299-4 | page = 313 [/tpl]
Sleep hygiene is a common term for all of the behaviors which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs.Ellis, J. J., Hampson, S. E., & Cropley, M. M. “Sleep hygiene or compensatory sleep practices: an examination of behaviors affecting sleep in older adults”. 2002 These behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment.  Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. Daytime napping can be used to supplement total sleep if it is not achieved during the night. Napping like exercise should not be done near the time the individual is going to go to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from the view of the individual trying to sleep. The room should also be kept at a comfortable temperature and dark to allow ease of sleep. If one cannot fall asleep within 20 minutes of getting in bed they should get up and do something relaxing until that they feel tired and should not return to bed unless they feel they can fall asleep within 20 minutes.
Stimulus control therapy is a treatment for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed, or sleep in general, with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred interchangeably with the concept of sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep or sex only, not for activities such as reading or watching television; waking up at the same time every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not result in a reasonably brief period of time after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during nighttime hours, and eliminating daytime naps.[tpl]Cite pmid|21178150[/tpl]
A component of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, a technique that aims to match the time spent in bed with actual time spent asleep. This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain times of the day and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy, which is often used to help early morning wakers reset their natural sleep cycle, can also be used with sleep restriction therapy to reinforce a new wake schedule. Although applying this technique with consistency is difficult, it can have a positive effect on insomnia in motivated patients.
Paradoxical intention is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead of attempting to fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory that may explain the effectiveness of this method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).[tpl]Cite pmid|19057243[/tpl]
Meditation has been recommended for the treatment of insomnia. The meditation teacher Siddhārtha Gautama, 'The Buddha', is recorded as having recommended the practice of 'loving-kindness' meditation, or mettā bhāvanā as a way to produce relaxation and thereby, sound sleep – putting it first in a list of the benefits of that meditation.Anguttara Nikaya XI.16. Metta Sutta. Good Will. University of Western Florida More recently, studies have concluded that: a mindfulness practice reduced mental and bodily restlessness before sleep and the subjective symptoms of insomnia;[tpl]cite journal|author=Cincotta, Andrea |year=2009|title= The effects of a mindfulness-based stress management program on pre-sleep arousal and insomnia symptoms: A pilot study|isbn=110914833X|doi=10.1002/smi.1370|last2=Gehrman|first2=Philip|last3=Gooneratne|first3=Nalaka S.|last4=Baime|first4=Michael J.|journal=Stress and Health|volume=27|issue=3|pages=e299[/tpl] and that mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy reduced restlessness, sleep effort and dysfunctional sleep-related thoughts[tpl]cite pmid|18502250[/tpl] including worry.[tpl]cite pmid|18552629[/tpl]

====Cognitive behavioral therapy====

There is some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is superior in the long-term to benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines in the treatment and management of insomnia.[tpl]Cite pmid|22631616 [/tpl] In this therapy, patients are taught improved sleep habits and relieved of counter-productive assumptions about sleep. Common misconceptions and expectations that can be modified include: (1) unrealistic sleep expectations (e.g., I need to have 8 hours of sleep each night), (2) misconceptions about insomnia causes (e.g., I have a chemical imbalance causing my insomnia), (3) amplifying the consequences of insomnia (e.g., I cannot do anything after a bad night's sleep), and (4) performance anxiety after trying for so long to have a good night's sleep by controlling the sleep process. Numerous studies have reported positive outcomes of combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia treatment with treatments such as stimulus control and the relaxation therapies. Hypnotic medications are equally effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia but their effects wear off over time due to tolerance. The effects of CBT-I have sustained and lasting effects on treating insomnia long after therapy has been discontinued.[tpl]Cite pmid|15451764[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|10086433[/tpl] The addition of hypnotic medications with CBT-I adds no benefit in insomnia. The long lasting benefits of a course of CBT-I shows superiority over pharmacological hypnotic drugs. Even in the short term when compared to short-term hypnotic medication such as zolpidem (Ambien), CBT-I still shows significant superiority. Thus CBT-I is recommended as a first line treatment for insomnia.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Miller, K. E. |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs. Pharmacotherapy for Insomnia |journal=American Family Physician |year=2005 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0715/p330.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606060237/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0715/p330.html|archivedate=2011-06-06[/tpl] Metacognition is also a recent trend in approach to behaviour therapy of insomnia.[tpl]cite pmid|22975073[/tpl]

====Prevention====

Insomnia can be short-term or long-term. Prevention of the sleep disorder may include maintaining a consistent sleeping schedule, such as waking up and sleeping at the same time. Also, one should avoid caffeinated drinks during the 8 hours before sleeping time. While exercise is essential and can aid the process of sleeping, it is important to not exercise right before bedtime, therefore creating a calm environment. Lastly, one's bed should only be for sleep and possibly sexual intercourse.  These are some of the points included in sleep hygiene. Going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day can create a steady pattern, which may help against insomnia.[tpl]cite doi|10.1001/jama.2012.6219[/tpl]

====Internet interventions====

Despite the therapeutic effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited by a lack of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense.[tpl]cite pmid|15951083[/tpl] One way to potentially overcome these barriers is to use the Internet to deliver treatment, making this effective intervention more accessible and less costly. The Internet has already become a critical source of health-care and medical information.Fox S, Fallows D. (2005-10-05) Internet health resources. Washington, DC: Pew Internet & American Life Project; 2003. Although the vast majority of health websites provide general information,[tpl]cite journal|author=Rabasca L. |title=Taking telehealth to the next step|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr00/telehealth.aspx|journal= Monitor on Psychology|year= 2000|volume=31|pages=36–37[/tpl] there is growing research literature on the development and evaluation of Internet interventions.Marks IM, Cavanagh K, Gega L. (2007) Hands-on Help: Computer-Aided Psychotherapy. Hove, England and New York: Psychology Press, ISBN 184169679X.[tpl]cite doi|10.1037/0735-7028.34.5.527[/tpl]
These online programs are typically behaviorally-based treatments that have been operationalized and transformed for delivery via the Internet.  They are usually highly structured; automated or human supported; based on effective face-to-face treatment; personalized to the user; interactive; enhanced by graphics, animations, audio, and possibly video; and tailored to provide follow-up and feedback.
A number of Internet interventions for insomnia have been developedL. Ritterband et al., 2011; L. M. Ritterband et al., 2009; Ström, Pettersson, & Andersson, 2004; Vincent & Lewycky, 2009 and a few of them have been evaluated as part of scientific research trials.
A paper published in 2012 reviewed the related literature[tpl]cite pmid|22585048[/tpl] and found good evidence for the use of Internet interventions for insomnia.

===Medications===

Many insomniacs rely on sleeping tablets and other sedatives to get rest. In some places medications are prescribed to over 95% of insomniac cases.[tpl]cite journal|author=Harrison C, Britt H |year=2009|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200905/200905beach.pdf |title=Insomnia|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume= 32|page=283[/tpl] The percentage of adults using a prescription sleep
aid increases with age. During 2005–2010, about 4% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over reported that they took prescription sleep aids in the past 30 days. Prevalence of use was lowest among the youngest age group (those aged 20–39) at about 2%, increased to 6% among those aged 50–59, and reached 7% among those aged 80 and over. More adult women (5.0%) reported using  prescription sleep aids than adult men (3.1%). Non-Hispanic white adults reported higher use of sleep aids (4.7%) than non-Hispanic black (2.5%) and Mexican-American (2.0%) adults. No difference was shown between non-Hispanic black adults and Mexican-American adults in use of prescription sleep aids.Chong Y., Fryar, C.D., and Gu, Q. (2013). Prescription Sleep Aid Use Among Adults: United States, 2005–2010. Hyattsville, Md.: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. As an alternative to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief from taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine.[tpl]Cite journal |author1 =Consumer Reports|author1-link =Consumer Reports |author2 = Drug Effectiveness Review Project |author2-link =Drug Effectiveness Review Project |date=January 2012 |title=Evaluating statin drugs to treat High Cholesterol and Heart Disease: Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price |publisher = Consumer Reports |work = Best Buy Drugs |pages = 3, 8, 11 |url = http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/InsomniaUpdate-FINAL-July2008.pdf |accessdate = 4 June 2013[/tpl] Certain classes of sedatives such as benzodiazepines and newer nonbenzodiazepine drugs can also cause physical dependence, which manifests in withdrawal symptoms if the drug is not carefully tapered down. The benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications also have a number of side-effects such as day time fatigue, motor vehicle crashes, cognitive impairments and falls and fractures. Elderly people are more sensitive to these side-effects.[tpl]Cite pmid|16284208[/tpl] The non-benzodiazepines zolpidem and zaleplon have not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance. Some benzodiazepines have demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance in the short term but in the longer term are associated with tolerance and dependence. Drugs that may prove more effective and safer than existing drugs for insomnia are in development.[tpl]Cite pmid |16517453 [/tpl]
Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines have similar efficacy that is not significantly more than for antidepressants.[tpl]cite pmid|17619935[/tpl] Benzodiazepines did not have a significant tendency for more adverse drug reactions. Chronic users of hypnotic medications for insomnia do not have better sleep than chronic insomniacs not taking medications. In fact, chronic users of hypnotic medications have more regular nighttime awakenings than insomniacs not taking hypnotic medications.[tpl]Cite pmid|7624493[/tpl] A further review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine hypnotic as well as the nonbenzodiazepines concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health and lack evidence of long-term effectiveness. The risks include dependence, accidents, and other adverse effects. Gradual discontinuation of hypnotics in long-term users leads to improved health without worsening of sleep. It is preferred that hypnotics be prescribed for only a few days at the lowest effective dose and avoided altogether wherever possible in the elderly.[tpl]Cite pmid|15587763[/tpl]

====Antihistamines====

The antihistamine diphenhydramine is widely used in nonprescription sleep aids such as Benadryl.  The antihistamine doxylamine is used in nonprescription sleep aids such as Unisom (USA) and Unisom 2 (Canada).  In some countries, including Australia, it is marketed under the names Restavit and Dozile. It is the most effective over-the-counter sedative currently available in the United States, and is more sedating than some prescription hypnotics.DrugBank: DB00366 (Doxylamine). Drugbank.ca. Retrieved on 2011-11-20.
While the two drugs mentioned above are available over the counter in most countries, the effectiveness of these agents may decrease over time, and the incidence of next-day sedation is higher than for most of the newer prescription drugs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Anticholinergic side-effects may also be a draw back of these particular drugs. While addiction does not seem to be an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use.

====Benzodiazepines====

The most commonly used class of hypnotics prescribed for insomnia are the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. But certain benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have significantly higher activity at the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the α1 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnotics – alprazolam and diazepam in turn have higher activity at the α2 subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the α1 subunit is associated with sedation, motor-impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the α2 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines are better suited to treat insomnia than others. Hypnotic benzodiazepines include drugs such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, triazolam, flurazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, and quazepam. These drugs can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, and the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation, especially after consistent usage over long periods of time. Benzodiazepines, while inducing unconsciousness, actually worsen sleep as they promote light sleep while decreasing time spent in deep sleep.[tpl]Cite pmid|1679317[/tpl] A further problem is, with regular use of short-acting sleep aids for insomnia, daytime rebound anxiety can emerge.[tpl]Cite pmid|10976252[/tpl] Benzodiazepines can help to initiate sleep and increase sleep time, but they also decrease deep sleep and increase light sleep. Although there is little evidence for benefit of benzodiazepines in insomnia and evidence of major harm, prescriptions have continued to increase.[tpl]Cite book| author=Carlstedt, Roland A. | title = Handbook of Integrative Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Medicine: Perspectives, Practices, and Research | date = 13 December 2009 | publisher = Springer| url = http://books.google.com/?id=4Tkdm1vRFbUC | isbn = 0-8261-1094-0 | pages = 128–130 [/tpl] There is a general awareness that long-term use of benzodiazepines for insomnia in most people is inappropriate and that a gradual withdrawal is usually beneficial due to the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines and is recommended whenever possible.[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Lader | first1 = Malcolm Harold | last2 = P.

====Non-benzodiazepines====

Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone, are a class hypnotic medications indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight.[tpl]cite pmid|23248080[/tpl] However, there are controversies over whether these non-benzodiazepine drugs are superior to benzodiazepines. These drugs appear to cause both psychological dependence and physical dependence, though less than traditional benzodiazepines and can also cause the same memory and cognitive disturbances along with morning sedation.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

====Antidepressants====

Some antidepressants such as amitriptyline, doxepin, mirtazapine, and trazodone can have a sedative effect, and are prescribed to treat insomnia.[tpl]Cite pmid|15519538[/tpl] Amitriptyline and doxepin both have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties, which contribute to their side-effect profile, while mirtazapines side-effects are primarily antihistaminergic, and trazadones side-effects are primarily antiadrenergic. Some also alter sleep architecture. As with benzodiazepines, the use of antidepressants in the treatment of insomnia can lead to withdrawal effects; withdrawal may induce rebound insomnia.
Mirtazapine is known to decrease sleep latency, promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia.[tpl]Cite pmid|14658972[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|12566938[/tpl]

====Melatonin====

Melatonin is a hormone synthesized by the pineal gland, secreted through the bloodstream in the dark or commonly at nighttime, in order to control the sleep cycle.[tpl]cite doi|10.1586/ern.10.1[/tpl]
Evidence for ramelteon looks promising.[tpl]cite pmid|22897464[/tpl] It and tasimelteon, increase sleep time due to a melatonin rhythm shift with no apparent negative effectives next day.[tpl]cite doi|10.2165/00002512-200623040-00001[/tpl] Although thus far there has been little evidence of abuse, but most melatonin drugs have not been highly tested for longitudinal side effects because of the lack of approval, except for Ramelteon, from the Food and Drug Administration, concluding that all the risks are not known at this time.  It is recommended that people who take melatonin take it at night right before going to bed.[tpl]cite web|title=Melatonin, Web M.D.|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-940-MELATONIN.aspx?activeIngredientId=940&activeIngredientName=MELATONIN|accessdate=2 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Reilly|first=T|title=How can travelling athletes deal with jet lag?|journal=Kinesiology|year=2009|volume=41|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/70889[/tpl]
Studies have also shown that children with Autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and other related neurological diseases can benefit from the use of melatonin. This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders. For example, children with ADHD tend to have trouble falling asleep because of their hyperactivity and, as a result, tend to be tired during most of the day. Children who have ADHD then, as well as the other disorders mentioned, are given melatonin before bedtime in order to help them sleep. The sleep cycle regulates for these children when given the melatonin supplement.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sánchez-Barceló|first=Emilio|coauthors=Mediavilla, Maria; Reiter, Russel J.|title=Clinical Uses of Melatonin in Pediatrics|journal=International Journal of Pediatrics|year=2011|doi=10.1155/2011/892624|volume=2011|pages=1[/tpl]

====Alcohol====

Alcohol is often used as a form of self-treatment of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to make up for lost time by producing more glutamine than it needs.
The increase in glutamine levels stimulates the brain while the drinker is trying to sleep, keeping him/her from reaching the deepest levels of sleep.Perry, Lacy. (2004-10-12) HowStuffWorks "How Hangovers Work". Health.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-20. Stopping chronic alcohol use can also lead to severe insomnia with vivid dreams. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Lee-chiong | first1 = Teofilo | title = Sleep Medicine: Essentials and Review | date = 24 April 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | url = http://books.google.com/?id=s1F_DEbRNMcC&pg=PT105 | isbn = 0-19-530659-7 | page = 105 [/tpl]

====Other====

Opioid medications such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine are used for insomnia that is associated with pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects. Opioids can fragment sleep and decrease REM and stage 2 sleep. By producing analgesia and sedation, opioids may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with pain-associated insomnia. However, dependence on opioids can lead to suffering from long time disturbance in sleep.[tpl]cite doi|10.1097/ADT.0b013e3181fb2847[/tpl]

Some insomniacs use herbs such as valerian, chamomile, lavender, cannabis, hops, Withania somnifera, and passion-flower.
