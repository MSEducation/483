In common-law countries, adultery was also known as criminal conversation. This became the name of the civil tort arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury.Black's Law Dictionary, 4th ed. 1957. Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as crim. con., and was abolished in England in 1857, and the Republic of Ireland in 1976. Another tort, alienation of affection, arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person.Black's Law Dictionary, 4th ed. 1957, citing Young v. Young, 236 Ala. 627, 184 So. 187. 190. This act was also known as desertion, which was often a crime as well.Black's Law Dictionary. A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |title=Criminal Conversation: North Carolina Laws and Defense |publisher=Haas McNeil & Associates, P.A. |accessdate=2010-07-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080604043419/http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |archivedate = 2008-06-04[/tpl] Because of its abuse, at least one jurisdiction (Nevada) has abolished the tort of alienation of affection and has made it a misdemeanor crime to file such a lawsuit.
A marriage in which both spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is sometimes referred to as an open marriage or the Swinging lifestyle.  Both are a form of non-monogamy, and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as adultery. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extra-marital relations could still be considered adultery and a crime in some legal jurisdictions.
In Canada, though the written definition in the Divorce Act refers to extramarital relations with someone of the opposite sex, a British Columbia judge used the Civil Marriage Act in a 2005 case to grant a woman a divorce from her husband who had cheated on her with another man, which the judge felt was equal reasoning to dissolve the union.
In the United Kingdom, case law restricts the definition of adultery to penetrative sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, no matter the gender of the spouses in the marriage, although infidelity with a person of the same gender can be grounds for a divorce as unreasonable behavior; this situation was discussed at length during debates on the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill.[tpl]cite hansard |jurisdiction= | url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/lhan31.pdf | house=House of Lords | date=8–9 July 2013 |speaker=Tina Stowell, Baroness Stowell of Beeston|volume=747|no=31|column_start=145|column_end=147 |position=Lords Spokesperson for Women and Equalities[/tpl]
In India, adultery is the sexual intercourse of a man with a married woman without the consent of her husband when such sexual intercourse does not amount to rape. It is a non-cognizable, non-bailable criminal offence.  A police officer cannot arrest a person without a warrant in a case of adultery as adultery is a non-cognizable offence.Adultery : Indian Legal Perspectives

==Legal issues regarding paternity==

Historically, paternity of children born out of adultery has been seen as a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable contraception and paternity testing have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless have a legal presumption that a woman's husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a rebuttable presumption, many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challenged - such as a certain number of years from the birth of the child).http://www.biojuris.com/natural/3-2-0.html Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to inheritance.
Children born out of adultery suffered, until recently, adverse legal and social consequences. In France, for instance, a law that stated that the inheritance rights of a child born under such circumstances were, on the part of the married parent, half of what they would have been under ordinary circumstances, remained in force until 2001, when France was forced to change it by a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (and in 2013 the ECtHR also ruled that the new 2001 regulations must be also applied to children born before 2001).http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-116716#{%22itemid%22:%22001-116716%22}
There has been, in recent years, a trend of legally favoring the right to a relation between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the 'social' family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children.http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument

==Cultural and religious traditions==

===Greco-Roman world===

In the Greco-Roman world there were stringent laws against adultery, but these applied to sexual intercourse with a married woman. In the early Roman Law the jus tori belonged to the husband. It was therefore not a crime against the wife for a husband to have sex with a slave or an unmarried woman.Dig., XLVIII, ad leg. Jul.
It is well known that the Roman husband often took advantage of his legal immunity. Thus we are told by the historian Spartianus that Verus, the imperial colleague of Marcus Aurelius, did not hesitate to declare to his reproaching wife: "Uxor enim dignitatis nomen est, non voluptatis." ('Wife' connotes rank, not sexual pleasure, or more literally "Wife is the name of dignity, not bliss") (Verus, V).
Later in Roman history, as William E.H. Lecky has shown, the idea that the husband owed a fidelity similar to that demanded of the wife must have gained ground, at least in theory. Lecky gathers from the legal maxim of Ulpian: "It seems most unfair for a man to require from a wife the chastity he does not himself practice".Codex Justin., Digest, XLVIII, 5–13; Lecky, History of European Morals, II, 313.
The lending of wives practiced among some people was, as Plutarch tells us, encouraged also by Lycurgus, though from a motive other than that which actuated the practice (Plutarch, Lycurgus, XXIX). The recognized license of the Greek husband may be seen in the following passage of the Oration against Neaera, the author of which is uncertain, though it has been attributed to Demosthenes:
The Roman Lex Julia, Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis (17 BC), punished adultery with banishment [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/government/julianmarriage.php |title=The Julian marriage laws |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29[/tpl] The two guilty parties were sent to different islands ("dummodo in diversas insulas relegentur"), and part of their property was confiscated. Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.

===Abrahamic religions===

====Biblical sources====

The Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh or Old Testament) prohibits adultery in the seventh of the Ten Commandments ([tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|20:12|HE[/tpl]) (sixth Commandments in Christian enumeration and in verse [tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|20:14|NIV[/tpl]). Adultery in traditional Judaism applies unequally to both parties.
For instance, the Old Testament book of Leviticus prescribes capital punishment for adultery between a man and married woman, though not for adultery between a woman and a married man.
 
 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. (Lev. 20:10).

Furthermore, Deuteronomic code prescribes stoning not only for female extramarital sex, but also for female premarital sex in the case where the woman lies about her virginity.
 
 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, … and say, / I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid. / … But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: / Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die. (Deut. 22:13-21).

It also prescribes the same for engaged women who lie with another man, under the premise that if she allows the action without protesting, this indicates willingness.
 
 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; / Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city. (Deut. 22:23-24).

====Book of Mormon sources====

The Book of Mormon also prohibits adultery. For instance, Abinadi cites the Ten Commandments when he accuses Noah's priests of sexual immorality.Mosiah 13:22 When Jesus Christ visits the Americas he reinforces  the law and teaches them the higher law (also found in the New Testament):
Book of Mormon prophets and civil leaders often list adultery as an illegal activity along with murder, robbing, and stealing.Alma 30:10

====Christianity====

Adultery is considered by Christians to be immoral and a sin, based primarily on passages like [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9–10|NIV[/tpl]. Although [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:11|NIV[/tpl] does say that "and that is what some of you were. But you were washed", it still acknowledges adultery to be immoral and a sin. The sixth commandment (seventh in some traditions) ("Thou shalt not commit adultery") is also a basis, but see also Biblical law in Christianity.
Jesus taught that indulgence in adulterous thoughts could be just as harmful to the soul as actual adultery, and it is clear that both carry the same weight of guilt:
and He also says:
However, Christ also showed forbearance to those committing adultery, although still commanding repentance, perhaps most famously in the story related in the Eighth Chapter of John:
''Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear.
So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.” And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?”
She said, “No one, Lord.”
And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”''  ~John 8: 3-11
Some churches have interpreted adultery to include all sexual relationships outside of marriage, regardless of the marital status of the participants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/adultery |title=Guide to the Scriptures: Adultery |publisher=lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02[/tpl]

====Judaism====

Adultery in traditional Judaism applies to both parties, but depends on the marital status of the woman (Lev. 20:10). Though the Torah prescribes the death penalty for adultery, the legal procedural requirements were very exacting and required the testimony of two eyewitnesses of good character for conviction. The defendant also must have been warned immediately before performing the act.Maimonidies, Book of the Commandments, Prohibition 392 and the note at the end of Prohibition 347, Hebrew translation and notes by Rabbi Joseph Kapach, Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem 1971  A death sentence could be issued only during the period when the Holy Temple stood, and only so long as the Supreme Torah Court convened in its chamber within the Temple complex.Maimonides Mishneh Torah: Laws of Sanhedrin 14:11  Today, therefore, no death penalty applies.Talmud Bavli: Tractate Ketuvoth 30a,b The death penalty for adultery was strangulation,Talmud Bavli: Tractate Sanhedrin, folio 52b, towards the bottom except in the case of a woman who was the daughter of a Kohain (Aaronic priestly caste), which was specifically mentioned by Scripture by the death penalty of burning (pouring molten lead down the throat).Lev. 21:9 Ipso facto, there never was mentioned in Pharisaic or Rabbinic Judaism sources a punishment of stoning for adulterers as mentioned in John 8.
At the civil level, however, Jewish law (halakha) forbids a man to continue living with an adulterous wife, and he is obliged to divorce her. Also, an adulteress is not permitted to marry the adulterer, but, to avoid any doubt as to her status as being free to marry another or that of her children, many authorities say he must give her a divorce as if they were married.The Jewish Way in Love & Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper & Row, San Francisco,1980
According to Judaism, the Seven laws of Noah apply to all of humankind; these laws prohibit adultery with another man's wife.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Judges, Laws of Kings and Wars, Chapter 7 (Shabse Frankel edition, Jerusalem - B'nai B'rak, 5762 (c.2008, copyright 1998))

====Islam====

Zina (زنا) is an Arabic term for illegal intercourse; premarital or extramarital. Various conditions and punishments have been attributed to adultery.
Under Muslim law, adultery in general is sexual intercourse by a person (whether man or woman) with someone to whom they are not married. Adultery is a violation of the marital contract and one of the major sins condemned by Allah in the Qur'an:
Qur'anic verses prohibiting adultery include:
Punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely.Online Qur'an Project Chapter 24. It has been said that these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can get convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asmasociety.org/perspectives/article_8.html |title=American Muslims need to speak out against violations of Islamic Shariah law |publisher=Asmasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl]
The punishment prescribed by the Qur'an is flogging 100 times in public for those found guilty. According to the prophet Muhammad, an unmarried person who commits adultery or fornication is punished by flogging 100 times; a married person, however, may receive the heavier punishment of stoning to death if convicted of adultery.Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found support for stoning as a punishment for adultery mostly in Arab countries, such as in Egypt (82% of respondents in favor of the punishment) and Jordan (70% in favor), as well as Pakistan (82% favor), whereas Nigeria (56% in favor) and in Indonesia (42% in favor) opinion is more divided, perhaps due to diverging traditions and differing interpretations of Sharia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah |title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah Retrieved 2011-06-02 |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl]

===Other historical practices===

In Native American cultures, severe penalties could be imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband. In many instances she was made to endure a bodily mutilation which would, in the mind of the aggrieved husband, prevent her from ever being a temptation to other men again.Schoolcraft, Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States, I, 236; V, 683, 684, 686.H.H. Bancroft, The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America, I, 514. Among the Aztecs, wives caught in adultery were occasionally impaled, although the more usual punishment was to be stoned to death.ABA aug Journal 1969, p.738
The Laws of Manu of ancient India, for example, said: "though destitute of virtue or seeking pleasure elsewhere, or devoid of good qualities, yet a husband must be constantly worshiped as a god by a faithful wife"; on the other, hand, "if a wife, proud of the greatness of her relatives or own excellence, violates the duty which she owes to her lord, the king shall cause her to be devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many."Laws of Manu, V, 154; VIII, 371.
In England and its successor states, it has been high treason to engage in adultery with the King's wife, his eldest son's wife and his eldest unmarried daughter. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that "the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious." Adultery was a serious issue when it came to succession to the crown. Philip IV of France had all three of his daughters-in-law imprisoned, two (Margaret of Burgundy and Blanche of Burgundy) on the grounds of adultery and the third (Joan of Burgundy) for being aware of their adulterous behaviour. The two brothers accused of being lovers of the king's daughters-in-law were executed immediately after being arrested. The wife of Philip IV's eldest son bore a daughter, the future Joan II of Navarre, whose paternity and succession rights were disputed all her life.McCracken, 171.

In the Philippines, adultery (defined as consensual sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man who is not her husband) and a related act of concubinage (a man cohabiting with a woman who is not his wife), are considered crimes under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. Adultery is not a crime in mainland China, but constitutes grounds for divorce.[tpl]cite web |title=Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China , Article 32|url=http://www.nwccw.gov.cn/?action-viewnews-itemid-140641-page-2 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl](中华人民共和国婚姻法第三十二条)
In Pakistan, adultery is a crime under the Hudood Ordinance. The Ordinance sets a maximum penalty of death, although only imprisonment and corporal punishment have ever actually been imposed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The Ordinance has been particularly controversial because it requires a woman making an accusation of rape to provide extremely strong evidence to avoid being charged with adultery herself. A conviction for rape is only possible with evidence from no fewer than four witnesses. In recent years high-profile rape cases in Pakistan have given the Ordinance more exposure than similar laws in other countries.Hudood laws open to change in Pakistan, July 2005 Similar laws exist in some other Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia.

In Southwest Asia, adultery has attracted severe sanctions, including death penalty. In some places, such as Saudi Arabia, the method of punishment for adultery is stoning to death. Proving adultery under Muslim law can be a very difficult task as it requires the accuser to produce four eyewitnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply in the application of social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Koranic law adultery are extremely rare."Mackey, Sandra.

====Europe====

Adultery is not a crime in European countries. Until quite recently however, several Western countries had anti-adultery laws on their books. Among the last European countries to decriminalize adultery were Italy (1969), Portugal (1974), France (1975), Spain (1981), Greece (1983), Belgium (1987) and Austria (1997).http://books.google.ro/books?id=HartNkkDBssC&printsec=frontcover&hl=ro&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=falsehttp://books.google.ro/books?id=XE97ryf8noAC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=Recent+Social+Trends+in+France,+1960-1990&source=bl&ots=uNGmU1r8CD&sig=5qKlBaI_HsxFSMeJxmXgkPWZOHA&hl=ro&sa=X&ei=POUDU6HbB6eDywOXhIGoBw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Recent%20Social%20Trends%20in%20France%2C%201960-1990&f=falsehttp://books.google.ro/books?id=QeuBc1ryQz8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=ro&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Before the 20th century, adultery was often punished harshly.

In Turkey adultery was decriminalized in 1996/1998 because the law was deemed discriminatory as it differentiated between women and men. In 2004, there were new discussions about re-criminalizing adultery, this time through  a gender-neutral offense.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has had the opportunity to rule in recent years on several cases involving the legitimacy of firing a person from their job due to adultery. These cases dealt with people working for religious organizations and raised the question of the balancing of the right of a person to respect for their private life (recognized in the EU) and the right of religious communities to be  protected against undue interference by the State (recognized also in the EU). These situations must be analyzed with regard to their specific circumstances, in each case. The ECtHR had ruled both in favor of the religious organization (in the case of Obst) and in favor of the fired person (in the case of Schüth).http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-3272505-3650095#{%22itemid%22:%22003-3272505-3650095%22}

The last conviction for adultery in Massachusetts occurred in 1983. In that case it was held that the statute was constitutional. It was held that "no fundamental personal privacy right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty guaranteed by the United States Constitution bars the criminal prosecution of such persons  adulterers."[tpl]cite web|url=http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/389/389mass171.html |title=STOWELL, COMMONWEALTH vs., 389 Mass. 171 |publisher=Masscases.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl] Whether a conviction under this statue would be possible today (especially after Lawrence v.

In Utah adultery is a class B misdemeanor. The adultery law only applies to the married party (the law states that "A married person commits adultery when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with a person other than his spouse.")[tpl]cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2011/title76/chapter7/section103.html |title=Section 103 Adultery. :: Chapter 7 Offenses Against the Family :: Title 76 Utah Criminal Code :: 2011 Utah Code :: Utah Code :: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia |publisher=Law.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl] However, Utah also has a fornication law that applies to any unmarried person (also a class B misdemeanor).[tpl]cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010400.htm |title=Utah State Legislature |publisher=Le.utah.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl]

South Carolina's adultery law came into spotlight in 2009, when then governor Mark Sanford admitted to his extramarital affair. He was not prosecuted for it; it is not clear whether South Carolina could prosecute a crime that occurred in another jurisdiction (Argentina in this case); furthermore, under South Carolina law adultery involves either "the living together and carnal intercourse with each other" or, if those involved do not live together "habitual carnal intercourse with each other" which is more difficult to prove.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c015.php |title=South Carolina Legislature Mobile |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl]

In the U.S. Military, adultery is a potential court-martial offense. The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States is unclear following Supreme Court decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults.See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas. However, occasional prosecutions do occur.Jonathan Turley, Of Lust and the Law, The Washington Post, September 5, 2004, p. B1.

====Criticism of adultery laws====

=====Political arguments=====

Laws against adultery have been named as invasive and incompatible with principles of limited government. Much of the criticism comes from libertarianism, the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than prosecuted and penalized by public entities.
 
 Opponents of adultery laws regard them as painfully archaic, believing they represent sanctions reminiscent of nineteenth-century novels. They further object to the legislation of morality, especially a morality so steeped in religious doctrine. Support for the preservation of the adultery laws comes from religious groups and from political parties who feel quite independent of morality, that the government has reason to concern itself with the consensual sexual activity of its citizens … The crucial question is: when, if ever, is the government justified to interfere in consensual bedroom affairs?Weissler, Benjamin. "Government and the Bedroom." July 13, 2012. Yale Undergraduate Law Review.

There is a history of adultery laws being abused. In Somerset, England, a somewhat common practice was for husbands to encourage their wives to seduce another man, who they would then sue or blackmail, under laws prohibiting men from having sex with women married to other men.Ley, David. "Kinky Cuckolding Fetish Goes Mainstream". Psychology Today. June 24, 2010.

=====Historical context=====

Historically, in most cultures, laws against adultery were enacted only to prevent women—and not men—from having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouses, whose property they were deemed. Among many cultures the penalty was—and to this day still is, as noted below—capital punishment. At the same time, men were free to maintain sexual relations with any women (polygyny) provided that the women didn't already have husbands or "owners." Indeed, בעל (ba`al), Hebrew for husband, used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with owner. These laws were enacted in fear of cuckoldry and thus sexual jealousy. Many indigenous customs, such as female genital mutilation"Female genital mutilation", World Health Organization, February 2010. and even menstrual taboos,Strassman, B.I. (1992) ‘The function of menstrual taboos among the Dogon: defense against cuckoldry?’ Human Nature 2: 89-131 have been theorized to have originated as preventive measures against cuckolding. This arrangement has been deplored by many modern intellectuals.
 
 Laws against adultery were based upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman … has …  an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal hausfrau, if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her![tpl]Citation|surname=Crowley|given=Aleister|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|year=1996|title=The Law is for All|place=Tempe, AZ|publisher=New Falcon Publications|chapter = 1:41, The New Comment|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1561840904/[/tpl]

=====Violence against women=====

Opponents of adultery laws argue that  these laws maintain social norms which justify violence, discrimination and oppression of women; in the form of state sanctioned forms of violence such as stoning, flogging or hanging for adultery; or in the form of individual acts of violence committed against women by husbands or relatives, such as honor killings, crimes of passion, and beatings.http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html UN Women has called for the decriminalization of adultery. A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in 2012 stated:

=====Use of limited resources of the criminal law enforcement=====

An argument against the criminal status of adultery is that the resources of the law enforcement are limited, and that they should be used carefully; by investing them in the investigation and prosecution of adultery (which is very difficult) the curbing of serious violent crimes may suffer.Suffolk law review, The Validity of Criminal Adultery Prohibitions After Lawrence v.Texas; pg. 859 "Lack of enforcement suggests the prevailing view that police resources are better spent elsewhere."http://suffolklawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/Viator_Note_Final.pdf

===Other consequences===

====General====

For various reasons, most couples who marry do so with the expectation of fidelity. Adultery is often seen as a breach of trust and of the commitment that had been made during the act of marriage.[tpl]cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, "Adultery" |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-05-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110427092349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery| archivedate= 27 April 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Adultery can be emotionally traumatic for both spouses and often results in divorce.[tpl]cite web |title=About.com Divorce Support, "Why Does Infidelity Often Lead to Divorce?" |url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/b/2011/05/12/why-does-infidelity-often-lead-to-divorce.htm|publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl] However, in a new work, The New Rules by Dr Catherine Hakim, a French sociologist and author, refers to the UK arguing that a "sour and rigid English view" of infidelity as opposed to the 'wonderful French way' of male infidelity is condemning millions of people to live frustrated "celibate" lives with their spouses. She argues that there is such a thing as a "successful affair" in which both parties are happier but no one gets hurt: "Sex is no more a moral issue than eating a good meal," she writes. "The fact that we eat most meals at home with spouses and partners does not preclude eating out in restaurants to sample different cuisines and ambiences, with friends or colleagues."[tpl]cite news|author=Mother Tongue |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9485796/Puritan-view-of-adultery-turns-Brits-into-caged-animals-says-academic.html |title=Puritan view of adultery turns Brits into 'caged animals' says academic |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2012-08-20|accessdate=2013-09-28 |location=London[/tpl]
Adultery may lead to ostracization from certain religious or social groups.Women as Guardians of Purity
Adultery can also lead to feelings of guilt and jealousy in the person with whom the affair is being committed. In some cases, this "third person" may encourage divorce (either openly or subtly).[tpl]cite web |title=Signs of a Cheating Husband |url=http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21|publisher= Beatingjealousy.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl] If the cheating spouse has hinted at divorce in order to continue the affair, the third person may feel deceived if that does not happen.[tpl]cite web |title= Are You the Other Woman in an Affair |url=http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html|publisher= Essortment.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Getting Over an Affair as the Other Woman |url=http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/community-features/ask-an-expert/questions-by-topic/infidelity/577-getting-over-an-affair-as-the-other-woman.html|publisher= Truthaboutdeception.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl] They may simply withdraw with ongoing feelings of guilt, carry on an obsession with their lover, may choose to reveal the affair, or in rare cases commit violence or other crimes.[tpl]cite web |title=Amy Fisher |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|publisher= trutv.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl]
Since adultery can lead to divorce, it may have long-term consequences for children in the family. Children of divorcees are twice as likely to have problems as adults with mental illness, substance abuse, and failed relationships, though heritable factors, such as a tendency toward anxiety and depression, are likely the root cause of both the infidelity of the parent and the later struggles of the child. While there is correlation, there is no evidence that divorces causes children to have struggles in later life.[tpl]cite web |title=nasponline.org, Divorce: A Parents’ Guide for Supporting Children |url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/parenting/divorce_ho.aspx|publisher= nasponline.org |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl]

====Sexually transmitted infections====

Like any sexual contact, adultery may result in sexually-transmitted diseases (STD). Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives,[tpl]cite web |title=family.jrank.org, "Birth Control – Contraceptive Methods, Sociocultural and Historical Aspects" |url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/163/Birth-Control.html|publisher= jrank.com |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl] STDs can easily be transmitted from one spouse to another in this way. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriers - to openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited.http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-12032012-153412/unrestricted/dissertation.pdfhttp://www.aids2031.org/pdfs/safe%20and%20consensual%20sex%20are%20women%20empowered%20enough%20to%20negotiate.pdfhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831928/ The World Health Organisation (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they though to have been infected.http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf

==Violence==

Historically, female adultery often resulted in extreme violence, including murder (of the woman, her lover, or both, committed by her husband). Today domestic violence is outlawed in the Western World, but this is not the case in many developing countries.

===Honor killings===

Honor killings are often connected to accusations of adultery. Honor killings continue to be legal in parts of the world.
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83):
Part of article 340 of the Penal Code of Jordan states that "he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty."[tpl]cite book|author=Altstein,Howard;Simon, Rita James|title=Global perspectives on social issues: marriage and divorce|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lexington, Mass|year=2003|page=11|isbn=0-7391-0588-4[/tpl]
Until 2009, in Syria, it was legal for a husband to kill or injure his wife or his female relatives caught in flagrante delicto committing adultery or other illegitimate sexual acts. The law has changed to allow the perpetrator to only "benefit from the attenuating circumstances, provided that he serves a prison term of no less than two years in the case of killing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=28169&baseHREF=country&baseHREFId=1263 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-09-28[/tpl] Other articles also provide for reduced sentences. Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria: No Exceptions for Honor Killings|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/28/syria-no-exceptions-honor-killings|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2011-12-08[/tpl]
According to the UN in 2002:

===Stoning===

Stoning, or lapidation, refers to a form of capital punishment whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies, or (in ancient Judaism) the condemned person is pushed from a platform set high enough above a stone floor that the fall would probably result in instantaneous death.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html|title = Examining Halcha, Jewish issues and secular law|last = Rapps|first = Dennis|author2 = Weinberg, Lewin|date = December 1999|work = Jewish Law:Legal briefs|publisher = Ira Kasdan|accessdate=2009-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091105092848/http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html| archivedate= 5 November 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Stoning continues to be practiced today, in parts of the world. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan by tribal courts.[ref]Examples include:
[/ref]

==In fiction==

The theme of adultery has been used in many literary works, and has served as a theme for some notable books, such as Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Lady Chatterley's Lover, The Scarlet Letter. Adultery has also been the theme of many movies.
