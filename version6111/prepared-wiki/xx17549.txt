[[File:PareoEfficientFrontier1024x1024.png|thumb|256px|right|A production-possibility frontier is an example of a Pareto Efficient
Frontier, or Pareto-Optimal Front.  A factory can produce different
quantities of two goods, as shown. One point is said to dominate
another if it is better on all of the Pareto dimensions. For example,
point K is dominated by points D and E, which both have higher
production levels of each item than at point K.  The Pareto-Optimal
(Pareto-Efficient) Frontier is the set of non-dominated points, shown
here in red (A-H). All of the grey points are non-Pareto Optimal, or
Pareto inefficient, assuming that all production levels inside the
front are possible.  If possible production levels were discrete, and
limited to the points shown, point N would also be Pareto Optimal
(making the Pareto-Optimal Front non-convex) because there is no point
with higher production levels for both items than at point N.

It is commonly accepted [tpl]By whom|date=March 2013[/tpl] that outcomes that are not Pareto efficient are to be avoided, and therefore Pareto efficiency is an important criterion for evaluating economic systems and public policies.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] If economic allocation in any system is not Pareto efficient, there is potential for a Pareto improvement—an increase in Pareto efficiency: through reallocation, improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being.
It is important to note, however, that a change from an inefficient allocation to an efficient one is not necessarily a Pareto improvement. Thus, in practice, ensuring that nobody is disadvantaged by a change aimed at achieving Pareto efficiency may require compensation of one or more parties. For instance, if a change in economic policy eliminates a monopoly and that market subsequently becomes competitive and more efficient, the monopolist will be made worse off. However, the loss to the monopolist will be more than offset by the gain in efficiency. This means the monopolist can be compensated for its loss while still leaving a net gain for others in the economy, a Pareto improvement.
In real-world practice, such compensations have unintended consequences. They can lead to incentive distortions over time as agents anticipate such compensations and change their actions accordingly. Under certain idealized conditions, it can be shown that a system of free markets will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome. This is called the first welfare theorem. It was first demonstrated mathematically by economists Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu. However, the result only holds under the restrictive assumptions necessary for the proof (markets exist for all possible goods so there are no externalities, all markets are in full equilibrium, markets are perfectly competitive, transaction costs are negligible, and market participants have perfect information). In the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generically be Pareto inefficient, per the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorem.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1891114 |last1=Greenwald |first1=Bruce |last2=Stiglitz |first2=Joseph E. |author1-link=Bruce Greenwald |author2-link=Joseph E.

==Weak Pareto efficiency==

A "weak Pareto optimum" (WPO) is an allocation for which there are no possible alternative allocations whose realization would cause every individual to gain. Thus an alternative allocation is considered to be a Pareto improvement only if the alternative allocation is strictly preferred by all individuals. When contrasted with weak Pareto efficiency, a standard Pareto optimum as described above may be referred to as a "strong Pareto optimum" (SPO).
Weak Pareto-optimality is "weaker" than strong Pareto-optimality in the sense that any SPO also qualifies as a WPO, but a WPO allocation is not necessarily an SPO.

[tpl]Refimprove section|date=November 2007[/tpl] thumb|300px|Example of a Pareto frontier. The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point C is not on the Pareto Frontier because it is dominated by both point A and point B. Points A and B are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence do lie on the frontier. The notion of Pareto efficiency is also useful in engineering. Given a set of choices and a way of valuing them, the Pareto frontier or Pareto set or Pareto front is the set of choices that are Pareto efficient. By restricting attention to the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient, a designer can make tradeoffs within this set, rather than considering the full range of every parameter.
