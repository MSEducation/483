Pitt Street Mall is the pedestrianised section of Pitt Street in the Sydney central business district, Australia. Located between Market Street and King Street, it is one block long and is one of Australia's busiest and most cosmopolitan shopping precincts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/shopping/a-whole-new-mall-game-20110505-1e9d8.html|title=A whole new mall game|date=5 May 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl] Floorspace rents are accordingly the highest in Australia, in part due to other cities' shopping precincts being longer. In 2012, its rents were the fifth highest in the world in terms of city streets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/pitt-street-mall-is-the-worlds-fifth-most-expensive-shopping-retail-venue/story-e6freuy9-1226519143918|title=Pitt Street mall is the world's fifth most expensive shopping retail venue|first=Phil|last=Jacob|date=18 November 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/can-pitt-street-mall-give-fifth-avenue-a-run-for-its-money-20121122-29r99.html|title=Natasha|last=Silva-Jelly|date=22 November 2012|work=Sydney Mornign Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl]

==History==

===2010â€“2011: redevelopment===

Along with these extensive upgrades to shopping centres, the mall itself recently saw a A$10 million refurbishment carried out. This included the provision of new seating as well as new pavers and a catenary lighting system (which will be installed in the coming months).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lights-to-enliven-pitt-street-mall-20090429-anf1.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Lights to enliven Pitt Street Mall | date=April 30, 2009[/tpl]

==Buildings, shops and tenants==

A number of shopping centres and arcades front the Mall, including Westfield Sydney, Strand Arcade, Mid City Centre, Glasshouse and Sydney Arcade.
In 2005, Westfield took over management of the majority of retail space in the mall through their acquisition of Sydney Central Plaza, Imperial Arcade, and management rights on Skygarden. Westfield promptly amalgamated the four properties into Westfield Sydney.Westfield Sydney
