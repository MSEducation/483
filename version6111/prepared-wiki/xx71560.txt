===Early years===

Emanuel Julius was born July 30, 1889, in Philadelphia, the son of a bookbinder. His parents were Jewish emigrants who fled Russia and immigrated to America to escape religious persecution.Susan Jacoby, Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2004; pg. 264.
As a boy, Emanuel read voraciously. Because literature and pamphlets produced by the socialists were inexpensive, Julius read them and became convinced of their truth.Marcet and Emanuel Haldeman-Julius - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society He joined the Socialist Party before World War I.

Haldeman-Julius rose to prominence as an editor (1915 - 1922),Haldeman-Julius Historical Notes: Chronology of Important Events of "Appeal to Reason" a socialist newspaper with a large but declining national circulation.  Along with his first wife, Marcet Haldeman (whose last name he adopted in hyphenate),  after purchasing the "Appeal"'s printing operation in Girard, Kansas, Haldeman-Julius began printing 3.5" x 5" pocket books on cheap pulp paper (similar to that used in pulp magazines), stapled in paper cover. They were first were called The Appeal's Pocket Series and sold in 1919 for 25 cents. The covers were either red or yellow. Over the next several years Haldeman-Julius changed the name successively to The People's Pocket Series, Appeal Pocket Series, Ten Cent Pocket Series, Five Cent Pocket Series, Pocket Series and finally in 1923, Little Blue Books. The five cent price of the books remained in place for many years.
