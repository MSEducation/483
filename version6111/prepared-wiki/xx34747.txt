It was administered by the Department of the Interior (and later by the Department of the Capital Territory) as if it were part of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), although it has always been a separate Commonwealth territory. The perception that it is part of the ACT stems from the fact that under the terms of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act, the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.[tpl]cite web|title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration|url=http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx|work=Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, in so far as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915.|publisher=The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl]
In 1989, when the ACT achieved self-government, the Department of The Arts, Sport, The Environment, Tourism and Territories took over responsibility for the JBT's administration, and it has since been administered by various Commonwealth Departments responsible to the Minister for Territories.

==History==

The bay was sighted by Lieutenant James Cook aboard [tpl]HMS|Endeavour[/tpl] on 25 April 1770 (two days after Saint George's Day) and he named the southern headland Cape St George.Place Names of Australia (Reed, 1973).[tpl]harvnb|Crabb|2007|page=4[/tpl]
In August 1791 the bay was entered and named by Lieutenant Richard Bowen aboard the convict transport ship Atlantic of the Third Fleet in honour of Admiral John Jervis, under whom he had served.[tpl]harvnb|Crabb|2007|page=5[/tpl]  In November 1791 Master Matthew Weatherhead aboard the Matilda entered the bay to undertake repairs.
Survivors of the Sydney Cove shipwreck in 1797 reached the area by foot, heading to Port Jackson.
Explorer George Bass entered the bay on 10 December 1797. He named Bowen Island.[tpl]harvnb|Crabb|2007|page=6[/tpl]

==Administration==

Jervis Bay Territory is administered by the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. However, it is counted as part of the ACT for the purpose of the ACT's representation in the Senate; and it forms part of the Division of Fraser for House of Representatives purposes. The Department of Regional Australia has proposed returning Jervis Bay Territory to New South Wales.[tpl]cite news|title=Documents flag returning Jervis Bay to NSW law|url=http://www.australiannews.net/story.php?rid=46585099|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=Canberra Times|date=3 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Costs, environment fears for Jervis Bay handover|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/costs-environment-fears-for-jervis-bay-handover-20111222-1uvnv.html|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=Canberra Times|date=22 December 2011[/tpl]
At the 2011 census, an estimated 377 people lived in the territory, the majority working and living at the Royal Australian Navy base, [tpl]HMAS|Creswell[/tpl]. Over 90% of the territory is now legally recognised as Aboriginal land. There is an Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay in the Booderee National Park.
For most purposes, the territory is governed under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), by the Jervis Bay Administration, which handles matters normally concerned with local or state government, and provides primary school teachers and Australian Federal Police staffing. Residents have access to the courts of the ACT, but are not separately represented in the ACT Legislative Assembly. The Jervis Bay Territory is in the Commonwealth Electoral Division of Fraser (ACT). Jervis Bay Territory residents are not represented at the local or State government level but have access to the decision-making process through community organisations.
The Defence Force Discipline Act (DFDA) Section 61 makes all Australian Defence Force members and "Defence Civilians" subject to the criminal laws of the Jervis Bay Territory regardless of where the offence occurred.   This is a legal device which makes Defence personnel subject to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and offences against the criminal law of the ACT, as military law, even if the offence is committed outside Australia.
Vincentia is the nearest town, roughly 3 km north of the border, population 2,750.

==Geography==

Having [tpl]convert|65.7|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of land and [tpl]convert|8.9|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl] marine reserve,Jervis Bay Territory Jervis Bay Territory is the smallest of all the mainland states and territories of Australia. Jervis Bay is a natural harbour [tpl]convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] north-south and [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east-west, opening to the east onto the Pacific Ocean. The bay is situated about [tpl]convert|198|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the city of Sydney, on the southern coast of New South Wales. The nearest city is Nowra, about [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Shoalhaven River to the north. The majority of Jervis Bay embayment is part of Jervis Bay Marine Park (NSW State) but the waters within JB Territory are part of Booderee National Park (Commonwealth). National Park was formerly known as Jervis Bay National Park (Commonwealth).
A wide variety of flora and fauna are native to the Booderee (aboriginal: bay of plenty) National Park with approximately 206 species of birds, 27 species of mammals, 15 species of amphibians, 23 species of reptiles and 180 species of fish native to the area.[tpl]cite book|title=Booderee National Park |author1=Lindenmayer, David|author2=MacGregor, Christopher|author3=Dexter, Nick|author4=Fortescue, Martin|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781486300426[/tpl] The park itself encompasses approximately 90% of the territory of Jervis Bay and covers the overlap between Australia's northern and southern climatic zones.
Ancient sand dunes overlay the sedimentary bedrock formations formed from upheaval of the surrounding marine environment 280–225 million years ago.  The park was designated sacred Aboriginal land in 1995. A significant portion of the bay's northern coast and headland forming Beecroft Peninsula and ending at Point Perpendicular and surrounding area is a gun bombardment range for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
There are three small lakes within the territory: Lake Windermere, the largest, with an area of [tpl]convert|31|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl], Lake Mckenzie, [tpl]convert|7|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl], and Blacks Waterhole [tpl]convert|1.4|ha|acre|1|abbr=on[/tpl].
Bowen Island, at the entrance to the bay [tpl]convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Governors Head, is [tpl]convert|51|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] in area. It has rookeries for the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor at the northern extent of its range.

==Towns and villages in the Territory==

There are three small towns or villages in the Jervis Bay Territory. They are all covered by postcode 2540. Listed from north to south, they are:

==HMAS Creswell==

Within the Booderee National Park is [tpl]HMAS|Creswell[/tpl], the Royal Australian Navy College named after Sir William Rooke Creswell, the Director of the Commonwealth Naval Forces which later became the RAN. The Jervis Bay Airfield is adjacent, operated by the RAN to support its Kalkara (Storm Petrel) pilotless target aircraft (Beech / BAe MQM-107 E). Kalkara are launched from the airfield and later recovered by parachute into the water and thence by boats maintained at HMAS Creswell, after target-towing exercises off the coast with ships or aircraft. Control equipment is sited at Bherwerre Ridge overlooking the sea to the east. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Nuclear reactor site==

Of historical interest is the site of the proposed Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The site is near Murray's Beach, at the southeast corner of the Bay. The project was cancelled in 1971 after site works (excavation and levelling) were done and a road was constructed to the territory border. The levelled site is now the car park for Murrays Beach and its adjacent boat ramp.
