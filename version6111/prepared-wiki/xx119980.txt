===Early History===

After the Norman Conquest in 1066, Unsworth was part of the Pilkington estate before passing into the hands of the Earls of Derby in the 15th century.
In the Hearth tax collected in 1666, Unsworth had 40 heaths with no house having six.

===Modern History===

Unsworth and Castle Brooks were sources of water for local industries such as bleach and dye works, there was also clay for brickworks. During the Industrial Revolution farming, cotton mills, print-works and bleach-grounds provided employment for its inhabitants. Cotton mills operating in the late 19th century were Worthington and Company whose Victoria Mills contained 220 looms producing ticking, nankeens, linen and drills and the Unsworth Finishing Company.[tpl]citation | title=1891 Cotton Mills in Radcliffe | url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/1891_Cotton_Mills_in_Radcliffe#Whitefield.2C_Unsworth_and_Besses-o.27th.27-Barn._11_miles_S.E._from_Radcliffe._.28p173.29 | publisher=Grace's Guide |accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl]
The first major change in the 20th century was the construction of the Royal Air Force's logistics base at nearby Pilsworth in World War II, parts of which remained in use in the early 1980s by shipping firms and other industries.
Unsworth was affected by the construction of the M66 motorway. The road between junctions 3 and 4 passes behind Unsworth Pole and through Back o'th Moss Farm. Construction of the motorway, along with urbanization in the mid-1970s reduced the dairy farm's acreage from 300 to 150 acres,resulted in a loss of the dairy production and lower yields of "hay, corn, barley and potatoes"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-380000-405000/page/6

Unsworth lies on high ground between two brooks running north to Whittle Brook and the River Roch. covering 972 acres of mostly arable land that was boggy until drainage was installed. The Parr Brook joins the River Roch at Blackford Bridge.
The village and surrounding area were urbanised in the 1960s. Transformation began in the 1950s with the construction of housing and the road known as Sunny Bank Road connecting the old village to the A56 arterial road between Bury and Manchester.
Hollins Vale became Bury’s third local nature reserve in 2003. It is owned by Vidor Waste Management and managed for the benefit of wildlife and the community by the Hollins Conservation Group.[tpl]citation |title=  Hollins Vale LNR |url=http://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4420|publisher= Bury Council| accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] Hollins Brook, a tributary of the River Roch meanders through the valley. Most of the area consists of woodland, marshland  open grassland which is managed by cattle that roam the area.[tpl]citation |title=  Hollins Vale Local Nature Reserve |url=http://www.bury.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=2772&p=0|format = pdf |publisher= Bury Council| accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] Hollins Vale was granted Site of Biological Importance status in 1981 due to its diverse range of waterside plants and is one of 50 such sites in the Bury area.[tpl]citation |title=  Sites of Biological Importance (SBI) |url=http://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4658|publisher= Bury Council| accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] The reserve is home to many species of wildlife such as  linnet, reed bunting, snipe and grey partridge. The birds and small mammals attract predators such as kestrel, sparrowhawk, buzzard, tawny owl, weasel and stoat.

The home of the ancient Unsworth family was noted for containing an oak table and panel with carvings of Saint George and the Dragon, the Eagle and Child, the Lion and the Unicorn, and the Unsworth Dragon connected with a local legend. Thomas Unsworth supposedly owned the house when a dragon ravaged the area. Bullets from guns had no effect but Thomas Unsworth mortally wounded the dragon by firing his dagger from a musket. The carvings on the panel and table were supposedly made with the dagger.[tpl]citation |title=  Unsworth Dragon |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/england/greater-manchester/legends/unsworth-dragon.html|publisher=Mysterious Britain| accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] The legend's origin may be related to the estate granted to a member of the family, possibly Thomas, for unknown military service.[tpl]sfn|Barton|1973|p=273[/tpl]
The Pole or Unsworth Pole was named after the pitch pole fixed by the Earl of Derby which was greased each year for the village's pot fair which was last held over a century ago. The challenge was to climb the greased pole to claim the prize. The last known successful ascender was Adam Holt in 1900. The current pole is not the original which was blown over in a gale, falling into the Bay Horse Inn.http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-380000-405000/page/19
