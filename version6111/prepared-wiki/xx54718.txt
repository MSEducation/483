==History==

During the Conquest of Luzon by  Adelantado Miguel Legazpi in 1571, Bulacan was reported to be well populated and rich. Initially there were only six encomiendas under the rule of the Alcalde Mayor in Bulacan: Calumpit (then an independent Alcaldia) Bulakan, Malolos, Meycauayan, Binto (present-day Plaridel), Guiguinto, and Caluya (present-day Balagtas). The encomiendas were later organized into Pueblos (towns). The first pueblo established in Bulacan was the town of Calumpit, founded by Agustinian friars in 1575.Historical Markers, Regions I-IV and CAR, NHI ,1993 p. 297 Calumpit was also the birthplace of Christianity historcal documents told that Calumpit is a different and separated in Bulacan comprising the Provincia de Calonpite y Hagonoy together with Apalit.A time came,in 1578 Alcaldia de Calumpit and it was dissolved and annexed to Provincia de Bulacan. It has been said that in 1578 the Augustinians conquered Bulacan (the town after which the province was named).[tpl]OR|date=September 2012[/tpl]The province of Bulacan (named Meycauayan it its antiquity), is on the island of Luzon, and is one of the most important “Alcadia de Termino”, Civil and politically it corresponds to the Audiencia y capitanía general de Filipinas, and spiritually belongs to the Archbishop of Manila.CRÓNICA DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS, by Don Fernando Fulgosio,  Rubio, Grilo y Vitturi,  Madrid, 1871 p.71 The Franciscan friars Juan Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa founded Meycauayan in the same year, and for a time it was the capital; people were able to flourish, and became so rich that the sons are six of the best in the province (Bocaue, Polo, San Jose del Monte, Santa Maria de Pandi, Obando and Marilao).Apuntes Interesantes sobre LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS... Imprenta de EL PUEBLO, Madrid 1869, p. 79 On the other hand Malolos also under Augustinian Order.During Spanish Period already existed as a Chinese settlement bearing the name Li-han,in which those people are rich tagalogs and Chinese who are excellent in commerce and trade was conquered by Spanish conquistador and constituted as Royal Encomienda by Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi in November 14, 1571 under Jeronimo Tirado and Marcos de Herrera.The Spaniards' First 50 Years in the Philippines, 1565-1615 | A Sourcebook The oldest document mentioning Malolos as a Civil Town can be found in Augustinian documents when the town of Malolos was accepted by the Augustinians to be its House of Order in June 11, 1580.

In an earlier period during 1890, Malolos was a hot-spot of Liberal Illustrados, notably the "20 Women of Malolos", who exerted pressure for education under a Filipino professor. However, the first phase of the revolution ceased in 1897 with the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel. Under its terms the leaders were to go to Hong Kong and reside there. Under the illusory peace created by the pact, the end of 1897 saw greater determination om the part of the Filipinos to carry on the revolution. In early 1898, the provinces of Zambales, Ilocos, Pampanga, Bulacan, Laguna, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac. and Camarines rose again. In Central Luzon, a revolutionary government was organized under General Francisco Makabulos, a Kapampangan revolutionary leader of La Paz, Tarlac.
The U.S. Americans established a local Philippine government in the Philippines when they held the first municipal election in the country in the town of Baliuag, Bulacan on May 6, 1899.
At the beginning of the American rule,1899-1900 Malolos became the headquarters of the Military Governor of the Philippines Malolos at Casa Real in Malolos and in February 27, 1901, the Philippine Commission officially transferred the seat of government to Malolos, and the Casa Real de Malolos was the seat of the Provincial Governor from 1900 to 1930 until the completion of the capitol building at the Brgy Guinhawa, Malolos City.
In 1942, at the height of World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army occupied Bulacan and made Casa Real de Malolos its headquarters.
In 1945, combined Filipino and American forces and local guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial Forces and liberated Bulacan.

==Issues Concerning the Foundation Date==

For a long period of time, Bulacan traced its founding as a province during the American Period at the reorganization of Philippine Provinces. To determine the true date of the province's foundation and to trace its roots in ancient period. Efforts and research conducted by Dr. Jaime Veneracion, Dr.Reynaldo Naguit of the Center for Bulacan Studies and Isagani Giron of the Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan (Sampaka) shows that Bulacan was identified as a province as early as 1578. This is due to a cedulario found by the researchers which states Provincia de Bulacan and was dated 1578. With regards to exact date of foundation of Bulacan as a province, Veneracion correlated it with the practice of Spaniard of dedicating the founding a pueblo to the feast of a patron saint. In the case of Bulacan it is the Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion, which is also the patron saint of Bulakan town, the first capital of the province

==Geography==

Several rivers irrigate the province of Bulacan; the largest one is that of Angat. Angat River passes through the towns of Norzagaray, Angat, Bustos,  San Rafael, Baliuag, Plaridel, Pulilan, and Calumpit. It flow thence into the Pampanga River, goes out again, washes Hagonoy and loses itself in the mangroves. The banks of these rivers are very fertile and are covered with trees.
