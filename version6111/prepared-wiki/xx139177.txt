Following the death of Count Heinrich X of Reuss-Lobenstein in 1671, Reuss-Lobenstein was ruled jointly by his three sons Heinrich III, Heinrich VIII and Heinrich X.

In 1806 the title of the ruler of Reuss-Ebersdorf was upgraded to that of Prince. In 1824, on the death of Prince Heinrich LIV of Reuss-Lobenstein, Count Heinrich LXXII of Reuss-Ebersdorf succeeded him and took the title Prince of Reuss-Lobenstein-Ebersdorf. Prince Heinrich LXXII remained prince of Reuss-Lobenstein-Ebersdorf until his abdication in 1848 in favour of the prince of Reuss-Schleiz.
Count Heinrich XXIV was the father of Countess Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf, maternal grandmother of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.
