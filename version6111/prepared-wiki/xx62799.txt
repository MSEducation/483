CATEGORIES: Garryales, Angiosperm orders

The Garryales are a small order of dicotyledons, including only two families and three genera.

==Description==

Garryales are woody plants that are either hairless or have very fine hairs.  Members of the Garryaceae family are evergreen, whereas those of Eucommiaceae are deciduous and produce latex.[tpl]sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=1[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

These belong among the asterids. Under the Cronquist system, the Garryaceae were placed among the Cornales.[tpl]sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=1[/tpl] The Eucommiaceae were given their own order and placed among the Hamamelidae. The Oncothecaceae family has been associated with Garryales, though the link isn't strong enough to prove that they are related.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/top/summaryapg2new.htm#Garryales|title=GARRYALES Lindley|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=23 August 2012[/tpl]
