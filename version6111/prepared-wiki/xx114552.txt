[/ref] As with her predecessor Rose, Martha is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia presumes this is because characters from the capital of the country are "therefore relatable to all British people" because they are seen as "neutral".[tpl]cite journal |last= Mills|first= Brett|year=2008 |month= |title=My house was on Torchwood!: Media, place and identity|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|volume=11|issue=4|pages=379–399|id= |url=  |doi=10.1177/1367877908096002[/tpl]
Freema Agyeman told the school publication The Newspaper that Martha is older and more secure than Rose.[tpl]cite news |first=Huw |last=Turbervill |title=Who's that girl? |url=http://www.thenewspaper.org.uk/film/pg000900.php |work=The Newspaper |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=30 January 2007 [/tpl] Agyeman speculated that Martha, by contrast, travels with the Doctor for the adventure, rather than because of a need for guidance or education (Agyeman also told The Newspaper that Martha hopes to eventually go back to Earth and finish her medical education). In addition, Martha's family appears to be of a higher social class than Rose; whereas Rose's family was fairly typically working class, Martha's family appears to be wealthier (her father owns what appears to be a late model Mercedes-Benz convertible, and the clothes worn by her family are substantially more in line with fashion), probably middle to upper middle class.
Drawing from her creator's pool of recurring names, Martha and her family share the last name "Jones" with many other Russell T Davies-penned characters. Foremost among them are Harriet Jones in Doctor Who, Ianto Jones and Eugene Jones in Torchwood, Yanto Jones in Mine All Mine and Stuart Allen Jones in Queer as Folk. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In casting Martha, the actress Freema Agyeman was reused from her minor role as  Adeola Oshodi, in the Series 2 episode "Army of Ghosts". Acknowledging this, the resemblance of the two characters was touched upon in "Smith and Jones" when Martha makes reference to her deceased cousin, also serving to connect Martha to the larger Doctor Who universe.

===Development===

Throughout Doctor Who series three, Martha pined for the Doctor's affection. In its final story — "Last of the Time Lords", Martha was separated from the Doctor for a year, and after saving the world she decided to return to Earth to allow herself to qualify as a medical doctor, look after her devastated family, and get over the Doctor's inability to reciprocate her feelings.
Following the airdate of "Last of the Time Lords", the BBC announced that the character would return to screens in three episodes of Torchwood Series 2, before rejoining David Tennant's Tenth Doctor alongside new companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) for five episodes in the fourth series of Doctor Who.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/07/02/46692.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090104232923/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/07/02/46692.shtml|archivedate=4 January 2009|title=More Martha!|publisher=BBC|date=2 July 2007|accessdate=2 July 2007[/tpl][ref]
