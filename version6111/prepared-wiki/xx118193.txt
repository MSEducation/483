Ecstatica is an action-adventure game for MS-DOS developed by Andrew Spencer Studios and released by Psygnosis in 1994.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay is from a third-person perspective with viewing angles changing automatically. The player has the option of choosing either a male or female character. The player has the ability to sneak, walk or run in different directions. The character may carry two items—one item with each hand. Throughout the game, the character is under constant threat from demons. He must fight with them, using various moves—this adds some elements of fighting game. In addition to action and adventure elements, the game also contains moments of black and crude humor. 

==Plot==

The setting is in Northern Europe in 928 AD. A traveler (the player) comes upon a town named Tirich hoping to find food and shelter. However, the town appears to be invaded by demons. The traveler must help the townspeople and lift the curse from the town by freeing the young witch Ecstatica from being possessed.

==Development==

The game is notable for using a unique type of "ellipsoid" graphics to display characters. Each character is made of ellipsoids approximating different types of body. The environments, such as the trees and the shrubs, are also constructed in ellipsoids. This gave the game a very unique aesthetic, as it looked much less angular than other more conventional polygon-based games at the time.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5826780/horror-comes-in-many-forms-including-tiny-ellipsoid-cocks|title=Horror Comes In Many Forms (Including Tiny Ellipsoid Cocks)|publisher=Kotaku|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=2011-08-02[/tpl]
