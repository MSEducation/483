The name for the band[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.timeout.com/london/music/mt-warning |title=Time Out says: MT Warning Music |publisher=Time Out|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl] comes via their home town Mount Warning, which is the first place to see the sunrise in Australia.
In an interview with Moustache Magazine, front-man Mikey Bee explained, "Producing in the sense that he throws visuals at me...he'll tell me, 'What if these guitars were a bit more abrasive there or the vocal was softer or what would a lyric like this sound like.' He's not a musician so those kinds of suggestions from someone who doesn't play but sees music is really awesome."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.moustachemagazine.com/2013/09/youve-been-warned/|title=Youâ€™ve Been Warned|publisher=Moustache Magazine|date=9 September 2013|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl]
The first gigs for MT WARNING were support slots for The Rubens and The Temper Trap, which Time Off Brisbane said:  "A perfect rattling tenor and there's clearly a few people hooked. His haunting and slightly cinematic single, "Burn Again", deftly prepares the ground for what's to come";[tpl]cite web|url= http://themusic.com.au/reviews/reviews-live/2013/05/02/the-rubens-the-tivoli-carley-hall/ |author=Carley Hall|title= At Tivoli: The Rubens, Oh Mercy, Walk the Moon, MT Warning|publisher=The Music.com.au Brisbane|date=26 April 2013|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl] and Drum Media said of their Sydney performance: "Flanked by an uber-cool collection of lads and ladies, showed some solid guitar prowess and a powerful voice".[tpl]cite web|url= http://themusic.com.au/reviews/reviews-live/2013/05/06/the-temper-trap-enmore-theatre-helen-lear/ |author=Helen Lear|title=At the Enmore Theatre: The temper Trap, Alpine, MT Warning|publisher=The Music.com.au|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl]
