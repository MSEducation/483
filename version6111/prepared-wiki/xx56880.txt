==History==

The magazine began publication in 1985 in the United Kingdom under the name For Him Magazine and changed its title to FHM in 1994 when Emap Consumer Media bought the magazine, although the full For Him Magazine continues to be printed on the spine of each issue.
Circulation expanded to newsagents as a quarterly by the spring of 1987.  It then went monthly and changed its name to FHM in 1994.  It subsequently dominated the men's market and began to expand internationally.
FHM was sold as part of the publishing company sale, from EMAP to German company Bauer Media Group in February 2008.
