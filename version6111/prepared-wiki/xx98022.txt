Maiden Japan, also known as Heavy Metal Army, is a live EP by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The title is a pun of Deep Purple's live album Made in Japan.
There are at least two different versions of this EP; all tracks were recorded in Kosei Nenkin Hall in Nagoya on 23 May 1981.  It was lead singer Paul Di'Anno's final recording with the band, and features a maximum of 5 tracks.  The original Japanese pressing features only 4 tracks and the record speed is 45RPM. It was never the band's intention to release this album, but Toshiba-EMI wanted a live album.

==Cover Art==

The original cover depicted the band's mascot, Eddie, holding the decapitated head of singer Paul Di'Anno.[tpl]cite book | last = Popoff | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Popoff | coauthors = | title = Run For Cover: The Art Of Derek Riggs | publisher = Aardvark Publishing |year=2006| location = | page = 40 | url = http://www.derekriggs.com/| doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4276-0538-6[/tpl] The replacement cover was done on very short notice after Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, received a proof for review, and became agitated at Di'Anno's depiction because the band were looking to replace him. Maiden Japan was released in Venezuela in 1987 with the original cover and has become a collector's item
