Fly is the second album by Yoko Ono, produced by her and John Lennon, and released in 1971. It was a complete avant-garde/Fluxus package in a gatefold sleeve that came with a full-size poster and a postcard to order Ono's book Grapefruit. Notable songs include the singles "Midsummer New York" and "Mrs. Lennon", "Hirake" aka "Open Your Box" and "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)", dedicated to Ono's daughter Kyoko Cox. "Airmale" is the soundtrack to Lennon's film Erection, showing a building being erected in time lapsed photography, while "Fly" is the soundtrack to Ono's film Fly.

==Recording==

The album was recorded around the same time as Lennon's Imagine. Ono had to re-record her vocals on "Open Your Box", on 4 March 1971 at Abbey Road Studios, after a managing director of EMI called the lyrics "distasteful";[tpl]cite book|editor=Miles, Barry; Badman, Keith |title=The Beatles Diary After the Break-Up: 1970-2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Music Sales Group |location=London |isbn=9780711983076 |edition=reprint[/tpl] The song featured a line that went "Open your trousers, open your skirt, open your legs and open your thighs". "Trousers", "skirt", "legs", and "thighs" were changed to "houses", "church", "lakes", and "eyes". Lennon and Ono didn't complain about the change of words, and only "wanted to get the record out", as a spokesman said. 
"Will You Touch Me" was first recorded during the Fly sessions sometime in November 1971, later ending up on 1981's Season of Glass. The original version ended up on the Rykodisc reissue of Fly in 1998.

==Release==

Fly peaked at number 199 in the Billboard charts. On 1 February 1972, Lennon and Ono Lennon recorded "Midsummer New York" backed by Elephant's Memory for an episode of The Mike Douglas Show which aired on 15 February.
