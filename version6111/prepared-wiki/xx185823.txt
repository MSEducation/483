==Career==

===Writer===

Ana María Simo was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba in 1943, and moved to Havana with her grandmother on the eve of the 1959 revolution. She was 15 when she began working as a journalist and 18 when her first book was published: Las fábulas (The Fables), a short story collection. The book was published by Ediciones El Puente, a literary and publishing project (1961 to 1965) which Simo co-directed  along with its founder, the poet José Mario Rodríguez.
Simo immigrated first to Paris (Dec. 1967), where she attended Roland Barthes’ seminar and studied sociology and linguistics at the University of Paris VIII-Vincennes (1968-1972). In the mid-1970s she settled in New York, where she began her career as an English-language writer. Her association with playwright/director Maria Irene Fornes’ theater workshop Peterson, Jane T. and Bennet, Suzanne, 1997. Women Playwrights of Diversity: A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook, Greenwood Press.  p. 19. throughout the 1980s was pivotal in her development as a writer.
Some of her most notable works includes her 1990 play "Going to New England" produced at the INTAR theater."Production Information: Going To New England", Cuban Theater Archive, University of Miami, 2005.  The New York Time's Stephen Holden gave the production mixed reviews, but also wrote that the play itself succeeded as "a study in physical and emotional claustrophobia" examining the traditions of Latin American machismo, Roman Catholic values, and erotic taboos.Holden, Stephen.

Simo's "The Bad Play," a 1991 dance-theater collaboration with choreographer Stephanie Skura, also reviewed in The New York Times, was described as "a very broad and very funny parody" of the Hispanic soap opera with philandering doctors and cantankerous mothers-in-law.Anderson, Jack. (91-10-28) "Dance in Review", New York Times.
Her 1989 short film, How to Kill Her, with Ela Troyano, premiered at the Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival and later went on to win first place in The Latino Film and Video Festival.
Simo's work has mainly been produced in New York City by venues including P.S. 122, Theater for the New City, INTAR Hispanic American Arts Center, the New York Shakespeare Festival's Latino Festival, Duo Theatre, and the WOW Café.

===Activist===

Simo immigrated to Paris in time to participate in the student revolution of May 1968. Shortly afterwards, she participated in women's and lesbian/gay activist groups for the first time, including the Gouines Rouges (Red Dykes), the MLF (Mouvement de Libération des Femmes), and the FHAR (Front homosexuel d´action révolutionnaire).Almendros, Nestor and Jiménez Leal, Orlando. (1984) Mauvaise Conduite.
In 1976 in New York, she co-founded the lesbian theater Medusa's Revenge with actor and director Magaly Alabau. In her book, Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America, Sarah Schulman writes, 
 
 "It is hard to find primary lesbian content on stage by an un-closeted writer before "Fefu and Her Friends" by Maria Irene Fornes in 1977. Or maybe it was Corinne Jacker's "Harry Outside" at the Circle Repertory Company in 1975. But, although each was sealed with a passionate kiss, both of these plays contained their lesbian content in subplots. Lesbian content was primary on stage at Medusa's Revenge at 10 Bleecker Street, the first theater in the world willing to produce our work." Schulman, Sarah. Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America, 1998, Duke University Press, p. 65

In 1992, Simo co-founded the direct action group The Lesbian Avengers with longtime lesbian activists Maxine Wolfe, Anne-Christine d'Adesky, Sarah Schulman, Marie Honan, and Anne Maguire.Schulman, Sarah, My American History, Routledge, 1994  The original group's sole stated focus: "Lesbian survival and visibility." The Lesbian Avengers inspired chapters worldwide. One of its long-term accomplishments is the annual Dyke March in New York City.
Shortly afterwards, along with video producer Mary Patierno and theater director Linda Chapman, she created Dyke TV. The half-hour television program produced by lesbians, for lesbians was aired on Public-access television across the United States for more than a decade. It included a mix of news, political commentary, the arts, health, and sports.Patierno, Mary, Zoom Info. Retrieved 08-01-02
Simo also co-founded The Gully online magazine  (2000-2006) with writer and activist Kelly Cogswell, "to encourage activism and redefine and expand gay issues." It offered queer views of international news, U.S. politics, activism, race, class, LGBT issues, and included a Spanish edition.GLBTQ and other resources Retrieved 09-12-09
