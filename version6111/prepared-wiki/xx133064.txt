==Story==

Under the rule of the Daishougun, the Gundam Army had always protected the peace of the country. But now a group called Tenma Army appeared and the group is spreading their claws across the land, ready to stage a revolt. The Gundam Army had a tough time fending off the Tenma Army. Thus the Daishougun started Touma Koujin Tai(Kidou Resshi Tai in the Bom Bom version), a special task force to seek out and destroy the Tenma Army. Musha Wing Zero was transformed to a child called Hanemaru by Youjutsushi Hydra while fending off the Tenma Army. 
Hanemaru followed the Touma Koujin Tai who found him injured in the ruins of the village. During the period he changes to Musha Wing Zero to help out the group. Later Wing Zero found out that his sister is alive and in the hands of the Tenma Army, in the process of saving his sister, Hanemaru regained his past memory and regained his form of Wing Zero. But the true goal of Hydra is to bring forth the Tenma Taitei, the true origin of all the evil the musha gundams had fought. With the power of the custom weapons of the Koujin Tai and the miracle of the stars Wing Zero and the Daishougun defeated Tenma Taitei and brought peace to the land once again.
