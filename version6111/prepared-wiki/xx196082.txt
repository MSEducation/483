Six Singles from Generation Terrorists is a box set of reissued singles from the debut album by the band Manic Street Preachers. The box set was released in the UK and Ireland only, on 13 September 1997. The six singles were contained in an inner silver box embossed with Six Singles from Generation Terrorists, within a grey cloth-effect slip-case outer box. On 1 September 1997, the six singles were also re-issued separately as a limited edition of 12,000 each. They mostly had the same track listings as the original releases and had very similar artwork to the originals. They entered the UK charts on the day that the box set was released, reaching between #41 and  #55
