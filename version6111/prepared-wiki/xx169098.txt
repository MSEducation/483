Edward Conway, 2nd Viscount Conway PC (bapt. 10 August 1594 – 26 June 1655) was an English politician, military commander and peer.

==Early life and education==

Conway was the eldest son of Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway and his wife, Dorothy, and was baptised on 10 August 1594 in Arrow, Warwickshire. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 3 May 1611 and is thought to have learnt military strategy from his uncle by marriage, Sir Horace Vere. He was knighted on 25 March 1618, and in 1621, he married Frances Popham (a daughter of Sir Francis Popham).

==Political and military service==

Conway was nominated by Lord Brooke to become Member of Parliament for Warwick between 1624 and 1625, and in 1626, he was elected for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight). In 1628, after his father was created Viscount Conway and Viscount Killultagh, Conway was summoned to parliament in the right of the Conway barony. He succeeded his father to his titles following his death on 3 January 1631.
Conway unsuccessfully commanded Charles I's forces at the Battle of Newburn in 1640. He became a Privy Council of Ireland, Marshal of the Army in Ireland, and was served as a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines from 1643 to 1649.
He was briefly imprisoned after being implicated in the plot by Edmund Waller and others to seize London for the king.

==Personal life==

Like his father, Conway had a particular interest in English literature, with literary connections including Sir John Beaumont, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, John Donne, and Sir John Suckling. In 1643, his London library was catalogued as containing 5000 or more volumes, and his Lisnegarvey library, County Antrim, contained between 8000 and 9900 books and manuscripts.
He retired to the house of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland in Petworth, Sussex, in the early 1650s. He later travelled abroad and died in Lyons, France on 26 June 1655. He was buried in Arrow, and his titles passed to his only son, Edward, who was later created Earl of Conway.
