In the field of neuroscience, substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide - a substance that functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator.[tpl]cite journal | author = Harrison S, Geppetti P | title = Substance p | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 555–76 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11378438 | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(01)00031-0  | url =   [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Datar P, Srivastava S, Coutinho E, Govil G | title = Substance P: structure, function, and therapeutics | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–103 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14754378 | doi = 10.2174/1568026043451636| url = http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2004/00000004/00000001/0009R.SGM [/tpl] To be specific, substance P is an hendecapeptide - a peptide composed of a chain of 11 amino acid residues. It belongs to the tachykinin neuropeptide family. Substance P and its closely related neuropeptide neurokinin A (NKA) are produced from a polyprotein precursor after differential splicing of the  preprotachykinin A gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of substance P is as follows:Campbell, Neil A, and Jane B Reece. Biology. 7th ed. San Francisco: Pearson Education, Inc., n.d.Print.

Substance P is released from the terminals of specific sensory nerves, it is found in the brain and spinal cord, and is associated with inflammatory processes and pain.

==Discovery==

Substance P (SP) was originally discovered in 1931 by Ulf von Euler and John H. Gaddum as a tissue extract that caused intestinal contraction in vitro.[tpl]cite journal | author = V Euler US, Gaddum JH | title = An unidentified depressor substance in certain tissue extracts | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–87 |date=June 1931 | pmid = 16994201 | pmc = 1403098 | doi = | url = http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16994201 | issn = [/tpl] Its tissue distribution and biologic actions were further investigated over the following decades. In 1983, NKA (previously known as substance K or neuromedin L) was isolated from porcine spinal cord and was also found to stimulate intestinal contraction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Panula P, Hadjiconstantinou M, Yang HY, Costa E | title = Immunohistochemical localization of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide and substance P in primary sensory neurons | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 2021–9 |date=October 1983 | pmid = 6194276 | doi = | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/3/10/2021 | issn = [/tpl]

==Receptor==

The endogenous receptor for substance P is neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1-receptor, NK1R).[tpl]cite journal | author = Gerard NP, Garraway LA, Eddy RL Jr, Shows TB, Iijima H, Paquet JL, Gerard C | title = Human substance P receptor (NK-1): organization of the gene, chromosome localization, and functional expression of cDNA clones | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 30 | issue = 44 | pages = 10640–6 |date=November 1991 | pmid = 1657150 | doi = 10.1021/bi00108a006| url =  [/tpl] It belongs to the tachykinin receptor sub-family of GPCRs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Maggi CA |title = The mammalian tachykinin receptors | journal = Gen.

Amino acid residues that are responsible for the binding of SP and its antagonists are present in the extracellular loops and transmembrane regions of NK-1. Binding of SP to NK-1 results in internalization by the clathrin-dependent mechanism to the acidified endosomes where the complex disassociates. SP is subsequently  degraded and NK-1 is re-expressed on the cell surface.[tpl]cite journal | author = Grady EF, Garland AM, Gamp PD, Lovett M, Payan DG, Bunnett NW | title = Delineation of the endocytic pathway of substance P and its seven-transmembrane domain NK1 receptor | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 509–24 |date=May 1995 | pmid = 7545030 | pmc = 301212 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.6.5.509| url =  http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/5/509 | issn = [/tpl] Substance P and the NK1 receptor are widely distributed in the brain and are found in brain regions that are specific to regulating emotion (hypothalamus, amygdala, and the periaqueductal gray).[tpl]cite journal | author = Yip J, Chahl LA | title = Localization of NK1 and NK3 receptors in guinea-pig brain | journal = Regulatory peptides | volume = 98 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 55–62 |date=April 2001 | pmid = 11179779 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-0115(00)00228-7  | url =   [/tpl] They are also found in close association with serotonin (5-HT) and neurons containing norepinephrine that are targeted by the currently used antidepressant drugs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gobbi G, Cassano T, Radja F, Morgese MG, Cuomo V, Santarelli L, Hen R, Blier P| title = Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonism requires norepinephrine to increase serotonin function | journal = European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 328–38 |date=April 2007 | pmid = 16950604 | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2006.07.004 | url =  [/tpl] The SP receptor promoter contains regions that are sensitive to cAMP, AP-1, AP-4, CEBPB,[tpl]cite journal | author = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR| title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390–9 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x | url =  [/tpl] and epidermal growth factor. Because these regions are related to complexed signal transduction pathways mediated by cytokines, it has been proposed that cytokines and neurotropic factors can induce NK-1.

==Function==

Substance P is an important element in pain perception. The sensory function of substance P is thought to be related to the transmission of pain information into the central nervous system. Substance P coexists with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in primary afferents that respond to painful stimulation. Substance P has been associated with the regulation of mood disorders, anxiety, stress,[tpl]cite journal | author = Ebner K, Singewald N | title = The role of substance P in stress and anxiety responses | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 251–72 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16820980 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-006-0335-9 | url =  [/tpl] reinforcement,[tpl]cite journal | author = Huston JP, Hasenöhrl RU, Boix F, Gerhardt P, Schwarting RK | title = Sequence-specific effects of neurokinin substance P on memory, reinforcement, and brain dopamine activity | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 112 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 147–62 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7532865 | doi = 10.1007/BF02244906| url =  [/tpl] neurogenesis,[tpl]cite journal | author = Park SW, Yan YP, Satriotomo I, Vemuganti R, Dempsey RJ | title = Substance P is a promoter of adult neural progenitor cell proliferation under normal and ischemic conditions | journal = Journal of neurosurgery | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 593–9 |date=September 2007 | pmid = 17886560 | doi = 10.3171/JNS-07/09/0593 | url =  [/tpl] respiratory rhythm,[tpl]cite journal | author = Bonham AC | title = Neurotransmitters in the CNS control of breathing | journal = Respiration physiology | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–30 |date=September 1995 | pmid = 8606995 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(95)00045-F | url =   [/tpl] neurotoxicity, nausea/emesis,[tpl]cite journal | author = Hesketh PJ | title = Potential role of the NK1 receptor antagonists in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting | journal = Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 350–4 |date=July 2001 | pmid = 11497388 | doi = 10.1007/s005200000199 | url =  [/tpl] pain and nociception.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zubrzycka M, Janecka A | title = Substance P: transmitter of nociception (Minireview) | journal = Endocrine regulations | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–201 |date=December 2000 | pmid = 11137976 | doi = | url = | issn = [/tpl] Substance P and other sensory neuropeptides can be released from the peripheral terminals of sensory nerve fibers in the skin, muscle and joints. It is proposed that this release is involved in neurogenic inflammation, which is a local inflammatory response to certain types of infection or injury.[tpl]cite journal | author = Donkin JJ, Turner RJ, Hassan I, Vink R | title = Substance P in traumatic brain injury | journal = Progress in brain research | volume = 161 | issue = | pages = 97–109 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17618972 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-6123(06)61007-8 | url =  [/tpl] The regulatory function of SP also involves the regulation of its high-affinity receptor, NK-1. Substance P receptor antagonists may have important therapeutic applications in the treatment of a variety of stress-related illnesses, in addition to their potential as analgesics.

===Vomiting===

The vomiting center in the medulla contains high concentrations of substance P and its receptor, in addition to other neurotransmitters such as choline, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and opioids. Their activation stimulates the vomiting reflex. Different emetic pathways exist, and substance P/NK1R appears to be within the final common pathway to regulate vomiting.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hornby PJ | title = Central neurocircuitry associated with emesis | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = Suppl 8A | issue = 8| pages = 106S–112S | series = 111 |date=December 2001 |pmid = 11749934 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00849-X | url =   [/tpl] Substance P antagonist (SPA) aprepitant is available in the market in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea/emesis.

===Pain===

Substance P is involved in nociception, transmitting information about tissue damage from peripheral receptors to the central nervous system to be converted to the sensation of pain. It has been theorized that it plays a part in fibromyalgia. Capsaicin has been shown to reduce the levels of substance P, it is presumed, by reducing the number of C-fibre nerves or causing these nerves to be more tolerant. Thus, capsaicin is clinically used as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent to reduce pain associated with arthritis and many types of neuralgia.  A role of  substance P and NKA in nociception is suggested by the reduction in response thresholds to noxious stimuli by central administration of K2 and K3 agonists. Based on recent studies, it was proposed that NK1, and possibly NK2 receptor antagonists, could be developed as analgesic drugs.
It has been studied that the mice carrying a disruption of the gene encoding SP/NKA show severely reduced nociceptive pain responses when the stimuli are moderate to intense. Pain behaviors induced by mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimulation of somatic and visceral tissues were reduced in the mutant mice lacking SP/NKA. However, it has been proposed that the importance of SP and NKA in animal's  pain response apply only to a certain 'window' of pain intensities, and, when the intensity of the pain stimuli is further increased, the responses of the knockout mice is not severely different from the wild-type mice.[tpl]cite journal | author = De Felipe C, Herrero JF, O'Brien JA, Palmer JA, Doyle CA, Smith AJ, Laird JM, Belmonte C, Cervero F, Hunt SP | title = Altered nociception, analgesia and aggression in mice lacking the receptor for substance P | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6674 | pages = 394–7 |date=March 1998 | pmid = 9537323 | doi = 10.1038/32904 | url =  [/tpl]
Substance P increases glutamate activity (NMDA) in central nervous system, and it is associated with the development of brain edema and functional deficits after traumatic brain injury.[tpl]cite journal | author = Donkin JJ, lNimmo AJ, Cernak I, Blumbergs PC, Vink R | title = Substance P is associated with the development of brain edema and functional deficits after traumatic brain injury | journal = J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 1388–98 |date=August 2009 | pmid = 19436311 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2009.63 | url =  [/tpl]

===Cell growth===

Substance P has been known to stimulate cell growth in culture,[tpl]cite journal | author = Reid TW, Murphy CJ, Iwahashi CK, Foster BA, Mannis MJ | title = Stimulation of epithelial cell growth by the neuropeptide substance P | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 52 |issue = 4 | pages = 476–85 |date=August 1993 | pmid = 7693729 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.240520411 |url =  [/tpl] and it was shown that substance P could promote wound healing of non-healing ulcers in humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Brown SM, Lamberts DW, Reid TW, Nishida T, Murphy CJ | title = Neurotrophic and anhidrotic keratopathy treated with substance P and insulinlike growth factor 1 | journal = Archives of Ophthalmology | volume = 115 | issue = 7 | pages = 926–7|date=July 1997 | pmid = 9230840 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.1997.01100160096021| url = | issn = [/tpl]

===Diabetes===

Substance P injected into pancreatic nerves has been shown to reverse diabetes in mice[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10812-breakthrough-sheds-light-on-cause-of-diabetes.html | title = Breakthrough sheds light on cause of diabetes  | author = Motluk A,  Geddes  L | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2005-12-15 | work = Health | publisher = New Scientist | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-11-01[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Tsui H, Razavi R, Chan Y, Yantha J, Dosch HM |title = 'Sensing' autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 13 |issue = 10 | pages = 405–13 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17900987 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2007.07.006 | url =  [/tpl] but effects to insulin secretion seem to be species-dependent. In humans, substance P given intravenously seems to decrease insulin release and causes fluctuations in blood sugar levels.[tpl]cite journal | author = Brown, M and Vale, W | title = Effects of neurotensin and substance P on plasma insulin, glucagon and glucose levels | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 819–822 | year = 1976 | pmid = 1261503 | doi = 10.1210/endo-98-3-819 | url =  [/tpl]

===Vasodilation===

Substance P also has effects as a potent vasodilator. Substance P-induced vasodilatation is dependent on nitric oxide release.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bossaller C, Reither K, Hehlert-Friedrich C, Auch-Schwelk W, Graf K, Gräfe M, Fleck E | title = In vivo measurement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation with substance P in man | journal = Herz | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 284–90 |date=October 1992 | pmid = 1282120 | doi = | url = | issn = [/tpl]  Substance P is involved in the axon reflex-mediated vasodilatation to local heating and wheal and flare reaction. It has been shown that vasodilatation to substance P is dependent on the NK1 receptor located on the endothelium.  In contrast to other neuropeptides studied in human skin, substance P-induced vasodilatation has been found to decline during continuous infusion. This possibly suggests an internalization of neurokinin-1 (NK1).[tpl]cite journal | author = Wong BJ, Tublitz NJ, Minson CT | title = Neurokinin-1 receptor desensitization to consecutive microdialysis infusions of substance P in human skin | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 568 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 1047–56 |date=November 2005 | pmid = 16123103 | pmc = 1464169 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2005.095372 | url =  [/tpl]  As is typical with many vasodilators, it also has bronchoconstrictive properties, administered through the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nervous system (branch of the vagal system).

==Clinical significance==

===Eczema===

High levels of BDNF and substance P have been found associated with increased itching in eczema.[tpl]cite web | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6962450.stm | title =  'Blood chemicals link' to eczema | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2007-08-26 | format = | work = Health | publisher = BBC NEWS | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-11-01[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hon KL, Lam MC, Wong KY, Leung TF, Ng PC | title = Pathophysiology of nocturnal scratching in childhood atopic dermatitis: the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and substance P | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 157 | issue = 5| pages = 922–5 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 17725670 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.08149.x|url =  [/tpl]

===Gastrointestinal infection===

Entamoeba histolytica is a unicellular parasitic protozoan that infects the lower gastrointestinal tract of humans. The  symptoms of infection are diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Steinitz H |title=recurrent intestinal amebiasis in Israel (author's transl) |language=German |journal = Leber, Magen, Darm |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=175–9 |year=1979|pmid=491812 |doi=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Stark D, van Hal S, Marriott D, Ellis J, Harkness J | title = Irritable bowel syndrome: a review on the role of intestinal protozoa and the importance of their detection and diagnosis |journal=Int.

Symp. | volume = 112 | issue= | pages = 139–54 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2861068 | doi =[/tpl]

===Denervation supersensitivity===

When the innervation to substance P nerve terminals is lost, post-synaptic cells compensate for the loss of adequate neurotransmitter by increasing the expression of post-synaptic receptors.  This, ultimately, leads to a condition known as Denervation Supersensitivity as the post-synaptic nerves will become hypersensitive to any invasion of substance P into the synaptic cleft.

==Deficiency==

Naked mole rats lack cutaneous C fibers reactive to substance P (SP) and many small neurons that are normally SP-positive. Thus, these animals are insensitive to pain when painful stimuli are administered to the skin.[tpl]cite journal | author=Park TJ, Comer C, Carol A, Lu Y, Hong HS, Rice FL | title = Somatosensory organization and behavior in naked mole-rats: II. Peripheral structures, innervation, and selective lack of neuropeptides associated with thermoregulation and pain | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 465 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12926019 | doi = 10.1002/cne.10824[/tpl] New studies have shown that, when the function of SP is genetically disrupted in mice, the animals demonstrated reduced responses to painful stimuli. Moreover, the response to capsaicin was absent or severely reduced in knockout mice.
