[[Covering code]]

CATEGORIES: Coding theory

In coding theory, a covering code is a set of elements (called codewords) in a space, with the property that every element of the space is within a fixed distance of some codeword. 

==Definition==

q-ary R-covering code of length n
In other words, the spheres (or balls or rook-domains) of radius R
with respect to the Hamming metric around the codewords of C have to exhaust
The covering radius of a code C is the smallest R such that C is R-covering.
Every perfect code is a covering code of minimal size.

==Example==

C = {0134,0223,1402,1431,1444,2123,2234,3002,3310,4010,4341} is a 5-ary 2-covering code of length 4.P.R.J. Östergård, Upper bounds for q-ary covering codes, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 37 (1991), 660-664

==Covering problem==

Every construction of a covering code gives an upper bound on Kq(n, R).
Lower bounds include the sphere covering bound and 

==Football pools problem==

A particular case is the football pools problem, based on football pool betting, where the aim is to predict the results of n football matches as a home win, draw or away win, or to at least predict  [tpl]nowrap|n - 1[/tpl] of them with multiple bets.  Thus a ternary covering, K3(n,1), is sought.
