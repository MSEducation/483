[[Pi-hahiroth]]

Pi-hahiroth ([tpl]lang-he|פִּי החִירֹת[/tpl]) is the fourth station of the Exodus. The fifth and sixth stations Marah and Elim (Bible) are located on the Red Sea. The biblical books Exodus and Numbers refer to Pi-hahiroth as the place where the Israelites encamped between Baal-zephon and Migdol while awaiting an attack by Pharaoh, prior to crossing the Red Sea.
Those positing a Hebrew name have speculated "Pi-hahiroth" might mean "mouth of the gorges", descriptive of its location as the end of a canal or river.
William Smith, in his Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, tentatively identifies Pi-hahiroth with Arsinoe, Egypt.
