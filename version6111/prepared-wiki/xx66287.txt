[[Absorption law]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Boolean algebra, Theorems in propositional logic, Lattice theory

In algebra, the absorption law or absorption identity is an identity linking a pair of binary operations.
Two binary operations, ¤ and ⁂, are said to be connected by the absorption law if:
Examples of lattices include Boolean algebras, the set of sets with union and intersection operators, Heyting algebras, and ordered sets with min and max operations.
The absorption law does not hold in many other algebraic structures, such as commutative rings, e.g. the field of real numbers, relevance logics, linear logics, and substructural logics. In the last case, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the free variables of the defining pair of identities.
