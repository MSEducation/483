so
and
This completes the proof of the lemma.

===[tpl]anchor|Lemma 4[/tpl]Lemma 4: An upper bound on the primorial===

We estimate the primorial function,
Proof:
Thus the lemma is proven.

==Proof of Bertrand's Postulate==

Assume there is a counterexample: an integer n ≥ 2 such that there is no prime p  with n If 2 ≤ n < 468, then p can be chosen from among the prime numbers 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 43, 83, 163, 317, 631 (each being less than twice its predecessor) such that n Therefore, every prime factor p satisfies p ≤ 2n/3.
Taking logarithms yields to
By concavity of the right-hand side as a function of n, the last inequality is necessarily verified on an interval. Since it holds true for n=467 and it does not for n=468, we obtain
But these cases have already been settled, and we conclude that no counterexample to the postulate is possible.

First, refine lemma 1 to:
Proof: By induction:
Taking logarithms to get
