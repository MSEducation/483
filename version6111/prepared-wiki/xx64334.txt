==Rules==

Each player is dealt seven "red apple" cards to make up their starting hand. On each card is printed a noun or noun phrase (both proper and common nouns are used), or occasionally a gerund. In the "Party Crate" packaging of the game, the game is played with hands of five red cards instead of seven.
The game is played in rounds with one player acting as the "judge" in each round. The judge for the round draws a "green apple" card on which is printed an adjective ("scary", "frivolous", "patriotic", etc.), and places it face-up on the table for everybody to see. Then each player other than the judge chooses a red apple card from their hand that they think is the best "match" for the chosen green apple card, and places it face-down. The judge shuffles the red apple cards, reads them (often aloud), and decides which is the best match for the green apple card. This decision is subjective; the official rules encourage the judge to pick the match that is "most creative, humorous or interesting".
The player who submitted the chosen red apple card wins the round, and takes the green apple card to signify their win. All players then draw a new red apple card to replace the one played in the previous round. The role of "judge" may pass to another person (generally passing to the next player in line, though some rules have the round's winner becoming the next "judge"). Some editions of the game suggest automatically rejecting the last redcard played in each round from consideration, to encourage players to play their cards more quickly.
The winner of the game is the first player to accumulate a pre-designated number of green cards (or alternatively, the player with the most green cards after a set number of rounds).

===Variations===

The game's structure is very flexible and affords for an array of possibilities for custom rules. The official rules suggest a series of these alternate rules to add variety to the gameplay:
