[[Gesshū Sōko]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese Zen Buddhists, 1618 births, 1696 deaths

Gesshū Sōko (1618–1696) was a Japanese Zen Buddhist teacher and a member of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. He studied under teachers of the lesser known, and more strictly monastic, Obaku School of Zen and contributed to a reformation of Sōtō monastic codes. As a result, he is sometimes given the title "The Revitalizer".
He is known for his calligraphy[tpl]cite book |title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East, third edition |first=John |last=Stevens[/tpl] as well as his poetry, including his death poem: 
 
 Inhale, exhale 
Forward, back 
Living, dying: 
Arrows, let flown each to each 
Meet midway and slice 
The void in aimless flight -- 
Thus I return to the source.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoffmann |first=Yoel |title=Japanese Death Poems: Written by Zen Monks and Haiku Poets on the Verge of Death |year=1986 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing[/tpl]

Gesshū Sōko passed Dharma transmission to Zen Master Manzan Dohaku who went on to restore the strong master-disciple bond in Sōtō Zen.
