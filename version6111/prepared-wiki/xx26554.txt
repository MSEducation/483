Ho Chi Minh City ([tpl]lang-vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh[/tpl]; [tpl]Audio|Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl]), formerly named Saigon ([tpl]lang-vi|Sài Gòn[/tpl]; [tpl]audio|Saigon.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|Saïgon[/tpl]), is the largest city in Vietnam. It was once known as Prey Nokor, an important Khmer sea port prior to annexation by the Vietnamese in the 17th century. Under the name Saigon, it was the capital of the French colony of Cochinchina and later of the independent republic of South Vietnam from 1955–75. South Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell and the war ended with a Communist victory. On 2 July 1976, Saigon merged with the surrounding Gia Định Province and was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after Hồ Chí Minh (although the name [tpl]lang|vi|Sài Gòn[/tpl] is still commonly used).[tpl]cite web|title=Letter from Ho Chi Minh City A Tribute to My Vietnam Vet Father|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/brown11122007.html|work=CounterPunch|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=15 October 2012|author=Ben Brown|date=12 November 2007[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. In the 1690s, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. Control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the official name of [tpl]lang|vi|Gia Định[/tpl] ([tpl]linktext|嘉|定[/tpl]). This name remained until the time of French conquest in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name Saigon for the city, a westernized form of the traditional name,[tpl]cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=354|author=Robert M.

In particular, Sài Gòn is still commonly used to refer to District 1.[tpl]Cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=353|author=Robert M.

===Etymology===

An etymology of Saigon (or Sài Gòn in Vietnamese) is that Sài is a Sino-Vietnamese word (Hán tự: 柴) meaning "firewood, lops, twigs; palisade", while Gòn is another Sino-Vietnamese word (Hán tự: 棍) meaning "stick, pole, bole", and whose meaning evolved into "cotton" in Vietnamese (bông gòn, literally "cotton stick", i.e., "cotton plant", then shortened to gòn). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at Cây Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Trương Vĩnh Ký, Souvenirs historiques sur Saigon et ses environs, trong Excursions et Reconnaissance X. Saigon, Imprimerie Coloniale 1885
Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (堤 岸), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means "embankment" (French: quais),"Un siècle plus tard (1773), la révolte des TÁYON (sic)  tout, d'abord dans les montagnes de la province de Qui-Nhon, et s’étendit rapidement dans le sud, chassa de Bien-Hoa le mouvement commercial qu’y avaient attiré les Chinois. Ceux-ci abandonnèrent Cou-lao-pho, remontèrent de fleuve de Tan-Binh, et vinrent choisir la position actuele de CHOLEN. Cette création date d'environ 1778. Ils appelèrent leur nouvelle résidence TAI-NGON ou TIN-GAN. Le nom transformé par les Annamites en celui de SAIGON fut depuis appliqué à tort, par l'expédition française, au SAIGON actuel dont la dénomination locale est BEN-NGHE ou BEN-THANH." Francis Garnier, quoted in: [tpl]cite book|title=Tuyển tập Vương Hồng Sến|author=Hồng Sến Vương, Q. Thắng Nguyễn|url=http://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn học|year=2002[/tpl] and Vietnamese Sai Côn, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor ([tpl]lang-km|ព្រៃនគរ[/tpl]). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' — thus, "forest city" or "forest kingdom"."The Khmer name for Saigon, by the way, is Prey Nokor; prey means forest, nokor home or city."

The current official name, [tpl]lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh[/tpl], abbreviated Tp. HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as [tpl]lang|fr|Hô Chi Minh Ville[/tpl] (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Hồ Chí Minh, the pre-eminent North Vietnamese leader. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, 胡) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from Sino-Vietnamese 志 明; Chí meaning 'will' (or spirit), and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "bringer of light".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ho_chi_minh.shtml|title=Historic Figures: Hồ Chí Minh (1890–1969)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=1 June 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

Ho Chi Minh City began as a small fishing village likely known as Prey Nokor. The area that the city now occupies was originally swampland, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese. In Khmer folklore southern Vietnam was given to the Vietnamese government as a dowry for the marriage of a Vietnamese princess to a Khmer prince in order to stop constant invasions and pillaging of Khmer villages.Jean Morice, Cambodge, du sourire à l'horreur, Éditions France-Empire, 1977, p.30. The early dynastical entity was the Rhead-Sivakumaran family who dominated the region in the early Romanic period, until the Qing dynasty overcame the armies of Rhead-Sivakumaran and General Behan in BC820.[tpl]cite book|last=Schweyer|first=Anne-Valerie|title=Ancient Vietnam[/tpl]

===Khmer territory===

Beginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618–1628) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a custom house there.Mai Thục, [tpl]lang|vi|Vương miện lưu đày: truyện lịch sử[/tpl], Nhà xuất bản Văn hóa – thông tin, 2004, p.580; Giáo sư Hoàng Xuân Việt, Nguyễn Minh Tiến hiệu đính, [tpl]lang|vi|Tìm hiểu lịch sử chữ quốc ngữ[/tpl], Ho Chi Minh City, Công ty Văn hóa Hương Trang, pp.31–33; Helen Jarvis, Cambodia, Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city cut off Cambodia's southeasterly access to the sea. Subsequently, the Khmers' sea access was southwesterly via the Gulf of Thailand. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Nguyễn Dynasty rule===

In 1698, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế by seaThe first settlers, http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia Định was built, which was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of Kỳ Hòa (see Citadel of Saigon). [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Colonial French era===

Conquered by France and Spain in 1859, the city was influenced by the French during their colonial occupation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French."Yearbook of the Encyclopedia Americana (2006)", p. 175.

===Capital of South Vietnam===

The Vietnamese people had proclaimed their own independence in 1945 after a combined French and Japanese occupation, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The US decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony.
4 April 1967 speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. at Riverside Church in New York CityThe Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam by Daniel C. Hallin
Former Emperor Bảo Đại made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. After the Việt Minh gained control of North Vietnam in 1954, it became common to refer to the Saigon government as "South Vietnam". The government was renamed the Republic of Vietnam when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm in 1955 in a fraudulent referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with many Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the Đô Thành Sài Gòn (Capital City Saigon). [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Post-Vietnam War and today===

At the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the "fall of Saigon", while the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the "Liberation of Saigon". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia Ðịnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader Hồ Chí Minh. The former name Saigon is still widely used by many Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelterrific.com/spring2000/asia_sp00_03.html|title=Pearl of the Orient is still Vietnam's heart|publisher=Travelterrific.com|accessdate=3 April 2010[/tpl] Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.

The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city center in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city center in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Center completed the 17.8   km 10–14 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade center, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Center, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

==Transport[tpl]anchor|Transportation[/tpl]==

===Air===

The city is served by Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic"Expansion of Saigon – Tan Son Nhat International Airport on", Sài Gòn Giải Phóng Newspaper, 13 October 2007 http://www.sggp.org.vn/xahoi/2007/10/125219/Two more HanoiSaigon flights per day for Pacific Airlines on Vietnamnet.net, accessdate 11 November 2007, [tpl]vi[/tpl] http://vietnamnet.vn/kinhte/2007/11/753468). Long Thành International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025.

===Rail===

Ho Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Within the city, the two main stations are Sóng Thần and Sài Gòn. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as Dĩ An, Thủ Đức, Bình Triệu, Gò Vấp. However, rail transportation is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.mt.gov.vn/ykienatgt/print.asp?ArticleId=2576 |title=Print Version |publisher=.mt.gov.vn |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]

===Water===

The city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including Vũng Tàu, Cần Thơ and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011–14.[tpl]Cite news|work=Vietnam News|title=City to expand waterway transport|url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/198826/City-to-expand-waterway-transport.html|author=Vietnam News Service[/tpl]

===Coach bus===

Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station – in terms of passengers handled – is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the Bình Thạnh District.

===Inner city transportation===

====Private transport====

The main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have trip meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. Public buses run on many routes and fare can be purchased on the bus. For short trips, "xe ôm" (literally, "hug vehicle") motorcycle taxis are available where the passenger sits at the rear of a motorbike. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]. There are approximated 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compare to Hanoi. The growing number of motorcycles tend to cause gridlocks and pollute the air. These are two reasons why the government develops plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transportation besides other measures to reduce traffic.[tpl]cite web |title=Imminent gridlocks |author=Hans-Heinrich Bass, Thanh Trung Nguyen |publisher=dandc.eu |date=April 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/vietnam-needs-tackle-urban-traffic-congestion[/tpl]

====Metro system====

The Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a light rail rapid transit network, is currently in the preparation stages, with the first line currently under construction, to be completed by 2017. This first line will connect Bến Thành to Suối Tiên Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/vietnammetro|title=Ho Chi Minh City Metro|publisher=Railway-technology.com|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] A line between Bến Thành and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government,[tpl]Cite news|work=Thanh Nien|title=HCMC's subway route No.2 approved|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/2008/Pages/20081211135245044481.aspx|author=Dinh Muoi[/tpl] and several more lines are currently the subject of feasibility studies.
