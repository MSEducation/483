==Biography==

Born in Minhou in Fujian province, he obtained the highest degree in the imperial examinations in 1847 and was soon appointed to the Hanlin Academy.
His great administrative abilities attracted the attention of Zeng Guofan, who enlisted him in the effort to suppress the Taiping Rebellion.
Following the suppression of the rebellion in 1864, Shen became actively involved in the Self-strengthening movement and later worked on the shipyard in Fuzhou (Foochow).  He utilized the skill of French technicians and workers[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]notably Prosper Giquel[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]to construct modern warships for the Imperial Navy prior to the destruction of the arsenal and the fleet itself during the Battle of Foochow in the 1883–1885 Sino-French War.
He also took part in obtaining a peace settlement with Japan, following the Japanese Taiwan Expedition of 1874. Then he was appointed as the Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1875 and died in 1879 during the post. He is chiefly remembered for his belated opposition to the Woosung Road Company's railroad, which he purchased and dismantled in its first year of operation,Huenemann, Ralph Wm.

Shen was married to Lin Puqing (林普晴, 1821–77), the third daughter of Lin Zexu.  She exhibited great courage and determined tenacity when under siege by the Taiping rebels at Guangxin when she bandaged troops, cooked for them and cut her finger to write a message in blood.
