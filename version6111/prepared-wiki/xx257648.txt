Forsnes chapel ([tpl]lang-no|Forsnes kapell[/tpl]) is a chapel in the municipality of Hitra in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The chapel is located in the village of Forsnes on the southwestern coast of the island of Hitra.
The new Kvenvær church was built at Kvenvær on Hitra in 1909, but the old Kvenvær church remained on the island of Hakkebuøya west of Kvenvær where it had been since the mid-1400s.  The church was unused from 1909 until 1934 when the building was deconstructed, moved, and rebuilt as the Forsnes chapel in Forsnes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkdalsmenighetene.no/forsnes/index.htm|title=Forsnes kirke|language=Norwegian|publisher=Orkdals prosti|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
