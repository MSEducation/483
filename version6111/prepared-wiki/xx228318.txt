The Technoseum (former name State Museum of Technology and Work, German: Landesmuseum f端r Technik und Arbeit) is a technology museum in Mannheim, Baden-W端rttemberg, Germany, with displays covering the industrialisation of the south-western regions of the country.
The museum building was designed by the Berlin architect, Ingeborg Kuhler. Its planning and construction period lasted from 1982 to 1990.

==The permanent exhibition==

Visitors who walk through the building from top to bottom will experience a journey in time from the beginning of the industrial revolution in the state of Baden-W端rttemberg to the present day.
Stands portraying the technical, social and political changes since the 18th century include those on clocks, paper manufacture and weaving. There are displays of living and working premises as well as machinery from the fields of industry, transport and the office. These displays enable the visitor to gain a graphic understanding of the far-reaching changes in living and working conditions right up to the present. 
The Elementa workshop complements, in an interesting way, the themes and exhibits of technological, economic and social history shown to date. It is not limited to covering basic scientific principles, but also shows the technical inventions which resulted from various scientific experiments.
The collections may be viewed over the BAM-Portal, Germany's common portal for libraries, archives and museums.
