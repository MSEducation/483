Operation Dingson (5–18 June 1944) was an operation in the Second World War, conducted by 178 Free French paratroops of the 4th Special Air Service (SAS), commanded by Colonel Pierre-Louis Bourgoin, who jumped into German occupied France near Vannes, Morbihan, Southern Brittany, in Plumelec, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30) with Captain Pierre Marienne and 17 men, then advanced to Saint-Marcel (8–18 June).
At this time, there were approximately 100,000 German troops, and artillery, preparing to move to the Normandy landing areas.
Immediately upon landing in Brittany, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30), the Free French SAS who jumped in near Plumelec, went into action fighting against German troops (Vlassov's army).
One hour later (0 h 40), the first victim of the liberation of his country, Corporal Emile Bouétard (born 1915 in Brittany) was killed near Plumelec.
The Free French SAS established a base (Saint-Marcel) and began to arm and equip members of local resistance fighters, operating with up to 3,000 Maquis fighters. However, their base was heavily attacked by a German paratroop division on 18 June and was forced to disperse.[tpl]cite book | last = Shortt | first = James | authorlink =  | coauthors = Angus McBride | title = The Special Air Service | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 1981 | location =  | page=14 | url =  | isbn = 0-85045-396-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Beavan  | first = Colin | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Operation Jedburgh: D-Day and America's First Shadow War | publisher = Viking | year = 2006 | page=147 | url =  | isbn = 0-670-03762-1 [/tpl]

The SAS teams remained behind enemy lines in occupied territory until the Allies arrived.
The glider pilots were looked after by the local Resistance and then met up with the advancing American army at Auray.
