[[Concave function]]

In mathematics, a concave function is the negative of a convex function. A concave function is also synonymously called concave downwards, concave down, convex upwards, convex cap or upper convex.

==Definition==

A real-valued function f on an interval (or, more generally, a convex set in vector space) is said to be concave if, for any x and y in the interval and for any t  in 0,1, 
A function is called strictly concave if
for any t in (0,1) and x ≠ y.
For a function f:R→R, this definition merely states that for every z between x and y, the point (z, f(z) ) on the graph of f is above the straight line joining the points (x, f(x) ) and (y, f(y) ).

==Properties==

A function f(x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function −f(x) is a convex function over the set.
A differentiable function f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f ′  is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope.  ("Decreasing" here means non-increasing, rather than strictly decreasing, and thus allows zero slopes.)
For a twice-differentiable function f, if the second derivative, f ′′(x), is positive (or, if the acceleration is positive), then the graph is convex; if f ′′(x) is negative, then the graph is concave. Points where concavity changes are inflection points. 
If a convex (i.e., concave upward) function has a "bottom", any point at the bottom is a minimal extremum.  If a concave (i.e., concave downward) function has an "apex", any point at the apex is a maximal extremum. 
If f(x) is twice-differentiable, then f(x) is concave if and only if f ′′(x) is non-positive. If its second derivative is negative then it is strictly concave, but the opposite is not true, as shown by f(x) = -x4.
If f is concave and differentiable, then it is bounded above by its first-order Taylor approximation:
A continuous function on C is concave if and only if for any x and y in C
If a function f is concave, and f(0) ≥ 0, then f is subadditive. Proof:
