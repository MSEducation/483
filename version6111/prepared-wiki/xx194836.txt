[[Intramolecular Diels–Alder cycloaddition]]

CATEGORIES: Name reactions, Cycloadditions

In organic chemistry, an intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition is a Diels–Alder reaction in which the diene and a dienophile are both part of the same molecule. The reaction leads to the formation of the same cyclohexene-like structure as usual for a Diels–Alder reaction, but as part of a more complex fused or bridged cyclic ring system.

==Reaction products==

Because the two reacting groups are already attached, two basic modes of addition are possible in this reaction. Depending on whether the tether that links to the dienophile is attached to the end or the middle of the diene, fused or bridged polycyclic ring systems can be formed.M. Nantz, G. Zweifel. (2007) Modern Organic Synthesis an Introduction. W. H. Freeman, pp. 429–430, ISBN 0716772663.
The tether than attaches the two reacting groups also affects the geometry of the reaction. As a result of its conformational and other structural restrictions, the exo vs endo resultsP.Y Bruice (2007). Organic Chemistry.

==Applications==

Intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition is extremely useful for the formation of naturally occurring polycyclic rings.  The reaction provides ready access to polycyclic compounds with a great deal of stereoselectivity.  The following are several useful drugs whose complete synthesis have been accomplished using the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction.

===Solanapyrone A===

Solanapyrone A is an inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase β and λ, repair type DNA polymerase.  The compound was isolated from the phytopathogenic fungi Alternaria solani, the cause of “early blight” in tomato and potato plants.  The drug is being look as an anti-cancer medication.[tpl]cite journal|author=B. Lygo, M.
