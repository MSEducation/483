Whereas "ordinary" or metallic superconductors usually have transition temperatures (temperatures below which they superconduct) below  [tpl]convert|30|K|°C[/tpl], HTS have been observed with transition temperatures as high as [tpl]convert|138|K|°C[/tpl]. Until 2008, only certain compounds of copper and oxygen (so-called "cuprates") were believed to have HTS properties, and the term high-temperature superconductor was used interchangeably with cuprate superconductor for compounds such as bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) and yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO). However, several iron-based compounds (the iron pnictides) are now known to be superconducting at high temperatures.Choi, Charles Q.

==History==

The phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, in metallic mercury below [tpl]convert|4|K|°C[/tpl]. For seventy-five years after that, researchers attempted to observe superconductivity at higher and higher temperatures.[tpl]cite video |people=Nisbett, Alec (Producer)|year=1988 |title=Superconductor: The race for the prize |url= |medium=Television Episode[/tpl] In the late 1970s, superconductivity was observed in certain metal oxides at temperatures as high as [tpl]convert|13|K|C[/tpl], which were much higher than those for elemental metals. In 1986, J. Georg Bednorz and K Alex Müller, working at the IBM research lab near Zurich, Switzerland were exploring a new class of ceramics for superconductivity. Bednorz encountered a barium-doped compound of lanthanum and copper oxide whose resistance dropped down to zero at a temperature around [tpl]convert|35|K|C[/tpl]. Their results were soon confirmed Stuart A Wolf & Vladimir Z Kresin,Eds,  Novel Superconductivity, Springer (October, 1987)  by many groups,Per Fridtjof Dahl, Superconductivity, AIP, (1992) notably Paul Chu at the University of Houston and Shoji Tanaka at the University of Tokyo.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Shoji|title=High temperature superconductivity: History and Outlook|journal=JSAP International|year=2001|url=http://www.jsap.or.jp/jsapi/Pdf/Number04/PastPresentFuture.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl]
Shortly after, P. W. Anderson, at Princeton University came up with the first theoretical description of these materials, using the resonating valence bond theory,[tpl]cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip|title=The Resonating valence bond state in la-2CuO-4 and superconductivity|journal=Science|volume=235|pages=1196–1198|year=1987|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/235/4793/1196.abstract|bibcode = 1987Sci...235.1196A |doi = 10.1126/science.235.4793.1196|pmid=17818979|issue=4793[/tpl] but a full understanding of these materials is still developing today.  These superconductors are now known to possess a d-wave pair symmetry. The first proposal that high-temperature cuprate superconductivity involves d-wave pairing was made in 1987 by Bickers, Scalapino and Scalettar,[tpl]cite journal|last1=Bickers|first1=N.E.|last2=Scalapino|first2=D. J.|last3=Scalettar|first3=R. T.|title=CDW and SDW mediated pairing interactions|journal=Int. J. Mod. Phys. B|volume=1|pages=687|year=1987[/tpl] followed by three subsequent theories in 1988 by Inui, Doniach, Hirschfeld and Ruckenstein,[tpl]cite journal|last4=Ruckenstein|first4=Andrei E.|last3=Hirschfeld|first3=Peter J.|last2=Doniach|first2=Sebastian|last1=Inui|first1=Masahiko|title=Coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in a mean-field theory of high-Tc superconductors|journal=Phys.

The confirmation of the d-wave nature of the cuprate
superconductors was made by a variety of experiments, including the
direct observation of the d-wave nodes in the excitation spectrum through
Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy, the observation of a half-integer 
flux in tunneling experiments, and indirectly from the temperature dependence
of the penetration depth, specific heat and thermal conductivity.
The superconductor with the highest transition temperature that has been confirmed by multiple independent research groups (a prerequisite to be called a discovery, verified by peer review) is mercury barium calcium copper oxide (HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8) at around 133 K.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schilling|first=A. et al.|title=Superconductivity in the Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system|journal=Nature|year=1993|url=http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/schilling/index.html[/tpl]
After more than twenty years of intensive research the origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still not clear, but it seems that instead of electron-phonon attraction mechanisms, as in conventional superconductivity, one is dealing with genuine electronic mechanisms (e.g. by antiferromagnetic correlations), and instead of s-wave pairing, d-waves are substantial.
One goal of all this research is room-temperature superconductivity.[tpl]cite book|author = A. Mourachkine|year = 2004|title = Room-Temperature Superconductivity|publisher = Cambridge International Science Publishing|arxiv=cond-mat/0606187|isbn = 1-904602-27-4[/tpl]

==Crystal structures of high-temperature ceramic superconductors==

The structure of high-Tc copper oxide or cuprate superconductors CP Poole, T Datta, HA Farach, Copper oxide superconductors New York, NY; John Wiley and Sons Inc. are often closely related to perovskite structure, and the structure of these compounds has been described as a distorted, oxygen deficient multi-layered perovskite structure. One of the properties of the crystal structure of oxide superconductors is an alternating multi-layer of CuO2 planes with superconductivity taking place between these layers. The more layers of CuO2 the higher Tc. This structure causes a large anisotropy in normal conducting and superconducting properties, since electrical currents are carried by holes induced in the oxygen sites of the CuO2 sheets. The electrical conduction is highly anisotropic, with a much higher conductivity parallel to the CuO2 plane than in the perpendicular direction. Generally, Critical temperatures depend on the chemical compositions, cations substitutions and oxygen content. They can be classified as superstripes; i.e., particular realizations of superlattices at atomic limit made of superconducting atomic layers, wires, dots separated by spacer layers, that gives multiband and multigap superconductivity.

===YBaCuO superconductors===

The first superconductor found with Tc > 77 K (liquid nitrogen boiling point) is yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7-x); the proportions of the 3 different metals in the YBa2Cu3O7 superconductor are in the mole ratio of 1 to 2 to 3 for yttrium to barium to copper, respectively. Thus, this particular superconductor is often referred to as the 123 superconductor.
The unit cell of YBa2Cu3O7 consists of three pseudocubic elementary perovskite unit cells. Each perovskite unit cell contains a Y or Ba atom at the center: Ba in the bottom unit cell, Y in the middle one, and Ba in the top unit cell. Thus, Y and Ba are stacked in the sequence Ba–Y–Ba along the c-axis. All corner sites of the unit cell are occupied by Cu, which has two different coordinations, Cu(1) and Cu(2), with respect to oxygen. There are four possible crystallographic sites for oxygen: O(1), O(2), O(3) and O(4). The coordination polyhedra of Y and Ba with respect to oxygen are different. The tripling of the perovskite unit cell leads to nine oxygen atoms, whereas YBa2Cu3O7 has seven oxygen atoms and, therefore, is referred to as an oxygen-deficient perovskite structure. The structure has a stacking of different layers: (CuO)(BaO)(CuO2)(Y)(CuO2)(BaO)(CuO). One of the key feature of the unit cell of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) is the presence of two layers of CuO2. The role of the Y plane is to serve as a spacer between two CuO2 planes. In YBCO, the Cu–O chains are known to play an important role for superconductivity. Tc is maximal near 92 K when x ≈ 0.15 and the structure is orthorhombic. Superconductivity disappears at x ≈ 0.6, where the structural transformation of YBCO occurs from orthorhombic to tetragonal.

===Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-Tc superconductors===

The crystal structure of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-Tc superconductors are very similar.Allen M. Hermann & J.V. Yakhmi, Eds, Thallium-Based High-Temperature Superconductors, 1994, Marcel Dekker Like YBCO, the perovskite-type feature and the presence of CuO2 layers also exist in these superconductors. However, unlike YBCO, Cu–O chains are not present in these superconductors. The YBCO superconductor has an orthorhombic structure, whereas the other high-Tc superconductors have a tetragonal structure.
The Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O system has three superconducting phases forming a homologous series as Bi2Sr2Can−1CunO4+2n+x (n = 1, 2 and 3). These three phases are Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223, having transition temperatures of 20, 85 and 110 K, respectively, where the numbering system represent number of atoms for Bi, Sr, Ca and Cu respectively. The two phases have a tetragonal structure which consists of two sheared crystallographic unit cells. The unit cell of these phases has double Bi–O planes which are stacked in a way that the Bi atom of one plane sits below the oxygen atom of the next consecutive plane. The Ca atom forms a layer within the interior of the CuO2 layers in both Bi-2212 and Bi-2223; there is no Ca layer in the Bi-2201 phase. The three phases differ with each other in the number of CuO2 planes; Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 phases have one, two and three CuO2 planes, respectively. The c axis of these phases increases with the number of CuO2 planes (see table below). The coordination of the Cu atom is different in the three phases. The Cu atom forms an octahedral coordination with respect to oxygen atoms in the 2201 phase, whereas in 2212, the Cu atom is surrounded by five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement. In the 2223 structure, Cu has two coordinations with respect to oxygen: one Cu atom is bonded with four oxygen atoms in square planar configuration and another Cu atom is coordinated with five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement.
Tl–Ba–Ca–Cu–O superconductor: The first series of the Tl-based superconductor containing one Tl–O layer has the general formula TlBa2Can-1CunO2n+3, whereas the second series containing two Tl–O layers has a formula of Tl2Ba2Can-1CunO2n+4 with n = 1, 2 and 3. In the structure of Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl-2201), there is one CuO2 layer with the stacking sequence (Tl–O) (Tl–O) (Ba–O) (Cu–O) (Ba–O) (Tl–O) (Tl–O). In Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (Tl-2212), there are two Cu–O layers with a Ca layer in between. Similar to the Tl2Ba2CuO6 structure, Tl–O layers are present outside the Ba–O layers. In Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 (Tl-2223), there are three CuO2 layers enclosing Ca layers between each of these. In Tl-based superconductors, Tc is found to increase with the increase in CuO2 layers. However, the value of Tc decreases after four CuO2 layers in TlBa2Can-1CunO2n+3, and in the Tl2Ba2Can-1CunO2n+4 compound, it decreases after three CuO2 layers.
Hg–Ba–Ca–Cu–O superconductor: The crystal structure of HgBa2CuO4 (Hg-1201), HgBa2CaCu2O6 (Hg-1212) and HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg-1223) is similar to that of Tl-1201, Tl-1212 and Tl-1223, with Hg in place of Tl. It is noteworthy that the Tc of the Hg compound (Hg-1201) containing one CuO2 layer is much larger as compared to the one-CuO2-layer compound of thallium (Tl-1201). In the Hg-based superconductor, Tc is also found to increase as the CuO2 layer increases. For Hg-1201, Hg-1212 and Hg-1223, the values of Tc are 94, 128 and the record value at ambient pressure 134 K,[ref]

</ref> respectively, as shown in table below. The observation that the ''T''<sub>c</sub> of Hg-1223 increases to 153&nbsp;K under high pressure indicates that the ''T''<sub>c</sub> of this compound is very sensitive to the structure of the compound.<ref>

==Preparation of high-Tc superconductors==

The simplest method for preparing high-Tc superconductors is a solid-state thermochemical reaction involving mixing, calcination and sintering. The appropriate amounts of precursor powders, usually oxides and carbonates, are mixed thoroughly using a ball mill. Solution chemistry processes such as coprecipitation, freeze-drying and sol-gel methods are alternative ways for preparing a homogeneous mixture. These powders are calcined in the temperature range from 800 °C to 950 °C for several hours. The powders are cooled, reground and calcined again. This process is repeated several times to get homogeneous material. The powders are subsequently compacted to pellets and sintered. The sintering environment such as temperature, annealing time, atmosphere and cooling rate play a very important role in getting good high-Tc superconducting materials. The YBa2Cu3O7-x compound is prepared by calcination and sintering of a homogeneous mixture of Y2O3, BaCO3 and CuO in the appropriate atomic ratio. Calcination is done at 900–950 °C, whereas sintering is done at 950 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen stoichiometry in this material is very crucial for obtaining a superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x compound. At the time of sintering, the semiconducting tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 compound is formed, which, on slow cooling in oxygen atmosphere, turns into superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x. The uptake and loss of oxygen are reversible in YBa2Cu3O7−x. A fully oxidized orthorhombic YBa2Cu3O7−x sample can be transformed into tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 by heating in a vacuum at temperature above 700 °C.
The preparation of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-Tc superconductors is difficult compared to YBCO. Problems in these superconductors arise because of the existence of three or more phases having a similar layered structure. Thus, syntactic intergrowth and defects such as stacking faults occur during synthesis and it becomes difficult to isolate a single superconducting phase. For Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O, it is relatively simple to prepare the Bi-2212 (Tc ≈ 85 K) phase, whereas it is very difficult to prepare a single phase of Bi-2223 (Tc ≈ 110 K). The Bi-2212 phase appears only after few hours of sintering at 860–870 °C, but the larger fraction of the Bi-2223 phase is formed after a long reaction time of more than a week at 870 °C. Although the substitution of Pb in the Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O compound has been found to promote the growth of the high-Tc phase, a long sintering time is still required.

==Properties==

"High-temperature" has two common definitions in the context of superconductivity:
The label high-Tc may be reserved by some authors for s materials with critical temperature greater than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K or −196 °C). However, a number of materials – including the original discovery and recently discovered pnictide superconductors – had critical temperatures below 77 K but are commonly referred to in publication as being in the high-Tc class.[tpl]cite journal|last=Norman|first=Michael R.|title=Trend: High-temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictides|journal=Physics |year=2008|volume=1|issue=21|doi=10.1103/Physics.1.21|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v1/21|accessdate=30 March 2012|bibcode = 2008PhyOJ...1...21N [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=High-Temperature Superconductivity: The Cuprates|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~tpd/research_hightc.html|work=Devereaux group|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=30 March 2012[/tpl]
Technological applications could benefit from both the higher critical temperature being above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen and also the higher critical magnetic field (and critical current density) at which superconductivity is destroyed. In magnet applications the high critical magnetic field may prove more valuable than the high Tc itself. Some cuprates have an upper critical field of about 100 tesla. However, cuprate materials are brittle ceramics which are expensive to manufacture and not easily turned into wires or other useful shapes.
After two decades of intense experimental and theoretical research, with over 100,000 published papers on the subject, several common features in the properties of high-temperature superconductors have been identified.[ref]
