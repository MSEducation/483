==Music videos==

Two singles were released; "Smashed into Pieces", followed by "Giving Up", both with music videos.
The "Smashed into Pieces" music video featured the whole band dressed in black pants and white shirts, with red ties, however singer Shane Told is wearing the opposite; red shirt and white tie. The video begins pixelated, but then slowly becomes clear to show a completely white room, with the instruments set up around the room. The song begins playing, as the band members walk in, pick up their instruments, and start playing with the song. In the final minute of the song, oil splashes across the members of the band, but they keep on playing, until the entire scene is covered in oil. However soon after, the oil flies off and they go on to finish the song clean. When the song finishes playing, they walk out in reverse.
The "Giving Up" music video follows a depressed man, who is remembering times spent with an ex-girlfriend. These scenes are entwined with shots of the band playing, which are mostly shot using fisheye lens.
The first single from the album (as well as being the band's first single ever), "Smashed into Pieces" was re-recorded by the band in 2013 and released on May 20 to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the album.
