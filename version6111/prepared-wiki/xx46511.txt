</ref> On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the [[Office of Fair Trading]] about BSkyB's move, and that it would withdraw its attempt to buy ITV plc, stating that it did not believe that it could currently make a deal on favourable terms.

===NTL===

====Internet====

NTL offered broadband Internet access connections through cable. The service operates through SACMs (Stand-alone cable modems) and set-top boxes (STBs).
In NTL areas customers could also access a 512 kbit/s download-speed; and both NTL and Telewest offer dial-up Internet services on a pay-as-you-go basis, or at a fixed monthly fee of £14.99 for unlimited usage.
The broadband services did not have a bandwidth-cap or a fair-usage policy; this means that customers have unlimited usage and need pay no extra charges related to the amount of data downloaded. However NTL has admitted introducing traffic shaping.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cableforum.co.uk/article/292/ntltelewest-admits-traffic-shaping-on-its-network |title=ntl:Telewest admits traffic shaping on its network |publisher=Cable Forum |date=2006-10-04 |accessdate=2013-08-03[/tpl]
NTL started trialling 20 Mbit/s, and temporarily upgraded some 10 Mbit/s subscribers to this speed in October 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=475832&page=1&pp=25 |title=Have NTL Upgraded 10MB ? |publisher=Digital Spy Forums |date=2006-10-19 |accessdate=2013-08-03[/tpl]
The 20 Mbit/s service reportedly supported 768 kbit/s upstream, though some users reported seeing upstream speeds of 1 Mbit/s [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2007[/tpl]. Furthermore, NTL started conducting trials of a 100Mbit broadband service on its cable network.http://www.digitalmediaasia.com/default.asp?ArticleID=13405[tpl]cite web|last=Walker |first=Dave |url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2006/02/ntl_trials_100m.html |title=NTL trials 100MB service |publisher=Tech Digest |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2013-08-03[/tpl]
After trials in the Guildford area from summer 1999, NTL launched its original broadband services at the same time that NTL acquired the Cable business of Cable and Wireless (spring 2000). In the "original NTL" (also known as "Langley") areas, NTL has always supplied broadband services via DOCSIS cable-modems. In these areas the digital television set-top boxes used an incompatible standard, DAVIC.
Initially, NTL decided to terminate service to approximately 90,000 ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers on short notice.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.zdnet.com/ntl-pulls-the-plug-on-cwc-internet-users-3040139019 |title=NTL pulls the plug on CWC internet users |publisher=ZDNet |date=17 October 2001 |accessdate=30 October 2013[/tpl] This threatened to leave customers stranded and without access to their email or websites and was due to NTL's lack of infrastructure capability in some areas.  Before termination of services, Boltblue struck a deal with NTL and Cable and Wireless Communications to save  minute deal was struck 90,000
[tpl]cite news | last=Welsh | first=James |date=22 November 2001 |title=Boltblue to take on non-cabled customers |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a4291/boltblue-to-take-on-non-cabled-customers.html | newspaper=Digital Spy |accessdate=30 October 2013[/tpl] and later an additional 210,000 customers. The roll-out of broadband services in the ex-Cable and Wireless franchises started in mid 2001.
NTL provided ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers with broadband through the set-top box (STB) also used for digital television services, adopting the rationale that subscribers could self-install. Initially, NTL supplied a "Self Install Kit" consisting of connecting cable, adapters and an install CD. Following demonstrated problems, NTL gradually introduced cable modems and phased out the self-install approach.  The Pace STBs proved highly problematic, exhibiting two major flaws.
Firstly, large numbers of connections (for example, those with peer-to-peer (P2P) software) would cause the connection to slow down and eventually freeze the modem part of the STB (also required for interactive TV services, which suffered a similar effect when downloading). Customers in these circumstances had to re-boot the STB.
Secondly, the single processor and sharing the internal modem between television and broadband services made the television part of the box slow and unresponsive, for example making it extremely difficult to change channel using the remote. This became particularly evident when using the lower "Tiers of Service" such the 128 kbit/s downstream 64 kbit/s upstream, as the digital television set-top box without broadband service actually enjoyed a 256 kbit/s upstream.
Although capable of higher speeds (up to 4 Mbit/s), NTL did not make speeds higher than 1 Mbit/s available due to degradation of the DTV service.
NTL eventually replaced the Pace set-top boxes with Samsung models that used a dual-processor architecture, overcoming the shortcomings of the Pace, and capable of much better downstream performance. However, with the advent of higher "Tiers of Service" of 10 Mbit/s downstream and higher, plus the reducing cost of NTL's cable modems (supplied by Ambit Broadband) NTL now supplies all subscribers with cable modems.
A historical view of NTL cable modems appears online at the Chetnet site.
The NTL network runs through transparent proxy servers. Up to 15 server addresses host each area. These transparent proxy servers also override the user's hosts file and prevent manual DNS updates. This makes it easier for NTL to provide a more reliable connection as well as being able to monitor traffic requirements in each area. This also causes many problems for websites which record IP addresses to ban and/or track users. This means that if a website bans one offender, it bans everyone in the same area. Also, many on-line games automatically ban IP addresses with multiple usernames associated with them. Small-scale games do not cause too many problems, but when friends attempt to spread the game around, the system prevents everyone (including the original player) from using the game.
On the other hand, advanced users can easily create a large number of illegitimate accounts on the aforementioned websites, allowing one user both to prevent all other users on the NTL network using the game, as well as to become untraceable.
Some of the STBs cannot support connection speeds above 1Mb. As many customers took up their connections before the system-wide upgrade from 1Mb to 2Mb basic rate, one commonly finds that people have paid for a 2Mb connection, whilst only having a 1Mb connection.
NTL has used MAC addresses to track and register customers to the NTL internet service. As NTL had not supported the use of routers, or Xbox on the minority Set Top Box based Broadband Internet service, users had to use a clone MAC address feature to connect to the Internet when using an STB. This has become a common problem for people wishing to connect their Xbox to the existing internet connection through a router or PC connected to their STB, if they fail to use the official registration process. (These comments do not apply to the majority (>90%) use of cable modems).

====Television====

The digital television service offers a number of different products including true video on demand, a PVR, and HDTV. On 1 September 2006 NTL introduced the FreeTV digital package to its telephone subscribers free of charge. However, value-pack customers lose their value-pack discounts if they integrate the FreeTV deal into their existing packages.

=====PVR and high definition services=====

NTL launched TV Drive, its high-definition television (HDTV) and Digital Video Recorder (PVR) service in Glasgow and Teesside on 16 November 2006. The service relies on the service of the same name offered in NTL's Telewest areas. The service uses a new PVR set-top-box, with three tuners and a 160GB hard disk for up to 80 hours recording. The presence of three tuners means that TV Drive can record two channels at the same time while watching a third. This contrasts with most other PVR systems such as Sky+, which can only have two tuners. Ntl plans to have this service available in 12 million homes by early 2007.

=====Video on demand=====

NTL has started to roll out its Video on Demand (VoD) service branded "NTL On Demand". NTL On Demand uses the Teleport system on Telewest's network. In contrast to Sky which, due to technical limitations, can only provide near-VOD services, NTL On Demand provides a true VoD system. The service allows customers of NTL Digital television to download programmes as and when they want to watch them from servers at the customer's local head-end. As the broadcaster automatically stores content on NTL's servers, it removes the need to pre-record many programmes. Users can search through a large library of programmes and watch them when they want to as part of their subscription. This library includes a free 7-day watch-again feature for TV-programmes produced by the BBC, Channel 4 and Flextech. NTL also offers other television-shows, films (service branded FilmFlex), and music videos, mostly for an additional fee. The VoD service also provides HD content that will work in conjunction with the TV Drive PVR.

====Fixed-line telephone====

NTL also provides telephone services to its customers, as the second-largest  fixed-line telephony provider in the UK, behind BT, who until 1984 held the monopoly on fixed-line telephony services in the UK.

====Premium TV====

Premium TV was a subsidiary of NTL.

On 14 June 2000, NTL won the rights to show 40 live Premier League matches on a pay-per-view basis for three years, beginning at the start of the 2001–02 season. NTL would pay approximately £109 million per annum for the rights. NTL pulled out of the deal on 18 October 2000, claiming that it was "unable to agree final terms".[tpl]cite web|url=http://pressoffice.virginmedia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=205406&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=935444&highlight=|title=Negotiations between NTL and the FA Premier League for pay-per-view rights cease|publisher=NTL|date=18 October 2000[/tpl] The failure to complete the deal, led to a lack of confidence in their proposed 2005 joint bid with ITV plc.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/premier-league-chairmen-dismiss-itvntl-proposal-510895.html|title=Premier League chairmen dismiss ITV/NTL proposal|publisher=The Independent|date=18 October 2000 | location=London | first1=Nick | last1=Harris | first2=Saeed | last2=Shah | accessdate=27 May 2010[/tpl]

Premium TV planned to launch a live sports channel in September 2001 called British Sport, which would have combined archive footage from the BBC with live coverage of rugby union, basketball and ice hockey. Premium TV dropped its plans after realising it could not compete with other sports broadcasters, such as ITV and BSkyB. Instead Premium TV chose to launch a channel with the working title of Classic Sport, offering classic BBC sports footage from the Grandstand archives, the channel never materialised.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/nov/08/broadcasting.bbc|title=BBC opens sports archives in cable deal|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 November 2001 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Milmo | accessdate=27 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/dec/19/broadcasting2|title=Classic Sport channel shelved|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 December 2001 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Milmo | accessdate=27 May 2010[/tpl] The Ice Hockey Superleague issued a high court writ claiming damages of up to £10m from the company, after its £1m-a-year TV deal was cancelled at short notice.

Premium TV was spun-out of NTL's UK cable operations and into NTL Europe Inc. in 2002, as part of a rescue plan devised by Barclay Knapp. Premium TV was placed under the control of the crisis and turnaround advisory group, Quest Turnaround Advisors. Quest negotiated commercial contracts with joint venture partners to eliminate £43 million of parent company guarantees and generated $10 million cash through restructuring. At the same time, Quest doubled paid subscribers to 75,000, cut staff by 50-per-cent, and broke even within 15 months of taking control. The business was then sold business for $54 million to Access Industries, who merged it with Inform Group in 2007 to create Perform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/10/06/football-crazy/|title=Football crazy|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=6 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qtadvisors.com/cs-ntleurope.html|title=PTV, Inc.

===Telewest===

===Virgin Mobile===

===Virgin.net===

For customers who do not live in cabled areas, NTL offers an ADSL broadband service through BT landlines under the Virgin.net brand, which it acquired in 2004 from Virgin Group, who founded it in 1996. Virgin.net customers receive up to 8 Mbit/s downstream and 400 kbit/s upstream. The service offers various usage-allowances depending on which package a user takes. Virgin.net also offers a dial-up service. Virgin.net also offers bundled phone-services via Carrier Preselect (CPS) to broadband subscribers.
Prior to acquiring Virgin.net, NTL offered a similar package called NTL Freedom.

===NTL:Telewest Business===

NTL also provides extensive business telephony and data network services that provide a significant portion of its revenue streams, and carrier services to other telcos.

==Broadcasting==

NTL owned Flextech, a content-provider with a number of wholly owned channels (including Bravo and LIVINGtv). Additionally, Flextech had a 50% share in UKTV (with BBC Worldwide), and owned Sit-Up Ltd, who operated Screenshop, bid TV, price-drop TV and speed auction TV.
In February 2001, NTL and Vivendi Universal launched The Studio, a 50:50 joint venture film channel which closed in January 2003.[tpl]cite news|first=Dan |last=Milmo |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/dec/18/broadcasting1 |title=NTL/Vivendi movie channel closes |publisher=The Guardian |date=18 December 2002 |accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl]
