[/ref] England were defeated in the last eight by Argentina with a brace of goals from Diego Maradona; the infamous "Hand of God" goal, and the "Goal of the Century" he scored five minutes later.  Robson was unimpressed by Maradona's claim of divine intervention:
Robson's England dropped only one point in qualifying for Euro 1988 which included an 8–0 defeat of Turkey. However this was followed by failure at the tournament itself, held in West Germany, where England were knocked out in the group stage. They finished bottom of their group, succumbing to defeats against Ireland, the Netherlands and the USSR. Robson was vilified by the British press, and after a draw in a friendly with Saudi Arabia, one newspaper demanded: "In the name of Allah, go".  Once again Robson submitted his resignation, and once again it was rejected by Millichip (again Brian Clough is often cited as a reason).
Robson led England without conceding a goal through the six-match qualification for the 1990 World Cup where they were one of six seeded teams. Once again they were placed in a group with the Netherlands and Ireland, with Egypt the fourth side. As in the 1986 World Cup, Robson was denied the service of his captain, Bryan Robson, who suffered an achilles tendon injury which prevented him playing in the latter stages of the tournament. England topped their qualifying group, accumulating four points from their three games. However their progress was not without controversy. England changed formation from their traditional 4–4–2 to incorporate a sweeper, with some sources suggesting this was due to player revolt after the 1–1 draw in the first match with the Republic of Ireland. Robson denies this claim:[tpl]cquote|...I made the switch, not them. I had no intention of allowing van Basten and Gullit to rip holes in us...[/tpl]
This was followed by victories over Belgium and Cameroon in the knock-out stages, to set up a semi-final with West Germany. England lost the match on a penalty shoot-out, after the score had been tied at 1–1 following extra time. Robson said afterwards that "not a day goes by when he does not think about the semi-final and other choices he might have made".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/well-done-sir-bobby-1-2124122 |title=Well done Sir Bobby |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=11 December 2007|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl] Robson remains only the second coach after Alf Ramsey to take England to a World Cup semi-final, and the only coach to do so on foreign soil.

===Continental management===

Before the 1990 World Cup, the FA told Robson that they would not renew his contract as England manager, so he moved on to the Netherlands to coach PSV Eindhoven, succeeding manager Guus Hiddink who had left the team after leading them to the 1987-88 European Cup victory and four consecutive Eredivisie titles. PSV sought a manager capable of instilling discipline into a fractious squad, much like Hiddink had done previously.[tpl]cite book |last=Kuper |first=Simon |title=Football against the enemy |publisher=Orion |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7528-4877-1|pages =93[/tpl] Robson described the move as "a culture shock" but felt "...a sense of adventure."[ref]
