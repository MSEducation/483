[[Sunglasses]]

CATEGORIES: Sunglasses, Eyewear, Ophthalmology, Prevention, Fashion accessories

Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses).[tpl]cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|others=Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=377[/tpl]
Healthcare professionals recommend eye protection whenever the sun comes out[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1282980/How-making-child-wear-sunglasses-save-sight.html|title=How making your child wear sunglasses could save their sight|accessdate=2010-10-19|last=Ellis|first=Rachel|date=2010-06-01|work=Eye Care Trust Organization UK|publisher=Daily Mail[/tpl] to protect the eyes from ultraviolet radiation (UV) and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems. Its usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures such as IntraLASIK and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas, when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK. Sunglasses have long been associated with celebrities and film actors primarily from a desire to mask their identity. Since the 1940s sunglasses have been popular as a fashion accessory, especially on the beach.

==History==

===Precursors===

In prehistoric and historic time, Inuit peoples wore flattened walrus ivory "glasses," looking through narrow slits to block harmful reflected rays of the sun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://collections.civilisations.ca/public/pages/cmccpublic/alt-emupublic/Display.php?irn=855927|title=Prehistoric Inuit Snow-Goggles, circa 1200|accessdate=2009-01-25|publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization|date=1997-10-03[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|title=Origin of Everyday Things|last1=Acton|first1=Johnny|last2=Adams|first2=Tania|last3=Packer|first3=Matt|editor=Jo Swinnerton|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=1-4027-4302-5|page=254[/tpl]
It is said that the Roman emperor Nero liked to watch gladiator fights with emeralds. These, however, appear to have worked rather like mirrors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+37.16|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XXXVII, Ch. 16|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl]
Sunglasses made from flat panes of smoky quartz, which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare were used in China in the 12th century or possibly earlier. Ancient documents describe the use of such crystal sunglasses by judges in ancient Chinese courts to conceal their facial expressions while questioning witnesses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/sunglasses.htm|title=Sunglasses History - The Invention of Sunglasses|accessdate=2007-06-28|last=Ament|first=Phil|date=2006-12-04|work=The Great Idea Finder|publisher=Vaunt Design Group[/tpl]
James Ayscough began experimenting with tinted lenses in spectacles in the mid-18th century, around 1752. These were not "sunglasses" as that term is now used; Ayscough believed blue- or green-tinted glass could correct for specific vision impairments. Protection from the Sun's rays was not a concern for him.
Yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th[tpl]Dubious|date=July 2009[/tpl] and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease.

===Modern developments===

In the early 1900s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among stars of movies. It is commonly believed that this was to avoid recognition by fans, but an alternative reason sometimes given is that they often had red eyes from the powerful arc lamps that were needed due to the extremely slow speed film stocks used.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] The stereotype persisted long after improvements in film quality and the introduction of ultraviolet filters had eliminated this problem.
Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses were introduced to America by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.articlesurfing.com/arts_and_crafts/the_history_of_sunglasses.html |title=The History Of Sunglasses |work= |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl] By 1938 Life magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a "new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S." It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes.[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EoEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA31#v=onepage&f=true | title=Dark Glasses are New Fad for Wear on City Streets | work=Life | date=1938-05-30 | accessdate=2 July 2013 | pages=31–33[/tpl]
Polarized sunglasses first became available in 1936, when Edwin H. Land began experimenting with making lenses with his patented Polaroid filter.

==Functions==

===Visual clarity and comfort===

Sunglasses can improve visual comfort and visual clarity by protecting the eye from glare.Sakamoto Y., Sasaki K., Kojima M., Sasaki H., Sakamoto A., Sakai M., Tatami A. "The effects of protective eyewear on hair and crystalline lens transparency. Dev Ophthalmol. 2002;35:93-103. PMID 12061282.
Various types of disposable sunglasses are dispensed to patients after receiving mydriatic eye drops during eye examinations.
The lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces such as water. They allow wearers to see into water when only surface glare would otherwise be seen, and eliminate glare from a road surface when driving into the sun.
The glare is neutralized by blocking the vertical (magnetic) components of light.

===Protection===

Sunglasses offer protection against excessive exposure to light, including its visible and invisible components.
The most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as photokeratitis, snow blindness, cataracts, pterygium, and various forms of eye cancer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/File/PolicyPublications/PSeye%20protectionAUG06.pdf|title=Cancer Council Australia; Centre for Eye Research Australia: Position Statement: Eye Protection. August 2006|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl] Medical experts advise the public on the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV; for adequate protection, experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99-100% of UVA and UVB light, with wavelengths up to 400 nm. Sunglasses which meet this requirement are often labeled as "UV400." This is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the European Union (see below), which requires that 95% of the radiation up to only 380 nm must be reflected or filtered out.[http://www.klinikum-karlsruhe.com/fileadmin/Files/makulahuenig.pdf Siegfried Hünig, in consultation with Albert J.

More recently, high-energy visible light (HEV) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration;Glazer-Hockstein C, Dunaief JL. "Could blue light-blocking lenses decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration?" Retina. 2006 Jan;26(1):1-4. [tpl]DOI|10.1097/00006982-200601000-00001[/tpl] PMID 16395131 Margrain TH, Boulton M, Marshall J, Sliney DH. "Do blue light filters confer protection against age-related macular degeneration?"

[tpl]DOI|10.1016/j.preteyeres.2004.05.001[/tpl] PMID 15302349 before, debates had already existed as to whether "blue blocking" or amber tinted lenses may have a protective effect.American Academy of Ophthalmollogy. "Information from Your Eye M.D.: Sunglasses." November 2003. Some manufacturers already design to block blue light; the insurance company Suva, which covers most Swiss employees, asked eye experts around Charlotte Remé (ETH Zürich) to develop norms for blue blocking, leading to a recommended minimum of 95% of the blue light.article by Charlotte Remé, who also developed the guidelines/norms for Switzerland: Remé, Charlotte (1997). Lichtschutz der Augen. protection for Eyes Der informierte Arzt – Gazette Medicale, 18, pp. 243-246 Sunglasses are especially important for children, as their ocular lenses are thought to transmit far more HEV light than adults (lenses "yellow" with age).
There has been some speculation that sunglasses actually promote skin cancer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/8739/Sunglasses+raise+risk+of+cancer|title=Sunglasses Raise Risk of Cancer|publisher=Express.co.uk|date=2007-06-03|accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl] This is due to the eyes being tricked into producing less melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the body.

====Assessing protection====

The only way to assess the protection of sunglasses is to have the lenses measured, either by the manufacturer or by a properly equipped optician. Several standards for sunglasses (see below) allow a general classification of the UV protection (but not the blue light protection), and manufacturers often indicate simply that the sunglasses meet the requirements of a specific standard rather than publish the exact figures.
The only "visible" quality test for sunglasses is their fit. The lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little "stray light" can reach the eye from their sides, or from above or below, but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses. To protect against "stray light" from the sides, the lenses should fit close enough to the temples and/or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders.
It is not possible to "see" the protection that sunglasses offer. Dark lenses do not automatically filter out more harmful UV radiation and blue light as compared to light lenses. Inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses (or wearing no sunglasses at all) because they provoke the pupil to open wider. As result, more unfiltered radiation enters the eye. Depending on the manufacturing technology, sufficiently protective lenses can block much or little light, resulting in dark or light lenses. The lens color is not a guarantee either. Lenses of various colors can offer sufficient (or insufficient) UV protection. Regarding blue light, the color gives at least a first indication: Blue blocking lenses are commonly yellow or brown whereas blue or gray lenses cannot offer the necessary blue light protection. However, not every yellow or brown lens blocks sufficient blue light. In rare cases, lenses can filter out too much blue light (i.e., 100%), which affects color vision and can be dangerous in traffic when colored signals are not properly recognized.
High prices cannot guarantee sufficient protection as no correlation between high prices and increased UV protection has been demonstrated. A 1995 study reported that "Expensive brands and polarizing sunglasses do not guarantee optimal UVA protection."Leow YH, Tham SN. "UV-protective sunglasses for UVA irradiation protection." Int J Dermatol. 1995 Nov;34(11):808-10. PMID 8543419. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also reported that "consumers cannot rely on price as an indicator of quality".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/614116/fromItemId/692835|title=Sunglasses and fashion spectacles—April 2003|publisher=Accc.gov.au|date=|accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl] One survey even found that a $6.95 pair of generic glasses offered slightly better protection than did expensive Salvatore Ferragamo shades.- Some Sunglasses Are Cheap In Price Only

===Further functions===

While non-tinted glasses are very rarely worn without the practical purpose of correcting eyesight or protecting one's eyes, sunglasses have become popular for several further reasons, and are sometimes worn even indoors or at night.
Sunglasses can be worn to hide one's eyes. They can make eye contact impossible, which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer's detachment,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] which is considered desirable (or "cool") in some circles. Eye contact can be avoided even more effectively by using mirrored sunglasses. Sunglasses can also be used to hide emotions; this can range from hiding blinking to hiding weeping and its resulting red eyes. In all cases, hiding one's eyes has implications for nonverbal communication; this is useful in poker, and many professional poker players wear heavily tinted glasses indoors while playing, so that it is more difficult for opponents to read tells which involve eye movement and thus gain an advantage.
Fashion trends can be another reason for wearing sunglasses, particularly designer sunglasses. Sunglasses of particular shapes may be in vogue as a fashion accessory. Fashion trends can also draw on the "cool" image of sunglasses.
People may also wear sunglasses to hide an abnormal appearance of their eyes. This can be true for people with severe visual impairment, such as the blind, who may wear sunglasses to avoid making others uncomfortable. The assumption is that it may be more comfortable for another person not to see the hidden eyes rather than see abnormal eyes or eyes which seem to look in the wrong direction. People may also wear sunglasses to hide dilated or contracted pupils, bloodshot eyes due to drug use, recent physical abuse (such as a black eye), exophthalmos (bulging eyes), a cataract, or eyes which jerk uncontrollably (nystagmus).
Some lawbreakers have also been known to wear sunglasses during or after committing a crime as an aid to hiding their identities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/gallery?id=8816697&photo=2 |title=10 most wanted bank robbery suspects |quote=In each of the instances, the female suspect wore a distinctive wig and sunglasses to conceal her identity. |date=2012-09-19 |publisher=ABC Local |accessdate=2012-11-26[/tpl]

==Standards==

There are three major sunglass standards, which are popularly known mostly as a reference for sunglass protection from UV radiation; the standards do, however, also include further requirements. A worldwide ISO standard does not yet exist, but by 2004, attempts to introduce such standard have led to a respective ISO standards committee, subcommittee, technical committee, and several working groups.no author (2004). Requirements of European Directives and Standards Relating to Sunglasses.. Retrieved 21 September 2009. Sunglasses sold in the United States are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and are required to conform to safety standards. 
The Australian Standard is AS/NZS 1067:2003 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles. The five ratings for transmittance (filter) under this standard are based on the amount of absorbed light, 0 to 4, with "0" providing some protection from UV radiation and sunglare, and "4" indicating a high level of protection, but not to be worn when driving. Australia introduced the world's first national standards for sunglasses in 1971. They were subsequently updated and expanded, leading in 1990 to AS 1067.1-1990 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles (incl. Part 1 Safety Requirements and Part 2 Performance Requirements), which was superseded in part in 2003 by AS/NZS 1067:2003 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles. The 2003 update made the Australian standard relatively similar to the European standard. This step opened the European market to Australian-made sunglasses, but the standard also maintained requirements considered specific to Australia's climate.no author (2002). Public eye looks over new standard for sunglasses (2002-01-20). website of Standards Australia. Retrieved 21 September 2009.
The European standard EN 1836:2005 has four transmittance ratings: "0" for insufficient UV protection, "2" for sufficient UHV protection, "6" for good UHV protection and "7" for "full" UHVV protection, meaning that no more than 5% of the 380 nm rays are transmitted. Products which fulfill the standard receive a CE mark. There is no rating for transmittance protection for radiation of up to 400 nm ("UV400"), as required in other countries (incl. the United States) and recommended by experts. The current standard EN 1836:2005 was preceded by the older standards EN 166:1995 (Personal eye protection –Specifications), EN167: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Optical test methods), and EN168: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Non-optical test methods), which in 2002 were republished as a revised standard under the name of EN 1836:1997 (which included two amendments). In addition to filtering, the standard also lists requirements for minimum robustness, labeling, materials (non-toxic for skin contact and not combustible) and lack of protrusions (to avoid harm when wearing them).
The U.S. standard is ANSI Z80.3-2001, which includes three transmittance categories. According to the ANSI Z80.3-2001 standard, the lens should have a UVB (280 to 315 nm) transmittance of no more than one per cent and a UVA (315 to 380 nm) transmittance of no more than 0.3 times the visual light transmittance. The ANSI Z87.1-2003 standard includes requirements for basic impact and high impact protection. In the basic impact test, a 1 in (2.54 cm) steel ball is dropped on the lens from a height of 50 in (127 cm). In the high velocity test, a 1/4 in (6.35 mm) steel ball is shot at the lens at 150 ft/s (45.72 m/s). To pass both tests, no part of the lens may touch the eye.

==Special-use==

===Land vehicle driving===

When driving a vehicle, particularly at high speed, dazzling glare caused by a low sun, or by lights reflecting off snow, puddles, other vehicles, or even the front of the vehicle, can be lethal. Sunglasses can protect against glare when driving. Two criteria must be met: vision must be clear, and the glasses must let sufficient light to get to the eyes for the driving conditions. General-purpose sunglasses may be too dark, or otherwise unsuitable for driving.
The Automobile Association and the UK Federation of Manufacturing Opticians have produced guidance for selection of sunglasses for driving. Variable tint or photochromic lenses increase their optical density when exposed to UV light, reverting to their clear state when the UV brightness decreases. This makes them unsuitable for driving because car windscreens filter out UV light, which both slows and limits the reaction of the lenses; they could become too dark or too light for the conditions. Some manufacturers produce special photochromic lenses which adapt to the varying light conditions when driving.
Lenses of fixed tint are graded according to the optical density of the tint; in the UK sunglasses must be labelled and show the filter category number. Lenses with light transmission less than 75% are unsuitable for night driving, and lenses with light transmission less than 8% (category 4) are unsuitable for driving at any time; they should by UK law be labelled 'Not suitable for driving and road use'. Yellow tinted lenses are also not recommended for night use. Due to the light levels within the car, filter category 2 lenses which transmit between 18% and 43% of light are recommended for daytime driving. Polarised lenses normally have a fixed tint, and can reduce reflected glare more than non-polarised lenses of the same density, particularly on wet roads.
Graduated lenses, with the bottom part lighter than the top, can make it easier to see the controls within the car. All sunglasses should be marked as meeting the standard for the region where sold. An anti-reflection coating is recommended, and a hard coating to protect the lenses from scratches. Sunglasses with deep side arms can block side, or peripheral, vision and are not recommended for driving. The Automobile Association: Driving in sunglasses

===Aircraft piloting===

Many of the criteria for sunglasses worn when piloting an aircraft are similar to those for land vehicles. Protection against UV radiation is more important, as its intensity increases with altitude. Polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised, intentionally or unintentionally, showing Moiré patterns on looking through the windscreen; and some LCD displays used by instruments emit polarised light, and can dim or disappear when the pilot turns to look at them. Vision in aviation

===Sports===

As do corrective glasses, sunglasses have to meet special requirements when worn for sports. They need shatterproof and impact-resistant lenses; a strap or other fixing is typically used to keep glasses in place during sporting activities, and they have a nose cushion.
For water sports, so-called water sunglasses (also: surf goggles or water eyewear) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water, such as the surf or whitewater. In addition to the features for sports glasses, water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off, and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging. These sunglasses are used in water sports such as surfing, windsurfing, kiteboarding, wakeboarding, kayaking, jet skiing, bodyboarding, and water skiing.
Mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection, because sunlight (including ultraviolet radiation) is more intense in higher altitudes, and snow and ice reflect additional light. Popular glasses for this use are a type called glacier glasses or glacier goggles. They typically have very dark round lenses and leather blinders at the sides, which protect the eyes by blocking the Sun's rays around the edges of the lenses.

===Space===

Special protection is required for space travel because the sunlight is far more intense and harmful than on Earth, where it is always filtered through the atmosphere. Sun protection is needed against much higher UV radiation and even against harmful infrared radiation, both within and outside the spacecraft. Within the spacecraft, astronauts wear sunglasses with darker lenses and a thin protective gold coating. During space walks, the visor of the astronauts' helmets, which also has a thin gold coating for extra protection, functions as strong sunglasses.no author (no date). Spinoff 2002. Space-Age Shades.

They must be flexible and durable, and must fit firmly in zero-gravity. Reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits: once inside the spacesuit, slipped glasses cannot be touched to push them back into place, sometimes for up to tenhours. Frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles cannot become dislodged, then float and be inhaled. 90% of astronauts wear glasses in space, even if they do not require corrective glasses on Earth, because zero-gravity and pressure changes temporarily affect their vision.
The first sunglasses used in a Moon landing were the original pilot sunglasses produced by American Optical. In 1969 they were used aboard the Eagle, the lunar landing module of Apollo 11, the first manned mission to land on the Moonn.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aaapilots.com/html/american_optical_aviator_sungl.html|title=no author (no date).

Stephens and Charles G. Miller at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) resulted in special lenses that protected against the light in space and during laser and welding work. The lenses used colored dyes and small particles of zinc oxide, which absorbs ultraviolet light and is also used in sunscreen lotions. The research was later broadened to further terrestrial applications, e.g., deserts, mountains, and fluorescent-lighted offices, and the technology was commercially marketed by a U.S. company.no author (2006).
