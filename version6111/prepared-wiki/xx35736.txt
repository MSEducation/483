Waveney is a local government district in Suffolk, England, named after the River Waveney that forms its north-west border. The district council is based in Lowestoft, the major settlement in Waveney, which is the only unparished area in the district.  The other towns in the district are Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth and Southwold.
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Beccles, Lowestoft and Southwold, along with Bungay and Halesworth urban districts, Wainford Rural District and part of Lothingland Rural District. The last elections to the council were held on 5th May 2011 when the council moved to a Whole Council election system meaning all 48 council seats were contested.Changing to Whole Council Elections â€“ Explanatory Document, Waveney District Council, 2010.
