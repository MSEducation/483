大開色界新曲+精選 Opening the Sexual Boundaries is a greatest hits compilation album by cantopop singer Prudence Liew, released on April 11, 2008.

==Album details==

This compilation was released to promote the concert series of the same name held at the Hong Kong Coliseum on April 19, & April 20, 2008.  The concerts marked the first time Liew had a solo concert series at the venue and also her first official concert since she went on hiatus back in 1995.  This 2-disc set contains 31 songs spanning from the Current Records/BMG Music era in the late 1980s to the Columbia Records era in the mid 1990s to the Taiwan release of the mandopop album 愛自己 Love Yourself in 2000 on Rock Records.  Also included are three new songs, with the title track serving as a comeback anthem for Liew and a preview of her concert. The track "浮花 (Floating Flower)" also serves as the theme song to the motion picture, True Women For Sale, in which Liew is the lead.  The album also comes with a bonus DVD with music videos of the three new tracks.
Liew's co-producer of this compilation is Jerald Chan, member of the musical group Swing.  Coincidentally, he is the son of Joseph Chan, Liew's early collaborator and producer of her first four studio albums from Prudence Liew to Jokingly Saying.
