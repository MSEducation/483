Freezer Queen was for decades a U.S. frozen food packaging company.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081118080309/http://www.freezerqueenfoods.com/about.php | title=About us | publisher=Freezer Queen (Wayback Machine) | year=2008 | accessdate=2012-02-04 [/tpl] It was a pioneer of the TV dinner industry beginning in 1958. For many years it was an important employer in Buffalo, New York. It was founded by Buffalo businessman Paul Snyder and at one point had more than a thousand employees. In 2004 its Buffalo plant failed a government safety inspection and thereafter was closed by Home Market Foods, by then its corporate parent.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.allbusiness.com/sector-42-wholesale-trade/merchantrs-nondurable/1191270-1.html | title=Dinner maker Freezer Queen's day is done as corporate parent shuts down factory. | work=Quick Frozen Foods International | publisher=EW Williams Publications | date=2006-07-01 | accessdate=2009-10-20 [/tpl] The company was previously owned by United Foods.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-22/business/fi-12463_1_freezer-queen | title=United Foods received an offer for Freezer Queen. | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=1985-10-22 | accessdate=2009-10-20 [/tpl]
The plant's closure left many employees out of work.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-148065447.html | title=Freezer Queen's demise puts 175 workers out in the cold. | first=Joseph | last=Galante | publisher=The Buffalo News | date=2006-07-10 | accessdate=2009-10-20 [/tpl] The USDA inspection found such violations as live cockroaches in the gravy tank on multiple occasions. In response, Freezer Queen first requested a new USDA inspector, then suggested that parts of the facility were debris-strewn and not normally cleaned, and finally elected to shut down the facility rather than fix the unsafe and unsanitary conditions.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://higgins.house.gov/archive/newsroom_ARTICLE3116_6410_PG_9.shtml | title=Higgins Calls for Buffalo Building Inspectors to Fully Investigate Freezer Queen Facility at Outer Harbor | publisher=Congressman Brian Higgins | date=2006-08-14 | accessdate=2012-01-04 [/tpl]
Thereafter, in its final years, Freezer Queen was merely a brand entity for the line of frozen dinners and entrees it had previously produced. Among those Freezer Queen-branded products were "Gravy with Salisbury Steaks," and "Broccoli with Cheese Sauce." Home Market Foods then transitioned the brand to "Family Buffet," ending Freezer Queen's history.
