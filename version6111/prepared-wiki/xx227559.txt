No European routes follow the A29 motorway.

==Section Klaaswaal-Dinteloord==

The section between the planned interchange Klaaswaal and the southern terminus, near Dinteloord, is officially a part of Rijksweg number 4. However, until that road's missing link between Rotterdam (at interchange Benelux) and Klaaswaal has been constructed, the section Klaaswaal-Dinteloord will be referred to as A29, to avoid confusion.
