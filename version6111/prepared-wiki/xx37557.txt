Paolo Cesare Maldini (born 26 June 1968) is a former Italian footballer who played as a left or central defender, being adept with either foot although naturally right-footed. He spent all 24 seasons of his career at Serie A club Milan, before retiring at the age of 41 in 2009, becoming a symbol and a legend of the club. During that period, he won the Champions League five times, as well as seven Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana, five European Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups. He played for 14 years for the Italian national team, making his debut in 1988 before retiring in 2002 with 126 caps and four World Cup participations.
He is regarded to be one of the greatest defenders of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174730/index.html |title=FIFA Classic Player: Paolo Maldini, an icon and a gentleman |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2011/07/legend-of-calcio-paolo-maldini/ |title=Legend of Calcio: Paolo Maldini |publisher=Forza Italian Football |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl]Ben Jones, The Football History Boys, http://thefootballhistoryboys.blogspot.com/2013/06/footballs-one-club-men-paolo-maldini.html Maldini played at a world class level for his entire career spanning two and a half decades, and won the Best Defender trophy at the UEFA Club Football Awards at the age of 39. He came second to George Weah for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award in 1995, the closest a defender had ever come to winning the award until Fabio Cannavaro, a fellow Italian, won the award in 2006. He was chosen as a defender on FIFA Dream Team of the history of World Cups, and in 2004 was named as one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA's 100th anniversary celebration.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013 [/tpl]
Maldini was also the Milan and Italy captain for many years and was considered a leader amongst leaders by fellow footballers, leading to the nickname "Il Capitano" (the Captain). Paolo's father Cesare formerly played for and captained Milan, and is a successful national U-21 manager.

==Club career==

Maldini made his league debut in the 1984–85 season on 20 January 1985, replacing the injured Sergio Battistini in a match against Udinese at the age of 16.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/football_legends_paolo_maldini.html|title=Paolo Maldini|accessdate=25 February 2008|publisher=Talk Football[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/05/23/maldini_the_fulcrum_of_milan_g.html | title=Maldini the fulcrum of Milan generation game | accessdate=28 May 2007 | work=Guardian | location=London | first=Richard | last=Williams | date=23 May 2007[/tpl] It was his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was in the starting eleven the following season. The 1987–88 Scudetto marked Maldini's first trophy, and the first of seven league titles, with the club.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/players/player=428/index.html | title=Paolo Maldini | accessdate=28 May 2007 | work=UEFA[/tpl] He was also part of Milan's undefeated Serie A champion side in the 1991–92 season. The back four that included Maldini and fellow long-timers Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti is widely considered one of European football's most formidable defensive quartets of the 1990s. Following Baresi's retirement, he would also form a formidable and successful partnership with Alessandro Nesta.
In addition to winning his third Champions League and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, Maldini became the first defender ever to win World Soccer magazine's annual World Player of the Year Award. During his acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone "a particular matter of pride because defenders generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the engine room rather than taking the glory."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cs.wm.edu/~wm/maldini.html | title = Paolo Maldini | accessdate =25 April 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080511045346/http://www.cs.wm.edu/~wm/maldini.html  |archivedate = 11 May 2008[/tpl] He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a player who "really deserved to receive the sort of award I have received."
Maldini played his 600th Serie A match on 13 May 2007 in a 1–1 draw at Catania.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Milan/Primo_Piano/2007/05_Maggio/14/MALDINI.shtml | title=Maldini infinito: e sono 600 | publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport | accessdate=14 May 2007 | work= | date = 14 May 2007 |language=Italian[/tpl] On 25 September 2005, Maldini broke Dino Zoff's Serie A appearance record after playing his 571st league match against Treviso;[tpl]cite web | url =  http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=343889&&cc=3888 | title = Maldini sets record | publisher = soccernet.espn.go.com | date = 25 September 2005 | accessdate =25 April 2008[/tpl] seven days earlier, he had played his 800th game in all competitions for Milan. On 16 February 2008, Maldini reached 1,000 senior games with Milan and Italy when he entered as a substitute against Parma.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Primo_Piano/2008/02_Febbraio/16/ParmaMilan.shtml | title = Anche il Parma frena il Milan | publisher = Gazzetta dello Sport | language = Italian | date = 16 February 2008 | accessdate =25 April 2008[/tpl]
Maldini has participated in eight UEFA Champions League finals during the course of his career, which is bettered only by Francisco Gento, who also appeared in a Cup Winners' Cup final, bringing his total European finals to nine. Maldini has lifted the trophy five times, the latest coming in Milan's 2–1 victory over Liverpool in the 2007 Champions League final on 23 May 2007 in Athens. In an interview with ESPN that aired prior to the broadcast of the 2007 final, he labeled the 2005 Champions League final, a match that Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after blowing a 3–0 half-time lead, the worst moment of his career, even though he had scored the fastest-ever goal in a European Clubs' Cup final just 51 seconds into the match, in the process also becoming the oldest player ever to score in a final.
Maldini announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2007–08 season, saying that he would do so with "no regrets."[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7146949.stm | title=Maldini to quit at end of season | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=17 December 2007 | date=16 December 2007[/tpl] However, following Milan's elimination from the Champions League by Arsenal in March, Maldini stated that he would possibly delay his retirement for at least a further year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://fourfourtwo.com/news/italy/7633/default.aspx | title= Injured Maldini's career could be over | accessdate=16 April 2008 | author=FourFourTwo[/tpl] He signed an extension on 6 June that kept him at Milan for the 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7441109.stm|title=Maldini to play for one more year |date=6 June 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 January 2009[/tpl] On 18 April 2009, Maldini announced that he will be finally retiring at the end of the 2008–09 season.
On 17 May, in the Friuli Stadium, Maldini played his 900th official match for Milan in a league game against Udinese. Maldini's last match in San Siro was on 24 May, in a game lost 3–2 against Roma. There was a small controversy when the Milan fans known as "Brigate Rossonere", protested against Maldini as he said goodbye.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2009/05/25/1285122/why-did-milan-ultras-insult-paolo-maldini | title = Why Did Milan Ultras Insult Paolo Maldini? | publisher = goal.com | date = 25 May 2009 | accessdate =16 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6355518.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Paolo Maldini farewell not so fond from AC Milan hard core | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=25 May 2009[/tpl] His last appearance for Milan, and his last game as an active player was on 31 May 2009, in the last match of the season, against Fiorentina, which Milan won 2–0.

==International career==

In 1986, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare to the Italian U-21 side, where he earned twelve caps and scored five goals in two years. He made his Azzurri debut at the age of nineteen on 31 March 1988, in a 1–1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia, and made one appearance for Italy at the 1988 Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy's games at Euro 1988, and participated in his first World Cup in 1990, where Italy lost to Argentina in the semi-finals on penalties.
Maldini's first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2–0 friendly win over Mexico on 20 January 1993. He was vice-captain for Italy at the 1994 World Cup, deputising for the injured  Franco Baresi in matches against Mexico, Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria. Maldini helped Italy keep a clean sheet in the final against Brazil as the team eventually lost on penalties. He was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father received the same honour at the 1962 World Cup.
After Baresi's international retirement in 1994, Maldini was appointed the team's full-time captain. Euro 1996 would see Italy eliminated in the group stage, and at the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup.  Italy did reach the final of Euro 2000, but lost to France in extra time.
Immediately after Italy were eliminated in the 2002 World Cup round of sixteen, Maldini retired trophyless from international competition as Italy's most capped player. He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times.[tpl]cite web | url = http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2011/07/legend-of-calcio-paolo-maldini/ | title = Legend of Calcio: Paolo Maldini | first = Sam | last = Lewis | publisher = forzaitalianfootball.com | date = 28 July 2011 | accessdate =14 September 2011[/tpl]
In February 2009, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the Azzurri for a final time. Italian Football Federation offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. However, Maldini rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in an "official" match.

==Retirement==

Prior to his retirement, Maldini expressed that he would never be moving into a coaching career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2009/05/08/1253863/ac-milan-legend-paolo-maldini-not-keen-on-coaching|title=AC Milan Legend Paolo Maldini Not Keen on Coaching|date=30 June 2009|work=Goal.com|accessdate=30 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://english.gazzetta.it/Football/Primo_Piano/2009/02/13/maldini.shtml|title=Maldini: "I'll win the derby and finish off with the League"|date=30 September 2009|work=La Gazetta dello Sport|accessdate=30 September 2009[/tpl] He was offered a position that would have reunited him with his former manager, Carlo Ancelotti, by joining Chelsea as a coach having reportedly met with Ancelotti and with Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, to discuss such a possibility.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8098673.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wilkins cool over Maldini rumours | date=18 June 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl] On 30 June 2009, Ancelotti announced that Maldini had turned down his offer to become part of Chelsea's coaching staff.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/chelsea/5698056/Paolo-Maldini-rejects-Chelsea-coaching-role.html|title=Paolo Maldini rejects Chelsea coaching role|date=30 June 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 June 2009 | location=London | first=Telegraph | last=Staff[/tpl]

==Style of play==

Maldini's sliding tackles, athleticism and energetic forward runs as a left-back were legendary. However, in the final few years of his career, as he lost speed, he was moved to a center-back position, where he relied more on his experience, positioning and timing to win the ball.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/9471db52-97bb-11e0-9c37-00144feab49a.html#axzz1ef0SGDMP | title = A football revolution| first = Simon| last = Kuper | publisher = Financial Times | date = 17 June 2011 | accessdate =25 November 2011[/tpl]
