Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is a dialect of Berlin Brandenburgish spoken in Berlin. It originates from a Mark Brandenburgish variant. However, several phrases in Berlinisch are typical for the city, indicating the manifold origins of immigrants, among them the Huguenots from France.

==Overview==

The area of Berlin was one of the first to abandon East Low German as a written language (in the 16th century) and later also as a spoken language. This was the first dialect of Standard German with definite High German roots but a Low German substratum apparently formed. (Berlinerisch may therefore be considered an early Missingsch.) Only recently has this new dialect expanded into the surroundings which until then used East Low German.
