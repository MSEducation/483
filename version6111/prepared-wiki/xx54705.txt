The self-proclaimed State of Deseret, precursor to the organization of the Utah Territory, had only one governor, Brigham Young. Utah Territory had 15 territorial governors from its organization in 1850 until the formation of the state of Utah in 1896, appointed by the President of the United States. John W. Dawson had the shortest term of only three weeks and Brigham Young, the first territorial governor, had the longest term at seven years.
There have been 17 governors of the State of Utah, with the longest serving being Calvin L. Rampton, who served three terms from 1965 to 1977. Olene S. Walker served the shortest term, the remaining 14 months of Mike Leavitt's term upon Leavitt's resignation to become head of the Environmental Protection Agency. At the age of 36, Heber Manning Wells was the youngest person to become governor. At the age of 70, Simon Bamberger became the oldest person to be elected, while Olene Walker, at age 72, was the oldest person to succeed to the office.
The current governor is Gary Herbert, who took office on August 11, 2009, upon the resignation of Jon Huntsman, Jr., to become United States Ambassador to China. Governor Herbert was elected to fill the remainder of Huntsman's term in November 2010, and his current term will expire on January 2, 2017.
There is an official seal of the Governor of Utah. Borrowing most of the same symbolism from the State Seal, the Governor's seal includes Roman numerals at the bottom, which represent the Governor himself, and this changes with every new Governor. Each Governor therefore has a seal unique to themselves and their administration. The Roman numerals are currently "XVII", representing Gary Herbert, who is the 17th governor of Utah since Statehood.

===State of Deseret===

A constitutional convention was convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, to work on a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849.[tpl]cite book | first=James H. | last=McClintock | title=Mormon settlement in Arizona | publisher=State of Arizona | location=Phoenix | year=1921 |  page=52 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WrkUAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA52 | accessdate=April 28, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book | first=Orson Ferguson | last=Whitney | title=History of Utah | publisher=George Q Cannon and Sons | location=Salt Lake City | year=1892 | pages=393–395 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zs8BAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA393 | accessdate=April 28, 2010[/tpl] The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851,[tpl]cite book | last=Powell | first=Allen Kent | title=Utah History Encyclopedia | publisher=University of Utah Press | location=Salt Lake City | year=1994 | page=139[/tpl] several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.

The territory initially consisted of present-day Utah, most of Nevada, and portions of Colorado and Wyoming. On February 28, 1861, the creation of Colorado Territory took land from the eastern side of Utah Territory. Nevada Territory was organized from the western section of Utah Territory on March 2, 1861.[tpl]cite book | title=The History of Nevada | editor-first=Sam P. | editor-last=Davis | publisher=Elms Publishers | location=Reno | page=192 | year=1912 | url=http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Reading%20Room%20Documents/Nevada%20-%20Organizing%20the%20Territory%20%281912%29.htm | accessdate=May 14, 2010[/tpl] Also on that date, Nebraska Territory gained area from the northeastern part of Utah Territory. Nevada Territory gained area from Utah Territory on July 14, 1862, and again on May 5, 1866, after becoming a state. Wyoming Territory was created on July 25, 1868, from Nebraska Territory, taking more area from the northeast corner, giving Utah Territory its final borders.
