[[The Kingdom & Its Fey]]

CATEGORIES: The Soil Bleeds Black albums, 1996 debut albums

After releasing their first two cassette productions, The Soil Bleeds Black published their debut album, The Kingdom & Its Fey. The album contains the band's first two cassettes, originally released through Dark Age Productions, along with several other tracks. A declaration of the band's past is evidenced in the heavy use of synthetic instrumentation while the atmosphere of bygone eras remains expressed. The LP edition of this album features five bonus tracks and is presented in a gatefold sleeve with additional separate sleeves that meet together to form a pictorial diorama.
