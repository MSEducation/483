The Defenders is the name of a number of Marvel Comics superhero groups which are usually presented as a "non-team" of individualistic "outsiders," each known for following their own agendas. The team often battled mystic and supernatural threats.
Its original incarnation was led by Doctor Strange and included the Hulk, Namor, and, eventually, the Silver Surfer. They first appeared as The Defenders in Marvel Feature #1 (December 1971).
The group had a rotating line-up from 1972 until 1986, with Dr. Strange and the Hulk being more or less constant members along with a number of other mainstays such as Valkyrie, Nighthawk, Hellcat, the Gargoyle, Beast, the Son of Satan and Luke Cage, and a large number of temporary members. The publication was retitled near the end of the run as The New Defenders but featured none of the original members and only Valkyrie, the Beast and the Gargoyle of the former long-term members. The concept was modified in the 1993–95 series Secret Defenders, in which Dr. Strange assembled different teams for each individual mission. Later, the original team were reunited in a short-lived series by Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen. In the 2000s, Marvel published a new miniseries featuring the classic line-up. Writer Matt Fraction and artist Terry Dodson launched a new Defenders series in December 2011.

==Publication history==

The origin of the Defenders lies in two crossover story arcs by Roy Thomas prior to the official founding of the team. The first, in Doctor Strange #183 (November 1969), Sub-Mariner #22 (February 1970), and The Incredible Hulk #126 (April 1970) occurred when the Dr. Strange series was canceled and the storyline was completed in the other series. Dr. Strange teams with Sub-Mariner, then the Hulk to protect the Earth from invasion by Lovecraftian inter-planar beings known as the Undying Ones and their leader, the Nameless One. Barbara Norriss, later the host of the Valkyrie, first appears in this story. In the second arc featured in Sub-Mariner #34-35, (February–March 1971), Namor enlists the aid of the Silver Surfer and the Hulk to stop a potentially devastating weather control experiment, inadvertently freeing a small island nation from a dictator and facing the Avengers under the unofficial name of the "Titans Three".[tpl]cite journal|last = DeAngelo|first = Daniel|title = The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players A History of the Defenders|magazine = Back Issue|issue = 65|page = 3|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = July 2013[/tpl]

Writer J. M. DeMatteis took over the series with issue #92. Coming from a background of writing 8-page horror shorts for DC Comics, DeMatteis found it a struggle to adapt to writing a 22-page superhero comic on a monthly basis.[tpl]cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = October 1986 | title = J.

===The New Defenders===

Suffering from creative burnout on the series, DeMatteis felt a change was needed. As of issue #125, The Defenders was retitled to The New Defenders as the original four members (Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, and Namor) are forced to leave the team,DeAngelo p. 14 in response to an alien prophecy that states that these four, operating as a group, would be responsible for destroying the world.  The Beast then reforms the team as an official super-hero team complete with government clearance.[tpl]cite comic| writer= DeMatteis, J. M.|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= DeMulder, Kim|story= Hello, I Must Be Going. (or...Mad Dogs and Elvishmen!)|title= The Defenders|issue= 125|date= November 1983[/tpl] The "New Defenders" concept provided a substantial boost to the series's sales, but left DeMatteis in a creative drought, as he realized in retrospect that "...I created a book that was exactly the kind of the thing that I hated to write. I made it into a standard superhero team..." DeMatteis stayed on for only six issues of The New Defenders before turning it over to writer Peter Gillis.
The series's final issue was The New Defenders #152.DeAngelo p. 16 Penciler Don Perlin recounted "Editor Carl Potts he took me and Peter Gillis to lunch. We went to an Indian restaurant… He said, ‘They canceled the book.’"[tpl]cite news|last = Aushenker|first= Michael|date = April 2007|title = The Son of Satan: A Trident True Devil Hero|work = Back Issue|issue = 21|pages = 6–13|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing[/tpl] In the final issue, several members (Gargoyle, Moondragon, Valkyrie, Andromeda, Manslaughter, Interloper) seemingly die in battle with the Dragon of the Moon.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Gillis, Peter B.|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Barras, Dell|story= The End of All Songs|title= The Defenders|issue= 152|date= February 1986[/tpl] The remaining members leave the team to join X-Factor.

===The Return of the Defenders===

In 1990, the original trio reunited in The Incredible Hulk #370-371, in which it was revealed that the prophecy was a hoax. The originals then rejoined with the Silver Surfer in a story entitled The Return of the Defenders running in The Incredible Hulk Annual #18, Namor the Sub-Mariner Annual #2, Silver Surfer Annual #5, and Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Annual #2.

===Secret Defenders===

In 1993, Marvel sought to revive the "Defenders" brand as "The Secret Defenders". The new team first appeared, unofficially, in Dr. Strange #50 and later Fantastic Four #374, before being officially introduced in Secret Defenders #1.Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 262: "Writer Roy Thomas and penciller Andre Coates created this new series that ran until 1995."[tpl]cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Coates, Andre|inker= Hudson, Don|story= A Gathering of Heroes|title= Secret Defenders|issue= 1|date= March 1993[/tpl] The series premise originally was that Doctor Strange would organize various teams of heroes for certain missions, with him as the leader. Members included Wolverine, Darkhawk, Spider-Woman, Spider-Man, Hulk, Ghost Rider, and others. This would last for the first several months of the title, before Doctor Strange was removed from the book, due to the character being reassigned to the "Midnight Sons" line at Marvel. After an arc where the supervillain Thanos organized a team of "Secret Defenders" for a mission,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Marz, Ron|penciller= Grindberg, Tom|inker= Hudson, Don|story= Escape|title= Secret Defenders|issue= 14|date= April 1994[/tpl] leadership of the Secret Defenders passed to Doctor Druid[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brevoort, Tom; Kanterovich, Mike|penciller= Decaire, Jerry|inker= DeZuniga, Tony|story= Strange Changes, Part 1: Strangers and Other Lovers|title= Secret Defenders|issue= 15|date= May 1994[/tpl] and the series itself abandoned the revolving door roster in favor of Druid and the Cognoscenti. The series was canceled with Secret Defenders #25.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brevoort, Tom; Kanterovich, Mike|penciller= Wylie, Bill|inker= DeZuniga, Tony|story= Final Defense, Part 4: Dead on Arrival|title= Secret Defenders|issue= 25|date= March 1995[/tpl]

===Reunion and The Order===

In 2001-2002, The Defenders reunited in The Defenders volume 2 #1-12 created by Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen, immediately followed by The Order #1-6, in which Yandroth manipulated Gaea into "cursing" the primary four Defenders (Doctor Strange, the Sub-Mariner, the Hulk, and the Silver Surfer) so that they would be summoned to major crisis situations. These members were then mind controlled by Yandroth into forming the world-dominating "Order"; once the Order were freed from this control by their fellow heroes (including their teammates Hellcat, Nighthawk, and Valkyrie), the Defenders apparently disbanded. A fill-in issue set between these two series was published in 2011.

===2005 Miniseries===

A Defenders five-issue miniseries debuted in July 2005, by Keith Giffen, J. M. DeMatteis, and Kevin Maguire (as a team, best known for their work on DC's Justice League franchise), featuring Doctor Strange attempting to reunite the original four Defenders to battle Dormammu and Umar. This series focuses mostly on humor as the characters spend most of their time arguing with and criticizing one another. The series was later collected into both hardcover and trade paperback collections, entitled Defenders: Indefensible.

===The Last Defenders===

In 2008 Joe Casey wrote a new miniseries with a new line-up of Defenders as a result of the Super-Human Registration Act and the events of the Civil War.[tpl]cite book|last = Casey|first = Joe|authorlink = Joe Casey|coauthors = Muniz, Jim|title = The Last Defenders |publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2008|pages = 144|isbn = 978-0785125075[/tpl] Nighthawk wanted a team made up of previous Defenders such as Hellcat and Devil Slayer but Tony Stark (Iron Man) makes the decision to select other heroes for the team. The line-up is led by Nighthawk, with Blazing Skull, Colossus, and She-Hulk as members. The Defenders are assigned to New Jersey under the Fifty State Initiative, because the proximity to New York City demands more experienced heroes than can just be recruited from the ranks of Camp Hammond. The team is disbanded for incompetence but Richmond eventually founds a team outside the Initiative with the Son of Satan, She-Hulk, Krang, and Nighthawk (S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Joaquin Pennyworth). The team reappears in the mini-series Vengeance (2011).

===The Offenders===

In the 2009 ongoing Hulk series (Issues 10-12), Red Hulk assembles a counter team of supervillains called the Offenders, which includes Baron Mordo, Terrax the Tamer, and Tiger Shark, and fights past versions of their enemies.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Loeb, Jeph|penciller= McGuinness, Ed|inker= Vines, Dexter|story= Love & Death|title= Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 10|date= April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Loeb, Jeph|penciller= McGuinness, Ed|inker= Vines, Dexter|story= Trapped in a World They Never Made|title= Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 11|date= June 2009[/tpl]

===Fear Itself: The Deep===

During the 2011 "Fear Itself" storyline, Doctor Strange reunites a new version of the Defenders with Lyra (daughter of Hulk), Namor, Loa (a student of the X-Men), and the Silver Surfer to confront Attuma who has become Nerkkod, Breaker of Oceans. Many past Defenders appear in the last issue.[tpl]Cite comic|writer= Bunn, Cullen|penciller= Garbett, Lee|inker= Meikis, David|story= Fear Itself: The Deep|title=Fear Itself: The Deep|issue=1|date=August 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite comic|writer= Bunn, Cullen|penciller= Garbett, Lee|inker= Meikis, David|story= The Deep|title=Fear Itself: The Deep|issue=2|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===2011 series===

Marvel launched a new Defenders series in December 2011, written by Matt Fraction and drawn by Terry Dodson. The new book features Doctor Strange, Red She-Hulk, Namor, the Silver Surfer and Iron Fist. The new series follows the reunion of the Defenders in Fear Itself: The Deep.[tpl]cite web|last= Norris|first= Erik|title= Comic-Con: Matt Fraction's New Defenders|url= http://comics.ign.com/articles/118/1184070p1.html|date= July 25, 2011|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6DoJvm2WY|archivedate= January 20, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= July 26, 2011[/tpl] During the battle against the Death Celestials, Black Cat, Nick Fury, and Ant-Man join the team. The series was cancelled at issue #12. Despite the prophecy supposedly being a hoax, the central storyline of the series involves a reunion of the original four Defenders setting off a chain of events leading to the destruction of the universe. In the final issue, Dr. Strange changes the past so that the reunion never happens, thus erasing all the events of the series.

===The Fearless Defenders===

February 2013 saw the debut of The Fearless Defenders, a series written by Cullen Bunn with artwork by Will Sliney. Bunn said that he had wanted to write the series, which centers on a new team of Valkyrior, led by Valkyrie and Misty Knight, after writing Fear Itself: The Fearless. It was suggested to him that it should run as a Defenders title, however Bunn explained that beyond the name there is "little connection" to the Defenders.[tpl]cite web |url= http://marvel.com/news/story/19674/marvel_now_qa_fearless_defenders|title= Marvel NOW!

==Membership==

Defenders membership was fluid yet a few members were relatively consistent: the three founders (Doctor Strange, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and the Incredible Hulk), the Silver Surfer, Valkyrie, Nighthawk, Hellcat, and Gargoyle. Membership was clearer in the New Defenders era when the team was more formally organized.

===Secret Defenders===

This group's composition was even more fluid than that of the original Defenders, but typically included either Doctor Strange or Doctor Druid as leader, joined by a custom selection of heroes chosen for the mission at hand. At various times, War Machine, Darkhawk, Thunderstrike, Wolverine, the second Spider-Woman, Ant-Man, Iceman, Nomad, and many others were members. At the end of its existence, the group had a somewhat regular composition including Cadaver, Sepulchre, Joshua Pryce, and Doctor Druid.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Defenders===

In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Defenders are a group of amateur vigilantes who dress up as superheroes. None of them have superpowers, although they claim to be experienced in crime-fighting. Henry Pym is invited to join them, and he accepts, adopting a new identity, Ant-Man, to avoid the potential legal problems of using his growth serum as it is now the official property of the government. Their members include Ultimate versions of Power Man, Hellcat, Nighthawk, Valkyrie, Black Knight, Son of Satan, and Whiz-Kid.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Millar, Mark|penciller= Dillon, Steve|inker= Dillon, Steve|story= The Reserves|title= Ultimates Annual|issue= 1|date= October 2005[/tpl] The Ultimate Defenders are much more interested in becoming celebrities rather than actually stopping crimes or saving lives.
Since The Ultimates volume 3, Pym has rejoined the Ultimates, and the Valkyrie was rewritten as having powers and skills akin to her Earth-616 counterpart, along with expertise in swordfighting, some degree of enhanced strength, and training by Thor.[tpl]cite book|last = Loeb|first = Jeph|coauthors = Madureira, Joe|title = Ultimates 3, Vol. 1: Who Killed The Scarlet Witch?|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2009|pages = 128|isbn = 978-0785130376[/tpl]
The Defenders return in Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates #1 (May 2010) with the original members now possessing superhuman abilities that fit their namesakes.

===What If? Age of Apocalypse===

In a reality in which Legion killed Charles Xavier, the Defenders were the sole group resisting the regime of the mutant tyrant Apocalypse. They were formed by Captain America (wielding Mjolnir), Captain Britain (wearing the Iron Man armor), Logan (without an adamantium skeleton), Molecule Man, Brother Voodoo (Sorcerer Supreme following the death of Doctor Strange), and the Thing, who wears a prosthetic arm. They are later joined by Sauron and Nate Summers.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Remender, Rick|penciller= Wilkins, Dave|inker= Wilkins, Dave|story= What If Legion Had Killed Xavier and Magneto?|title= What If?

===Age of Ultron===

Following Wolverine's murder of Hank Pym during Age of Ultron, a splinter timeline is created. In the new timeline, the Defenders became the world's premier superhero team after the breakup of the Avengers. The new Defenders line-up consisted of Doctor Strange, Captain America, Wolverine, Janet Van Dyne as Captain Marvel, Thing, Cable, Hulk, and Star-Lord. The group is a resistance against Morgan le Fay who has conquered half of Earth.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Peterson, Brandon|inker= Peterson, Brandon|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 8|date= July 2013[/tpl]
