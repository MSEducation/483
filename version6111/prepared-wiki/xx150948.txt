[[Chronic progressive lymphedema]]

CATEGORIES: Horse diseases

Chronic progressive lymphedema, or CPL, is a disease that resembles scratches. It has been identified in Shire, Clydesdale and Belgian horses as well as a small number of Gypsy Vanners.[tpl]cite web | title = Chronic Progressive Lymphedema | work = Bannasch Laboratory | publisher = UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine | url = http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html | accessdate = 2007-07-07 [/tpl]  It is characterized by lymphedema and symptoms include progressive swelling, thickening skin and lesions on the lower leg.  The disease is most likely caused by a malfunctioning lymphatic system and a compromised immune system. There is quite possibly a genetic component. There is no cure at this point, only treatment that has helped keep it under control for some.
Scientists at UC Davis Center for Equine Health are continuing research on the disease with the interest, cooperation and financial support from Ayrshire Farms of Upperville, Virginia.
