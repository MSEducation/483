[[Zavkhan Province]]

CATEGORIES: Zavkhan Province, Provinces of Mongolia

Zavkhan ([tpl]lang-mn|Завхан[/tpl]) is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia, located in the west of the country, 1,104 km from Ulaanbaatar. Its capital is Uliastai. The aimag is named after the Zavkhan River, which forms the border between Zavkhan and Gobi-Altai aimag.

==Environment==

Locally, Zavkhan's environment is considered "Gobi-Khangai" (Говь хангай), since it connects the Gobi Desert in the south with the western Khangai Mountain Range and the broad lake basin of Khovd aimag. 
The highest peak in the province is Otgontenger (Отгонтэнгэр, lit. "youngest sky") both the highest (4,031 m) and only peak in the Khangai range capped with a permanent glacier. The mountain is located in the 95,510 hectare Otgon Tenger Strictly Protected Area, about 60 km east of Uliastai. An image of the mountain can be seen on the aimag's coat of arms. Otgontenger is associated with the Bodhisattva Ochirvaani (Очирваань). 
The western and south-western regions of Zavkhan contain the massive Bor Khyarin Els sand dunes that stretch for over 100 km within the Zavkhan, down into Gobi-Altai aimag. One of the largest lakes in Zavkhan, Bayan Nuur (баян нуур, "rich lake") is nestled among the dunes.
== Climate == 
Most precipitation falls in the summer months as rain, with some snow in the adjacent months of May and September. Winters are typically very dry.
Zavkhan has some of the coldest winter temperatures in Mongolia. In Tosontsengel, the largest soum in Zavkhan, winter temperatures as low as −52.9 °C (−63.2 °F) have been recorded. The soum also holds the record for the highest barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth [tpl]convert|1085.7|hPa|inHg[/tpl], measured on 19 December 2001.[ref]

== Wildlife == 
Aside from having massive livestock populations, Zavkhan's broad ecological regions and deep forests are home to a diverse population of wildlife: bears, wild boars, spotted deer, argali, wild goats, ibexes, wolves, Corsac foxes, marmots, mongooses, lynxes, hares, and both white and black-tale antelope. 
Many forest, mountain and migratory birds can be found in the aimag, including rare Snow cocks and Bobwhites, as well as swans, vultures, falcons and hawks. 
Fishing is a popular pastime in Zavkhan. Khar Nuur and Bayan Nuur lakes are rich with fish, and many of the hundreds of smaller rivers throughout the province provide decent fishing. 

==Population==

Population growth in Zavkhan aimag stopped in 1994, then migration out of the aimag (approx. 40,000 in 1995-2005) reduced its population to the end of 1979 level. The majority of the population is ethnic Khalkha but there are sizable Khotgoid and Kazakh minorities.

largely been unexploited, in 2012 the Golden Hill Project mine was built by Bayan Airag Exploration LLC outside of Durvuljin soum. Bayan Airag Exploration LLC: official website
