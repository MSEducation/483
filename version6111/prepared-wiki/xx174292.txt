==Early life==

Duffy was born in Bangor, Gwynedd to an English father, John Duffy, who was born in Liverpool and brought up in Rock Ferry, Wirral; and a Welsh mother, Joyce Smith (née Williams), born in Bangor, Caernarfonshire and brought up in Nefyn, near Pwllheli. She was partly raised in Nefyn with her twin sister, Katy Ann, and older sister Kelly Ann, who was born in 1980. Duffy's parents divorced when she was 10 and she moved to Letterston, near the Pembrokeshire town of Fishguard with her mother and sisters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2007/11/30/singing-sensation-duffy-shows-her-emotions-91466-20181443/|title=Singing sensation Duffy shows her emotions|publisher=South Wales Western Mail|date=30 November 2007|accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]
Duffy attended Ysgol Nefyn (Nefyn School), Gwynedd on the Llyn Peninsula and Sir Thomas Picton School in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire as a child. At the age of 17, she attended the Pwllheli campus of Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor to study for her A levels. She subsequently went to Chester University and studied for Commercial Music Production in the Warrington campus. From 2004, she studied Performing Arts at the Parkgate campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=chart-topper-duffy-worked-and-studied-in-chester&method=full&objectid=20507737&siteid=50020-name_page.html[/tpl]
In September 1998, at the age of 14, Duffy was briefly put in a police safe house when authorities uncovered a plot by her stepfather's ex-wife to pay an assassin £3,000 to kill her stepfather, Philip Smith. Smith's ex-wife, Dawn Watson, was sentenced to a 3½-year jail term for soliciting to murder. Smith had previously beaten up Watson's new husband Marc Watson, who had also accused Smith of being violent towards his ex-partner whilst they were together.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1151962/The-night-I-brutally-beaten-Duffys-wild-eyed-stepfather.html |title='The night I was brutally beaten up by Duffy's wild-eyed stepfather' | Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-02-21 |accessdate=2013-04-17 |location=London |first1=Simon |last1=Trump |first2=Claudia |last2=Joseph[/tpl] "I was so terrified.

At age 15, she ran away back to her father's home in Nefyn. Duffy said in retrospect, "It was a horrendous thing to do." Her mother and her sisters did not speak to her for about a year afterward. In reaction to her parents' break-up, the following three years were a rebellious period that included binge drinking and stealing a rowing boat.Duffy's 48-hour drinking binge.
