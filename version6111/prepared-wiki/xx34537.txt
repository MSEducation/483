Snettisham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

Snettisham RSPB reserve, on the coast of The Wash some [tpl]convert|2|mi[/tpl] to the west of Snettisham village, is a nature reserve in the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It consists of bird lagoons and bird observation hides, including a rotary hide. The Snettisham coast around the reserve is often said to be "where Norfolk stares at Lincolnshire". This is because, unlike much of Norfolk's coast where the sea stretches to the horizon, Snettisham looks across the square-mouthed estuary of The Wash at the county of Lincolnshire, only [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] away. The River Ingol runs to the south of the village upon which stands the now unused Snettisham watermill. This is now in the process of being renovated (October 2011).
Though traces of the station and railway line can still be seen the service which was opened in 1862 was terminated in 1969.
St. Mary's Church in the village has a 14th-century, [tpl]convert|172|ft|adj=on[/tpl] high spire. Nikolaus Pevsner called it "perhaps the most exciting decorated church in Norfolk". 
The Snettisham Hoard is a series of discoveries of Iron Age precious metal, including nearly 180 gold torques, 75 complete and the rest fragmentary, found in the area between 1948 to 1973. In 1985 there was also a find of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard. Although this latter find has no direct connection with the nearby Iron Age finds, it may be evidence of a long tradition of gold- and silver-working in the area.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm | title = The Snettisham Treasure | publisher = Current Archaeology | accessdate = June 6, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060509121039/http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm  |archivedate = May 9, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/j/snettisham_jewellers_hoard.aspx | title =  Jeweller's hoard from Snettisham | publisher = The British Museum | accessdate = June 9, 2010 [/tpl]
Snettisham has a complex entry in the Domesday book where it is divided in ownership between William de Warenne and the Bishop of Bayeux. Related berewicks are West Newton and Castle Rising, moreover Weston Longville is said to be in Snettisham's valuation. The name of the manor is spelt in four different ways, two very similar to the present pronunciation, one of Snesham and one of Nestesham.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003.
