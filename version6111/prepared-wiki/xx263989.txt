Beecher-McFadden Estate is a historic estate located at Peekskill, Westchester County, New York. The estate includes an imposing brick mansion and a large support building set among scenic landscaping.  The mansion was originally built about 1875 in a Victorian Gothic style and extensively remodeled in the 1920s in the Tudor Revival style. It is a large, [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl]-story, asymmetrical brick building with stone trim, Tudor arches, and plain balustrades.  The north elevation retains the original [tpl]frac|1|1|2[/tpl]-story, red brick walls with polychrome brick trim.  The large support structure has a 2-story center section, flanked by [tpl]frac|1|1|2[/tpl]-story wings, and is in the Jacobean Revival style.  The property was originally developed by Rev. Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887), then purchased by the locally prominent McFadden family in 1902.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10627|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Beecher-McFadden Estate|date=June 1987|accessdate=2011-01-01 |author=Austin N.
