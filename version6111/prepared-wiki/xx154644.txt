The role of the Oba has diminished with the coming of colonial and democratic institutions. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the Oyo warrior chiefs and palace officials, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the empire. In Lagos, like in many areas of the country, chieftaincy titles are given mostly to successful men and women from the Oba's territory, and even elsewhere. The titles also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the Oba, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional investiture ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the Oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official government of Nigeria if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the Oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local media and enter the public domain. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. This ceremony, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, is one of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of Nigeria.Lionel Caplan, Humphrey Fisher, David Parkin; The Politics of Cultural Performance.
