So local Seventh-day Adventist church leader began in 1911 various similar groups under names like: Pals, Woodland Clans and Takoma Clan.

In 1919, the Mission Scouts of Madison, Tennessee were started by Arthur W. Spalding for which he wrote a pledge and law. The Missionary Volunteer Department of the General Conference began a class style award earning program in the 1920s. The Department associate secretary received permission from the Boys Scouts of America to incorporate into a MV honors program parts from Merit Badges in 1928. In 1926, the denomination held its first summer camp in Michigan. In Santa Ana, California around 1929 to 1930, local Adventist clubs using the name Pathfinder were started by John McKim and Dr. Theron Johnston. A JMV summer camp was found in 1930 by the Southeastern California Conference was called Pathfinder Camp mostly like do to the existence of the Santa Ana Pathfinder. The Santa Ana Pathfinders ended in 1936. A year later in Glendale, California, a new Pathfinder group was founded which also added military drills from the Adventist affiliated Medical Cadet Corps. There was a general opposition to these clubs by the denomination's leaders as they did not want the focus to be on missionary work as opposed to more secular pursuits. Despite this, Pathfinder Clubs were sprouting up all over California and the Pacific Northwest in the 1940s. The Southeastern California Conference youth director John Hancock started the first conference sponsored Pathfinder Club in Riverside in 1946.[tpl]cite book|last=Land|first=Gary|title=Historical Dictionary of Seventh-Day Adventists|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=228|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fFYFLksIywcC&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&dq=Pathfinders+scouting+Seventh-day+Adventist+Church&source=bl&ots=WLr49tCC4_&sig=oLVP_pRDmdR9Rr9leRDCDPNfp1E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1XXhUpulF8LgqwHP3oGICg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q=Pathfinders%20scouting%20Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church&f=false|accessdate=January 23, 2014|date=January 1, 2005[/tpl]
With the action of the Southeastern California Conference, discussion regarding these clubs move to the denomination's General Conference (GC), which in 1950s recognized the program. The GC then adopted a program and guidelines while adopting a pledge and law similar to the Mission Scouts' version. The next year, the Oregon Conference held the first Pathfinder Fair and the GC issued the Pathfinder Staff Training Course publication.
