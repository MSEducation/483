A study by Satoshi Kanazawa suggested that even if controlled for obesity levels and intelligence, black women are significantly less physically attractive than non-black women. This was blamed on a higher average level of testosterone in black Africans.Satoshi Kanazawa Causes Firestorm After Claiming Black Women Are Less Attractive 
Some other suggested factors that are the cause for this condition are: As a category, African American men suffer from higher rates of incarceration, unemployment, and poor health than do their white counterparts in the United States. These conditions often make their lives unstable, and disqualify them from raising a home effectively, in effect brand them as "unmarriageable". (Reference: Benokraitis, N. 2011. Marriage and Families: Choices and Constrainsts. Prenhall, NY. Other factors that contribute to the marriage squeeze is that African American men marry non-African Americans at a higher rate than do African American women.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crowder|first=Kyle D.|coauthors=Tolnay, Stewart E.|date=August 2000|title=A New Marriage Squeeze for Black Women: The Role of Racial Intermarriage by Black Men|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|publisher=National Council on Family Relations|location=Minneapolis, MN|volume=62|issue=3|pages=792–80|issn=00222445|oclc=49976459|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1566797|accessdate=2008-07-19|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00792.x[/tpl] According to Newsweek, 43% of African American women between the ages of 30 and 34 have never been married.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000493.html|title=The Black Gender Gap |date=2003-02-23|publisher=Gene Expression|accessdate=2008-07-15[/tpl]  
Several explanations of this phenomenon have been advanced by sociologists. There is a desire among educated women of all races to marry partners within or above their social and economic class; when African American women restrict their marriage prospects to African American men, African American women risk either marrying below their socioeconomic class or not marrying at all as African American women consistently achieve better completion rates in higher education than African American men do.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040425/news_mz1c25marry.html|title=Fewer Women are 'Marrying up'|last=Melendez|first=Michele M.|date=2004-04-25|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-15[/tpl] Also, rates of incarceration for marriage-age African American males are far higher than rates for females, further contributing to the male/female gap. As of 2002, 10.4% of all African American males between the ages of 25 and 29 were sentenced and in prison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/p02.pdf |format=PDF|title=Prisoners in 2002 |publisher=U.

According to AsianWeek, possible explanations for the relatively low number of African American/Asian American interracial couplings could be covert racism from first generation family members at the idea of marrying African Americans.  These negative views on African Americans possibly stem from stereotypes within the Asian community which portray African Americans as "violent" and "lazy", or from the perception that marrying a black partner constitutes "marrying down" because black Americans are on average less affluent than Caucasian Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://asianweek.com/040998/feature.html|title=The Minority Interracial Couples|publisher=AsianWeek|date=April 1998|last=Lavilla|first=Stacy|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]
