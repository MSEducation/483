==Restoration projects==

In 2009, a consortium of public and private partners, including the Houston Audubon Society and the Harris & Eliza Kempner Fund, were awarded the Coastal America Partnership Award for recognition of their financial support in the creation of a breakwater to help slow erosion to the island.  The partnership also helped fund restoration of wetlands that encompass the island. The award is only environmental honor of its kind given by the president of the United States.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=bff77af30947f1d6|work=Galveston Daily News |author=Bronwyn Turner |title=Presidential honor for Deer Island project |accessdate=2009-12-03[/tpl]
