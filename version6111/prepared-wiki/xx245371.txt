==Background==

Of Mice & Men began progress on their self-titled debut shortly after demo session recordings. The group were signed to Rise within Carlile's acknowledgment that the previous group he was a part of (Attack Attack!) were signed to label upon his membership. The album was officially announced by Austin Carlile on the band's YouTube channel on December 23, 2009,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNhgXnLSX4|title=YouTube - Of Mice & Men Video Update!|last=Carlile|first=Austin|date=23 December 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] and is currently available on SmartPunk,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smartpunk.com/catalog/product/view/id/31381/s/of-mice-and-men-of-mice-and-men/category/3/|title=Of Mice And men|publisher=SmartPunk|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] MerchNOW,[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.merchnow.com/products/111676|title=Of Mice & Men : MerchNOW|publisher=MerchNOW|accessdate=2 March 2010[/tpl] and InterPunk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=176025&|title=Interpunk.com - The Ultimate Punk Music Store!|publisher=Interpunk|accessdate=2 March 2010[/tpl] Shortly after the album's release Carlile left the band and Jerry Roush took his position on lead vocals. After Warped Tour 2010, Jaxin Hall left the band to improve his home life and work on his clothing company, Love Before Glory. Jerry was with Of Mice & Men up to the This Is A Family Tour with label mates Attack Attack!. After this, Carlile was invited and returned to the band again with Roush fired. Austin Carlile was working on a side project with Alan Ashby at the time so when he was invited back he said that he and Alan were a package deal. Alan was put on rhythm guitar and Shayley was moved to bass, but will still be doing clean vocals. Shayley Bourget left the band because of his back problems that he couldn't fix during tours, and because of his problem with depression.
Two videos were made for the singles "Those in Glass Houses" and "Second & Sebring".Of Mice & Men premiere!
