Stephen ("Steve") Andrew Seymour (October 4, 1920 in New York City â€“ June 18, 1973 in Los Angeles) was an American track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw; he is regarded by track and field historians as America's original javelin technician. 
Following the Second World War, performance levels of elite U.S. javelin throwers lagged well behind the Europeans. Seeking to refine his skills, Seymour spent 1946 in Finland, training with that nation's world-class throwers. It didn't take long for Steve Seymour's meticulous research to pay dividends. In 1947, Steve established an American Record of 75.80 meters (248' 8") at the U.S. AAU Championships; his mark was within ten-feet of the global standard set by Finland's Yrjo Nikkanen in 1938.
1948 was a memorable year in Seymour's relatively short career; he won a second consecutive national AAU title, and a silver medal at the Summer Olympics in London. In 1950, Steve Seymour added a third national championship to his collection; and in 1951 he was the silver medalist at the Pan American Games.
