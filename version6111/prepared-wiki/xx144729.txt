==Recent history==

During the Croatian War of Independence, Dubica was located in the area contested by the Serbian rebels. Most of the civilians fled the area during the attacks of the Serbian forces that started in September 1991. These forces were controlled by Milan Martić, and consisted of units of Yugoslav People's Army, Territorial Defence, and the so-called Militia of SAO Krajina. Hrvatska Dubica fell on September 17, 1991.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hrvatska-dubica.hr/povijest.html | language = Croatian | title = Povijest | trans_title = History | publisher = Municipality of Hrvatska Dubica | accessdate = 2010-10-22[/tpl] Around October 7, 1991, the Serbian forces took control of the entire wider area of Hrvatska Kostajnica.
Serb forces made a campaign of ethnic cleansing, eliminating all Croats from the area, notably in the infamous Baćin massacre.
