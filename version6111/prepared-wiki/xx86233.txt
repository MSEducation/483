William Holburne (died 1 April 1760) (also known as William Holborne and William Holburn) was an officer of the Royal Navy.
William was the brother of Francis Holburne, a naval officer who rose to flag rank. William also entered the navy, and may have served aboard the 74-gun third rate [tpl]HMS|Kent|1746|6[/tpl], during her time with Admiral Sir Edward Hawke's fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre.
Holburne was promoted to command a sloop on 21 April 1747, and was further advanced to command HMS Prince Frederick on 15 April 1748. He was appointed to command HMS Ramillies in 1755, during the Seven Years' War. Ramillies was part of a squadron commanded by William's brother, Commodore Francis Holburne. William took command of the 74-gun [tpl]HMS|Terrible|1747|6[/tpl] in 1755, and Francis shifted his pennant to her.
William Holburne took command of the 80-gun [tpl]HMS|Newark|1695|6[/tpl], which formed part of the expedition to Louisbourg under his brother in 1757. He went to the Mediterranean in 1759, and served as part of Admiral Sir Edward Boscawen's fleet at the Battle of Lagos. During the battle Boscawen's flagship, [tpl]HMS|Namur|1756|6[/tpl] was badly damaged and un-manoeuvrable. Boscawen therefore shifted his flag to Holburne's Newark. Holburne did not command any more ships after Newark, and died on 1 April 1760.
