[[Vulture]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of prey, Scavengers

Vulture is the name given to two groups of convergently evolved, usually scavenging birds of prey: the New World vultures, including the Californian and Andean Condors; and the Old World vultures, including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains. Research has shown that some traditional Old World Vultures (including the Bearded Vulture) are not closely related to the others, which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two. New World vultures are found in North and South America; Old World vultures are found in Europe, Africa and Asia, meaning that between the two groups, vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica.
A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head, devoid of normal feathers. Although, it has been historically believed to help keep the head clean when feeding, research has shown that the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation.[tpl]cite journal|title=Why do vultures have bald heads?

A group of vultures is called a wake, committee, venue, kettle, or volt. The term kettle refers to vultures in flight, while committee, volt, and venue refer to vultures resting in trees. Wake is reserved for a group of vultures that are feeding.[tpl]cite book |last=Lipton |first=James |title=An Exaltation of Larks: The Ultimate Edition |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140170960#reader_0140170960 |accessdate= |year=1993 |publisher=Penguin Books |edition=third |location=New York |isbn=9780140170962 |oclc=29191881 |page=275[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.westvalley.edu/oth/erodrigues/groups.html|title=Groups to Animals|publisher=West Valley College |location=Saratoga, California |first=Ernie J. |last=Rodrigues |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090921230948/http://www.westvalley.edu/oth/erodrigues/groups.html |archivedate=September 21, 2009[/tpl] The word Geier (taken from the German language) does not have a precise meaning in ornithology; it is occasionally used to refer to a vulture in English, as in some poetry.

==Classification==

Vultures are classified into two groups: Old World vultures and New World vultures. The similarities between the two different groups are due to convergent evolution.

===Old World vultures===

The Old World vultures found in Africa, Asia, and Europe belong to the family Accipitridae, which also includes eagles, kites, buzzards, and hawks. Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight.
There are 16 species, the last three of which are distinct from the others:

===New World vultures===

The New World vultures and condors found in warm and temperate areas of the Americas are not closely related to the similar Accipitridae, but belong in the family Cathartidae, which was once considered to be related to the storks. However, recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be included among the Accipitriformes, along with other birds of prey.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=please provide a source for this research.|date=July 2011[/tpl] However, they are still not closely related to the other vultures, and their similarities are due to convergent evolution. Several species have a good sense of smell, unusual for raptors, and are able to smell dead animals from great heights, up to a mile away.
There are seven species:

==Feeding==

Vultures seldom attack healthy animals, but may kill the wounded or sick. When a carcass has too thick a hide for its beak to open, it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.webvulture.com/vulture-facts.html |title=Fast Vulture Facts |publisher=WebVulture.com |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718015236/http://www.webvulture.com/vulture-facts.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011[/tpl] Vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields. They gorge themselves when prey is abundant, until their crop bulges, and sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food. They do not carry food to their young in their claws, but disgorge it from the crop. These birds are of great value as scavengers, especially in hot regions. Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive, allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with Botulinum toxin, hog cholera, and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-09/968529176.Bc.r.html |title=Re: How come that vultures can resist dangerous toxins when feeding on carcass |last1=Caryl |first1=Jim |date=September 7, 2000 |publisher=MadSci Network |accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl] New World vultures often vomit when threatened or approached. Contrary to some accounts, they don't 'projectile vomit' on their attacker as a deliberate defense, but it does lighten their stomach load to make take-off easier, and the vomited meal residue may distract a predator, allowing the bird to escape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vulturesociety.homestead.com/TVFacts.html |title=Turkey Vulture Facts |publisher=Turkey Vulture Society |accessdate=2012-12-01[/tpl] New World vultures also urinate straight down their legs; the uric acid kills bacteria accumulated from walking through carcasses, and also acts as evaporative cooling.[tpl]cite web |url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/vulture-vomit.htm |title= Why is it a bad idea to scare a vulture? |last1=Conger |first1=Cristen |publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl]

The vultures in south Asia, mainly in India and Nepal, have declined dramatically in just the last 10–15 years.[tpl]update after|2013|10|4|reason="Last 10-15 years" doesn't make it clear when that time reference should be taken from[/tpl] It has been proposed that this may be due to residues of the veterinary drug Diclofenac in animal carcasses.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6975/abs/nature02317.html |last1=Oaks |first1=J.

The same problem is also seen in Nepal where government has taken some late steps to conserve remaining vultures.
