Mill Hill School, commonly referred to as "Mill Hill", is a coeducational independent day and boarding school located in Mill Hill, London. A member of the HMC, it is one of a handful of independent boarding schools in London. The school educates approximately 640 pupils, spread across ten day and boarding houses.
Dr. Dominic Luckett became headmaster at the start of the 2007–2008 academic year. He was previously deputy headmaster of Worth School.  He succeeded William R Winfield, MA.
The site was once the estate of Ridgeway House, significant in the history of British botany, as the former home of botanist and avid gardener Peter Collinson.

==Houses==

As with many independent schools, Mill Hill School is divided into houses. These are:

===Boarding houses===

===Day houses===

Winterstoke House was renamed as Grimsdell Pre-preparatory School in 1995.

==History==

A committee of Nonconformist merchants and ministers, including John Pye Smith, founded the schoolA History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1 for boys on 25th January 1807. They located it outside the boundary of London because of "dangers both physical and moral, awaiting youth while passing through the streets of a large, crowded and corrupt city". The school is in peaceful, secure and rural surroundings, but by today's standards very close to Central London. A boarding school was opened in the house once occupied by Peter Collinson, with about 20 boys. The Reverend J Atkinson was the first headmaster and chaplain until 1810. 
Mill Hill School occupies a [tpl]convert|120|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site, part of which formed the gardens of Ridgeway House, the house of the botanist Peter Collinson. He was one of the most important importers of rare and exotic plants into English gardens. Many of the species that he introduced to Mill Hill in the 18th Century continue to flourish today in the grounds of the School. In 1746 Collinson planted Britain's first hydrangea on the grounds, now located adjacent to School House.
The estate was purchased by the botanist Richard Salisbury in 1802, Ridgeway House became the setting for a long-running scientific dispute between the new owner and his guest, James Edward Smith.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle =Salisbury, Richard Anthony|first = George Simonds|last =Boulger |authorlink =George Simonds Boulger|volume = 50|quote=sources: Journal of Botany, 1886.][/tpl] The flora of Mill Hill was supplemented by the work of the amateur botanist Richard William Bowry Buckland (died 1947), governor of the foundation from 1878 to 1889, who cultivated a garden in the south-west of the school's grounds for the enjoyment of future generations. He wrote in his diary:
 
 "In years bygone I pray to thee,
This willow here, my legacy,
As I have sat, pray sit thee.
In shaded splendour,
Millhillians; rest hither."
Richard Buckland

In 1939, Mill Hill School's premises were taken over by the British government and the school was evacuated to St. Bees School in Cumberland for the duration of the Second World War. Collinson House, a school for girls, was named for it. A St Bees Association was founded in commemoration of this period of evacuation in the school's history by Michael Berry OBE and David Smith.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.stbees.org.uk/history/hist_mill_hill.htm  | title=Evacuation of Mill Hill School to St. Bees | publisher=The St Bees Association[/tpl]

In 2005 the school was one of 50 of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by The Times. Together they had driven up fees for thousands of parents.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Independent schools face huge fines over cartel to fix fees | first=Tony | last=Halpin | date=2005-11-10 | accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000, and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust. It is to benefit persons who were students at the schools during the cartel period.The Office of Fair Trading: OFT names further trustees as part of the independent schools settlement
