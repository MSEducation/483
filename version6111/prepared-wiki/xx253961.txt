The 20th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised in Virginia for service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia.
The 20th Virginia was assembled in July, 1861, with men from Richmond and the counties of Lunenburg, Powhatan, Buckingham, Prince Edward, Halifax, and Brunswick. Two companies were captured in the fight at Rich Mountain and in September five companies were disbanded.
An unsuccessful attempt was made to reorganize, and later the two companies were assigned to the 59th Virginia Infantry.
Lieutenant Colonels James R. Crenshaw, John Pegram, and Nathaniel Tyler were in command.
