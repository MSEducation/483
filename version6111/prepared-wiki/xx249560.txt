In interviews Cox compared Bob Servant to the Dundonian poet William McGonagall and said "We’ve had Billy Connolly and Lex McLean’s Glasgow stories and traditions, but now we’ve got this Dundee creature". Forsyth has noted McGonagall as an influence for the character along with Harry Flashman, the anti-hero of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman novels. In November 2010 Forsyth published Servant's autobiography Bob Servant - Hero Of Dundee.
Bob Servant made the leap to television in early 2013 as the independent candidate for Broughty Ferry in the cult BBC Four comedy Bob Servant Independent which added Jonathan Watson and Rufus Jones to the existing radio cast.[tpl]cite web|title=BBC Bob Servant Independent|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wwyrh|accessdate=20 February 2013[/tpl]
