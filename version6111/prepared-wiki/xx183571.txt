[[Bidirectional Glenn procedure]]

CATEGORIES: Medical procedures

A Glenn shunt is a palliative procedure that is offered to a patient with single ventricular physiology either due to valvular anomalies (e.g., tricuspid or pulmonic valve atresia) or ventricular pathologies (like hypoplastic right ventricle or single ventricle etc.). This involves drainage of the superior vena cava (SVC) to the right pulmonary artery (RPA) thereby reducing ventricular work to some extent as  deoxygenated blood returning from the head and upper body is directly routed to the pulmonary arteries for oxygenation by the lungs. Since the stream of blood on entering the pulmonary arterial system flows to both right and left lungs, it is called a bi-directional Glenn procedure. The Glenn procedure was introduced in 1958 by William Glenn and modifications to the procedure were published by Dr. Azzolina in 1973.[tpl]cite pmid |  5017561[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid | 13566431[/tpl] The original description by Dr. Glenn allowed communication only between the RPA and the SVC, whereas the modified technique had the SVC connecting at or before the bifurcation between the right and left pulmonary arteries.
