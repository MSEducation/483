Ron Avitzur is a software developer. He worked with Apple Computer in the early 1990s. After Apple cancelled his project, Graphing Calculator, he, together with his friend Greg Robbins, continued to work for free, sneaking into the building every day in order to continue development of the software. When completed, the software was so impressive that Apple executives used it as their standard demonstration of the then-new PowerPC chips, and agreed to ship the calculator with Mac OS 9."Should I Stay Or Should I Go," This American Life, March 11, 2005http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/132066
