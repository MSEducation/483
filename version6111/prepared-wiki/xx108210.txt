The two Serenades, Op. 11 and 16, represented two of the earliest efforts by Johannes Brahms to write orchestral music. They both date from the 1850s when Brahms was residing in Detmold.Geiringer, p. 55

==Serenade No. 1 in D, Op. 11==

The first serenade was completed in 1857. At that time, Brahms was also working on his First Piano Concerto.
