==Hewlett-Packard==

In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard's garage with an initial capital investment of $538 (approximately $[tpl]Inflation|US|0.538|1939|r=0[/tpl],000 in [tpl]#expr:[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]-1[/tpl]). Packard mentions in his book The HP Way that the name Hewlett-Packard was determined by the flip of a coin: HP, rather than PH.[tpl]cite book |title=HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company |last=Packard |first=David|year=1995|publisher=Collins |isbn=0-88730-817-1[/tpl] Their first product was a sound oscillator sold to Walt Disney Studios for use on the soundtrack of Fantasia.

The company, where Packard proved to be an expert administrator and Hewlett provided many technical innovations, grew into the world's largest producer of electronic testing and measurement devices. It also became a major producer of calculators, computers, and laser and ink jet printers.
HP incorporated in 1947, with Packard becoming its first president, serving in that role until 1964; he was then elected Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, holding these positions through 1968. He left HP in 1969 to serve in the Nixon administration until 1971, at which time he returned to HP and was re-elected Chairman of the Board, serving from 1972 to 1993. In 1991, Packard oversaw a major reorganization at HP.  He retired from HP in 1993. At the time of his death in 1996, Packard's stake in the company was worth more than $1 billion.

==Philanthropy==

From the early 1980s until his death in 1996, Packard dedicated much of his time and money to philanthropic projects.

The couple eventually donated $55 million to build the new aquarium, which opened in 1984 with Julie Packard as executive director. In 1987, Packard gave $13 million to create the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation has since provided about 90% of the Institute's operating budget.
In 1964, the couple founded the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. In 1986, they donated $40 million toward building what became the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University; the new hospital opened in June 1991. Packard and Hewlett made a combined donation of $77 million to Stanford in 1994,[tpl]cite web|title=Packard and Hewlett gift to make possible new science/engineering quad|publisher=Stanford News Service|accessdate=2011-11-11|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/94/941011Arc4100.html|date=October 11, 1994[/tpl]  for which the university named the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building in his honor.[tpl]cite web|title=Engineering memory of the month|url=http://soe.stanford.edu/about/memories/08_2009_packard.html|publisher=Stanford Engineering|accessdate=November 11, 2011|date=August 2009[/tpl]  The building is located adjacent to the William Hewlett Teaching Center.
Packard was a member  of the American Enterprise Institute's board of trustees. He died on March 26, 1996 at age 83 in Stanford, California, leaving the bulk of his estate to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.
