The Hokkiens refer to this area as gu chia chui, and the Cantonese call it ngow chay shui also meaning "bullock water cart road". Kreta Ayer Road was officially conferred in 1922.
Kreta Ayer Road defines for the Chinese in Singapore, the Chinatown area. For the Chinese, the Chinatown area is referred also as tua poh or "greater town" district. In the 1880s, Kreta Ayer was the red light district of Chinatown. The Chinese traveller, Li Zhongjue, observed in 1887 that the street was a place of restaurants, theatres and brothels and where "filth and dirt are hidden".
