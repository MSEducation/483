==Political career==

Bondevik in 2008 said that he regards himself as a "68'er", and that he was "influenced by the radical wind of the time". While he remained in the movement of Young Christian Democrats (Norway, KrFU), he claims to have "radicalized the organization to great despair in the party". He has also said that he would likely rather have "oriented" himself towards the Socialist People's Party, had his radicalization of the Christian Democratic Party not gone through.Anfindsen, 2010, p. 249.
Representing the Christian Democratic Party, Bondevik was a member of the Storting (Parliament) from 1973 to 2005. He was his party's parliamentary leader in the periods of 1981–1983, 1986–1989, 1993–1997, 1997 and 2000–2001, and party leader from 1983 to 1995. In this position, he was succeeded by Valgerd Svarstad Haugland. Bondevik was also Minister of Foreign Affairs in Jan P. Syse's government of 1989–1990, Minister of Church and Education in Kåre Willoch's government 1983–1986, also Prime Minister Willoch's deputy 1985–1986, and state secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister during Lars Korvald's  government 1972–1973.

===As Prime Minister===

Bondevik's first term as Prime Minister lasted from 17 October 1997 to 3 March 2000, in a coalition cabinet consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Centre Party and the Liberal Party.
While serving his first term as Prime Minister, Bondevik attracted international attention in August 1998 when he announced that he was suffering from depressive episode, becoming the highest ranking world leader to admit to suffering from a mental illness while in office. Upon this revelation, Anne Enger Lahnstein became acting Prime Minister for three weeks, from 30 August to 23 September, while he recovered from the depressive episode. Bondevik then returned to office. Bondevik received thousands of supportive letters, and said that the experience had been positive overall, both for himself and because it made mental illness more publicly acceptable.BBC Newsnight, 21 January 2008.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Ben|last2=Bondevik|first2=Kjell Magne|title=Fighting stigma with openness|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=December 2011|volume=89|issue=12|pages=862-863|doi=10.2471/BLT.11.041211|pmid=22271941|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-041211/en/index.html|accessdate=19 July 2013|pmc=3260893[/tpl]
Bondevik's first cabinet was defeated by a motion of no confidence in March 2000 as a result of a dispute over the construction of gas-fired power stationsRow over gas-fired power stations topples Government and was replaced by a Labour Party government led by Jens Stoltenberg until their defeat in the 2001 parliamentary election. Bondevik then formed his second cabinet, consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, which took office on 19 October 2001.
The second Bondevik government carried out reforms and left a booming economy. However, Bondevik was defeated in the 2005 parliamentary election, with 81 seats obtained for Bondevik's coalition and its supporters to the opposition Red-Green Coalition's 88.
Bondevik announced his retirement from national-level politics at the end of his term as prime minister and did not seek re-election for his seat in parliament.

==The Oslo Centre==

The Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights was founded by Kjell Magne Bondevik in January 2006. The purpose of the centre is to work for world peace, human rights and inter-religious tolerance world wide. The centre cooperates closely with the Carter Center in Atlanta, the Kim Dae Jung Library in Seoul and the Crisis Management Initiative in Helsinki.

==Awards and decorations==

Bondevik was awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav in 2004, the first sitting Norwegian Prime Minister to receive the Order of St. Olav in 80 years. The award happened due to a change in the Statutes of the Order with automatic awards to the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Government that stirred some debate and criticism.Orden på Bondevik [tpl]no icon[/tpl] Dagbladet, retrieved 20 July, 2013 With the succeeding Stoltenberg Government, the practice was halted.Den siste ære [tpl]no icon[/tpl] VG, retrieved 20 July 2013
