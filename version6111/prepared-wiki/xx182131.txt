The Benning Bridge is a beam bridge carrying Benning Road over the Anacostia River and Kingman Island in Washington DC. It is a six-lane bridge with pedestrian lanes on both sides. A separate Washington Metro bridge carrying the Blue and Orange lines crosses over the bridge near its western terminus, and parallels the bridge on the north.

==History==

In 1791, the state of Maryland (in which then controlled the area which would later become the District of Columbia) issued a charter to Benjamin Stoddert, Thomas Law, and John Templeman to build a bridge across the Anacostia River.Bryan, Wilhelmus Bogart. A History of the National Capital From Its Foundation Through the Period of the Adoption of the Organic Act. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1914, p. 492.Croggon, James. "When City Was Young." Washington Evening Star. August 17, 1906. Stoddert owned land (known as "Long Meadows") on the eastern shore of the Anacostia River, and a bridge would have helped him develop him land. The right to build a bridge was not exercised until 1805, when Chain Bridge was swept away during floods. Stoddert then formed the Anacostia Bridge Co., and that same year erected a $20,000 wooden bridge known as Stoddert's Bridge in this location. In the 1790s, "Captain" William Benning came from Virginia and purchased [tpl]convert|330|acre|km2[/tpl] of land on the western end of Stoddert's Bridge.Deanwood History Committee.

By 1814, the bridge—now also known as "Upper Bridge"—was in disrepair.Lord, Walter. The Dawn's Early Light. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 93. During the War of 1812, the U.S. military commander of the Military District of Washington burned Stoddert's Bridge in an attempt to stop the British from invading the city of Washington.Lord, The Dawn's Early Light, 1994, p. 96; Muller, Charles Geoffrey.

The bridge was rebuilt in 1815 by Thomas Ewell, who renamed it Ewell's Bridge.Bryan, A History of the National Capital From Its Foundation Through the Period of the Adoption of the Organic Act, 1914, p. 98-99. In the 1820s, Ewell sold the bridge to Benning, who renamed it Benning's Bridge. Benning built a new bridge at the site in the 1830s (although not all sources agree on the exact date).[tpl]cite news | url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0EFA659FCB895&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title= Local roads scholars give streets'history | author= | publisher=The Washington Times | date= June 25, 1992 | accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl]
After a major flood in 1840, the bridge was repaired. It was purchased in August 1848 by the federal government and the toll removed.Turnpike Roads in District of Columbia. Minority Report. Committee on the District of Columbia. U.S. House of Representatives. Report No. 410. 35th Cong., 1st Sess. May 24, 1858, p. 2. In disrepair due to the large amount of traffic over the span, it was almost completely rebuilt in 1868.Letter of the Secretary of War, March 22, 1869. Exec. Doc. No. 100. United States Senate. 41st Cong., 1st Sess. June 20, 1870, p. 2. The structure was replaced with a steel bridge in 1892,Wasserman, Paul & Hausrath, Don. Washington, D.C.

A second concrete bridge was constructed in 1961; the old span now carried eastbound traffic, while the new span carried only westbound traffic.
