==Biography==

===Early years===

Born into a family of musical siblings, David began studying the violin at the age of six. At the age of 12, he embarked upon learning the viola and by age 16, the viola became his primary instrument. He continued to pursue both instruments at the pre-college divisions of Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music, Italy’s Accademia Chigiana, Switzerland’s International Music Academy, and the Verbier Festival Academy, studying with world-renowned pedagogues Pinchas Zukerman, Roberto Diaz, Seiji Ozawa, Robert Mann, Nobuko Imai, Boris Belkin, and Yuri Bashmet.

===2003 - Present Day===

Since 2003 David has been performing with leading musicians and orchestras in the United States and Europe. As the First Prize winner of the 2005 Philadelphia Orchestra Young Artists Competition, David performed the Walton Viola Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the baton of Christoph Eschenbach, who describes Carpenter’s viola playing as “breathtaking, convincing and highly charismatic.” He has been acclaimed by Die Welt as “A New Star at the Forefront of Violists”; by The Philadelphia Inquirer as "an overnight-star violist"; and by The Strad Magazine as a violist whose "soulful sound, committed playing and dazzling technique leaves little to desire." David has made his recital debuts in the United States at well-known venues including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. This past November, he made his debut in Germany with the Dresden Staatskapelle performing the Schnittke Viola Concerto. In 2008, he was Maxim Vengerov’s last-minute replacement for performances of Benjamin Yusupov's Viola, Tango, Rock Concerto with the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra in Switzerland. He has performed in the United States at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, Chicago’s Krannert Center, and San Francisco’s Herbst Theatre, among other venues. In September, David released his first recording on the Ondine label of the Elgar Cello Concerto (arr. Lionel Tertis/Carpenter) and the Schnittke Viola Concerto with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Maestro Christoph Eschenbach.  The disc received international acclaim and received numerous awards such as the Editor’s Choice Award by Gramophone Magazine and Disc of the Month by The New Yorker. Most recently, David was the recipient of the prestigious 2010 Avery Fisher Career Grant.
In 2006, David Aaron Carpenter was selected as a protégé by mentor Pinchas Zukerman as part of the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, an international philanthropic programme that pairs masters in their disciplines with emerging talents for a year of one-to-one creative exchange.http://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/pairing/2006-2007/pinchas_zukerman_and_david_aaron_carpenter
