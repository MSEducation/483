[[List of California ballot propositions]]

The following is a list of California ballot propositions broken down by decade.  Propositions can be placed on the ballot either through the initiative process or by a vote of the state legislature. Propositions were added to the California constitution as part of the ethics reform instituted by Governor Hiram Johnson in the early 1910s.
Prior to the November 1982 general election, proposition numbers started with "1" for each election.  After November 1982, subsequent propositions received higher and higher numbers until November 1998 when the count was reset.  Starting with November 1998, the count is reset in 10-year cycles.
In October 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill which requires all future ballot propositions to be listed only in general elections (held in November), rather than during any statewide election. Two propositions had already qualified for the next statewide election (which was the June 2012 presidential primaries) prior to the signing of the law, making the June 2012 primaries the last state-wide non-general elections in California to have statewide propositions on the ballot.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/08/3968832/gov-jerry-brown-signs-bill-restricting.html|title=Gov.
