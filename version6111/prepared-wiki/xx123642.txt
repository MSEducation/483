==Golden Days==

The frequency at one point in the early 1980s was 103.1 FM. The move to 103.1 was challenged by WNEW at 102.7 and then WAPP 103.5 because of interference in their protected primary contour. This eventually led back to the station returning to 90.9 FM.  While at 103.1, the on-air talent was most competitive to even commercial stations. WKRB now stands on 90.3 FM.
On air personalities included William "Kid Willy" McFarland, who served as the General Manager and was eventually on Z100 in New York under the name "Spanky McFarland" before his death, Vincent "King Johnny Thunder" Soriano, who was also the Program Director during this period, and is currently at WSIA-FM, Big Dave Neel, Stanley "Stan The Man" Evans, Patrick "Pat The Cat" Phillips (now Kid Kelly) who is still at Z100 New York as the host and creator of his very own syndicated classic hits show called "Backtrax U.S.A.", and as the VP of music programming here at Sirius/XM Satellite Radio and Sirius/XM Hits 1, Lenny Green now on WBLS, Ruby Tuesday currently on Electric FM (originally from the "B91" days was also heard on WNYZ PULSE 87, WNEW 102.7 FM, 77 WABC, and WXXP PARTY 105 to name a few), Yo! Sunny Joe Fox a frequent New York City Radio Personality now heard on WKNE a 50,000 Watt Heritage Top 40 Powered by Saga Communications in Southern New Hampshire and others.
During the "glory days", a morning show, which preceded the famous "Zoo" shows of the mid 80s was created.
The college held its 30th Anniversary Celebration of the radio station in May 2008.
