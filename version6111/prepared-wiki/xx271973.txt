Phoenix was built at the Confederate Naval Works at Selma in 1863 and launched in March 1864.  She was severely damaged during the launching and subsequently could not be used as a warship.  She was brought to Mobile and scuttled by Confederate forces at the Dog River Bar in Mobile Bay on August 7, 1864.  She was blown up a few nights later by Union sailors from the USS Metacomet.  The Confederates then burned her to the waterline.  The wreck was located in 1985 and determined to be well preserved.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks |last=Gaines |first=W.
