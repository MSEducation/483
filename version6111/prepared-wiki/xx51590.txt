[[Counterstereotype]]

CATEGORIES: Stereotypes, Political correctness

A counter-stereotype, reverse stereotype, or anti-stereotype is the reverse of a stereotype.  
Although counter-stereotypes arise in opposition to stereotypes, they may eventually become stereotypes themselves if they are too popular.
An example is the character type called the magical negro; Spike Lee popularized this term deriding the archetype of the "super-duper magical negro" in 2001 while discussing films with students at Washington State University and at Yale University.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20041025/kinga.shtml |title= Stephen King's Super-Duper Magical Negroes |first= Nnedi | last = Okorafor-Mbachu | authorlink = Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu| work = Strange Horizons |date= 2004-10-25 | accessdate = 2006-12-03 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n21/story3.html | title = Director Spike Lee slams 'same old' black stereotypes in today's films | first = Susan | last = Gonzalez | work = Yale Bulletin & Calendar | publisher =Yale University | date = 2001-03-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-29 [/tpl]

==Examples==

==Social psychology of counterstereotypical people==

Social psychologists have found that people tend to react more negatively to counterstereotypical people than to stereotypical people.Rubin, M., Paolini, S., & Crisp, R. J. (2013). Linguistic description moderates the evaluations of counterstereotypical people. Social Psychology, 44, 289-298. doi: 10.1027/1864-9335/a000114 This may be because counterstereotypical people threaten the need to maintain stable and coherent stereotype systems.
