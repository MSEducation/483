Brentford Community Stadium is a proposed stadium in Kew Bridge, west London with a projected capacity of 20,000. It is planned to be the home of Brentford F.C..

==Background==

In October 2002, following several years of speculation about a possible relocation, the club announced plans to move to a 20,000 capacity stadium near Kew Bridge. This included an ambitious monorail proposal, which was later dropped from the scheme. After several years of uncertainty the project was suddenly brought back to public attention in late 2007 when the club announced they had secured an option on the site.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brentford/7132539.stm | work=BBC News | title=Brentford given new stadium boost | date=7 December 2007[/tpl] 
This was followed up in February 2008 when a partnership deal with Barratt Homes to develop the site was announced.Brentford Football Club And Barratt Homes Team Up To Acquire Land For New Community Stadium | Brentford | News | Latest News | Latest News

The club's plan to move to a new community stadium took a massive step forward when, on 28 June 2012, the Club bought the 7.6 acre site in Lionel Road, Brentford, from Barratt Homes who had originally acquired the site in January 2008. The Club is planning to build a 20,000 capacity stadium on the land in time for the 2016/17 season, with the option of extending to 25,000 seats. In December 2013 Brentford football club were given approval for the new stadium by Hounslow Council with further approval sought and received from the Mayor of London and the government  in early 2014.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25249046 | title=Brentford Football Club given Lionel Road stadium go-ahead | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=7 December 2013 | date=6 December 2013[/tpl] Work is expected to commence in the summer of 2014.

==Location==

It is planned to be located on a [tpl]convert|7.6|acre|m2[/tpl] site off Lionel Road, and adjacent to Kew Bridge railway station. It stands in the middle of a triangle of railway lines, predominantly used for freight. Hounslow Council have
been pushing a proposal for an extension of Crossrail to Hounslow via Kew Bridge, using one of these freight lines. The outline document suggested a station could be built to serve the Lionel Road site. The proposal is unlikely to make it into the first phase of the Crossrail project, but might be a later addition to the route.A4
