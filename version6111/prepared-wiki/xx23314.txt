Angelopoulos, defined by Martin Scorsese as "a masterful filmmaker", has developed a unique cinematic vision, characterized by slightest movement, slightest change in distance, long takes, and complicated but carefully composed scenes, offering a hypnotic, sweeping, and profoundly emotional cinema.[tpl]Sfn|Horton|1999|loc=preface[/tpl][tpl]Sfn|Horton|1999|loc=back cover[/tpl]

==Biography==

Theodoros Angelopoulos was born in Athens on 27 April 1935. During the Greek Civil War, his father was taken hostage and returned when Angelopoulos was 9 years old; according to the director, the absence of his father and looking for him among the dead bodies had a great impact on his cinematography."Theodoros Angelopoulos", editions Kastanioti, p. 189.  He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, but after his military service went to Paris to attend the Sorbonne. He soon dropped out to study film at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC) before returning to Greece. There, he worked as a journalist and film critic. Angelopoulos began making films after the 1967 coup that began the Greek military dictatorship known as the Regime of the Colonels. He made his first short film in 1968 and in the 1970s he began making a series of political feature films about modern Greece: Days of '36 (Meres Tou 36, 1972), The Travelling Players (O Thiassos, 1975) and The Hunters (I Kynighoi, 1977). In 1978, he was a member of the jury at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1978/04_jury_1978/04_Jury_1978.html |title=Berlinale 1978: Juries |accessdate=4 August 2010 |work=berlinale.de [/tpl]

He quickly established a characteristic style, marked by slow, episodic and ambiguous narrative structures as well as long takes (The Travelling Players, for example, consists of only 80 shots in about four hours of film). These takes often include meticulously choreographed and complicated scenes involving many actors. His regular collaborators include the cinematographer Giorgos Arvanitis, the screenwriter Tonino Guerra and the composer Eleni Karaindrou. One of the recurring themes of his work is immigration, the flight from homeland and the return, as well as the history of 20th century Greece. Angelopoulos was considered by British film critics Derek Malcolm[tpl]sfn|Malcolm 2000[/tpl] and David Thomson[tpl]sfn|Thomson|2002|pp=21–22[/tpl] as one of the world's greatest directors.
Angelopoulos was awarded honorary doctorates by the Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium in 1995, by Paris West University Nanterre La Défense, France, by the University of Essex, UK in July 2001,[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/or/2001/t-angelopoulos-oration.aspx |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=University of Essex |date=9 December 2009 [/tpl] by the University of Western Macedonia, Greece in December 2008,[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.uowm.gr/registration/eggrafa/Deltio_Typou_anagoreusis_Theodorou_Aggelopoulou.pdf |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=University of Western Macedonia |date=15 December 2008 [/tpl] and by the University of the Aegean, Greece in December 2009.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.ct.aegean.gr/events/angelopoulos_epitimos/page/omilies.htm |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=University of the Aegean |date=12 July 2001 [/tpl]
