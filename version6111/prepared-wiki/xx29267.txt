The Horseshoe Falls, also known as the Canadian Falls, is part of Niagara Falls, on the Niagara River. Approximately 90% of the Niagara River, after diversions for hydropower generation, flows over Horseshoe Falls. The remaining 10% flows over the American Falls. It is located between Terrapin Point on Goat Island in New York State, and Table Rock on the Ontario side of the falls. According to official U.S. Geological Survey maps (see References 78 below), approximately two-thirds of Horseshoe Falls is located in Ontario, Canada with the remaining one-third in New York State, United States of America.Staff report (June 23, 2006).

Video claims Horseshoe Falls for U.S. Toronto Star"The international boundary line may pass through the Horseshoe Falls just beyond Terrapin Tower Point, so that the United States are not entitled to as large a portion as Canada of the Horseshoe Falls, which is admittedly not all Canadian."

==Boundary controversies==

When the boundary line was determined in 1819 based on the Treaty of Ghent, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in New York, United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which was once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955 the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point.[tpl]cite book |last= Berton |first= Pierre |title= Niagara: A History of the Falls |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=P_Rr06A2H6UC&pg=PA20 |accessdate= 1 December 2010 |year= 2009 |publisher= SUNY Press |isbn= 978-1-4384-2928-1 |pages=20â€“21[/tpl] In the early 1980s the United States Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether [tpl]convert|400|ft|m[/tpl] of the Horseshoe Falls was eliminated.  Constant erosion indicates the boundary line will alter into the future.
In October 2007, the Horseshoe Falls was featured in a Disney produced video titled Welcome: Portraits of America, made for the United States Department of State and Department of Homeland Security to promote United States tourism.Associated Press; Toronto Star: U.S. annexes Canadian landmark in tourism video; October 28, 2007 A controversy surrounded the film, because instead of showing just the American falls and Bridal Veil Falls, they focused on Horseshoe Falls, which lies mostly in Canada.  
Current (2014) online promotional materials from the Niagara Falls State Park, including the interactive map of the State Park, show the part of the Horseshoe Falls that is in U.S. territory, as determined by U.S. Geological Survey maps.  This presentation of only part of Horseshoe Falls reflects a more accurate depiction of the boundardies of Niagara Falls State Park and U.S. territory.  These official maps show approximately one-third of the Horseshoe Falls lies within the U.S. (New York State), while the remainder of the Horseshoe Falls lies on the Canadian side.  Scientists indicate Horseshoe Falls will continue to erode, thus altering future U.S.-Canadian boundaries.USGS 1995 Niagara Falls Map
According to the U.S. Geological Survey maps, approximately one-third of Horseshoe Falls is within U.S. territory (New York State).  Both the 1995 map cited above and the new 2013 map show approximately two-thirds is in Canada.  Both U.S. and New York State boundaries are shown on the newer map.USGS Niagara Falls Topo 2013 Map
