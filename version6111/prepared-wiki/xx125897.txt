CATEGORIES: Subgroups of the Han Chinese, Ningbo

The Ningbo people ([tpl]Zh|t=寧波人|s=宁波人|p=Níngbō rén[/tpl]; Ningbo dialect: [tpl]IPA-wuu|ɲiŋ.bɔ.ɲiŋ|[/tpl]) or alternatively Mingzhou people ([tpl]Zh|c=明州人|p=Míngzhōu rén[/tpl]) is the general name for two groups of Chinese people: those who live(d) in Ningbo, and those whose ancestors were from Ningbo. Many famous Chinese come from Ningbo, and many more have Ningbo as their ancestral home. Ningbo people are a subgroup of Wuyue Han Chinese. People from Zhoushan or with ancestry from there are also considered themselves to be Ningbo people. (Since Zhoushan in earlier times was part of Mingzhou or Ming Prefecture, an old name for Ningbo.)
