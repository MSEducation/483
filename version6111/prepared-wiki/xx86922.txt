[[Kronecker symbol]]

CATEGORIES: Modular arithmetic

==Definition==

Let n be a non-zero integer, with prime factorization  
where u is a unit (i.e., u is 1 or −1), and the pi are primes. Let a be an integer. The Kronecker symbol (a|n) is defined by 
For odd pi, the number (a|pi) is simply the usual Legendre symbol. This leaves the case when pi = 2. We define (a|2) by 
Since it extends the Jacobi symbol, the quantity (a|u) is simply 1 when u = 1. When u = −1, we define it by 
Finally, we put
These extensions suffice to define the Kronecker symbol for all integer values n.

==Properties==

The Kronecker symbol shares many basic properties of the Jacobi symbol, under certain restrictions:

===Quadratic reciprocity===

The Kronecker symbol also satisfies the following version of quadratic reciprocity.
