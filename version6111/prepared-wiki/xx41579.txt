==History==

The earliest known reference to a windmill in Saxtead occurs in 1287, the current Saxtead Green Mill dates back to at least 1796 when the miller was Amos Webber.[tpl]cite book |last=Wailes |first=Rex |authorlink=Rex Wailes ||title=Saxtead Green Post Mill |publisher=English Heritage |location=London |isbn=978 1 85074 220 3[/tpl]  In 1810, the Mill House was built for Robert Holmes. The mill was raised a total of three times during its working life. The mill was tailwinded c. 1853. As a result of this, the mill was completely rebuilt in 1854 by Whitmore and Binyon, the Wickham Market millwrights. New cast iron machinery was fitted, and the layout of the machinery changed from Head and Tail to Breast stones. It was in this year that the mill was raised for the third time. Collins, the Melton millwright worked on the mill in the 1870s and Whitmore and Binyon again worked on the mill in the 1890s. From 1926 millwright Jesse Wightman (initially apprentice to A S Aldred the Miller) assisted the owner with repairs until the mill ceased working commercially on the death of the last miller in 1947.[tpl]cite book | first =R J | last = Brown| year = 1976| title = Windmills of England | pages= 182| publisher = Robert Hale Ltd| location = London | isbn = 0-7091-5641-3[/tpl]
The mill passed to Mr S C Sullivan,(1908-1997)The son of A S Aldred, who placed the mill in the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1951.  The mill is currently owned by Stephen and Jonathan Sullivan (ensuring the Mill has been in the ownership of the same family since 1873) The mill was completely rebuilt between 1957 and 1960 under the supervision of Jesse Wightman. A replacement crowntree was obtained from a windmill at Wetheringsett which had been demolished. The mill has been in the care of English Heritage since 1984 [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001001001013003007008 |title=Saxtead Green Post Mill |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=2008-10-23[/tpl]
