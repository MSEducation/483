A later study using a larger patient population reports no change in the cortical thickness in migraine sufferers.Datte R,  Detre JA et al. Absence of changes in cortical thickness in patients with migraine.Cephalagia 2011.Oct 31(14).PMID 21911412
A genetic disorder of the cerebral cortex, whereby increased folding in certain areas results in a microgyrus, where there are four layers instead of six, is in some instances seen to be related to dyslexia.Habib M (December 2000). "The neurological basis of developmental dyslexia: an overview and working hypothesis". Brain 123 (Pt 12): 2373–99. doi:10.1093/brain/123.12.2373. PMID 11099442.

==Function==

===Connections===

The cerebral cortex is connected to various subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia, sending information to them along efferent connections and receiving information from them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is routed to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information, however, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex). The vast majority of connections are from one area of the cortex to another, rather than to subcortical areas; Braitenberg and Schüz (1991) put the figure as high as 99%.Braitenberg, V and Schüz, A 1991.

The cortex is commonly described as comprising three parts: sensory, motor, and association areas.

===Sensory areas===

The sensory areas are the areas that receive and process information from the senses. Parts of the cortex that receive sensory inputs from the thalamus are called primary sensory areas. The senses of vision, audition, and touch are served by the primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory cortex. In general, the two hemispheres receive information from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. For example the right primary somatosensory cortex receives information from the left limbs, and the right visual cortex receives information from the left visual field. The organization of sensory maps in the cortex reflects that of the corresponding sensing organ, in what is known as a topographic map. Neighboring points in the primary visual cortex, for example, correspond to neighboring points in the retina. This topographic map is called a retinotopic map. In the same way, there exists a tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and a somatotopic map in the primary sensory cortex. This last topographic map of the body onto the posterior central gyrus has been illustrated as a deformed human representation, the somatosensory homunculus, where the size of different body parts reflects the relative density of their innervation. Areas with lots of sensory innervation, such as the fingertips and the lips, require more cortical area to process finer sensation.

===Motor areas===

The motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cortex. They are shaped like a pair of headphones stretching from ear to ear. The motor areas are very closely related to the control of voluntary movements, especially fine fragmented movements performed by the hand. The right half of the motor area controls the left side of the body, and vice versa.
Two areas of the cortex are commonly referred to as motor:
In addition, motor functions have been described for:
Just underneath the cerebral cortex are interconnected subcortical masses of grey matter called basal ganglia (or nuclei).  The basal ganglia receive input from the substantia nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the cerebral cortex, and send signals back to both of these locations.  They are involved in motor control.  They are found lateral to the thalamus. The main components of the basal ganglia are the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus. The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus, because together they form a lens-shaped body.  The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus striatum after their striped appearance.Saladin, Kenneth. Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function, 5th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, 2010. Print.Dorland’s Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2008.

===Association areas===

Association areas function to produce a meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes - all located in the posterior part of the cortex - organize sensory information into a coherent perceptual model of our environment centered on our body image. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as abstract thought. In the past it was theorized that language abilities are localized in the left hemisphere in areas 44/45, the Broca's area, for language expression and area 22, the Wernicke's area, for language reception. However, language is no longer limited to easily identifiable areas. More recent research suggests that the processes of language expression and reception occur in areas other than just those structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, pons, and the caudate nucleus.
The association areas integrate information from different receptors or sensory areas and relate the information to past experiences. Then the brain makes a decision and sends nerve impulses to the motor areas to give responses.

==Clinical significance==

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Lafora disease, show as a marker, an atrophy of the grey matter of the cerebral cortex.Ortolano S and Vieitez I et al. Loss of cortical neurons underlies the neuropathology of Lafora disease. Mol Brain 2014;7:7. PMCID:PMC3917365

==In other animals==

The cerebral cortex is derived from the pallium, a layered structure found in the forebrain of all vertebrates.  The basic form of the pallium is a cylindrical layer enclosing fluid-filled ventricles.  Around the circumference of the cylinder are four zones, the dorsal pallium, medial pallium, ventral pallium, and lateral pallium, which are thought respectively to give rise to the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory cortex.
Until recently no counterpart to the cerebral cortex had been recognized in invertebrates.  However, a study published in the journal Cell in 2010, based on gene expression profiles, reported strong affinities between the cerebral cortex and the mushroom bodies of ragworms.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Tomer|first1=R|last2=Denes|first2=AS|last3=Tessmar-Raible|first3=K|last4=Arendt|first4=D |author8=Tomer R, Denes AS, Tessmar-Raible K, Arendt D|title=Profiling by image registration reveals common origin of annelid mushroom bodies and vertebrate pallium |journal=Cell |year=2010 |volume=142|issue=5|pmid=20813265 |pages=800–809 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.043[/tpl]  Mushroom bodies are structures in the brains of many types of worms and arthropods that are known to play important roles in learning and memory; the genetic evidence indicates a common evolutionary origin, and therefore indicates that the origins of the earliest precursors of the cerebral cortex date back to the early Precambrian era.
