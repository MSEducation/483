CATEGORIES: Dams completed in 1971, Dams in Western Australia, Darling Range

South Dandalup Dam is a dam in Western Australia. It is located where the South Dandalup River flows out of Lake Banksiadale. The dam was built in 1971 in response to rapid population growth in Perth, Western Australia's capital city, and a resources boom in the Pilbara.
With a reservoir capacity of 137.7 GL, it is the second-largest dam providing water to Perth. It has a catchment area of [tpl]convert|311|km2[/tpl], a surface area of [tpl]convert|21|km2[/tpl] at full storage, and a reservoir length of [tpl]convert|22|km[/tpl]. The dam itself is an earthfilled embankment dam, [tpl]convert|43|m[/tpl] high and [tpl]convert|268|m[/tpl] wide.
Located only [tpl]convert|6|km[/tpl] north-east of the historic town of Dwellingup, and around [tpl]convert|90|km[/tpl] from Perth, it is a popular recreation area. Western Australia's Water Corporation manages the area, and has provided facilities including picnic areas with gas barbecues, and a number of walk trails.
