Otto von HabsburgOtto was born as His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke and Imperial Prince Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, and became the Crown Prince of these countries in 1916. After 1918, titles of nobility were formally abolished in Austria, thus von Habsburg turned into Habsburg. The same applied after Habsburg became a German citizen (see Printausgabe der deutschen Wochenzeitung die Zeit vom 21 July 2011, p.36). By courtesy, he would also be referred to by European courts by his former style and title, i.e. as His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke Otto of Austria. In the Austrian republic, the authorities referred to him, from 1919, as Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, a name he never used himself. However, Otto did not live in Austria after 1918 and his citizenship there was revoked by Adolf Hitler in 1941, making him stateless. His Austrian citizenship was only restored in 1965. Otto later became a citizen of or was issued passports of multiple other countries, where his official name was Otto von Habsburg. As a Member of the European Parliament for Germany, his official name in the European Union was Otto von Habsburg. On his website, he used the style and name His Imperial and Royal Highness Dr. Otto von Habsburg.

He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007.
The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke and Imperial Prince Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia. With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was himself likely to become the Emperor. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful Emperor-King from 1922.[tpl]Cite news|title=Death of former 'kaiser in exile' and last heir to Austro-Hungarian throne|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0705/1224300090924.html|date=4 July 2011|newspaper=The Irish Times|accessdate=5 July 2011|first=Derek|last=Scally[/tpl]
Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration—being thoroughly disgusted with nationalism—and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism.Kaiser-Sohn Otto von Habsburg gestorben Deutsche Welle, 4 July 2011 [tpl]de icon[/tpl] He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian anti-Nazi resistance.[tpl]cite web|author= Tibor Pásztory |url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/meinungen/gastkommentare/289459_Die-beliebtesten-Irrtuemer-zur-Monarchie.html |title=Die beliebtesten Irrtümer zur Monarchie  |publisher=Wienerzeitung.at |accessdate=16 July 2011[/tpl] After the 1938 Anschluss, monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria, and—sentenced to death by the Nazis—Otto fled to the United States, with a visa issued by Aristides de Sousa Mendes.
Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the International Paneuropean Union, and served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) 1979–1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain during his tenure. Otto von Habsburg played a central role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the Pan-European Picnic. Later he would be a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2474&Itemid=1 |title=The Budapest Times - Hungary‘s leading English Language source for daily news |publisher=Budapesttimes.hu |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2011[/tpl] A noted intellectual, he has published several books on historical and political affairs.

Otto was exiled in 1918 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch. During his life in exile, he lived in Switzerland, Madeira, Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in Bavaria (Germany), in the residence Villa Austria. At the time of his death, he was a citizen of Germany, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, having earlier been stateless de jure and de facto and possessed passports of Monaco, the Order of Malta, and Spain.
His funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on 16 July 2011; he was subsequently entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna and his heart buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary.

==Early life==

Otto was born at Villa Wartholz in Reichenau an der Rax, Austria-Hungary. He was baptised Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xavier Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius on 25 November 1912 at Villa Wartholz by the Prince-Archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Franz Xaver Nagl. His godfather was the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria (represented by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria); his godmother was his grandmother Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal.Wiener Zeitung, 26 November 1912.
In November 1916, Otto became Crown Prince of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia when his father, Archduke Charles, acceded to the throne. However, in 1918, at the end of the First World War, the monarchies were abolished, the Republics of Austria and Hungary founded instead, and the family was forced into exile in Madeira.[tpl]cite news|last=Scally|first=Derek|title=Death of former 'kaiser in exile' and last heir to Austro-Hungarian throne|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0705/1224300090924.html|accessdate=29 September 2011|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=5 July 2011[/tpl]  Hungary did become a kingdom again, but Charles was never to regain the throne. Instead, Miklós Horthy ruled as regent until 1944, in a kingdom without a king.
He spoke German, Hungarian, Croatian, English, Spanish, French and Latin fluently. In later life, he would write some 40 books in German, Hungarian, French and Spanish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110704-36065.html|title=Otto von Habsburg, heir to Austria's last emperor, dies at 98|publisher=The Local|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] His mother made him learn many languages because she believed he one day might rule over many lands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789670,00.html|title=Habsburg Empire: Clown Prince|publisher=TIME|date=11 March 1940|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Warren|first=David|title=The Europe that might have been|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/Europe+that+might+have+been/5055722/story.html|accessdate=29 September 2011|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=10 July 2011[/tpl]

==Years in exile==

Otto's family spent the subsequent years in Switzerland, and on the Portuguese island of Madeira, where Charles died prematurely in 1922, leaving the 9-year-old Otto pretender to the throne. On his father's deathbed, his mother, then-Empress Dowager Zita, told the 9-year-old, "your father is now sleeping the eternal sleep—you are now Emperor and King".[tpl]cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/675151/Habsburgs-Erbe-zerfiel-und-erlebte-dennoch-eine-Renaissance?_vl_backlink=/home/politik/innenpolitik/index.do |title=Habsburgs Erbe zerfiel und erlebte dennoch eine Renaissance |publisher=Diepresse.com |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011[/tpl] The family eventually relocated to the Basque town of Lekeitio, where 40 Spanish grandees bought them a villa. Meanwhile, the Austrian parliament had officially expelled the Habsburg dynasty and confiscated all the official property (Habsburg Law of 3 April 1919).
In 1935, he graduated with a PhD degree in Political and Social Sciences from the University of Louvain in Belgium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/europe/otto-hapsburg-eldest-son-of-austrias-last-emperor-dies-at-98 |title=Otto Hapsburg, eldest son of Austria's last emperor, dies at 98  |publisher=Thenational.ae |accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] From his father's death throughout the remainder of his time in exile, Otto considered himself the rightful emperor of Austria and stated this on many occasions. In 1937 he wrote,Gedächtnisjahrbuch 1937, 9. Jg.: Dem Andenken an Karls von Österreich Kaiser und König. Arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichischer Vereine – Wien, W. Hamburger 1937 “I know very well that the overwhelming majority of the Austrian population would like me to assume the heritage of the peace emperor, my beloved father, rather earlier than later. (...) The Austrian people have never cast a vote in favor of the republic. They have remained silent as long as they were exhausted from the long fight, and taken by surprise by the audacity of the revolutionaries of 1918 and 1919. They shook off their resignation when they realized that the revolution had raped their right to life and freedom. (...) Such trust places a heavy burden on me. I accept it readily. God willing, the hour of reunion between the Duke and the people will arrive soon.” 
He continued to enjoy considerable public support in Austria; from 1931 to 1938, 1,603 Austrian municipalities named Otto an honorary citizen.Heinz Arnberger, Winfried R. Garscha, Rudolf G. Ardelt, Christa Mitterrutzner, Anschluß 1938, Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes, Österreichischer Bundesverlag, 1988, ISBN 3-215-06824-9

===Nominal King of Hungary===

In 1920 Admiral Miklós Horthy overthrew the Hungarian republic and established a kingdom with himself as regent for the Habsburgs. Horthy made it clear that he did not wish the old king to take up his old position, and after his father's death, Otto was the nominal king, albeit still in exile. In the late 1920s, when Otto came of age, there was talk about him indeed taking up his position. On the advice of the Admiral, he decided not to do so.

==World War II==

Otto strongly opposed the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany. In 1938 he requested Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg to resist the Nazis and supported an international intervention, and offered to return from exile to take over the reins of government in order to repel Hitler.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/royalty-obituaries/8616240/Archduke-Otto-von-Habsburg.html |title=Archduke Otto von Habsburg |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 4 July 2011|accessdate=6 July 2011 |location=London[/tpl] According to Gerald Warner, "Austrian Jews were among the strongest supporters of a Habsburg restoration, since they believed the dynasty would give the nation sufficient resolve to stand up to the Third Reich".[tpl]cite news|last=Warner |first=Gerald |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/5774579/Otto_von_Habsburgs_96th_birthday_telescopes_European_history/ |title=Otto von Habsburg's 96th birthday telescopes European history  |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2011 |location=London[/tpl]

The leaders of the Austrian legitimist movement, i.e. supporters of Otto, were arrested by the Nazis and largely executed (Stefan Zweig's novella The Royal Game is based on these events). Otto's cousins Max, Duke of Hohenberg, and Prince Ernst of Hohenberg were arrested in Vienna by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau concentration camp where they remained throughout Nazi rule.  Fortunately for Otto von Habsburg and his entire family, they were able to obtain visas from the Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, which saved their lives.http://sousamendesfoundation.org/habsburg/  Otto was involved in helping around 15,000 Austrians,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9o8qcb00/otto-von-habsburg-oldest-son-of-austria-hungarys-last-emperor-dies-at-age-98.html |title=Otto von Habsburg, oldest son of Austria-Hungary's last emperor, dies at age 98  |publisher=Newser |accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] including thousands of Austrian Jews, flee the country at the beginning of the Second World War.http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/obituaries/otto-von-habsburg-1.1110433
During his exile in the US, Otto along with his younger brothers was in direct contact with President Roosevelt and the federal government. Otto tried to found an "Austrian Battalion" in the US Army, which was delayed and never actually happened. Nevertheless Otto successfully tried to avoid the bombardment of Austrian cities, especially the capital, Vienna, which were consequently delayed by high-ranking commanding personnel; bombardments on Vienna began later in the war (1943). Otto tried hard to set symbolic steps for the will of Austria and Austrians to be free, independent and democratic. Also Otto advised the US government that after the war there should be great concerns about Austria becoming a Soviet satellite state. Otto was commonly known in the US as "Otto of Austria", trying to keep Austria and its neighbors in the minds of the American people via starting a series of stamps (the Overrun Countries series) containing the German occupied nations of Europe and much more. 
Rudolf Hess ordered that Otto was to be executed immediately if caught.Omeidl "Rudolf Hess, der Stellvertreter des Führers, hatte den deutschen Invasionstruppen für das neutrale Belgien den Befehl erteilt, Otto von Habsburg und seine Brüder, falls sie gefasst würden, ohne jedes weitere Verfahren sofort zu erschießen." http://www.omeidl.com/monarch.html After the German invasion of France the family left the French capital and fled to Portugal with a visa issued by Aristides de Sousa Mendes, the Portuguese consul in Bordeaux. For his own safety, he left the European continent and lived from 1940 to 1944 in Washington, D.C. In his wartime exile in the United States, he worked to stop or limit the bombing campaign against Austria. In the United States, he initiated the Austrian Day and was able to get Austria included in a postage stamp series on "Occupied Nations". He obtained the support of Winston Churchill for a conservative "Danube Federation", in effect a restoration of Austria-Hungary, but Joseph Stalin put an end to these plans. He lobbied for the recognition of an Austrian government-in-exile, for the rights of the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, against the deportation of the German-speaking inhabitants of Bohemia and eastern Europe, and against letting Stalin rule Eastern Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.die-tagespost.de/Sie-nannten-ihn-bdquo-Otto-von-Europa-ldquo-;art456,125800 |title=Sie nannten ihn 'Otto von Europa' |publisher=Die-tagespost.de |accessdate=8 July 2011[/tpl]
In 1941, Adolf Hitler personally revoked the citizenship of Otto, his mother, and his siblings, and the imperial-royal family found themselves stateless.Stephan Baier, Eva Demmerle: Otto von Habsburg. Die Biografie. Amalthea, Wien 2002, ISBN 3-85002-486-5, p. 122.

==After World War II==

At the end of the war, Otto returned to Europe and lived for some years in France and Spain.
In 1949, he ennobled several people, granting them Austrian noble titles, although not recognized by the Austrian republic. As he did not possess a passport and was effectively stateless, he was given a passport of the Principality of Monaco, thanks to the intervention of Charles de Gaulle in 1946. As a Knight of Malta, the Order also issued him a diplomatic passport. Later, he was also given a Spanish diplomatic passport.http://www.kathweb.at/site/nachrichten/database/40510.html
On 8 May 1956, Otto was recognized as an Austrian citizen by the provincial government of Lower Austria.Oliver Meidl: Monarch. A Life for Europe - Republican Recognition in Black and Yellow.  "Ottos Anwalt verfassten Text vom 21. Februar 1958, in dem es heißt: "Um in meine Heimat zurückkehren zu können, erkläre ich im eigenen Namen und im Namen meiner Gemahlin und meiner minderjährigen Kinder als österreichischer Staatsbürger, die derzeit in Österreich geltenden Gesetze anzuerkennen und mich als getreuer Bürger der Republik zu bekennen." July 2011 http://www.omeidl.com/monarch.html  The Austrian Interior Ministry approved this declaration of Citizenship, but on the condition that he accept the name Dr. Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, on 8 February 1957. But this only entitled him to a passport "valid in every country but Austria".Gedenkdienst Archive Zur Geschichte der „Habsburger-Gesetze“ http://www.gedenkdienst.at/index.php?id=679  Otto had already submitted a written statement, on 21 February 1958, that he and his family would renounce all privileges formerly entitled a member of the House of Habsburg, but this first declaration did not satisfy the requirements of the Habsburg Law, which stated that Otto and other descendants of Charles could only return to Austria if they renounced all royal claims and accepted the status of private citizens.  He officially declared his loyalty to the Republic of Austria on 5 June 1961, but this statement was ruled insufficient as well.
In a declaration dated 31 May 1961, Otto renounced all claims to the Austrian throne and proclaimed himself "a loyal citizen of the republic", a move that he made only after much hesitation and certainly "for purely practical reasons".Brook-Shepherd, pg. 181 In a 2007 interview on the occasion of his approaching 95th birthday, Otto stated:
The Austrian administrative court found on 24 May 1963 that Otto's statement was sufficient to meet this requirement.  His wife and he were then issued a Certified Proof of Citizenship on 20 July 1965.  However, several elements in the country, particularly the Socialists, were ill-disposed to welcoming back the heir of the deposed dynasty. This touched off political infighting and civil unrest that almost precipitated a crisis of state, and later became known as the "Habsburg Crisis." It was only on 1 June 1966, after the People's Party won an outright majority in the national election, that Otto was issued an Austrian passport, and was finally able to visit his home country again on 31 October 1966 for the first time in 48 years.  That day, he traveled to Innsbruck to visit the grave of Archduke Eugen of Austria. Later, he visited Vienna on 5 July 1967.Salzburger Nachrichten 1 June 1963 (German) http://www.omeidl.com/files/habsbg_articlesn63.jpgA Life for Europe:Republican Recognition in Black and Yellow "...Otto von Habsburg am 31.

In December 2006, he observed that, "The catastrophe of 11 September 2001 struck the United States more profoundly than any of us, whence a certain mutual incomprehension.

Although his speech received an ovation,ÖRF Online (German) http://sciencev1.orf.at/uhl/151021.html the Habsburgs were once again distanced from the popular opinion of the Austrian people, as demonstrated in public protest, media criticism and disapproval voiced by Austrian politicians.N-TV, 12 March 2008 (German) http://www.n-tv.de/politik/dossier/Oesterreich-arbeitet-auf-article255663.html  Social Democratic Party Defence Minister Norbert Darabos was quoted as saying that the remarks were "unacceptable", "a veritable democratic-political scandal" and that he had "insulted the victims of National Socialism". Otto von Habsburg was also quoted as saying that "a discussion as to whether Austria was an accomplice or a victim is an outrage".Tiroler Tageszeitung, 9 July 2011(German)  http://www.tt.com/csp/cms/sites/tt/Nachrichten/3029285-2/karl-habsburg-verteidigt-v%C3%A4terliche-aussage-%C3%BCber-opferrolle.csp

Murauer also recalled that Engelbert Dollfuß had been the only head of government in Europe to have been murdered by the Nazis. Murauer advised Darabos "to avoid populist pot-shots against an honourable European of the highest calibre."
