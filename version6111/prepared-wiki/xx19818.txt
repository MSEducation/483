==History==

Founded in Milan in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli, Pirelli initially specialised in rubber and derivative processes, and the company formerly made scuba diving rebreathers.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Coates, JK; Kincaid, TC; Lanphier, EH |title=Evaluation of the Pirelli Underwater Oxygen Breathing Equipment for Use in the Naval Service. |journal=Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-RR-2-52 |year=1952 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3393 |accessdate=16 March 2009 [/tpl] Effectively, Pirelli's activities are still primarily focused on the production of tyres and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group's name to Prysmian. It is said[tpl]by whom|date=May 2011[/tpl] that Giovanni and his brother, Francesco Pirelli will award the companies net worth to their grandson, Marcello; the favorite of the Pirelli billion-dollar family.
In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli commissioned the building of a famous Milanese skyscraper in the same area that housed the very first Pirelli factory during the 19th century: see Pirelli Tower.Skyscrapers, Antonino Terranova, White Star Publishers, 2003 (ISBN-8880952307)
In 1974, Pirelli invented the "wide radial tyre", upon a request from the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to withstand the power of the new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick tyres made with the cross ply technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10 km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.
Subsequently, Porsche started using the same tyres with the award-winning Porsche 911 Turbo.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Today,[tpl]when|date=May 2011[/tpl]  the wide tyres are still the standard in sport & racing cars in Europe.
In 2002 started production of clothing, watches, eyewear with brand Pirelli.[ref]

==Sponsorship==

===Football===

Pirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is well known for its long term primary sponsorship of the Italian football team Internazionale. Pirelli previously appeared as a sponsor on the shirts of the Maltese football club Valletta for a short time. Pirelli's sponsorship of football teams not only happens in Europe, South America is a key market and as a result successful clubs South America have been sponsored by the tyre company. The Brazilan team Palmeiras, Uruguayan team Peñarol and Argentinian side Vélez Sársfield both had Pirelli as a shirt sponsor. When English Football League Two side Burton Albion Football Club built their new stadium in 2005, Pirelli became the title sponsor the new ground. This was because the new stadium, named Pirelli Stadium lies next to the Pirelli factory in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. In 2009 Pirelli became the title sponsor of the Chinese Super League (CSL), China's top tier football league.

===Rally===

Pirelli also supports rally with their Pirelli Star Driver program as an initiative to support young rally drivers, organised by Pirelli and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

==Motorsport==

Pirelli is the only allowed tyre brand in the FIM World Superbike Championship since 2007 (along with its support classes, such as the Supersport World Championship).
Pirelli has also been awarded the contract for the control tyre supply in the British Superbike Championship from 2008 until at least 2010.British Superbikes 2007[tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Pirelli were also the official tyre supplier of the World Rally Championship replacing BF Goodrich for the 2008 season, with all cars using Pirelli tyres and wearing Pirelli decals until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula 1 commitments at the end of the 2010 season.
Pirelli is the sole tyre supplier in Formula One, following Bridgestone's decision to withdraw from the role at the end of [tpl]F1|2010[/tpl].[tpl]Cite news| title = Bridgestone to Cease Tire Supply to the FIA Formula One World Championship | url = http://bridgestone.com/corporate/news/2009110201.html | publisher = Bridgestone | date = 2 November 2009 | accessdate = 2 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=World Motor Sport Council: 23 June 2010|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_230610.aspx|work=fia.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Pirelli return to F1 after 20-year absence|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/06/23/pirelli-return-to-f1-after-20-year-absence/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl] Pirelli previously competed in Formula One from [tpl]F1|1950[/tpl]–[tpl]F1|1958[/tpl], [tpl]F1|1981[/tpl]–[tpl]F1|1986[/tpl] and [tpl]F1|1989[/tpl]–[tpl]F1|1991[/tpl].
Controversy surrounded Pirelli's Formula 1 tyres as at the 2013 British Grand Prix seven Pirelli tyres failed: Pérez twice, Alonso, Hamilton, Gutierrez, Vergne, and Massa. Following a safety car period drivers were instructed to stay off the kerbs that were later found to be "razor sharp" and may have been the cause, but the president of the British Racing Drivers' Club rejected the idea that the kerbs could be at fault, saying that "These kerbs have been in since 2009 and we have had thousands and thousands of cars go over these kerbs and they have been absolutely fine".http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23132957 The incidents were described as "unacceptable" by F1 drivers.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23118249 It was later suggested that the cause of the tyre failures could be the teams putting them on the wrong side of the car. Pirelli stressed that the tyres are of an asymmetrical construction and are not interchangeable, and that if they are used correctly, they do not pose a threat to safety.http://www.pirelli.com/tyre/ww/en/news/2013/07/02/pirelli-explanation-on-silverstone-facts-and-next-races/ However, the fault was ultimately found to be in Pirelli's design of the tyres so Pirelli changed the construction of the tyres to prevent further incidents.
Pirelli suffered further tyre problems at the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix. During the second practice two tyres failed: Vettel and Alonso. One senior figure at Pirelli described the failures as a "big concern", whilst Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery admitted the tyre failures were "a worry for the sport".http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23816972 Following these issues, just one day later Michelin announced that they could replace Pirelli as the tyre supplier for 2014. In October 2013 Fernando Alonso complained that "the quality of the tyres is very on the limit", and that they "will not do 5km". Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery said: "Of course Alonso is one of the great F1 drivers, so to hear such comments is disappointing and below the standards you would expect from such a champion.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24409735 In the Korean Grand Prix Pérez locked a front tyre heavily and then suffered a dramatic failure on the subsequent long straight.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24420547 Pirelli hit controversy at the Indian Grand Prix where they requested the teams run the tyres a limited number of laps due to their fragility. One senior engineer at a top team said this was the worst blistering ever experienced.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24690717
In pre-season testing for the 2014 season the tyre on Rosberg's car failed, sending Rosberg into a 200mph spin.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/25449812 The incident prompted considerable alarm, and Pirelli stated that the tyre "will not be proposed again".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/12472/9080138/pirelli-tyre-which-failed-on-rosbergs-car-was-prototype-that-wont-be-used-again | work=Sky Sports[/tpl] In January 2014, it was revealed that Pirelli had signed a contract with the FIA to supply tyres to Formula One for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/112150 | work=Autosport | date=16 January 2014[/tpl] The Pirelli 2014 wet tyre was criticised by Adrian Sutil as "the worst I have driven" and Jenson Button "twitchy" and "they take away that grip that they gave you".http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/26800835
