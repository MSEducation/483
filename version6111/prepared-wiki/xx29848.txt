</ref> a section by [[Russell T Davies]] says that during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the Time Lords used Bowships (used against the Great Vampires in an ancient war), Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms (war machines first mentioned in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel "[[Damaged Goods (Doctor Who novel)|Damaged Goods]]",<ref>

In "The End of Time", the Lord President is shown wearing a gauntlet with several powers, primarily the ability to disintegrate a target and the ability to reverse/revert changes made to the human race by the Master suggesting the ability to manipulate the timeline of objects or events. Physically this resembles the Resurrection Gauntlet from Torchwood and Davros' gauntlet from the Series 4 finale, but this may be coincidental. When Rassilon threw the white point star into the hologram of the Earth, the diamond was able to arrive to the planet by following the Master's signal, traveling through the Time locked war to the post-war universe.
Gallifreyan paintings were unique in that they were in 3D, as they acted as snapshots of a single moment in time by use of stasis cubes. This meant that they could be used as rudimentary time travel, by freezing a person inside a painting and then letting them out at the required point in time.

==History==

Details of the Time Lords' history within the show are sketchy and are fraught with supposition and contradiction. The Time Lords became the masters of time travel when one of their number, the scientist Omega, created an energy source to power their experiments in time.[ref]

Unfortunately, the star flared, first into a supernova, and then collapsed into a black hole. Omega was thought killed in that explosion but unknown to everyone, had somehow survived in an anti-matter universe beyond the black hole's singularity. Rassilon, the ultimate founder of Time Lord society, then took a singularity (assumed by fans and the spin-off media to be the same one as Omega's) and placed it beneath the Time Lords' citadel on Gallifrey. This perfectly balanced Eye of Harmony then served as the power source for their civilisation as well as their time machines. In "The Satan Pit", the Doctor states that his race "practically invented black holes. In fact, we did", presumably a reference to the singularity created by Omega.
At some point in their history the Time Lords interacted with the civilisation of the planet Minyos, giving them advanced technology (including the ability to "regenerate" to a limited degree, by rejuvenating their bodies when they grow too old). This met with disastrous results, (which is said by some to be the reason the Time Lords adopted a philosophy of "non-interference"). The Minyans destroyed themselves in a series of nuclear wars ("Underworld").This is said (by some) to have been the reason the Time Lords established a "non-interference" code.

As of the current series, the Time Lords have, according to the Doctor, all perished at the conclusion of a Time War with the Daleks, leaving the Doctor the sole survivor and the last of his race. It was also revealed by the Beast that the Doctor was responsible for the extinction of both races.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Satan Pit|series=Doctor Who[/tpl]
However, there may have been survivors other than the Doctor. The fate of Time Lady Romanadvoratrelundar (Romana) – a one-time companion of the Doctor – is unknown, as in her last appearance in the television series ("Warriors' Gate") she was in the parallel dimension of E-Space. In the episode "Gridlock", the Face of Boe told the Doctor with his dying breath that "you are not alone".[tpl]cite episode | title = Gridlock | episodelink = Gridlock (Doctor Who) | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Richard Clarke, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | city = Cardiff | airdate = 14 April 2007 [/tpl] In the episode "Utopia" the Doctor learns that the Master survived. The Doctor had failed to sense him because he had used a chameleon arch to turn himself into a human (as the Doctor did in "Human Nature"), while hiding at the end of the Universe. While the Master is commonly presumed to have been the one to whom the Face of Boe referred (the Master's pseudonym, Professor Yana, was an acronym of the Face of Boe's final message, "You are not alone." Y.A.N.A.), this also opens a possible plot hook for the similar survival of other Time Lords throughout time and space. The Master is supposed to have died during the events of "Last of the Time Lords"; shortly after having his plans of universal conquest foiled by the Doctor and his companion Martha Jones, the Master was shot by his human wife Lucy Saxon. He chose to repress his ability to regenerate and subsequently died, leaving the Doctor to mourn him and to burn his body on a pyre. However, a short scene at the end of the episode shows a female hand picking the Master's signet ring out of the ashes, while the Master's voice can be heard laughing in the background. The Master returns and plays a significant role in "The End of Time".[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In the episode "The Doctor's Daughter", after landing on planet Messaline the Doctor was forced to place his hand inside a progenation machine, which used his DNA to create a new soldier, to fight in the war taking place. The new female soldier – his daughter, Jenny, possesses the DNA of a Time Lord. While the Doctor argues that a Time Lord is more than simply genetics, he is impressed by the superhuman abilities she displays, and intelligence on par with his own. By the end of the episode he becomes more willing to accept her as his daughter and a Time Lord. Donna Noble also gains the mind of a Time Lord or at least part of the Doctor's. After being trapped on the TARDIS as it is about to be destroyed, she is drawn towards the Doctor's hand, which was severed in the 2005 Christmas special and loaded with unused energy from a partial regeneration (see "Journey's End", 2008). Touching the hand triggers the remaining regeneration process, and causes a second Doctor to be created, one who is part human, borrowing traits from Donna just as she absorbs part of his mind.
"The End of Time" saw their first appearance in character since the series returned. As Time Lord society began to lose its mortality during the Time War to the point of being feared, a resurrected Rassilon led the high council of Gallifrey in the final days and intended bring about the end of time while the Time Lords transcend to a state of pure consciousness. When the War Doctor took the Moment, a prophecy from the Time Lady 'the Visionary' was deciphered that he was going to wipe out the Time Lords with the Daleks. Refusing to accept this, Rassilon devised a method for Gallifrey to escape the Time Lock through the Master, whose madness was a result of a signal placed in his mind as a child, and a White Point Star, a flawless uncut diamond found only on Gallifrey. Though he appears on Earth in 2010, Rassilon's plan fails as the Tenth Doctor destroyed the machine maintaining the link with the Master following Rassilion back into the events of the Time War. However, as revealed The Day of the Doctor, Gallifrey was never destroyed at all, as the Moment and Clara Oswald managed to gather all thirteen incarnations of the Doctor together to place the planet in a sort of hidden stasis, out of sync with the rest of the universe, to make it appear as though the Time Lords perished along with the Daleks. The Time Lords later tried to return through a crack in time in "The Time of the Doctor," but while this ultimately failed, they intervened to change the Doctor's future by granting him a new regeneration cycle before closing the crack.
