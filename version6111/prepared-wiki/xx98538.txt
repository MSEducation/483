Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity also called "Sig Tau" is a U.S. college social fraternity founded on June 28, 1920 at University of Central Missouri (then known as Central Missouri State Teachers College). The fraternity was born out of the desires and aspirations of seventeen men in the belief that all men are social creatures and that friendships of college men are lasting ones. It rose as a result of friendships made while in the service of their country during World War I in France. By dedicating themselves to the highest ideals of manhood, brotherhood and citizenship, they would inspire thousands of men from all parts of the country who would follow in their footsteps.Bernier, William P. "Our Heritage" page 35. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.
In accordance with the founding of Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity at Central Missouri State Teachers College, the fraternity created new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers colleges (at the time also called "normal schools").  Since the fraternity's beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 140 university campuses across the United States.Bernier, William P. "Chapter Roll" page 120. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.

==History==

Four of the Founders; Emmett Ellis, Leland Thornton Hoback, Edward George Grannert, and William Glenn Parsons, had enlisted and served their country together during the First World War in France. Parsons commented that in founding the Fraternity they wanted to sustain a "sense of service, responsibility and affection for their companions." These four, together with Allen Ross Nieman, Edward Henry McCune, Carl Nelson Chapman, Buell Wright McDaniel, George Eugene Hartrick, A. Barney Cott, Chiles Edward Hoffman, Rodney Edward Herndon, William Edward Billings, Clarence Willard Salter, Frank H. Gorman, Alpheus Oliphant Fisher, and Daniel Frank Fisher, were the 17 founders of the Fraternity.Anson, Jack L., & Marchesani Jr., Robert F. "Sigma Tau Gamma" page III-136. Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, 20th Edition: 1991.
When they returned to school in the summer of 1920, the Normal School they knew had been elevated by the Missouri legislature to a 4-year college granting bachelors degrees.
Several of the founders were members of the Irving Literary Society, but they wanted to cut across the boundaries of this and other literary societies to form their new fraternity. They wanted the most desirable men from each to join. On the morning of June 28, 1920, "at an unusually early hour" according to the original minutes, a list containing the names of about thirty men was posted on the college bulletin board by Emmett Ellis with a request to meet that afternoon for what was, to them, an unknown purpose.
According to the minutes, "the notice had the proper effect and, as requested, there appeared a goodly number of men to learn what was in store for them." Founder Nieman, who had become familiar with fraternities while attending William Jewell College, was the principal organizer of the meeting. He explained the purpose of the meeting and told them what such an organization could mean to the men of the college. The men elected Leland Hoback temporary chairman and Emmett Ellis temporary secretary. They agreed to begin crafting the organization and adjourned until July 7, 1920.
The Founders were accompanied by Dr. Wilson C. Morris to present their petition to the faculty. Dr. Morris was a Sigma Nu in his college days and his influence was significant and the new Fraternity received recognition. Dr. Morris became the Fraternity's first honorary member and served the Alpha chapter at Central Missouri as patron, counselor, and advisor until his death in 1947.Bernier, William P. "Our Heritage" page 36. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.Dinsmore, Keith C. "In The Month of Roses", p. 5. The SAGA of Sigma Tau Gamma, Summer 1970
In the fall of 1920 a ceremony for initiation of new members was written and the chapter of 17 grew to 31 by its first anniversary in 1921. Founder Edward H. McCune recalled later that, "from the very beginning, Sigma Tau Gamma prospered, both in membership and service. Its challenge to students to live well and promote the spirit of brotherhood was continually being met by those who were seeking membership."Bernier, William P. "Our Heritage" page 37. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.

==Fraternity organization==

===College chapters===

The principal unit in the organization of the Fraternity is the college chapter. Delegates from the college chapters comprise the major part of the Grand Chapter, having the ultimate authority and responsibility for the Fraternity.Bernier, William P. "Our Governance" page 73. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition: 2004.

===Alumni chapters===

Alumni members living in a geographic area may organize an alumni chapter for the purpose of maintaining social ties with other members and continue their activity in the Fraternity. Alumni chapters are chartered by the Fraternity and send a delegate to the Grand Chapter. Unlike an alumni association, which includes alumni from a single college chapter, an alumni chapter includes alumni in a particular region, from any college chapter.Bernier, William P. "Our Governance" page 76. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition: 2004.

===Grand Chapter===

Sigma Tau Gamma is organized into a Grand Chapter. The body of the Grand Chapter meets biennially and is the supreme legislative authority of the Fraternity. Representatives of the collegiate chapters, alumni chapters, alumni associations, members of the Board of Directors, past presidents of the Fraternity, and members of the Society of Seventeen are voting delegates of the Grand Chapter. 
The Grand Chapter has the authority to legislate for the good of the Fraternity and to adopt and amend the Constitution and Laws. Through the acts voted upon at the Grand Chapter meeting, voting delegates determine the broad policies of the Fraternity.
Board of Directors The Board of Directors is the governing body elected by the Grand Chapter, and is made up of the president, president-elect, four directors at large, and the two immediate past presidents. An executive vice president is employed by the Board of Directors and is the chief executive officer. He directs the professional staff of the Sigma Tau Gamma Headquarters who in turn direct the efforts of volunteer staff that support the regions, advisors, and chapters of the Fraternity.
The Sigma Tau Gamma Foundation exists to support the programs of the Fraternity. It is governed by a 18 member Board of Trustees that is elected by the Fraternity Board of Directors. The Executive Vice President of the Fraternity serves in a similar role for the Foundation.

==Membership==

All members of Sigma Tau Gamma fall into 1 of 3 classes according to Article 3 of the Constitution: Collegiate Members, Alumni Members, or Honorary Members. Any male student that is regularly enrolled in a college at which a collegiate chapter of Sigma Tau Gamma exists is eligible for membership, provided he is not a member of another North-American Interfraternity Conference fraternity.

===Path of Principles===

The Path of Principles is the lifelong member development program of Sigma Tau Gamma. 
New collegiate members of the Fraternity are titled Associate Members. Associate members will organize themselves into a model chapter, with meetings, officers, events, and standards that parallel that of the full chapter. Using the first four weeks of membership as an opportunity to practice membership.
After the initial four weeks, associate members participate in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Degree of the Ritual of Initiation ("Initiation" for short) and are elevated to the status of Brother. At this time they become full members excepting one capacity- to hold appointed or elected office in a chapter. Newly initiated brothers may now attend and participate in chapter meetings, but for another four weeks they will also continue practicing good membership in the associate model chapter.
Eight total weeks having past, four as associates and four as brothers, the new members have sufficiently practiced membership to become fully capable members. The 4th Degree of the Ritual of Initiation (the "4th Degree" for short) is conducted and members are elevated to the level of "Leader", the first of 17 levels of the Path of Principles. Having attained the first level, the member may now wear a Ritual stole during appropriate ceremonies
For the remainder of his time as a college member, and throughout his life as an alumnus, a member of Sigma Tau Gamma continues his progress through the Path of Principles by attaining new levels. Titles are bestowed to members that continue quality, principle-based involvement in the Fraternity after reaching new levels. To advance 1 level, a member must complete tasks associated with each of the six principles. While in college, those tasks may include attaining a high grade point average or serving in a chapter office. As an alumnus, they may include advising a chapter or remaining involved with an alumni association. 

===Rituals===

Sigma Tau Gamma utilizes ceremonies, both public and private, to mark the progress of members through important milestones of membership. Ritualists wear the Sigma Tau Gamma Ritual stole during the ceremonies.

==Foundation==

The Sigma Tau Gamma Foundation, Inc. was organized December 10, 1966 and established as an educational foundation qualified as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity.Bernier, William P. "Our Heritage" page 46. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition: 2004.
The Sigma Tau Gamma Foundation awards scholarships for undergraduate and graduate study, primarily with restricted funding designated for particular chapters named Chapter Heritage Funds. Alumni Associations help administrate the disbursement of Chapter Heritage Funds.http://sigmataugamma.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=28&Itemid=91
The Foundation is also particularly active in supporting citizenship and leadership development programs through the use of funding from the Chain of Honor Annual Fund.http://sigmataugamma.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=27&Itemid=90

===BACCHUS===

In 1986, delegates to the Michael J. Steinbeck Grand Chapter in St. Louis, Missouri adopted BACCHUS (Boosting Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of University Students) as Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity's official philanthropy.Bernier, William P. "Our Traditions" page 71. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.
Dr. Gerardo M. Gonzalez, President and Founder of BACCHUS, was initiated as an honorary member of Alpha Chapter (University of Central Missouri) in 1982. He is an Honorary Sigma Tau Gamma Foundation Trustee.

===Books For Kids===

In 1994, under the leadership of past Foundation President, Ken Hoover, Books For Kids is a charitable project created by the Sigma Tau Gamma Foundation that was created as a project that would tie the fraternity back to its educational heritage.
After two successful years, the Board of Directors decided that due to the tremendous success of the Books For Kids project, they would make it the national philanthropy of Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity.
As of 2004, Books For Kids has donated over 28,000 books and $30,000 to the public libraries and school districts of the region selected to host the fraternity's annual National Convention.

===Special Olympics===

On June 30, 2011, the Board of directors announced that Special Olympics is the new national philanthropy of Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity.

==Recognition and honors==

Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity recognizes both individual and group achievement each year at the annual Awards Banquet held as the concluding event to the Grand Chapter (in even number years) and the Strategic Leadership Conference (held in odd number years).

===Collegiate member awards===

===Alumni member awards===

===Chapter awards===

Chapter awards recognize those college chapters that exemplify the Principle of Excellence. Most chapter awards measure chapter performance during the academic year. This time period does not coincide with the term of the chapter executive board, as it is generally elected in November and takes office in December. Thus the awards are designed to assess a chapter, and not simply the quality of a particular set of officers. Most awards are not judged by a panel or committee. Rather, they are earned by McCune Metrics score achievement.http://sigmataugamma.theginsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8&Itemid=26
