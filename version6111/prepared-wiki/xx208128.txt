Belmont Middle School is a public middle school in the Gaston County Schools school district located in Belmont, North Carolina, United States.
The campus of Belmont Middle School is one of only five sites in the United States of "The Spirit of the Fighting Yank," a sculpture by Ernest Moore Viquesney. Based on the original created in 1943, this cast-zinc statue portrays a determined-looking GI carrying a Thompson sub-machine gun by his left side (later lost in the case of this statue, now sporting a wooden block), about to lob a grenade with his right hand. While Viquesney produced many GI-themed pieces with the coming of World War II, most of them were miniatures and this was the only one produced as a life-size monument. It is believed to have been cast by the Raphael Groppi Studio of Chicago, Illinois. This particular statue was dedicated in 1946 after Viquesney's death.Spirit of the Fighting Yank - Belmont, NC, retrieved on 2009-05-10.WWII Monument in Belmont, NC, retrieved on 2008-07-26.
