==Biography==

===Early life===

Bosé was born in San Fernando Hospital in Panama City, Panama, the son of Italian actress Lucia Bosè (real name Lucia Borloni) and bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguín (real name Luis Miguel González Lucas). He is also a cousin of Carmen Ordóñez. He grew up in an environment surrounded by art and culture. Close friends of his family were Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway. His godfather was Luchino Visconti and Pablo Picasso was the godfather of his sister Paola Dominguin.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hola.com/biografias/miguel-bose/ |title=Noticias, fotos y biografía de Miguel Bosé |first= |last=|work=hola.com |year=2012|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] The love of his life was Sasha Sökol, a Mexican singer whom he was never able to marry due to the difficulties of his career.

==Career==

Propelled by his famous family and their friends, in 1971, Bosé started a career as an actor, participating in various movies. He quickly won spots on the basis of his talent and good looks alone, rather than his name, and he did study serious acting as well as dancing and singing. However, he did not make that many films, and in 1975 he decided a career change was due and started exploring his talents as a singer. With the assistance of Camilo Blanes he recorded his first singles. Two years later, in 1977, Bosé signed a contract with CBS Records, and he remained with them until 1984.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p28991 |title=Miguel Bosé | AllMusic |first=Zac |last=Johnson |work=allmusic.com |year=2012|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] Between 1977 and 1982, Bosè was a major teen idol in Italy, Spain and Southern Europe in general. He had 7 top ten hits in a disco/new wave trend that earned him a secure spot in every televised song festival held in the aforementioned countries, but, by 1983, his star had severely waned in Italy, and he rarely performed there again until the 2000s, retreating to Latin American markets instead.
In 1983, 1984, and 1985, he participated in the "Llena Tu Cabeza De Rock" television specials on Puerto Rico WAPA-TV. But it was in 1985 that he became an international superstar, when his song "Amante bandido" rose to the top of the charts all over Latin America and in Spain, while he started to decline in Italy (where he had a parallel career, singing in both Italian and English - he would go back to the top there in 1994, by winning Festivalbar (the second musical event after the Sanremo Music Festival) for the third time). The video to that song also became one of the most widely seen Spanish music videos, with Bose playing both a Superman style superhero and an Indiana Jones type of adventurer in it.

===2007: Papito===

In 2007, to celebrate his 30 years as a singer, he released Papito, an album that contains remakes of his previous songs, re-interpreted in duets with Juanes, Alejandro Sanz, Fangoria (band), Ivete Sangalo, Laura Pausini, Shakira, Julieta Venegas, Ricky Martin, Amaia Montero (past member of the Spanish band La Oreja de Van Gogh), and Michael Stipe from R.E.M., along with many other singers. Three singles were released off Papito: the first is a re-make of his hit "Nena", featuring Mexican superstar Paulina Rubio; the second was "Morena Mía", with Julieta Venegas. The third single "Como un lobo" featured his niece Bimba Bosé. "Nena" was by far the most successful single off the album, since it was nominated for a Latin Grammy for best song, and became the best selling download of Spain in 2007.
In 2008, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe offered him Colombian citizenship because of his efforts towards peace in Colombia, including his participation in two concerts in 2008. On March 16 of 2010 he received Colombian citizenship during a ceremony in the presidential palace, Casa de Nariño.

===2012: Papitwo===

After several "clues" the artist gave on Twitter, he launched on September 4, 2012 the album Papitwo, a continuation of his successful Papito, remaking well-known songs of his career, counting again with artist such as Juanes in "Partisano", Bimba Bosé in "Shoot Me In The Back" and Alejandro Sanz in "Te Comería El Corazón" and adding new collaborations with singers such as Pablo Alborán in "Puede Que", Juan Luis Guerra in "Creo En Ti", Tiziano Ferro in "Amiga", Jovanotti in "Mirarte", Malú in his first hit "Linda" (first single in Spain), Joaquín Sabina in "Sol Forastero", Ximena Sariñana in "Aire Soy" (first single in America) and Dani Martín in "Te Digo Amor", among others. The Hollywood actress Penélope Cruz collaborated in the non-released song "Decirnos Adiós", composed by her brother to Bosé.
The album has two versions, a single one with 14 previous hits remade with different artists and a deluxe one, with another CD containing 14 collaborations that Bosé has made with singers during his career like Hombres G with "Lo Noto", Raphael with "Morir de Amor", Natalia Lafourcade with "Si No Pueden Quererte", Spanknox with "Wrong In The Right Way", between others.
The album was released simultaneously with the tour "Papitwo", which Bosé started in Madrid.
Miguel Bosé will be honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year on November 20, 2013.Miguel Bosé Named 2013 Latin Recording Academy Person Of The Year
