==History==

Cvent was founded in September 1999 by Reggie Aggarwal. That same year it received $17 million in venture capital and grew its staff to 125 employees. Following the dot-com bubble burst and the September 11 attacks, Cvent faced near-bankruptcy and was forced to cut 80% of its staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/20/there-and-back-again-how-cvents-founder-stood-by-his-company-for-better-or-bankruptcy/|title=There And Back Again – How Cvent’s Founder Stood By His Company, For Better Or Bankruptcy|work=TechCrunch|date=July 20, 2011[/tpl]
