Bram Moolenaar (born 1961, in Lisse, province of Zuid-Holland, Netherlands) is an active member of the open source software community. He is the author of Vim,[tpl]cite book|last1=Rehman|first1=Rafeeq Ur|last2=Paul|first2=Christopher|title=The Linux development platform: configuring, using, and maintaining a complete programming environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1velOihOTIwC&pg=PA37|accessdate=30 March 2011|year=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=978-0-13-009115-4|pages=37–[/tpl] a text editor that is very popular among programmers and power users.
The Vim editor started as "Vi IMitation" on the Amiga in 1988, but was later relabeled "Vi IMproved"[tpl]cite web|url=http://moolenaar.net/vimstory.pdf |title=The continuing story of Vim |publisher=Moolenaar.net |accessdate=2012-11-13[/tpl] and ported to many other platforms. As vi was a popular editor amongst programmers and system administrators, there initially was doubt whether Bram's 'improved' version could achieve the quality and fan following of the original. But since its first release for Unix systems in 1992, Vim has effectively eclipsed the original Vi, having won several awards[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moolenaar.net/vim.html#awards |title=Vim |publisher=Moolenaar.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl] and has been referred to as one of the most popular text editors.[tpl]cite web|author=Jacob Gube |url=http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/the-15-most-popular-text-editors-for-developers/ |title=The 15 Most Popular Text Editors for Developers |publisher=Sixrevisions.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tuxarena.blogspot.com/2009/04/14-most-popular-text-editors-for-linux.html |title=14 Most Popular Text Editors for Linux | TuxArena Blog |publisher=Tuxarena.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/385929/best-text-editors |title=Best Text Editors |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl]
Bram promotes charity and encourages people to support orphans in Uganda. He pioneered a methodology called charityware through his Vim editor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4657?page=0,3|title=Algorithms in Africa|last=Marshall|first=Wayne|date=1 January 2001|work=Linux Journal|accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl] The software itself is available for free, but it encourages the user to donate to the programmer's favorite charity. A number of other applications have been licensed this way since the inception of this concept.
Other software tools that Moolenaar has developed include a software build tool written in Python, called A-A-P, which is similar to make, and a programming language called ZimbuMoolenaar, B., "the Zimbu programming language", Retrieved on March 16 2014 which puts an emphasis on readability of programs.  Bram is also an assurer for the non-profit certificate authority CAcert, which means that he is eligible to verify the identities of people using the CAcert web of trust model. Amongst all of Moolenaar's contributions to the field of computer science, the Vim editor remains his most prominent and a widely used application.
Moolenaar has been a member of a Dutch Unix user group, NLUUG, which presented him with an award[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.moolenaar.net/#Award|title=NLUUG Award|date=2008|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl] during its 25th anniversary, for his creation of Vim and his contributions to open source software in general.
