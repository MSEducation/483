==History==

PA 346 was assigned in the original assignment of state highways in Pennsylvania. It originally began in Foster Brook, north of Bradford, and ended in Eldred.[tpl]cite map|title=Map Showing Pennsylvania State Highways|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1928[/tpl] It was extended westward in 1935 to a new terminus at Corydon, where it ended at PA 159,[tpl]cite map|title=Pennsylvania Highways and Parks Map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Recreation|year=1935[/tpl] a north–south route assigned in 1928 that began at PA 59 in Cornplanter and followed the Allegheny River north to the New York state line. This [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] alignment of PA 159 remained in place until 1946, when all of PA 159 south of Corydon was replaced by an extended PA 346. The short segment of PA 159 between Corydon and the state line became unnumbered.[tpl]cite map|title=Pennsylvania Official Road Map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1946[/tpl]
When the Allegheny Reservoir was completed in 1967, the portion of PA 346 near the Allegheny River was permanently inundated. As a result, PA 346 was rerouted slightly on its existing western end to head northwest to the state line, where it connected to the rebuilt New York State Route 280.[tpl]cite map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1960fr.pdf|title=Official Map of Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1960|accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1970fr.pdf|title=Official Map of Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1970|accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl] Originally, PA 346 followed East Main Street in Bradford and Foster Brook.[tpl]cite map|title=Discover The New Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|year=1976[/tpl] When the Bradford Bypass (US 219) was finished in 1977, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation realigned PA 346 onto the bypass as well.[tpl]cite map|title=Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|year=1977[/tpl]
