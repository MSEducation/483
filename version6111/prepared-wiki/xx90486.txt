[[Chronic kidney disease]]

CATEGORIES: Kidney diseases, Organ failure

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease (CRD), is a progressive loss in renal function over a period of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are non-specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia or pericarditis.[tpl]cite web | author=National Kidney Foundation | title=K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease | url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/guidelines_ckd | year=2002 | accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl] It is differentiated from acute kidney disease in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months.
Chronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine. Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of CKD, and the condition is discovered if urinalysis (testing of a urine sample) shows that the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine. To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests and often renal biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if there is a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction. Recent professional guidelines classify the severity of chronic kidney disease in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end stage renal disease (ESRD), end stage renal failure (ESRF), or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic kidney failure (CKF) or chronic renal failure (CRF).
There is no specific treatment unequivocally shown to slow the worsening of chronic kidney disease. If there is an underlying cause to CKD, such as vasculitis, this may be treated directly to slow the damage. In more advanced stages, treatments may be required for anemia and bone disease. Severe CKD requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant.

==Signs and symptoms==

CKD is initially without specific symptoms and is generally only detected as an increase in serum creatinine or protein in the urine. As the kidney function decreases:
People with chronic kidney disease suffer from accelerated atherosclerosis and are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than the general population. Patients afflicted with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease tend to have significantly worse prognoses than those suffering only from the latter.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Sexual dysfunction is very common in both men and women with chronic kidney disease.  A majority of men have a reduced sex drive, difficulty obtaining an erection and reaching orgasm, and the problems get worse with age.  A majority of women have trouble with sexual arousal, and painful periods and problems with performing and enjoying sex are common.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vecchio M, Navaneethan SD, Johnson DW, et al. |title=Interventions for treating sexual dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=12 |pages=CD007747 |year=2010 |pmid=21154382 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007747.pub2 [/tpl]

==Causes==

The three most common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.[tpl]cite web |title=United States Renal Data System (USRDS) |url=http://www.usrds.org/[/tpl]  Together, these cause approximately 75% of all adult cases.
Historically, kidney disease has been classified according to the part of the renal anatomy that is involved.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

In many CKD patients, previous renal disease or other underlying diseases are already known. A small number present with CKD of unknown cause. In these patients, a cause is occasionally identified retrospectively.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
It is important to differentiate CKD from acute renal failure (ARF) because ARF can be reversible. Abdominal ultrasound, in which the size of the kidneys is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (Additional tests may include nuclear medicine MAG3 scan to confirm blood flows and establish the differential function between the two kidneys. DMSA scans are also used in renal imaging; with both MAG3 and DMSA being used chelated with the radioactive element Technetium-99.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
In chronic renal failure treated with standard dialysis, numerous uremic toxins accumulate. These toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum, have different molecular weights and some of them are bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]

===Stages===

All individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 2 for 3 months are classified as having chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the presence or absence of kidney damage. The rationale for including these individuals is that reduction in kidney function to this level or lower represents loss of half or more of the adult level of normal kidney function, which may be associated with a number of complications.
All individuals with kidney damage are classified as having chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the level of GFR. The rationale for including individuals with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is that GFR may be sustained at normal or increased levels despite substantial kidney damage and that patients with kidney damage are at increased risk of the two major outcomes of chronic kidney disease: loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease.
The loss of protein in the urine is regarded as an independent marker for worsening of renal function and cardiovascular disease. Hence, British guidelines append the letter "P" to the stage of chronic kidney disease if there is significant protein loss.[tpl]NICE|73|Chronic kidney disease|2008[/tpl]
Slightly diminished function; kidney damage with normal or relatively high GFR (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine test or imaging studies.
Mild reduction in GFR (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2) with kidney damage. Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine test or imaging studies.
Moderate reduction in GFR (30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2). British guidelines distinguish between stage 3A (GFR 45–59) and stage 3B (GFR 30–44) for purposes of screening and referral.
Severe reduction in GFR (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2)
Preparation for renal replacement therapy
Established kidney failure (GFR 2, permanent renal replacement therapy (RRT), or end stage renal disease (ESRD)

===NDD-CKD vs. ESRD===

The term non-dialysis dependent CKD, also abbreviated as NDD-CKD, is a designation used to encompass the status of those persons with an established CKD who do not yet require the life-supporting treatments for renal failure known as renal replacement therapy (including maintenance dialysis or renal transplantation).  The condition of individuals with CKD, who require either of the 2 types of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation), is referred to as the end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hence, the start of the ESRD is practically the irreversible conclusion of the NDD-CKD. Even though the non-dialysis dependent status refers to the status of persons with earlier stages of CKD (stages 1 to 4), patients with advanced stage of CKD (Stage 5), who have not yet started renal replacement therapy are also referred to as NDD-CKD.

==Screening==

Screening those who neither have symptoms nor risk factors for chronic kidney disease is not recommended.[tpl]cite journal|last=Qaseem|first=A|coauthors=Hopkins, RH; Sweet, DE; Starkey, M; Shekelle, P|title=Screening, Monitoring, and Treatment of Stage 1 to 3 Chronic Kidney Disease: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=Oct 22, 2013|pmid=24145991|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-12-201312170-00726|volume=159|issue=12|pages=835–47[/tpl] Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous racial origin, those with a history of renal disease in the past, as well as subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis. Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR/1.73 m2 from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine-to-albumin creatinine ratio in a first-morning urine specimen as well as dipstick screen for hematuria.[tpl]cite book |last=Johnson |first=David |editor-first=John |editor-last=Daugirdas |title=Handbook of Chronic Kidney Disease Management |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |date=2011-05-02 |pages=32–43 |chapter=Chapter 4: CKD Screening and Management: Overview |chapterurl=http://hdcn.com/CKDhandbook/toc.htm  |isbn=1-58255-893-0[/tpl]  Guidelines for nephrologist referral vary among different countries.  Nephrology referral is useful when eGFR/1.73m2 is less than 30 or decreasing by more than 3 mL/min/year, when urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more than 30 mg/g, when blood pressure is difficult to control, or when hematuria or other findings suggest either a primarily glomerular disorder or secondary disease amenable to specific treatment.  Other benefits of early nephrology referral include proper patient education regarding options for renal replacement therapy as well as pre-emptive transplantation, and timely workup and placement of an arteriovenous fistula in those patients opting for future hemodialysis.

==Treatment==

The presence of chronic kidney disease confers a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as hyperlipidemia. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is therefore cardiovascular disease rather than renal failure. Aggressive treatment of hyperlipidemia is warranted.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chauhan V, Vaid M |title=Dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease: managing a high-risk combination |journal=Postgrad Med |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=54–61 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19940417 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2009.11.2077[/tpl]
Apart from controlling other risk factors, the goal of therapy is to slow down or halt the progression of CKD to stage 5. Control of blood pressure and treatment of the original disease, whenever feasible, are the broad principles of management. Generally, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are used, as they have been found to slow the progression of CKD to stage 5.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ruggenenti P, Perna A, Gherardi G, Gaspari F, Benini R, Remuzzi G |title=Renal function and requirement for dialysis in chronic nephropathy patients on long-term ramipril: REIN follow-up trial.

Zerenex(TM), a very promising new drug developed by Keryx Biopharma will have the ability to treat both elevated serum phosphate levels and anemia in CKD patients likely reducing or eliminating the need for other drugs i.e. IV iron and ESA's.
When one reaches stage 5 CKD, renal replacement therapy is usually required, in the form of either dialysis or a transplant.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease is guarded as epidemiological data has shown that all cause mortality (the overall death rate) increases as kidney function decreases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Perazella MA, Khan S |title=Increased mortality in chronic kidney disease: a call to action |journal=Am.

===Cancer risk===

Patients with end-stage renal disease are at increased overall risk for cancer.[tpl]cite PMID|10408483[/tpl] This risk is particularly high in younger patients and gradually diminishes with age. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians not perform routine cancer screening in patients with limited life expectancies due to ESRD because evidence does not show that such tests lead to improved patient outcomes.[tpl]Cite journal |author1 = American Society of Nephrology |author1-link = American Society of Nephrology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Society of Nephrology |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012 |postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1001/archinte.1996.00440110117016[/tpl]

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major concern in African Americans, mostly due to increased prevalence of hypertension. As an example, 37% of end-stage renal disease cases in African Americans can be attributed to high blood pressure, compared with 19% among caucasians.[tpl]cite journal |author=Appel LJ, Wright JT, Greene T, et al. |title=Long-term effects of renin-angiotensin system-blocking therapy and a low blood pressure goal on progression of hypertensive chronic kidney disease in African Americans |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=168 |issue=8 |pages=832–9 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18443258 |doi=10.1001/archinte.168.8.832 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18443258[/tpl] Treatment efficacy also differs between racial groups. Administration of anti-hypertensive drugs generally halts disease progression in white populations, but has little effect in slowing renal disease among blacks, and additional treatment such as bicarbonate therapy is often required. While lower socioeconomic status contributes to prevalence of CKD, there are still significant differences in CKD prevalence between African Americans and whites when controlling for environmental factors.
Studies have shown that there is a true association between history of chronic renal failure in first or second-degree relatives, and risk of disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Klag MJ, Whelton PK, Randall BL, Neaton JD, Brancati FL, Stamler J |title=End-stage renal disease in African-American and white men. 16-year MRFIT findings |journal=JAMA |volume=277 |issue=16 |pages=1293–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9109467 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03540400043029 [/tpl] In addition, African Americans may have higher serum levels of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). High HLA concentrations can contribute to increased systemic inflammation, which indirectly may lead to heightened susceptibility for developing kidney disease. Lack of nocturnal reduction in blood pressure among groups of African Americans is also offered as an explanation, which lends further credence to a genetic etiology of CKD racial disparities.
