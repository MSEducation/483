[[Division of Barker]]

The Division of Barker is an Australian Electoral Division in the south-east of South Australia.
The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Collet Barker, an early explorer of the region at the mouth of the Murray River. It has always been based in the south-eastern rural areas of South Australia, centred on Bordertown and Mount Gambier, but in recent years its boundaries have been extended to the north to include Riverland towns such as Renmark. Barker is the only one of South Australia's remaining original six divisions that has never been held by the Australian Labor Party.  It has been in the hands of the Liberal Party and its predecessors for its entire existence, except for a six-year period when Country Party MP Archie Cameron held it; however, Cameron joined the United Australia Party, direct forerunner of the Liberals, in 1940.  
Barker originally extended as far west as the outer fringes of the Adelaide area, around Glenelg. However, that portion was removed after parliament was expanded in the 1949 redistribution, making this already safely conservative seat even more so. Its most prominent members have been Cameron, a former leader of the Country Party and later Speaker of the House in the Menzies Government, Jim Forbes, a minister in the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments, and Ian McLachlan, Minister for Defence from 1996 to 1998 in the Howard Government.
