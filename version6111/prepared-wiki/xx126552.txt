Confidencen, or Ulriksdals slottsteater (Ulriksdal Palace Theatre), is a Swedish opera stage. 
Confidencen is Sweden's oldest rococo theatre situated in the National City Park, on the ground of the Ulriksdal Palace outside Stockholm. The building's original structure was built in 1671. It was first used as a stable block, but then converted to a theatre in 1753 when Queen Louisa Ulrika decorated it as one of her prime theatres: for twenty years, the scene was thereafter occupied by the Du Londel Troupe. It was one of a few chosen theatres maintained by the Swedish Royal Family, and used until her son's, king Gustav IIIs death in 1792. His majesty himself performed there as well as the great Swedish national poet and composer Carl Michael Bellman.
Confidencen is part of the Ulriksdal Palace estate, one of the five official residences of the Swedish Royal Family.
The opera stage is run by opera singer Kjerstin Dellert since the 1980s.
