St. James Church (also known as Garth Chapel) is a historic church located northwest of Charlottesville near Owensville, Albemarle County, Virginia, United States on VA 614 east of VA 676. The vernacular Gothic Revival chapel was constructed in 1896 with the help of the Garth Family and the sponsorship of Christ Episcopal Church in Charlottesville.  The church served a congregation of between 25â€“30 people at its construction.  Regular worship services were held up until the 1940s, after which only graveside funeral services were held.  Beginning in 1974 and continuing to the present day, christenings, weddings, and funerals were held in the church.  Although there is no active congregation, St. James Church continues to be a consecrated Episcopal Church.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Albemarle/002-0582_StJames_Church_2012_NRHP_Draft.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: St. James Church|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Historic Resources|author=Geoffrey Henry and Gardiner Hallock|date=May 2012[/tpl]
