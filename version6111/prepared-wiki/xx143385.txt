Beginning in 2004–2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010–11, Wallingford-Swarthmore School District applied for and received $211,167 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/education_budget/8699/pa_accountability_grants/604468 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title= Accountability Block Grant report Grantee list 2010 |year=2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/grants_and_subsidies/7207/pa-pact_information/507147 |title=Accountability Block Grant Mid Year report |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008[/tpl]

====Classrooms for the Future grant====

The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006–2009. Wallingford-Swarthmore School District did not apply to participate in 2006–07 or in 2007–08. The district received $188,223 in 2008–09.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/reports/performance/special/specff122208.pdf |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General |title=Classrooms for the Future grants audit |date=December 22, 2008[/tpl]

====Federal Stimulus grant====

The district received an extra $946,764 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.recovery.pa.gov/ |title=Delaware County ARRA FUNDING Report  |author=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  |year=2009[/tpl] The funding was limited to the 2009–10 and 2010–2011 school years.[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09071/954967-298.stm |title=School stimulus money |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette' |date=March 12, 2009[/tpl] Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly warned to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs or purchasing books and software.

====Race to the Top grant====

District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/directory/stimulus/93015?DirMode=1 |title=RTTT_Webinar_for_districts_December_2009.pdf |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=December 9, 2009[/tpl] Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvanias-race-to-the-top-fueled-by-effective-reforms-strong-local-support-82086397.html |title=Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, |author=Governor's Press Office release |date=January 20, 2010[/tpl] Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant.

===Common Cents state initiative===

The School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/common_cents/8781 |title=Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2007[/tpl] After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.

===Real estate taxes===

Property tax rates in 2011–12 were set by the school board at 38.1520 mills for Nether Providence Township/Rose Valley Boro and 38.1520 mills for Rutledge/Swarthmore Boro. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Rates by School District 2011–12 Real Estate Mills |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011[/tpl] Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Act 511 Tax Report |year=2004[/tpl] The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.steb.state.pa.us/aboutusmain.asp |title=State Tax Equalization Board About US |author=State Tax Equalization Board |year=2011[/tpl]

====Act 1 Adjusted Index====

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010[/tpl] In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011[/tpl] The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school’s share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011[/tpl]

For the 2011–12 school year, the Wallingford-Swarthmore School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 the Taxpayer Relief Act information |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011[/tpl]
According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Exceptions |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=April 2011[/tpl]

The farm must be at least [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2|adj=pre|contiguous[/tpl] and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_rent_rebate/11410 |title=Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program |author=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2006[/tpl]
