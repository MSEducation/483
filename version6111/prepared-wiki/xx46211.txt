==Early life==

Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg. He has claimed he was born in 1938 to Elisabeth (born Bahlman) and Otto Lagerfeldt.[tpl]cite journal|last=Colapinto |first=John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/19/070319fa_fact_colapinto?currentPage=all |journal=The New Yorker |title=Profiles – In the now, where Karl Largerfeld lives |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl] He is known to insist that no one knows his real birth date; interviewed on French television in February 2009, Lagerfeld said that he was "born neither in 1933 nor 1938."Interview on On n'est pas couché, France2, 21 February 2009
In April 2013 he finally declared that he was born in 1935.http://fr.news.yahoo.com/karl-lagerfeld-r%C3%A9v%C3%A8le-%C3%A2ge-premi%C3%A8re-fois-064500963.html A birth announcement was, however, published by his parents in 1933, and the baptismal register in Hamburg also lists him as born in 1933.Der grosse Karl wird schon 80 Die Welt, 7 July 2013 [tpl]de-icon[/tpl] biography at Munzinger-Archiv [tpl]de-icon[/tpl] His older sister, Martha Christiane (a.k.a. Christel), was born in 1931. Lagerfeld has an older half-sister, Thea, from his father's first marriage. His original name was Lagerfeldt (with a "t"), but he later changed it to Lagerfeld as, in his words, "it sounds more commercial."[tpl]cite book|last = Lagerfeld |first = Karl |last2 = Houdret |first2=Jean-Claude| title =The Karl Lagerfeld Diet | publisher=PowerHouse Books | year=2005| isbn = 978-1-57687-251-2[/tpl]
Purportedly, Lagerfeld grew up as the son of a wealthy businessman from Sweden who was introducing powdered milk. His family was mainly shielded from the deprivations of World War II due to his father's business interests in Germany through the firm Glücksklee-Milch GmbH.[tpl]cite book |first=Paul |last=Sahner |title=Karl |publisher=mvg verlag |year=2009 |page=15 |isbn=978-3-86882-015-7 |language=German [/tpl][tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PU4YAAAAIAAJ&q=Fashion+designer+Karl+Lagerfeld+was+born+on+September+10,+1938,+in+Hamburg,+Germany.+His+father+was+Swedish,+from+a+merchant+banker's+family,+and+made+the+family+fortune+by+introducing+powdered+milk+to+Europe |volume=9 |page=161 |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography |publisher=Gale Research |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7876-2221-3 |quote=Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld was born on September 10, 1935, in Hamburg, Germany. His father was Swedish, from a merchant banker's family, and made the family fortune by introducing powdered milk to Europe |accessdate=7 January 2012 [/tpl] His mother is from Berlin;According to "Lagerfeld Confidential", Marconi Rodolphe, 2006. according to Alicia Drake,[tpl]Vague|date=January 2012[/tpl] she was a lingerie saleswoman there when she met her husband and married him in 1930.
After attending a private school, Lagerfeld finished his secondary school at the Lycée Montaigne in Paris, where he majored in drawing and history.[tpl]cite book| title =Biography News, Volume 1 | publisher=Gale Research Company | year=1974[/tpl]
Lagerfeld was hired as Pierre Balmain's assistant after winning the coats category in a design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat in 1955. In 1958, after three years at Balmain, he moved to Jean Patou where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years. His first collection was shown in a two-hour presentation in July 1958, but he used the name Roland Karl, rather than Karl Lagerfeld. Although, in 1962, reporters began referring to him as Karl Lagerfelt or Karl Logerfeld. The first collection was poorly received. Carrie Donovan, an American fashion journalist, wrote that "the press booed the collection"[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]. The UPI noted: "The firm's brand new designer, 25-year old Roland Karl, showed a collection which stressed shape and had no trace of last year's sack." The reporter went on to say: "A couple of short black cocktail dresses were cut so wide open at the front that even some of the women reporters gasped. Other cocktail and evening dresses feature low, low-cut backs." Most interestingly, Karl said that his design silhouette for the season was called by the letter "K" for Karl, which was translated into a straight line in front, curved in at the waist in the back, with a low fullness to the skirt.
His skirts for the spring 1960 season were the shortest in Brisbane, and the collection was not well received. Carrie Donovan wrote that it "looked like clever and immensely salable ready-to-wear, not couture." For his late 1960 collection, he designed special little hats, pancake shaped circles of satin, which hung on the cheek. He called them "slaps in the face." Karl's collection was said to be well received but not groundbreaking. "I became bored there, too, and I quit and tried to go back to school, but that didn't work, so I spent two years mostly on beaches—I guess I studied life."' In 1963, he began designing for Tiziani, a Roman couture house founded that year by Evan Richards (b. 1924) of Jacksboro, Texas. It began as couture and then branched out into ready-to-wear, bearing the label "Tiziani-Roma—Made in England." Lagerfeld and Richards sketched the first collection in 1963 together. "When they wound up with 90 outfits, Tiziani threw caution and invitations to the winds, borrowed Catherine the Great's jewels from Harry Winston, and opened his salon with a three-night wingding," according to one report in 1969. Lagerfeld designed for the company until 1969. Elizabeth Taylor was a fan of the label; she referred to Evan as Evan Tiziani, which was, of course, not his family name, and began wearing the outfits in August 1966. Gina Lollobrigida, Doris Duke, and Princess Marcella Borghese were also customers while Lagerfeld was designing the line. He was replaced in 1969 with Guy Douvier (1928–1993).
Lagerfeld began to freelance for French fashion house Chloé in 1964, at first designing a few pieces each season. As more and more pieces were incorporated, he soon designed the entire collection. In 1970, he also began a brief design collaboration with Roman haute-couture house Curiel; its head was Gigliola Curiel, who died in November 1969. Lagerfeld's first collection there was described as having a "drippy drapey elegance" designed for a "1930s cinema queen."[tpl]according to whom|date=July 2012[/tpl] The Curiel mannequins all wore identical, short-cropped blonde wigs. He also showed black velvet shorts, worn under a black velvet ankle-length cape.
His Chloé collection for spring 1973 (shown in October 1972) garnered headlines for offering something both "high fashion and high camp." He showed loose Spencer jackets and printed silk shirt-jackets. He designed something he called a "surprise" skirt, which was in an ankle-length, pleated silk, so loose that it hid the fact it was actually pants. "It seems that wearing these skirts is an extraordinary sensation," he told a reporter at the time. He also designed a look inspired by Carmen Miranda, which consisted of mini-bra dresses with very short skirts, and long dresses with bra tops and scarf shawls.
From 1972, he collaborated with Italian fashion house Fendi, designing furs, clothing, and accessories.
Starting in the 1970s, Lagerfeld has occasionally worked as a costume designer for theatrical productions. He collaborated with stage directors such as Luca Ronconi and Jürgen Flimm, and designed for theaters such as La Scala in Milan (Les Troyens by Hector Berlioz, 1980; directed by Ronconi), the Burgtheater in Vienna (Komödie der Verführung by Arthur Schnitzler, 1980; directed by Horst Zankl), and the Salzburg Festival (Der Schwierige by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, 1990; directed by Flimm).

==International fame (1982–present)==

At the time, he was maintaining a design contract with Japanese firm Isetan to create collections for both men and women through 30 licenses, had a lingerie line in the U.S. produced by Eve Stillmann, was designing shoes for Charles Jourdan and sweaters for Ballantyne, and worked with Trevira as a fashion adviser.
In 2002, Karl Lagerfeld asked Renzo Rosso, the founder of Diesel, to collaborate with him on a special denim collection for the Lagerfeld Gallery.Tungate, Mark: "Fifty". Gestalten Verlag; 2005. ISBN 978-3-89955-095-5 The collection, Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel's creative team, under the supervision of Rosso. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer's catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2002/05/10/pop-goes-the-diesel |title=Pop Goes the Diesel |date=10 May 2002 |work=Vogue |accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl] and then sold in highly limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries in Paris and Monaco and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers were sold out, even though prices ranged from $240 to $1,840.[tpl]cite web|first=Jenny |last=Bailly |url=http://www.fashionwindows.com/beauty/diesel/experimental.asp |title=Diesel Gets 'Experimental' As Lagerfeld Gallery Takes Soho Store by Storm |publisher=Fashionwindows.com |date=9 August 2002 |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl] In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said: "I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the prêt-à-porter of casual wear."
Lagerfeld designed the costumes for the Carmen sequences in the 2002 film Callas Forever; in 2004, some outfits for singer Madonna for her Re-Invention tour, and recently outfits for Kylie Minogue's Showgirl tour.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Lagerfeld collaborated with H&M, which, on 12 November 2004, offered a limited range of Lagerfeld clothes for men and women, in certain outlets. Only two days after having supplied its outlets, H&M announced that almost all the clothes were sold out. However, Lagerfeld has expressed some fear that working with lower-end brands will taint his image;[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] although, in the past he has worked closely with the hosiery designer Wolford.
Lagerfeld is also a photographer. He produced Visionaire 23: The Emperor's New Clothes, a series of nude pictures of models and celebrities. He also personally photographed Mariah Carey for the cover of V magazine in 2005. In addition to his editorial work for Harper's Bazaar, Numéro, and Russian and German editions of Vogue, Lagerfeld photographs advertising campaigns for the houses under his direction—Chanel, Fendi, and his eponymous line.
In the 1980s, Hans Christian Andersen tale "The Emperor's New Clothes" was published with drawings by Lagerfeld.
The designer was also the subject of French reality-TV series "Signé Chanel" in 2005. It covered the creation of his fall/winter 2004–2005 Chanel couture collection and aired on Sundance Channel in the United States during the fall of 2006.
He has also supported and encouraged the work of up-and-coming designers including Philip Colbert of Rodnik.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
