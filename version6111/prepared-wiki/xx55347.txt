The ''xungen'' movement is a cultural and literary movement in mainland China emphasizing local and minority cultures. It began in the late-1980s. Its premise is that the Cultural Revolution damaged a pluralistic Chinese identity that had existed for centuries, and that the reconstruction of that identity requires a healthy appreciation of local cultures.
The xungen movement bears some similarities with the Taiwanese localization movement in its rejection of a forcefully-imposed Chinese identity.
