Oscar Gutierrez (born December 11, 1974) is an American professional wrestler signed to WWE. Gutierrez was trained by his uncle Rey Misterio, Sr., learning the Lucha Libre high flying style that has been his trademark.
Gutierrez originally worked for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) in Mexico, from 1992 to 1995. He wrestled in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1995 to 1996 and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1996 to 2001, as Rey Misterio, Jr. or Rey Mysterio, Jr. ("Rey Misterio" is Spanish for "King Mystery"[tpl]cite book|author=Jeremy Roberts|title=Rey Mysterio: Behind the Mask|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KsbBEV3YiX8C|accessdate=December 3, 2012|date=November 3, 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-9896-1[/tpl]) but dropped the "Junior" from his name when he began working for WWE in 2002.
Mysterio is known for having a high flying style, which helped kick-start the cruiserweight wrestling revolution in the United States in the late 1990s during his time in WCW. In WCW he won the WCW World Tag Team Championship three times, and the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship once with Billy Kidman as part of the Filthy Animals. In WWE, Mysterio is a three-time world champion, having held the World Heavyweight Championship twice and the WWE Championship once, and is currently listed as the lightest world champion in WWE history. He has also held the WWE Tag Team Championship a record-tying four times, and the WWE Intercontinental Championship twice. He also held the WCW/WWE Cruiserweight Championship a record eight times (five times in WCW, three in WWE). All totaled, he has won 21 titles between WWE and WCW. Mysterio was the 21st person to win the WWE Triple Crown Championship, and was the winner of the 2006 Royal Rumble.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===

Gutierrez made his debut in Mexico on April 30, 1989 when he was only 14 years old. He was trained by his uncle Rey Misterio, Sr. and wrestled early on in Mexico where he learned the Lucha Libre high flying style that has been his trademark. He had ring names such as "La Lagartija Verde (The Green Lizard)" and "Colibrí" before his uncle gave him the name of Rey Misterio, Jr./Rey Mysterio, Jr. In 1989, Mysterio was awarded "Most Improved Wrestler" in Mexico while wrestling as Colibrí. In 1991 he received the award again, this time under the name of "Rey Misterio, Jr."

===Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (1992–1995)===

In Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), Mysterio feuded with Juventud Guerrera. Mysterio's uncle Misterio, Sr. also took on Guerrera in a tag match: Misterio, Sr. and Mysterio, Jr. facing Guerrera and his father Fuerza Guerrera. Mysterio commonly teamed with the similarly undersized high flyer known as Romy "Romeo" Magruder.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1996)===

Mysterio signed with Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1995.[tpl]cite video|title=Rey Mysterio: The Biggest Little Man|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1353050/|date=2007|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video[/tpl] He debuted in September at Gangsta's Paradise, defeating Psicosis, who was also making his ECW debut.[tpl]cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|last=Loverro|first=Thom|pages=105–106|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-1058-1[/tpl] A feud between the two began, which included a two out of three falls match and a Mexican Death match. Mysterio also had a series of matches with ECW-newcomer Juventud Guerrera during the first half of 1996.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–2001)===

====Cruiserweight division (1996–1999)====

Rey Mysterio, Jr. made his World Championship Wrestling (WCW) debut on June 16, 1996, at The Great American Bash, challenging Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, which Malenko retained by cheating to win. In July at Bash at the Beach, he defeated longtime rival Psicosis in a number one contender's match to earn another opportunity at the Cruiserweight title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#96|title=Bash at the Beach 1996 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=May 15, 2008[/tpl] The next night, on the July 8 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, he defeated Malenko to win his first Cruiserweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/cruiser/349714|title=History of the Cruiserweight Championship: Rey Mysterio|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] He reigned as champion for three months, which included title defenses against the likes of Ultimate Dragon, Malenko, and Super Caló before he lost the title to Malenko at Halloween Havoc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#96|title=Hog Wild results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXXIII|title=Clash of the Champions XXXIII results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#96|title=Fall Brawl 1996: WarGames results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#96|title=Halloween Havoc 1996 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] Following his Cruiserweight Championship reign, Mysterio challenged Ultimate Dragon for the J-Crown Championship, but was unsuccessful in his title match at World War 3 in November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html#96|title=World War 3 1996 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl]
In early 1997, he feuded with Prince Iaukea over the WCW World Television Championship. Mysterio was defeated in his title match against Iaukea at SuperBrawl VII after Lord Steven Regal attacked him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VII|title=SuperBrawl VII results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] Mysterio also lost a championship rematch at Uncensored in March.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#97|title=1997 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] Mysterio soon began a feud with the New World Order (nWo), which culminated when he lost a Mexican Death match to nWo member Konnan at Road Wild in August. Mysterio then became involved in a feud with his real-life friend and Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero. He defeated Guerrero in a Title vs. Mask match at Halloween Havoc to win the Cruiserweight Championship for the second time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/cruiser/|title=History of the Cruiserweight Championship|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=May 15, 2008[/tpl] On the November 10, 1997, episode of Nitro, he lost the title back to Guerrero. They had a rematch at World War 3, which Mysterio also lost.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html#97|title=World War 3 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl]
On the January 15, 1998, episode of WCW Thunder, Mysterio defeated Juventud to win his third Cruiserweight Championship, but lost it nine days later to Chris Jericho at Souled Out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwoppv.html#98|title=Souled Out 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] After the match, Jericho continued the beating by using a toolbox he found at ringside. This storyline was used to cover Mysterio's need for a knee operation that kept him out of the ring for six months. He made his return at Bash at the Beach, where he defeated Jericho for his fourth Cruiserweight championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#98|title=Bash at the Beach 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] The next night, however, the result was overturned and the belt returned to Jericho due to Dean Malenko interfering. Later that year, Eddie Guerrero formed a Mexican stable known as the Latino World Order (LWO) (a spin off of New World Order) that included nearly every luchador in the promotion. Mysterio continually refused to join and feuded with Guerrero and the LWO members, including winning a match against longtime rival and LWO member Psicosis in a match at Road Wild.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#98|title=Road Wild 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] He was finally forced to join the group after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. Mysterio's on-and-off tag team partner Billy Kidman joined him during the feud with LWO, wrestling against the LWO despite Mysterio being a part of the group. His alliance with Kidman was formed after Mysterio helped Kidman defeat Juventud for the Cruiserweight Title at World War 3. Mysterio went up against Kidman for the Cruiserweight title at Starrcade 1998 but was unsuccessful winning back the title in a Triangle match that also involved Juventud. Kidman once again defeated Mysterio for the Cruiserweight title at Souled Out 1999 in a Fatal Four-Way match that also included Psicosis and Juventud.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#98|title=Starrcade 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwoppv.html#99|title=Souled Out 1999 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl]

====Giant Killer and unmasking (1999)====

In 1999, after the two factions of nWo reformed, they demanded that the LWO disband. Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a "Hair vs. Mask match" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked:
[tpl]cquote|I was strongly against it! I don't think WCW understood what the mask meant to me, to my fans and to my family. It was a very bad move on their behalf. The fans wanted Rey Mysterio with the mask and losing it hurt me a lot. It was also frustrating that it didn't come as the climax to a feud with another masked wrestler, but in a throwaway match. The same thing happened to Juventud and Psicosis and psychologically wise it was a bad move by Eric Bischoff. I think the fans understand that I was in a position where I had no option. I either had to lose my mask or lose my job.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rey-mysterio.org/rey/articles/misc004.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080403055559/http://www.rey-mysterio.org/rey/articles/misc004.php|archivedate=April 3, 2008|title=Rey Mysterio Misc 4[/tpl][/tpl]
Mysterio later became a "giant killer" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1999023m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro – Monday, 02/22/99|work=DDT Digest|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1999031m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro – Monday, 03/08/99|work=DDT Digest|accessdate=May 16, 2008[/tpl] He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming.
The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship.  On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held. El Dandy was the lottery winner, but he was injured, and Mysterio took the shot instead.  The match ended with a disqualification win for Flair, even though Arn Anderson's interference on Flair's behalf should have theoretically disqualified Flair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/1999033m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro 3/22/99 Results|work=DDT Digest|accessdate=January 5, 2011[/tpl]  The following week, Mysterio and Kidman teamed with each other and defeated Flair's Four Horsemen stablemates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wcw/wcw-t.html|title=W.C.W.

At Slamboree, Mysterio and Kidman lost the World Tag Team titles to Raven and Perry Saturn in a Triangle match, also involving former champions Benoit and Malenko.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/slambore.html#99|title=Slamboree 1999 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl]

====No Limit Soldiers and Filthy Animals (1999–2001)====

In mid-1999, Mysterio and Konnan joined Master P's No Limit Soldiers, and began feuding with the West Texas Rednecks. At The Great American Bash, they defeated Rednecks members Curt Hennig and Bobby Duncum, Jr. in a tag team match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#99|title=The Great American Bash 1999 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl] At Bash at the Beach, they defeated the Rednecks in a four-on-four Elimination tag team match when Mysterio pinned Hennig.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#99|title=Bash at the Beach 1999 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|publisher=Pro Wrestling Hitsory|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl] After Master P's departure from WCW, Mysterio formed a stable with Eddie Guerrero and Billy Kidman known as the Filthy Animals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/f/filthy-animals.html|title=Filthy Animals Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl] The three wrestlers soon began a feud with the Dead Pool.

On the October 18 episode of Nitro, Mysterio and Konnan teamed up together to defeat Harlem Heat for the World Tag Team Championship. Mysterio, however, was injured during the match and was sidelined as a result. Billy Kidman substituted for Mysterio and teamed with Konnan during their title defense against Harlem Heat and The First Family, in which the Filthy Animals went on to lose the title back to Harlem Heat. Mysterio returned in early 2000 and remained a steady performer, eventually joining the New Blood faction in early 2000 opposing the Millionaire's Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/new-blood.html|title=New Blood Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl] On the August 14 episode of Nitro, Mysterio and Juventud defeated The Great Muta and Vampiro to win the World Tag Team Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/2000082m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro – August 14, 2000|work=DDT Digest|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl] They were stripped of the title after Ernest Miller pinned Disco Inferno with the stipulation that if he pinned Disco, Mysterio and Guerrera would be stripped of the title.

===Return to Mexico and the independent circuit (2001–2002)===

After WCW closed down, Mysterio started wrestling independently in Mexico with Billy Kidman. He made his first ever Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre appearance, debuting in an eight-man tag team match. Mysterio wrestled a total of 10 matches in CMLL before returning to the United States. Upon his return to the USA, he worked in XWF, IWA Mid-South, and HWA, with the likes of Eddie Guerrero and CM Punk.

===World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE===

====Cruiserweight Champion (2002–2004)====

In June 2002, Mysterio signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and promos that hyped his debut began airing. The "Jr." was dropped from his name and was billed simply as Rey Mysterio. At the insistence of Vince McMahon, Mysterio agreed to wear his mask again. While this angered lucha libre fans in Mexico as it violated tradition, Mysterio did receive permission from the official luche libre organizations to wear his mask again, as he had not lost his mask in a traditional mask vs. mask match.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/2009/05/19/wrestler-of-the-week-rey-mysterio/ WWE has normally censored footage of Mysterio being unmasked in WCW for kayfabe-based reasons. However, when WWE Classics on Demand rebroadcast WCW Sin in April 2013, a match featuring Mysterio unmasked was left intact.
Mysterio made his WWE debut on the July 25, 2002, episode of SmackDown! as a fan favorite in a match against Chavo Guerrero, which Mysterio won.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/020725.html|title=SmackDown! results – July 25, 2002|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=May 18, 2008[/tpl] He eventually began a feud with Kurt Angle, which culminated in a match at SummerSlam that Angle won after forcing Mysterio to submit to the ankle lock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2002/results/|title=SummerSlam 2002 official results|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=May 18, 2008[/tpl] He later formed a tag team with Edge; the two participated in a tournament for the newly created and SmackDown!-exclusive WWE Tag Team Championship.

====Tag Team Champion and storyline with Eddie Guerrero (2004–2006)====

After an unsuccessful attempt at regaining the Cruiserweight Title, Mysterio formed a tag team with Rob Van Dam, and went on to win the Tag Team Championship from Kenzo Suzuki and René Dupreé on the December 9 episode of SmackDown!.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwetag/329982|title=History of the WWE Tag Team Chmapionship: Rey Mysterio & Rob Van Dam|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=May 20, 2008[/tpl] They successfully defended the title against the former champions at Armageddon,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2004/results/|title=Armageddon 2004 official results|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=May 20, 2008[/tpl] before losing the title to the Basham Brothers on the January 13, 2005, episode of SmackDown! after Van Dam was injured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050113.html|title=SmackDown! results – January 13, 2005|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=May 20, 2008[/tpl]
Mysterio then teamed up with Eddie Guerrero to win the Tag Team Championship back from the Bashams at No Way Out. During this time Rey had a video camera, which was called the "619 cam", during his entrance he taped members of the audience with this. In a departure from traditional booking, the new champions did not defend their title at WrestleMania 21, but instead had a match against each other which Rey won. Two months later, at ECW One Night Stand, Mysterio faced and defeated long-time rival Psicosis for the first time in nearly five years.
The match at WrestleMania was part of a storyline in which Guerrero turned on Mysterio and beat him up after abandoning him during a match against MNM for the Tag Team Championship. Then after a no disqualification match against Chavo, Eddie came out and slammed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie's increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio. Guerrero and Mysterio continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio's real life son Dominick, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that, in the storyline, he was Dominick's biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match for the custody of Dominick. Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match. On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That same day at a WWE "Super Show" where SmackDown! and Raw were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so no one could see his face). Mysterio went on to defeat Shawn Michaels in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Guerrero.
Mysterio participated in the main event of Survivor Series as part of Team SmackDown! along with Randy Orton, Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John "Bradshaw" Layfield who defeated Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, The Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters). After Survivor Series, Mysterio faced Big Show in a match billed as "David vs. Goliath" in a SmackDown! special show. The match stemmed from Mysterio eliminating Big Show at Survivor Series, and ended as a "no contest" when Big Show's tag team partner Kane interfered in the match. Mysterio continued to feud with Raw's World Tag Team Champions, and found a tag team partner in World Heavyweight Champion Batista. They were booked to face Raw's Kane and The Big Show in a tag match at Armageddon. Before Armageddon, Batista and Mysterio defeated MNM on the December 19 episode of SmackDown! to win the Tag Team Championship in a match they both dedicated to Eddie Guerrero. Now the Tag Team Champions, Mysterio and Batista's match with Big Show and Kane was billed as "Champions vs. Champions." Mysterio and Batista lost the match when Kane pinned Mysterio after a chokeslam. On the December 30 episode of SmackDown!, MNM invoked their rematch clause, defeating Batista and Mysterio with help from Mark Henry to regain the Tag Team Championship. Mysterio and Batista lost a Steel Cage match for the title the next week, after more interference by Henry. On the January 10, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio was involved in a 20-man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. He was eliminated by Mark Henry, Kurt Angle won the match, last eliminating Henry.

====World Heavyweight Champion (2006–2008)====

On July 23 at The Great American Bash, Mysterio lost the World Heavyweight Championship to King Booker after Chavo Guerrero interfered the match and hit Mysterio with a steel chair. Guerrero cost Mysterio his rematch the following week. This culminated in a match at SummerSlam where Mysterio lost to Guerrero after Vickie Guerrero tried to stop both men from fighting but accidentally knocked Mysterio off the top turnbuckle. Vickie then along with Chavo turned on Mysterio after she hit him in the back with a steel chair and gave him an injury, thus, siding with Guerrero.

At TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs Mysterio teamed with Big Show to unsuccessfully challenge Cody Rhodes and Goldust for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a four-way match, also involving Ryback and Curtis Axel, and The Real Americans. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 26, 2014, Mysterio entered the Royal Rumble match at #30, but was eliminated by Seth Rollins.

On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website an article in its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Gutierrez who was alleged to have obtained nandrolone and stanozolol.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/03/19/wrestlers/index.html|title=Wrestlers allegedly tied to drug ring|accessdate=March 22, 2007|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNN|date=March 19, 2007[/tpl] WWE subsequently stated that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in February 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/si|title=A Statement From World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2007[/tpl] On August 27, 2009, WWE announced that Gutierrez would receive a 30-day suspension due to a violation of the wellness program.
