==History==

In 1918,some local merchants with the cooperation of the local Chinese set up a primary school named Chong Cheng Primary School (now known as Sekolan Jenis Kebangsaan (Cina) Seg Hwa, Chinese:昔华国民型华文小学) along Jalan Mentol, Segamat. With financial contributions from the local Chinese merchants, a new building with eight classrooms was constructed in 1936.
After the Second World War, the school was renamed "Hwa Chiao Primary and Secondary School" (Sekolah Menengah Rendah Hwa Chiao) with the establishment of a secondary school section.
Due to the increasing student population, a new block of 10 classrooms was put up in 1950. However, it did not solve the shortage of classrooms. The Board of Governors of the school set up a building committee in 1954 with the assistance of the Association of Rubber Merchants.
The Building Committee proposed an alternative site for construction of the secondary school building. With the assistance of the then local assemblyman, YB Tuan Haji Noor, the school successfully applied for a piece of land approximately [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2[/tpl] near Bukit Hampar (where the school is now situated) from the Government of Johor.
A new block of 16 classrooms was constructed at the new site. The secondary school was officially separated from Hwa Chiao Primary and Secondary School and named as Sekolah Menengah Hwa Chiao, Bukit Hampar (Tahang Rimau). The primary school remains at Jalan Mentol. The first school session at the new site started in 1957.

==Change of Name==

From the establishment until 1957, the school was running with private funding and donations from the locals. With the independence of the Federation of Malaya and in line with national policy, the Board of Governors agreed to accept the government funding and assistant for the administration of the school. It was renamed Hwa Chiao National Type Secondary School (Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Hwa Chiao) with the appointment of Mr Tseng Hsi Kuei as Principal.
Due to the shortage of classrooms, the school operated in two sessions per day i.e. morning for upper secondary and afternoon for lower secondary from 1959.
In 1963 the Board of Governors of the school felt that the name "Hwa Chiao" was no longer appropriate as it carries the meaning of "Chinese abroad" while most of the Chinese in Malaya has been granted citizenship. The school was renamed "Seg Hwa National Type Secondary School" (Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Seg Hwa). "Seg Hwa" means "the Chinese of Segamat".
