[[Honest leftmost branch]]

CATEGORIES: Trees (set theory)

In set theory, an honest leftmost branch of a tree T on ω × γ is a branch (maximal chain) ƒ ∈ T such that for each branch g ∈ T, one has ∀ n ∈ ω : ƒ(n) ≤ g(n). Here, T denotes the set of branches of maximal length of T, ω is the ordinal (represented by the natural numbers N) and γ is some other ordinal.
