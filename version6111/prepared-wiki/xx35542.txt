Geikie Gorge National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, [tpl]convert|1837|km|mi|0[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Great Circle Distance between Geike Gorge National Park and Perth|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/distancedraw2?rec1=293571&placename=perth&placetype=0&state=WA+&place1=GEIKIE+GORGE+NATIONAL+PARK&place1long=125.755562&place1lat=-18.045000|publisher=Geoscience Australia|date=March 2004[/tpl] (great circle distance) northeast of Perth and approximately [tpl]convert|420|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Broome by road.
The gorge was named in honour of Sir Archibald Geikie, the Director General of Geological Survey for Great Britain and Ireland when it was given its European name in 1883. Sir Archibald never visited the gorge and in due course the traditional owners, the Bunuba people, hope that it will be more generally known by its Aboriginal name, Darngku.
The park is one of the most accessible in the Kimberley as it is only [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Fitzroy Crossing and is serviced by a bitumen road. No camping is allowed in the park and visitors can only enter during the day. The park has picnic shelters, barbecue areas, toilets and water available.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kimberleyaustralia.com/geikie-gorge-national-park.html|title=Kimberley Australia - Travel Guide|year=2009|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl]
A [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|0|adj=on[/tpl] walk trail exists along the eastern base of the gorge walls although the terrain is rough and uneven it does offer an excellent view.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/walking_wheretowalk.pdf|title=Where to Walk in WA|year=2006|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] The western side of the gorge is closed to visitors as it is a nature preserve. Tour boats also operate in the gorge and a boat ramp is available for the public to use.
The gorge has been formed by the Fitzroy River and the level of the river in the wet season can rise by up to [tpl]convert|16.5|m|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl].  The flood level can be clearly seen on the walls where the abrasive action of the floodwaters on the limestone has scoured the surface white.
The limestone was originally a reef formed not by corals but by algae and lime secreting organisms that are now extinct. The reef was formed in the Devonian period when the reeding waters allowed the organisms to build a reef up to [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] thick. The remains of the reef now stand as the limestone range that wind across the countryside up to [tpl]convert|100|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl] above the plains. Fossils from the devonian can be found within the limestone strata. 
The river water sustains an abundance of life including barramundi, sawfish and freshwater crocodiles all of which can be found in the gorge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelmate.com.au/Places/Places.asp?TownName=Fitzroy+Crossing_%5C_WA|title=Travelmate - Fitzroy Crossing WA|year=2009|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl]
The vegetation that fringes the river bank includes River Gums, freshwater mangroves, pandanus, cadjeput and native figs. Dense banks of reeds are also found along the banks. The flora provides a suitable habitat for a range of fauna including fruit bats, lilac-crowned wren, reed warbler and the great bowerbird.
