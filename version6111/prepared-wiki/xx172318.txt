Symptoms were first reported late on 2 August 2007 on farmland located in Normandy in Surrey, which was subsequently isolated and placed under restrictions.[ref]

The following day the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) Debby Reynolds confirmed that initial testing revealed that 60 cattle were infected with foot-and-mouth disease and 
that other potential cases were being investigated.
On the 4 August the virus was identified as the FMDV BFS 1860 O1 1967 (Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus, British Field Strain 1860, serotype O, subtype 1, isolated in 1967; also referred to as strain BFS 1860/UK/67
), a virus isolated in the 1967 outbreak and until the 2007 outbreak, not in circulation in animals. It was the same strain as used at the nearby Pirbright laboratory site, which houses separate units of the Institute for Animal Health and Merial Animal Health Ltd at Pirbright, [tpl]convert|2+1/2|mi|km[/tpl] away, which was identified as a possible source of infection, as it is one of only four European laboratories authorised to handle that strain of the virus to produce vaccines, the next nearest being in Belgium.[ref]"Foot and Mouth Disease Summary Epidemiological Report" – DEFRA Dated 9 August 2007

As a result the isolation zone was extended.[ref]

The laboratory carries out research into foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as well as other diseases affecting livestock.
On 5 August another protection zone was created near Elstead after a cow at one of the two other locations used by the farm tested positive. The herd at both locations had already been slaughtered the previous day as a standard precautionary measure.[ref]

On 7 August the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) issued a report - "Initial report on potential breaches to biosecurity at the Pirbright site, 2007"Initial report on potential breaches to biosecurity at the Pirbright site, 2007 – HSE
which contained the following comments –

On 9 August, a farmer who let the land at the site of the second outbreak reported some cows on his own farm to DEFRA as a precautionary measure. A 3 km Temporary Control Zone was established,[ref]"Declaration of a Temporary Control Zone" (PDF). DEFRA. Dated 9 August 2007 21:15

on August 11 when negative test results were returned.
Three further potential outbreaks were investigated during August, at a farm elsewhere in Surrey; at the Chessington World of Adventures zoo; and at a farm near Romney in Kent. All three tested negative for foot and mouth.
On 24 August, following a lack of further outbreaks since the initial discovery, Defra lifted the protection zones around the farms.The Times Sat 24 August 2007 Page 4. Also

==Second outbreak==

On 12 September a new case of foot and mouth was found 30 miles from the original case at Milton Park Farm in Egham, Surrey.[ref]

Separately, a Temporary Control Zone was put around a premises in Norfolk as a precautionary measure following a veterinary visit.  Laboratory results for these animals were also negative and so the local restrictions were lifted the next evening.

==Precautions==

All livestock at the 3 geographically separate locations were destroyed on 4 August. A nationwide ban on the movement of cattle and pigs has been imposed, with a [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] protection zone currently in place around the affected farm and a further [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] zone of cattle surveillance. An [tpl]convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] aerial exclusion zone has been set up around the site.

==Reaction==

===International reaction===

Following the confirmation of the outbreak, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have closed all of their ports to livestock, fresh meat and non-pasteurised milk imports, and have ordered disinfectant measures to be put in place at ports and airports all over the island.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mhcwcwauojsn/rss2/|title=Disinfectant measures ordered at ports and airports|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|date=2007-08-04|accessdate = 2007-08-04[/tpl] Additionally, Canada has blocked the entry of any livestock from the United Kingdom (including, for the moment, Northern Ireland) into the country, and Japan and the United States have blocked the entry of pigs and pig products. British beef is already banned in both of these countries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070804.wfootandmouth0804/BNStory/Front|title=British livestock exports banned|publisher=theglobeandmail.com|date=2007-08-04|accessdate = 2007-08-05|location=Toronto[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

===Scientific reaction===

On the prospect of the virus emanating from one of the Pirbright establishments, emeritus professor of bacteriology Hugh Pennington was quoted as saying, "If we know exactly where the virus has come from, and particularly if it's a vaccine type of virus, it's less likely to be a nasty virus."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6931858.stm|title=Disease labs face safety inquiry|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-08-05|accessdate = 2007-08-05[/tpl]
Dr King, a former head of molecular biology at the IAH, was quoted in The Times as saying "As far as I am concerned the authorities have failed to find any chink in the armoury of the establishment’s bio-security. What you are left with is human movement, which is not a matter for the institute, it’s a police matter. It’s very, very unlikely that it could be spread by accident. People do not spread the disease easily."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2231397.ece|title=Fresh outbreak of virus suspected as scientists point to sabotage as cause|publisher=The Times|date=2007-08-10|accessdate = 2007-08-10 | location=London | first1=Lewis | last1=Smith | first2=Will | last2=Pavia[/tpl]

===Political reaction===

The Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Environment Secretary Hilary Benn returned to London early from their holidays, in a story broken by BBC News journalist Gary O'Donoghue that in turn led to accusations of discrimination against the BBC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052864/Five-figure-payout-BBC-reporter-taken-TV-news-blind.html|title=Five-figure payout for BBC reporter taken off the TV news 'because he was blind'|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2008-09-07|accessdate=2008-09-07 | location=London|first=Paul|last=Revoir[/tpl] Welsh Minister for Rural Affairs Elin Jones cut short her holiday to New Zealand,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6932239.stm|title=Abattoir lay-offs after outbreak|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-08-06|accessdate=2007-08-10[/tpl] and opposition leader David Cameron also cancelled his holiday in Brittany. A COBRA meeting took place shortly before the official announcement, with the Prime Minister participating on a telephone link.

==Investigation==

A report into the epidemic was released on September 5. It reported that traces of the virus were found in a pipe at the Pirbright institute running from Merial to the government's treatment plant. It is thought that tree roots damaged the pipe allowing the virus to the surface. The report hypothesises that site workmen conveyed the virus to the Normandy farm en route home from work.BBC News
An independent investigation carried out by Professor Brian Geoffrey Spratt, who received a CBE for his work, found that due to the recognition that infected material could survive the initial citric acid disinfection stage within the Merial plant, the effluent system up to the final caustic soda treatment plant was considered by Defra inspectors to be within the scope of Category 4 containment, yet it appeared not to have been subject to regular inspection and there was evidence of leakage both from broken pipework and via unsealed, overflowing manholes –

==Media Reporting==

The media were the only people to breach the Police cordons. At the time Surrey Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Rowley said "So far, two photographers have been arrested for breaching cordons, despite the obvious need to protect the area and clear signs prohibiting entry. No members of the public have tried to get inside contaminated areas and unfortunately the only attempted breaches have been by some of the media." [ref]
"Trading Standards and police warn people to respect Foot and Mouth restrictions" – Surrey Police Dated 9 August 2007

Peter Denard from Surrey Trading Standards added "This is a virulent disease spread on contact and proximity. The idea that anyone not wearing protective clothing and taking no bio-security measures is trampling through a potentially contaminated area of the countryside is beyond belief!". 
The two photographers, Philip Hollis of The Daily Telegraph and James Purkiss, were later found guilty under the Animal Health Act for ignoring prohibitions and entering protected sites. Hollis was fined £2,000 and ordered him to pay £5,000 costs. Purkiss was sentenced to 140 hours of community service, and fined £1,150. [ref]
