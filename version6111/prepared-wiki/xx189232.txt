[[Selinum carvifolia]]

CATEGORIES: Apiaceae

Selinum carvifolia is a flowering plant of the genus Selinum in the family Apiaceae.It is a plant of fens and damp meadows,growing in most of Europe,with the exception of much of the Mediterranean region,eastwards to Central Asia.Its common name in English is Cambridge Milk Parsley,because it is confined,in the U.K.,to the county of Cambridgeshire and bears some similarity in appearance to Milk Parsley (Thyselium palustre, formerly known as Peucedanum palustre),an umbellifer of another genus,but found in similar,moist habitats.
S.carvifolia used also to occur in the English counties of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire but is now extinct in both.Umbellifers of the British Isles B.S.B.I. Handbook No.2.  Tutin,T.G. Pub. Botanical Society of the British Isles,London 1980.
