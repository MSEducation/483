[[Hepatitis A virus cis-acting replication element]]

CATEGORIES: Hepatitis A

In molecular biology, the Hepatitis A virus cis-acting replication element (CRE) is an s an RNA element which is found in the coding region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is larger than the CREs found in related Picornavirus species, but is thought to be functionally similar. It is thought to be involved in uridylylation of VPg.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yang|first=Y|coauthors=Yi, M; Evans, DJ; Simmonds, P; Lemon, SM|title=Identification of a conserved RNA replication element (cre) within the 3Dpol-coding sequence of hepatoviruses.|journal=Journal of virology|date=October 2008|volume=82|issue=20|pages=10118â€“28|pmid=18684812[/tpl]
