Rouché's theorem, named after [tpl]Link-interwiki|en=Eugène Rouché|lang=fr[/tpl], states that if the  complex-valued functions f and g are holomorphic inside and on some closed contour K, with |g(z)|

==Geometric explanation==

It is possible to provide an informal explanation of Rouche's theorem.
Let C be a closed, simple curve (i.e., not self-intersecting).  Let h(z) = f(z) + g(z).  If f and g are both holomorphic on the interior of C, then h must also be holomorphic on the interior of C. Then, with the conditions imposed above, the Rouche's theorem in its original (and not symmetric) form says that
Notice that the condition |f(z)| > |h(z) − f(z)| means that for any z, the distance from f(z) to the origin is larger than the length of h(z) − f(z), which in the following picture means that for each point on the blue curve, the segment joining it to the origin is larger than the green segment associated with it. Informally we can say that the blue curve f(z) is always closer to the red curve h(z) than it is to the origin.
The previous paragraph shows that h(z) must wind around the origin exactly as many times as f(z).  The index of both curves around zero is therefore the same, so by the argument principle, f(z) and h(z)  must have the same number of zeros inside C.
One popular, informal way to summarize this argument is as follows: If a person were to walk a dog on a leash around and around a tree, and if the length of the leash is less than the minimum radius of the walk, then the person and the dog go around the tree an equal number of times.

==Applications==

Rouché's theorem can also be used to give a short proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.  Let
One advantage of this proof over the others is that it shows not only that a polynomial must have a zero but the number of its zeros is equal to its degree (counting, as usual, multiplicity).
Another use of Rouché's theorem is to prove the open mapping theorem for analytic functions. We refer to the article for the proof.

==Proof of symmetric form of Rouché's theorem==

By the argument principle, this winding number is given by
where NF(K) is the number of zeros of F inside K, PF(K) is the number of poles inside K. Hence NF = PF. But F is the ratio of two holomorphic functions f and g inside K, and so the zeros are those of f and the poles are the zeros of g (after canceling out the common zeros of f and g). That is,
as required.
