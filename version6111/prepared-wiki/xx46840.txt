</ref> The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) is responsible for scrutinising public spending throughout the UK on behalf of the [[British Parliament]] and is independent of Government. It provides reports on the value for money of many PFI transactions and makes recommendations. The [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] and [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] also provide reports on these issues at a UK-wide level. The [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own equivalents of the NAO such as the Wales Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Audit Office which review PFI projects in their respective localities. In recent years the Finance Committees of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have held enquiries into whether PFI represents good value for money.

===Local government===

PFI is used in both central and local government. In the case of local government projects, the capital element of the funding which enables the local authority to pay the private sector for these projects is given by central government in the form of what are known as PFI "credits". The local authority then selects a private company to perform the work, and transfers detailed control of the project, and in theory the risk, to the company.

===Appraisal process===

Jeremy Colman, former deputy general of the National Audit Office and Auditor General for Wales is quoted in the Financial Times saying that many PFI appraisals suffer from "spurious precision" and others are based on "pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo". Some, he says, are simply "utter rubbish". He noted government pressures on contracting authorities to weight their appraisals in favour of taking their projects down the PFI route: "If the answer comes out wrong you don't get your project. So the answer doesn't come out wrong very often."[tpl]Citation| last = Timmins| first = N.| title = Warning of 'Spurious' Figures on Value of PFI| newspaper = The Financial Times| date = 5 June 2002| url = http://www.ft.com[/tpl]
In a paper published in the British Medical Journal, the magazine of the medical trade union, the BMA, a team consisting of two public health specialists and an economist concluded that many PFI appraisals do not correctly calculate the true risks involved. They argued that the appraisal system is highly subjective in its evaluation of risk transferral to the private sector. An example was an NHS project where the risk that clinical cost savings might not be achieved was theoretically transferred to the private sector. In the appraisal this risk was valued at Â£5m but in practice the private contractor had no responsibility for ensuring clinical cost-savings and faced no penalty if there were none. Therefore the supposed risk transfer was in fact spurious.[tpl]Citation| last1 = Gaffney  | first1 = D.| last2 = Pollock | first2 = Allyson M.| last3 = Price | first3 = D.| last4 = Shaoul | first4 = J.| title = PFI in the NHS: is there an economic case?| journal = British Medical Journal| volume = 319| issue =| pages =| publisher =| location =| year = 1999| url =| issn = [/tpl]
In 2012, it was reported that dozens of hospitals labouring under PFI-related debts were at risk of closure.[tpl]cite web |last= Hern |first= Alex |date= 26 June 2012 |title= Live near one of these hospitals?
