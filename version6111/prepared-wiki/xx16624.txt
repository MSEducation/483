Turning the other cheek is a phrase in Christian doctrine that refers to responding to an aggressor without violence.

==Scriptural reference==

The phrase originates from the Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament. In the Gospel of Matthew, an alternative for "an eye for an eye" is given by Jesus:

In the Sermon on the Plain[tpl]bibleref|Luke|16:17|KJV[/tpl] - This is a different location than the sermon on the mount of Matthew. in the Gospel of Luke, as part of his command to "love your enemies", Jesus says:

This passage is viewed by some[tpl]whom?|date=June 2012[/tpl] as commanding nonresistance, Christian pacifism or nonviolence on the part of the victim.

==Interpretations==

This phrase, as with much of the Sermon on the Mount, has been subjected to both literal and figurative interpretations. See also Sermon on the Mount#Interpretations.

===Christian anarchist interpretation===

Since the passages call for total nonresistance to the point of facilitating aggression against oneself, and since human governments defend themselves by military force, this has led some into Christian anarchism, including the notable Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, author of the nonfiction book The Kingdom of God Is Within You. 

===Nonviolent resistance interpretation===

The scholar Walter Wink, in his book Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination, interprets the passage as ways to subvert the power structures of the time.[tpl]cite book |last= Wink |first= Walter |date= 1992 |title= Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination | pages = 175-182 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qNAEjt_Yh5cC |location= |publisher= Fortress Press |isbn= 978-0800626464 |accessdate= December 27, 2013 [/tpl] He says that at the time of Jesus, striking someone deemed to be of a lower class with the back of the hand was used to assert authority and dominance. If the persecuted person "turned the other cheek," the discipliner was faced with a dilemma. The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek the persecuted was demanding equality.
Wink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10–13). By giving the lender the cloak as well the debtor was reduced to nakedness. He notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20–23).
Wink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions.[tpl]cite book |author=Th. Mommsen |title=Codex Theodosianus 8:5:1|url=http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Constitutiones/CTh08.html#5[/tpl] In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.[tpl]cite book |author=Michael Avi-Yonah |title=The Jews Under Roman and Byzantine Rule: A Political History of Palestine from the Bar Kokhba War to the Arab Conquest[/tpl]

===Righteous personal conduct interpretation===

Another interpretation is that Jesus was not changing the meaning of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" but restoring it to the original context. Jesus starts his statement with "you have heard it said", which could mean that he was clarifying a misconception, as opposed to "it is written" which could be a reference to scripture.  The common misconception seems to be that people were using Exodus 21:24-25 (the guidelines for a magistrate to punish convicted offenders) as a justification for personal vengeance.  In this context, the command to "turn the other cheek" would not be a command to allow someone to beat or rob a person, but a command not to take vengeance.

===Game theory===

Obadiah Shoher in his book "Jesus and Christ" points out that the injunction is limited: Jesus only admonishes to offer the cheek once more, not forever. Thus, the offender is given a second chance to reform. Such tolerance is a good strategy in small communities of generally well-wishing like-minded religious people where an offense is likely unintentional and therefore does not call for immediate retribution as in the general society which the Book of Exodus deals with.
