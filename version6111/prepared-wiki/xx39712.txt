[[Ayah]]

CATEGORIES: Ayat, Arrangement of the Quran

Ayah (or Aayah; [tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|آية[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|āyah[/tpl], plural: ayat (ayaat) [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]large|آيات[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|āyāt[/tpl]) means "evidence" or "sign". In the context of Islam's principal scripture, the Qur'an, ayah is used to mean "verse", i.e. each statement or paragraph marked by a number.
Although meaning "verse" when using the Qur'an, it is doubtful whether "ayah" means anything other than "sign" or "remarkable event" in the Qur'an's text. The "signs" refer to various phenomena, ranging from the universe, its creation, the alternation between day and night, rainfall, the life and growth plants, etc. Other references are to miracles or to the rewards of belief and the fate of unbelievers.[tpl]cite book |last=Campo |first=Juan E. |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |year=2009 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |isbn=9780816054541 |pages=77[/tpl] For example:
Chapters in the Quran consist of several verses, varying in number from 3 to 286. Within a long chapter, the verses may be further grouped into thematic sequences or passages.
For the purpose of interpretation, the verses are separated into two groups: those that are clear and unambiguous (muhkam) and those that are allegorical (mutashabeh).The Ayahs of the Quran: The Muhkam and the Mutashabih (Association of Islamic Charitable Projects). This distinction is based on the Quran itself: "It is God Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are 'clear', they are the foundation of the Book. Others are 'allegorical' but those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: We believe in the Book, the whole of it is from our Lord. And none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.""Ali-Imran 3:7 from the Yusuf Ali translation of the Quran online at the Quranic Arabic Corpus.
The word ayah is also used to refer to the verses of the Bible by Arab Christians and Christians in countries where Arabic words are used for religious terms.For example, [tpl]cite web |title='Yesus' Siapakah Dia? |url=http://www.kabarindonesia.com/berita.php?pil=19&dn=20070103185551 |work=KabarIndonesia |accessdate=21 July 2011 |language=Indonesian |quote=...Kejadian 1:26.

A common myth persists that the number of verses in the Quran is 6,666.[tpl]cite book |last=Hixon |first=Lex |title=The heart of the Qurʼan : an introduction to Islamic spirituality |year=2003 |publisher=Quest |isbn=9780835608220 |edition=2. ed.[/tpl] In fact, the total number of verses in all chapters is 6,236, although this varies depending on how (or if) the Basmala appearing at the start of each chapter are counted.
