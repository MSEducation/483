Bahnbetriebswerk Hermeskeil is a small, Prussian locomotive depot at Hermeskeil, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany that dates from 1888. Until 1903 it was called a Maschinenstation (engine station).
The locomotive depot is directly opposite the station building at Hermeskeil station and has a six-road roundhouse (originally two-road) and a 16m turntable (originally 13m). From 1956 the depot became an outstation of Simmern locomotive depot but this was closed on 1 April 1959.
