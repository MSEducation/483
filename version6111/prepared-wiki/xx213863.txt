Bloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future.  She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times.  The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend.  The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation games.

==Ritual==

Historically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards while holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face.[tpl]cite book | authorlink= | first=Bill| last=Ellis| title=Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture| publisher=University of Kentucky Press| year=2004| isbn=0-8131-2289-9[/tpl] There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were destined to die before they married.[tpl]cite book | authorlink=Ronald Hutton| first=Ronald| last=Hutton| title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2001| isbn=0-19-285448-8[/tpl]
In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups (usually teenagers) who ritualistically invoke her name, usually by repeatedly chanting her name in a mirror placed in a dimly lit room.  The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, a witch or ghost; can be friendly or evil; and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood.  The lore surrounding the ritual (if she is summoned properly) states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,Bloody Mary at Urban Legends or scratching their eyes out.Bloody Mary; www.Halloween–Website.com; accessed .
A modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's tenuous connection to Queen Mary I, also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/bloodymary.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Bloody Mary|publisher=Snopes[/tpl]

==Phenomenon explained==

Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room may eventually cause one to hallucinate.  Facial features may appear to "melt" or disappear, and other hallucinations (such as faces) may appear.  This phenomenon is believed to be a consequence of sensory deprivation—causing our brain's facial-recognition system to misfire.The Strange Face in the Mirror Illusion; referencing Caputo's October 18, 2012 "Perception Magazine" article; Mindhacks; accessed December 2013.
