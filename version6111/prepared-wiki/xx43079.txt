==Etymology==

Rogaland is the Norse name of the region – revived in modern times.  Until 1919 the name of the county was Stavanger amt.  It has been argued that the first element is the plural genitive case of rygir, the name of an old Germanic tribe (see Rugians). The last element is land n 'land, region'. In Norse times the region was alternatively called Rygjafylki (see Ryfylke).
