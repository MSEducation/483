MS Genève is the oldest paddle ship of Lake Geneva. 
Genève was built in 1896 by Sulzer for the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman. She was launched for the Swiss national exhibition in Geneva.
Genève was the theater of the death of Elisabeth of Bavaria on 10 September 1898. The wounded Empress, who had been stabbed, boarded the ship, where her condition was seen to be life-threatening, and Genève turned around to return her to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage, where she died shortly afterwards.
On 3 May 1928, near Pully, Genève collided with the Rhône. The left anchor of Genève became entangled into the rigging of the Rhône, breaking her bowsprit and her figurehead, and snapping the top of the fore-mast. A passenger was killed by a falling piece of the fore-mast.
In 1934, Genève went under a refit, where her steam machinery was replaced with diesel engines. She was the first CGN ship to be converted to diesel.
In 1973, Genève was taken out of commission and sold for scrap. The next year, she was purchased by an "Association pour le Bateau Genève" for 75 000 CHF, and moored at Eaux-Vives dock. She is now unserviceable, but still afloat.
The name Genève was taken by a CGN swift boat on 31 October 2007.
