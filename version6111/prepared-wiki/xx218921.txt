Maine Eastern Railroad [tpl]reporting mark|MERR[/tpl] is a railroad that operates in coastal Maine between Brunswick and Rockland on the state-owned Rockland Branch rail line. Maine Eastern connects with the Amtrak Downeaster and Pan Am Railways at Brunswick Maine Street Station. 
The company provides freight service year-round, and passenger service seasonally between Brunswick and Rockland with former New Haven/Amtrak EMD FL-9 locomotives and stainless steel streamlined passenger cars.
Maine Eastern is the successor to Safe Handling Rail, which took over operation of the MaineDOT-owned line when the Maine Coast Railroad chose not to bid on a new contract.
Maine Eastern is a subsidiary of the Morristown & Erie Railway of New Jersey, who won the bid to operate the line in 2003. Commodities moved in freight service include cement, plate steel, and perlite.
