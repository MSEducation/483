==Chemical triggers==

Multiple chemicals have been reported to trigger MCS symptoms.  In addition to anything which is perfumed or scented, complaints are commonly formed about everyday items:
Multiple food intolerances can be masked by a delayed reaction. These are not allergic reactions, and cannot be tested, only discovered by an elimination diet.
In a review of a two-phase population study, respondents with MCS indicated cleaning agents (88.4%), pesticides (81.2%), perfumes (81.2%), vehicle exhaust (72.5%), the products used in barber shops and beauty salons (60.9%), new carpeting (53.6%), new furniture (39.1%), chlorine in drinking water (29.1%), and fresh ink (26.1%) were the products most often reported to trigger reactions in the respondents.  They also indicated smoke from a fireplace, wood stove, or barbecue grill, and secondhand tobacco smoke were triggers for reactions.Caress SM, and Steinemann, AC (September 2003).

==Diagnosis==

People who have developed symptoms of MCS have attributed a wide assortment of symptoms to chemical exposure, though symptoms are generally consistent for each individual.  The first step in diagnosing a potential MCS sufferer is to identify and treat all other conditions which are present and which often explain the reported symptoms.  For example, true allergy, thyroid disorders, orthostatic syndromes, anxiety, and depression need to be carefully evaluated and, if present, properly treated.
The "gold standard" procedure for identifying a person who has MCS is to test his or her response to the random introduction of chemicals the patient has self-identified as relevant, such as scented soaps or dryer sheets.  This may be done in a carefully designed challenge booth to eliminate the possibility of contaminants in the room.  Chemicals and controls, sometimes called prompts, are introduced in a random method, usually scent-masked.  The test subject does not know when a prompt is being given.  Objective and subjective responses are measured.  Objective measures, such as the galvanic skin response electrodermal response, indicate psychological arousal, such as fear, anxiety, or anger.  Subjective responses include patient self-reports.  A diagnosis of MCS can only be justified when the subject cannot consciously distinguish between chemicals and controls, and when responses are consistently present with exposure to chemicals and consistently absent when prompted by a control.

==Treatment==

In various studies, about one half of the patients who present with symptoms of MCS meet the criteria for depressive and anxiety disorders, and these conditions must be treated when present.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lax MB, Henneberger PK |title=Patients with multiple chemical sensitivities in an occupational health clinic: presentation and follow-up |journal=Arch. Environ. Health |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=425–31 |year=1995 |pmid=8572720 |doi= 10.1080/00039896.1995.9935978|url=[/tpl] The use of SSRI antidepressants with a 53-year-old man with multiple chemical sensitivities showed a dramatic improvement, which suggests, as with the general population, a subgroup of MCS patients may have an atypical depression and should be evaluated for this condition.[tpl]cite journal |author=Andiné P, Rönnbäck L, Järvholm B |title=Successful use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in a patient with multiple chemical sensitivities |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=82–3 |date=July 1997 |pmid=9259230 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb09910.x|url=[/tpl]
Another study showed psychotherapy resulted in significant, long-term improvement in MCS symptoms, although there was no control group to which to compare results.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lacour M, Zunder T, Dettenkofer M, Schönbeck S, Lüdtke R, Scheidt C |title=An interdisciplinary therapeutic approach for dealing with patients attributing chronic fatigue and functional memory disorders to environmental poisoning—a pilot study |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=204 |issue=5-6 |pages=339–46 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11885358 |doi= 10.1078/1438-4639-00103|url=[/tpl]
While patients typically resist the potentially stigmatizing diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, many MCS sufferers benefit strongly from lifestyle changes.  A 2003 survey of 917 MCS patients revealed the two most effective treatments for MCS, in order of self-perceived harm/benefit ratio, were a chemical-free living space and chemical avoidance.  Next came prayer and meditation, which presumably did no harm.  By comparison, two-thirds of patients who had tried Zoloft thought it was harmful. Other treatments with perceived harm included other pharmaceutical drugs, provocative neutralization, hydrogen peroxide, Metagenics' UltraClear medical food, and microhydrin antioxidants.  Overall, one or more antidepressants and anxiolytics were rated harmful by about half of survey respondents who had tried them, and as either harmless or helpful by the remaining respondents.
Other treatment modalities variably consist of the avoidance of known irritants, nutritional support to purge the body of its toxic load, sauna detoxification and autolymphycyte factor treatment.
Because many people eliminate whole categories of food in an effort to reduce symptoms, a complete review of the patient's diet may be needed to avoid nutritional deficiencies.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/magazine/26wwln_diagnosis.html?_r=1&n=Top/News/Health/Diseases,%20Conditions,%20and%20Health%20Topics/Allergies&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin |title=On Her Last Legs - New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-25 |format= |work=The New York Times | first1=Lisa | last1=Sanders | date=2006-02-26[/tpl]

==History==

Allergist Theron G. Randolph (1906–1995) was the first to describe "the chemical intolerance phenomenon" in the mid-20th century, calling it "unwitting addiction" and comparing it to drug and alcohol addiction, with the addiction cycle being transparent to the patient as a masked intolerance.Miller, Claudia. Toxicant-induced Loss of Tolerance" Addiction 96 (2000), 115–139. When Randolph formulated his views, the term allergy was not connected with immunology, as it has been since the late 1960s. It was then that non-immune-mediated hypersensitivities came to be called "intolerances", "idiopathic" or "idiosyncratic reactions" or "pseudoallergies". Randolph's theory was dismissed from the realm of allergology as the condition is not mediated by the humoral immune system.

==Epidemiology==

As Magill and Seruda report:
 Most patients (85 to 90 percent) complaining of MCS syndrome are women. Most present between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Much additional basic descriptive and epidemiologic information is still unknown. The incidence and prevalence are unknown. The question of whether MCS is becoming more or less common is unanswered, as is the question of whether it is preventable. The natural history and biologic outcomes of MCS are unknown, and descriptions of MCS in primary care settings have not been reported. Selected patients from specialty settings comprise reports of the syndrome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Magill MK, Suruda A |title=Multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=721–8 |date=September 1998 |pmid=9750540 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980901ap/magill.html[/tpl] 

===Relationship to Gulf War syndrome===

Several clinical and epidemiological studies conducted in the United States and in the United Kingdom have investigated the occurrence of MCS in military personnel deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1990s.  Some of the health complaints and symptoms reported by veterans of the Gulf War attributed to Gulf War syndrome are similar to those reported for MCS, including headache, fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, inability to concentrate, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal issues.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gray GC, Gackstetter GD, Kang HK, Graham JT, Scott KC | year = 2004 | title = After more than 10 years of Gulf War Veteran medical evaluations, what have we learned? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventative Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 443–452 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.02.006[/tpl]
A population-based, cross-sectional epidemiological study involving American veterans of the Gulf War, non-Gulf War veterans, and non-deployed reservists enlisted both during Gulf War era and outside the Gulf War era concluded the prevalence of MCS-type symptoms in Gulf War veterans was somewhat higher than in non-Gulf War veterans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Black DW, Doebbeling BN, Voelker MD, Clarke WR, Woolson RF, Barrett DH, Schwartz DA | year = 2000 | title = Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome.  Symptom prevalence and the risk factors in a military population | url = | journal = Archive of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = | pages = 1169–1176 | doi=10.1001/archinte.160.8.1169[/tpl]  After adjusting for potentially confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, and military training), there was a robust association between individuals with MCS-type symptoms and psychiatric treatment (either therapy or medication) before deployment and, therefore, before any possible deployment-connected chemical exposures.
The odds of reporting MCS or chronic multiple-symptom illness was 3.5 times greater for Gulf War veterans than non-Gulf veterans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Thomas HV, Stimpson NJ, Weightman AL, Dunstan F, Lewis G | year = 2006 | title = Systematic review of multi-symptom conditions in Gulf War veterans."

Gulf War veterans have an increased rate of multiple-symptom conditions compared to military personnel deployed to other conflicts, and although it is unexplained, Gulf War syndrome is not considered distinct from other medically unexplained syndromes observed in civilian populations, including MCS.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ismail K, Lewis G | year = 2006 | title = Multi-symptom illnesses, unexplained illness, and Gulf War Syndrome | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 361 | issue = | pages = 543–551 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1815[/tpl]
