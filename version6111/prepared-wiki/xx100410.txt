==Fictional character biography==

Arclight served with the American ground forces during the Vietnam War, and she is still haunted by memories of that place.X-Factor vol. 1 #10 (November 1986) She has redirected her rage into bodybuilding, which she uses to augment her mutant powers.  Her mutant ability enables her to create shock waves through physical contact, usually combined with her super strength in form of punches and blows.  During a few of her appearances she has been shown to project a bright light upon impact of her hands.
As a war veteran, she is well versed in battle and is known as one of the most bloodthirsty members of the Marauders, the group responsible for the "Mutant Massacre". Her relationship with teammate Scalphunter has also made her second-in-command. During their first mission, Arclight kills dozens of underground-dwelling mutants known as Morlocks. She also took some time off to answer Superia's invitation to join her female group of villains, the Femizons.Power Pack vol. 1 #27 (December 1986)
Though the details of her recruitment by Mister Sinister to the Marauders remain unrevealed, she has participated in all of the group's major operations.  Due to Sinister cloning the Marauders multiple times, it is hard to determine if the 'original' Arclight has been present in all of them.
Following M-Day, Arclight became one of the so-called 198, one of the few remaining mutants retaining their powers, and a refugee at the X-Mansion.X-Men: The 198 #2-5 (April–July 2006) She later returns as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old members like Scalphunter and new ones like Sunfire and Lady Mastermind.X-Men vol. 2 #200
During Messiah CompleX in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is injured by Wolfsbane who bites her in the neck.X-Men #200-203 (August–November 2007) She is seen later being defeated by Rockslide.New X-Men #46 (March 2008)
