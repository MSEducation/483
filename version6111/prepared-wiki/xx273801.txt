[[Cyber-utopianism]]

CATEGORIES: Cyberspace, Social theories, Philosophy of technology

Cyber-utopianism – the belief that online communication is in itself emancipatory, and that the Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor – has accompanied the Internet from its beginnings; and was the subject of critique by the Critical Art Ensemble as early as 1995.Stepehn Wilson, Information Arts (2002) p. 477 While the romantic view of cyberspace was partially dented by the bursting of the Dot-com bubble, utopian views of the internet continued to re-invent themselves through the Noughties.P. Buckley/D. Clark, The Rough Guide to the Internet (2009) p. 312-5
In 2011, cyber-utopianism, particularly in global politics, was powerfully critiqued by Evgeny Morozov in his 2011 book The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom. R. Sassower, Digital Exposure: Postmodern Capitalism (2013) p. ix and p. 16 Acknowledging his own past as a cyber-utopian, Morozov calls the belief naive and stubborn for its refusal to acknowledge the downside – the opportunities for authoritarian monitoring and control - of cyber-space.[tpl]cite book|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=The Net Delusion|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-353-3[/tpl]
He goes on to blame the "former hippies" in the 1990s, for causing this utopian belief.

==Origins: Californian ideology==

The Californian Ideology is a set of beliefs combining bohemian and anti-authoritarian attitudes from the counterculture of the 1960s with techno-utopianism and support for neoliberal economic policies. These beliefs are thought by some to have been characteristic of the culture of the IT industry in Silicon Valley and the West Coast of the United States during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2 |title=The Californian Ideology |last1=Barbrook |first1=Richard |last2=Cameron |first2=Andy |date= |website=Imaginary Futures |publisher= |accessdate=Arpil 27, 2014[/tpl] Adam Curtis connects it to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. 
Such an ideology of digital utopianism fuelled the first generation of Internet pioneers.J.M Reagle jr, Good Faith Collaboration (2010) p. 162

==Further criticisms==

Critical reservations about popular positivist readings of the Internet have surfaced repeatedly over the decades:
In an article from The New Yorker from 2010, Malcolm Gladwell argues his doubts about the emancipatory and empowering qualities of social media in general. In the article he criticizes Clay Shirky for propagating and overestimating the revolutionary potential of social media. In the conclusion he says: "Shirky considers this model of activism an upgrade. But it is simply a form of organizing which favors the weak-tie connections that give us access to information over the strong-tie connections that help us persevere in the face of danger."

==Cognate utopias==

Cyber-utopianism is somewhat derivative of the views espoused by the Extropians, whose ultimate goal is to upload human consciousness to the Internet.
Additionally, Ray Kurweil's books, especially The Age of Spiritual Machines, espouses a kind of cyber-utopianism, in that he views an event, the Singularity, where advances in technology will be so rapid as to represent a barrier after which life will be experientially different, incomprehensible, and advanced.

==Cyber-dystopia==

In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements.[tpl]cite book |last=Nye |first=David E. |date=August 2007  |title=Technology Matters: Questions to Live With  |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-matters |location= |publisher=The MIT Press |page= |isbn=9780262640671 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 [/tpl] Cyber dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. In her book Personal Connections, Nancy Baym talks about the way a cyber dystopia would negatively affect social interactions. "The dystopian alternative is usually articulated as a fear that new media will take people away from their intimate relationships, as they substitute mediated relationships or even media use itself for face to face engagement."(Personal Connections (2010) 36) She compares this fear with the fear that many felt during the introduction of the television and the telephone, as people grew weary about the potential for substitution of meaningful relationships.[tpl]cite book |last=Baym |first=Nancy K. |date=Apr 2010 |title=Personal Connections in the Digital Age |url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745643328 |location= |publisher=Polity |page=28-36 |isbn=9780745643311 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 [/tpl]
