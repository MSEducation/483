Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo (29 September 1807 – 17 December 1859) (Baqueiro 1896) was a liberal Yucatecan politician, who was 5 times governor of Yucatán between 1841 and 1853.
Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo was born in the city of Campeche, a son of Manuel Barbachano and his wife, the former Maria Josefa Tarrazo.
He was one of the staunchest advocates for the independence of Yucatán from Mexico, but historical circumstances led to Yucatán twice declaring its independence while Barbachano was out of power, and twice Barbachano arranged for Yucatán's reunification with Mexico.
He generally alternated in power with the centrist Santiago Méndez, who was more in favor of union with Mexico but was driven to declare independence by the excesses of Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.
The final reunification was due to the crisis of the Caste War of Yucatán.
