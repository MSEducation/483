[[Selimus]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Selimus is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species S. venustus is found in Brazil.
Saaristo (2006) erroneously erected a genus of the same name in the family Theridiidae for the species Anelosimus placens, described by Blackwall in 1877 as Theridion placens, and moved to Anelosimus by Saaristo (1978). If this new genus is valid it will have to be renamed.World Spider Catalog 8.5
