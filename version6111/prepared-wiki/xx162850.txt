In the first half of 1894, 24 proofs of the Barber series dimes were minted in San Francisco, which is where the S in the common name of the coin comes from. Very little is known as fact about the dimes. The superintendent of the San Francisco Mint is said to have had them minted as gifts for some important bankers. Further, three of the dimes were said to have been given to the superintendent's daughter, who allegedly spent one on ice cream and sold the other two in the 1950s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
