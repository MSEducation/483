==Criticism and controversy==

===Hackers had free access for years without being detected===

In September 1991, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was discovered in the act of hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel.[tpl]cite news|last=Khatchadourian |first=Raffi |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all |title=WikiLeaks and Julian Paul Assange |work=The New Yorker |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2012[/tpl]
In 2004, it was discovered that crackers (malicious hackers) gained almost complete access to Nortel's systems. Thought to have originated in 2000, for nearly ten years they accessed documents including emails, technical papers, research, development reports, and business plans. The breach was not properly addressed by the time the company started selling some of its assets in 2009, following a bankruptcy filing. The Wall Street Journal reports that hackers working from Chinese IP addresses used seven passwords of Nortel executives, including a former CEO, to penetrate networks owned by the company.
Brian Shields, a former systems security advisor for Nortel, led an internal investigation on the breach and exposed rootkit software on at least two machines in 2009 that allowed hackers to control them remotely and monitor email. Despite the original discovery in 2004 and the subsequent investigation that led to the rootkit detection in 2009, Nortel allegedly ignored the problem and failed to disclose it to potential buyers of its business. Avaya and Genband both acquired parts of Nortel, and some employees used old Nortel machines connected to the new companies' networks. Although Avaya says it has dealt with the issue, Shields says "it's despicable that Nortel didn't say anything," leaving it up to him to inform the new company of his investigation. Nortel refused to comment on The Wall Street Journal report, but former CEO Mike Zafirovski, in charge between 2005 and 2009, claimed the company "did not believe it was a real issue."[ref]

===Government bailouts===

====2003====

On Feb 16, 2003 the Winnipeg Sun published an article criticising the Canadian Federal government for propping up “mega-loser Nortel” through Export Development Canada (EDC). The article interviewed Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who termed this EDC support as "corporate welfare at its worst." Mr Robinson was appalled that Canadians who already lost billions on Nortel on the stock market would be asked for even more money through their taxes to support Nortel.

====2009====

EDC had agreed to provide up to $30 million in short-term financing through an existing bonding facility. The Canadian government resisted characterizing its position on Nortel as a bailout.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idCAN1446286920090114 | work=Reuters | first=Randall | last=Palmer | title=UPDATE 2-Canada government pledges to help Nortel | date=January 14, 2009[/tpl]

Until 2005 Nortel fully funded the disability insurance in its HWT. However, it is alleged that since then, the HWT Governance Committees and third party trustee, Northern Trust, breached their fiduciary duties to protect Nortel's disabled employees and survivors of deceased employees by allowing Nortel to misdirect over $100 million from the HWT for purposes inconsistent with the terms of the HWT.Systemic Failure of Employer Sponsored Disability Insurance

===Bookkeeping irregularities===

In 2007 both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission laid charges against former senior financial officials from Nortel including Frank Dunn who was fired from Nortel in 2004. Frank Dunn was promoted from chief financial officer to replace John A. Roth as CEO in November, 2001. According to the SEC, Dunn and three other financial officers began to fudge revenue by misusing "bill and hold" transactions starting "no later than September, 2000". The SEC said that at least a year's worth of the alleged book-keeping took place while John Roth was still CEO of Nortel, even though no charges were laid against him.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ex-nortel-ceo-john-roth-says-hes-cleared/article87339/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Boyd | last=Erman | title=Ex-Nortel CEO John Roth says he's cleared – The Globe and Mail | date=March 13, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070312.rnortelroth0312/BNStory/Front |title=Unknown |work=The Globe and Mail |date=March 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Executive compensation===

====2001 compensation====

In the article “Nortel's Roth Rakes It In” published by Light Reading, Nortel was criticized for raising its CEO’s pay just days before he announced his intention to retire in May 2001. The article went on to state that Nortel’s share prices tumbled almost twentyfold during Roth’s years at the helm of Nortel and its number of employees dropped dramatically.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=12855 |title=Nortel's Roth Rakes It In – Telecom News Analysis |publisher=Light Reading |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2012[/tpl]

====2003 compensation====

In 2003 Nortel paid tens of millions of dollars in so-called "return to profitability" bonuses, largely to a select group of senior managers. The "return to profitability" has been alleged to be a fabrication achieved by the release of $490 million in reserves to boost earnings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-39.htm |title=SEC Charges Four Former Senior Executives of Nortel |publisher=Sec.gov |date=March 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011[/tpl]

====2009 compensation====

As Nortel entered bankruptcy proceedings, it paid out retention bonuses to almost 1,000 top executives, totalling up to US$45 million, drawing criticism as the company withheld severance payments to employees laid-off prior to the creditor protection filing. Nortel proceeded with thousands of additional layoffs without severance,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1329547 |title=Nortel slashes 10% of workforce |work=National Post[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1327983 |title=Nortel cuts another 3,200 workers worldwide with no severance pay |work=National Post |date=February 25, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2011[/tpl] and the pension fund remained underfunded,[tpl]cite web|first=Kelly M. |last=Teal |url=http://www.xchangemag.com/articles/an-oral-history-inside-nortels-meltdown.html |title=An Oral History: Inside Nortel's Meltdown |publisher=Xchangemag.com |date=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2011[/tpl] while Nortel paid $14.2 million in cash to seven executives. Nortel also paid $1.4 million to ten former and current directors, and paid $140 million to lawyers, pension, human resources and financial experts helping to oversee the company’s bankruptcy proceedings.

====2010 compensation====

In a U.S. court filing on February 11, 2010, Nortel proposed to spend $92.3M on retention bonuses for 1,475 employees in its Nortel Business Services and Corporate groups. According to the plan, Christopher Ricaurte, president of Nortel Business Services, would receive $2.5 million in incentives. In all, Canadian employees were eligible for $27 million, U.S. employees $55 million, and about $10 million would go to others. This proposed plan came the same week Nortel negotiated a $57-million deal to wind up health care and other benefits for former Canadian employees.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Nortel%20allots%20staff/2553490/story.html |title=Nortel allots $92.3M for top staff |work=Ottawa Citizen[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] Claiming that the retention bonuses proposal was extraordinary, acting US trustee Roberta DeAngelis objected to the payment of $55.6 million to 866 employees. However, court appointed representatives for Nortel former employees, who are creditors in the Ontario bankruptcy court, have signed an agreement to not oppose any employee incentive program.

===Treatment of Nortel pensioners===

On June 23, 2010 the News and Observer published a story criticizing treatment pensioners have been receiving from their former employer, Nortel. According to the article, Nortel has asked a federal court to terminate medical coverage, prescription drug coverage, long-term disability, and life insurance of 4,000 retirees and dependents, claiming the benefits are costing the company $2 million per month. Nortel blamed the company's creditors for this decision.

===Nortel ex-CEO files as a creditor seeking $1 billion from the proceeds of bankruptcy===

In the middle of the decade several class-action lawsuits were filed against John Roth and others, by former employees who felt that their 401K company plans were depleted due to misrepresentation by the defendants. They claimed they were duped into investing in Nortel stock, when those who encouraged them to do so allegedly knew that the company was ailing. John Roth left Nortel in 2001 with more than $130 million.
In 2009 Mr. Roth filed a claim for $1 billion, aiming to become a creditor to the assets of Nortel along with all other Nortel employees, in case the class action lawsuits against him succeeded.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/12/17/nortel-john-roth-lawsuits.html#ixzz17Fo2R8fU |work=CBC News |date=December 17, 2009 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][ref]

===Conflicts of interest===

During Nortel's 2002 annual shareholders' meeting held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, several shareholders (including Robert Verdun) complained about non-arms-length relationships with service providers such as director Yves Fortier, who provided legal services to Nortel while sitting on its board, and Nortel's auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, who were paid $15 million for non-auditing services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=14491 |title=Shareholders Blast Nortel – Telecom News Analysis |publisher=Light Reading |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2012[/tpl]
