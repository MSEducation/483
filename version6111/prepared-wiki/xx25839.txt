[[Xukuru people]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Brazil, Indigenous peoples of Eastern Brazil

The Xukuru (Xucuru) are an indigenous people of Brazil, with a population of approximately 8,500, living in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. They have recently gained governmental  recognition of their rights to their indigenous homeland in the Ororubo Mountains, though this has brought them into conflict with the local settler population of the region. In 1998, a Xukuru leader, Chic√£o (Francisco Lacerda), was assassinated, apparently because of his opposition to the encroachment of ranchers in Xukuru territory. However his children carried on his legacy and the Lacerda family line still lives on today.
