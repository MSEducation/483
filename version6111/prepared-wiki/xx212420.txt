==History==

In November 1850, Grass Valley held its first election under an oak tree on the site where the home was soon built. The following year, in 1851, a building was constructed on the property and used as an office for Gilmor Meredithâ€™s Gold Hill Mining Company. The building was used as a schoolhouse in 1852.  
Montez moved to Grass Valley in 1853 and purchased the building for her home. She hosted parties in her salon, kept a pet bear, and mentored the young Lotta Crabtree whose home (later, a historical landmark) was on the same street.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257&dq=grass+%22lola+montez%22&source=web&ots=8QNhG1qdu6&sig=krCTfyBMTL01hVoRknOHBPzsFM0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |pages=257 |title=Historic spots in California: Fifth Edition |last=Hoover |first=M.B. |coauthors=Kyle, D.E. & Rensch, E.G. |year=2002 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=0-8047-4483-1[/tpl] Montez left Grass Valley in 1855.
