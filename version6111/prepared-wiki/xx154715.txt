==Critical reception==

Greg Prato of Allmusic said, "you hear a band that had pretty much found their sound early on".  He compared the band favorably to other pop-metal bands of the time, but said the album was "aimed at die-hard die-hard Stryper fans".  Ken Pierce of Piercing Metal said the songs "rock quite well and are a fun listen", but also stated that  the release was for die-hard fans.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.piercingmetal.com/cd_stryper_roxxregime.htm | title=Reviews:Roxx Regime Demos 1983 | author=Pierce, Ken | accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl]
