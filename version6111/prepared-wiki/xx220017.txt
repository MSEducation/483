==Reviews==

The sleeve notes of the CD "Irish Dance Music" say that this music is described "as representative of the quality music played by a hard core of active traditional musicians in Dublin at the time.  Bill Harte and Sonny are reputed to have been among the pioneers who saw the potential for Irish music making in the button accordion pitched B/C and subsequently devised and disseminated the fingering method".
