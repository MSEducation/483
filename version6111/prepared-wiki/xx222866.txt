CATEGORIES: Channel 23 digital TV stations in the United States

WDPM-DT is a religious television station in Mobile, Alabama, which broadcast locally on UHF channel 23 as an affiliate of the Daystar Television Network. Broadcasting from its transmitter near Robertsdale, Alabama, the station signed on after the analog signal of WSRE (PBS channel 23) signed off for the last time on February 17, 2009.
Since the "channel 23.1" series of virtual channel designations already identifies the existing PBS member station's digital subchannels, this numbering sequence would not be available to the new station. According to the ATSC standard, WDPM-DT's channel numbers would therefore need to be displayed (using PSIP) using numbering based on WSRE's digital channel number, 31.ATSC standard A/65C, Annex 'B', Advanced Television Systems Committee, May 2006. From sign-on until February 2010, the station displayed as Channel 4.1, which is considered a violation of these standards.  This was corrected for several months, but is currently happening again.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The audio of this digital broadcast is also in perpetual clipping mode. The average is about 7dB hotter than current limits of digital broadcast audio and is "breaking up" on all programs. (Oct 2011 referenced)
