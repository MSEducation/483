Brochiloricaria is a small genus of armored catfishes native to South America.

==Species==

There are currently two recognized species in this genus: [tpl]FishBase genus | genus = Brochiloricaria| month = December | year = 2011[/tpl]

==Appearance and anatomy==

Brochiloricaria is morphologically very similar to Loricaria and can be distinguished from the latter only by its teeth characteristics; in Brochiloricaria, the teeth are very long and of equal size on both jaws, while in Loricaria the premaxillary teeth are almost two times longer than dentary teeth.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01462p040.pdf|title=The genera of the Neotropical armored catfish subfamily Loricariinae (Siluriformes: Loricariidae): a practical key and synopsis|first=Raphael|last=Covain|author2=Fisch-Muller, Sonia|journal=Zootaxa|volume=1462|pages=1–40|year=2007|format=PDF[/tpl] However, dentition may not be a reliable characteristic to differentiate to genera, so Brochiloricaria may actually be a synonym of Loricaria.
Both species of Brochiloricaria reach almost 30 centimetres (12 in) in length.

==Ecology==

Brochiloricaria is an abdomino-lip brooder.
