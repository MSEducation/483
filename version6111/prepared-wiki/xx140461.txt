Soundbeam is an interactive MIDI hardware and software system developed by The Soundbeam Project / EMS in which movement within a series of ultrasonic beams is used to control multimedia hardware and software.

==System==

Soundbeam uses a combination of ultrasound (SONAR) and tangible (foot controller) inputs to generate MIDI messages.  The SONAR uses 50 KHz signals.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct01/articles/soundbeam.asp?session=15873131355f7ea0a84d1c418f418009 |title=Music and Movement: Soundbeam 2 MIDI Performance Controller |accessdate=4 January 2009 |work=Reviews: MIDI Controller |publisher=Sound on Sound |date=October 2001[/tpl]

===Version history===

==Implementation==

Originally designed by Edward Williams for the production of avant-garde dance music, Soundbeam has been used primarily in the field of special needs education due to the minimal physical movement required for its operation. David Jackson's Tonewall project has utilized Soundbeam since 1992.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.jaxontonewall.com/soundbeam/soundbeam.htm/ |title=David Jackson's Tonewall |accessdate=4 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Jaxon Tonewall |date=6 November 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Due to the system's ability for expansion with four sensors and eight switches, installations have included DAW synchronization (such as with Reason or Ableton), as well as live video manipulation such as Arkaos, (Resolume and Vvvv).
There are many thousands of users of Soundbeam throughout the world, and there are many film examples available on YouTube and on the Soundbeam projects website.
