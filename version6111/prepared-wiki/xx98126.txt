Wade Dooley (born 2 October 1957) is a former England rugby union international who played lock forward. He played for his country 55 times and was known as the "Blackpool Tower", as a result of being 6 feet 8Â inches tall and a police officer with Lancashire Constabulary in Blackpool.
Dooley was born in Warrington, Northern England and played rugby league as a teenager, taking up rugby union aged 19. He played most of his career for Preston Grasshoppers, where he was nurtured by former England international and coach Dick Greenwood. He also had a brief spell with Fylde.
Dooley made his international debut on 5 January 1985 against Romania. He later established a second row partnership with fellow police officer Paul Ackford.
In 1987 he broke the cheekbone of Welsh player Phil Davies with a punch during a rough game in Cardiff. http://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/features/columnists/peter-jackson/5218/peter-jackson-the-force-is-no-longer-with-welsh-club-rugby/
