[[Newsreel]]

CATEGORIES: Newsreels

A newsreel is a form of short documentary film prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century, regularly released in a public presentation place and containing filmed news stories and items of topical interest. It was a source of news, current affairs, and entertainment for millions of moviegoers until television supplanted its role in the 1950s. Newsreels are now considered significant historical documents, since they are often the only audiovisual record of historical and cultural events of those times.Australian Screen: Cine sound Movie tone Australian Newsreel Collection (1929 - 1975)
