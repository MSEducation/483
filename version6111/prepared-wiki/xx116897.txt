Toyota was caught using illegal turbo restrictors at the Rally Catalunya and were given a one-year ban by the FIA. FIA president Max Mosley called the illegal turbo restrictor "the most sophisticated device I've ever seen in 30 years of motor sports." Toyota and their drivers, Juha Kankkunen, Didier Auriol and Armin Schwarz, were also stripped of all points in the championships. Kankkunen had been in contention for the drivers' world title. Mosley stated that "there is no suggestion the drivers were aware of what was going on."[tpl]cite news | title=Toyota team pick up a one-year ban | work=The Independent | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/toyota-team-pick-up-a-oneyear-ban-1537474.html | accessdate=8 June 2009 | location=London | date=4 November 1995[/tpl]
