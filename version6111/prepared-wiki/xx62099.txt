==History==

In the early 1990s, the owner of Tofino Air, and a lifelong resident of British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, started a small regional airline called "Midcoast Air," to better assure safety and dependability for himself and his co-workers as they travelled from the logging and fishing camps on BC's west coast, to their homes on the Sunshine Coast. In 1998, Midcoast Air re-located to Sechelt.
In January 2001, Tofino Air purchased Pacific Spirit Air based in Silva Bay on Gabriola Island. After purchasing Pacific Spirit Air, Tofino Air increased its daily routes by adding in scheduled flights from Gabriola Island to Vancouver International Airport. The airline also continued offering daily scheduled flights between Departure Bay in Nanaimo and Sechelt.
In April 2011, Tofino Air moved from its location in Departure Bay to the Harbour of Nanaimo where it began to offer scheduled flights between Nanaimo and Vancouver. In late May 2011, Tofino Air was one of the first airlines to move into the new Vancouver Harbour Water Airport, and began to offer scheduled flights to Nanaimo, Sechelt and Tofino.
