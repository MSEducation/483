==Heritage==

The Bath Grounds get their name from the Ivanhoe Baths, a Neo-Grecian Spa building designed by Robert Chaplin. The spa opened in 1822 and was named after the Sir Walter Scott novel Ivanhoe which mentions the local area. The adjacent Royal Hotel, opened in 1827, was originally built to accommodate the rapidly increasing number of visitors to the spa. The Ivanhoe Baths were closed on 22 March 1884, caused by falling visitor numbers due to the new preference of seaside resorts over spa resorts. The buildings remained unused and gradually decayed, eventually getting demolished almost 60 years later for health and safety reasons. The Royal Hotel remained, standing to the West of the Bath Grounds, and was granted a grade 2 listed building status in 1950.http://bathgroundsregeneration.co.uk/history.html
Remnants of the spa buildings are still visible within the Bath Grounds, including stone fragments from the columns, pediments and cornices.http://bathgroundsregeneration.co.uk/PDF's/NODE-%20Heritage%20statement.pdf

==Other Uses==

==Controversies==

The Bath Grounds is currently at the centre of a controversial development dispute, in which it is proposed by Oaklands Hotels Ltd - owners of the grounds and adjactent Royal Hotel- that five houses will be built on the grounds, covering around a fifth of the available green space.https://plans.nwleics.gov.uk/public-access/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=N0J5TKLR63000 The proposals have been met with fierce local opposition including petitions, objection letters, local media coverage and the formation of a "Friends of Ashby Bath Grounds" Facebook group.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Friends-of-Ashby-Bath-Grounds/429756810485645
