Victor Edward Galway (24 May 1894â€”9 July 1960) was a New Zealand music academic, organist, conductor and composer.

==Biography==

Victor Galway was born in Colchester, Essex, England. He attended Ayr Academy and studied organ under Frederick Ely. In 1911 he emigrated with his family to Australia, where he studied music at the University of Melbourne. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1916, and in 1923 became the university's first student to complete the requirements for the Doctor of Music degree. 
In 1919 Galway moved to Dunedin, New Zealand, to take up the position of organist and choirmaster at First Church of Otago. He became the first lecturer in music at the University of Otago in 1925, and the first Blair Professor of Music at the university in 1939. That year he also left his post at First Church to become organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's Cathedral, Dunedin.
Galway also served as conductor of the Dunedin Choral Society, conductor of the Otago University Musical Society, and president of the Otago Society of Musicians. Most of his compositions were for choral music, and several of his pieces were published by Oxford University Press.
In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal,[tpl]cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work= Evening Post | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4 [/tpl] and in 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.[tpl]cite book | first=Alister|last=Taylor| title=The New Zealand Roll of Honour| publisher=Alister Taylor| year=1998 | ISBN=0-908578-58-X| pages=411[/tpl]
