==Professional life==

===Early Modern India===

Koch's work has made considerable contributions to the historical understanding of early modern India. In collaboration with the Indian architect Richard A. Barraud she conducted major surveys of the palaces and gardens of Shah Jahan, reconstructed the Mughal city of Agra, and produced the first, comprehensive documentation of the Taj Mahal. Through this work, Koch has developed one of the largest archives of photographs and measured drawings of the Islamic architecture of the Indian subcontinent.
She has also contributed to recording Mughal painting and applied arts, the artistic connections between Europe and Mughal India, and imperial symbolism.TV interview with  reporter Stephen Grant  on the  Taj Mahal and  The Complete Taj Mahal  for  the programme "Daily Planet",  Discovery Channel Canada, "Canada's flagship daily science news magazine show (www.exn.ca/dailyplanet)", 13 December 2006

===Methodology===

Koch supports establishing art as an historical source, believing that an integrative approach can provide the key to the political and ideological concepts of the historical period being studied. Architecture and art emerge as a means of communication, through a topos of symbols, and like language and literature, they represent vital clues in the study of cultural and political history.
In her work with the Mughal Empire, informed by the written sources, she utilises the art historian’s technique of formal analysis: utilising elements of the aesthetics of art, architectural form, building type, garden and urban design to form an understanding of the period. This approach has uncovered aspects of the Mughal culture which were never recorded, but expressed only in architecture and the arts.Narayani Gupta, Ira Pande,  "A Conversation with Ebba Koch", India International Centre Quarterly (Autumn 2007), pp. 138-150.
