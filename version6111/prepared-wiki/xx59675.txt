==Plot summary==

A group of scientific researchers, isolated in Antarctica by the nearly-ended winter, discover an alien spaceship buried in the ice, where it crashed twenty million years before. They try to thaw the inside of the spacecraft with a thermite charge, but end up accidentally destroying it when the ship's magnesium hull is ignited by the charge. However, they do recover the alien pilot from the ancient ice, which the researchers believe was searching for heat when it was frozen. Thawing revives the alien, a being which can assume the shape, memories, and personality of any living thing it devours, while maintaining its original body mass for further reproduction. Unknown to them, the alien immediately kills and then imitates the crew's physicist, a man named Connant; with some 90 pounds of its matter left over it tries to become a sled dog. The crew discovers the dog-Thing and kills it in the process of transformation. Pathologist Blair, who had lobbied for thawing the Thing, goes insane with paranoia and guilt, vowing to kill everyone at the base in order to save mankind; he is isolated within a locked cabin at their outpost. Connant is also isolated as a precaution and a "rule-of-four" is initiated in which all personnel must remain under the close scrutiny of three others.
The crew realizes they must isolate themselves and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, while pretending things are normal over their radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempt from civilization. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic, able to read minds and project thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned.
Everyone suspects each other by now but must stay together for safety, deciding who will take turns sleeping and speculating when the patient monsters will finally have the upper hand. Tensions mount and some men begin to go mad thinking they are already the last human or wondering if they would even know if they weren't human any longer. Ultimately, one of the crew members is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing. McReady realizes that even small pieces of the creature will behave as independent, selfish organisms. He then uses this weakness to test which men have been "converted" by taking blood samples from everyone and dipping a heated wire in the vial of blood. Each man's blood is tested, one at a time, and the donor is immediately killed if his blood recoils from the wire; fourteen in all, including Connant and Garry, are revealed as aliens. They go to test the isolated Blair and on the way see the first albatross of the Antarctic Spring flying overhead; they shoot the bird to prevent a Thing from taking it over and flying to civilization.
When they reach Blair's cabin they discover he is a Thing. They realize that it has been left to its own devices for a week, coming and going as it pleased, able to squeeze under doors by transforming itself. With the creatures inside the base destroyed, McReady and two others enter the cabin to kill the Thing that was once Blair. McReady systematically forces it out into the snow and methodically destroys it with a blowtorch. Afterwards the trio discover that the Thing was dangerously close to finishing construction of an atomic-powered anti-gravity device that would have allowed it to escape to the outside world.
 "No, by the grace of God, who evidently does hear very well, even down here, and the margin of half an hour, we keep our world, and the planets of the system too. Anti-gravity, you know, and atomic power. Because They came from another sun, a star beyond the stars. They came from a world with a bluer sun." 

==Adaptations==

===Film===

====Versions====

Who Goes There? has been adapted three times as a motion picture.
The Thing from Another World (1951) was a rather loose adaptation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/165516-building-the-perfect-star-beast-the-antecedents-of-alien/|work=PopMatters|date=2012-11-21|title=Building the Perfect Star Beast: The Antecedents of 'Alien'|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III[/tpl] It featured James Arness as the Thing, Kenneth Tobey as the Air Force officer, and Robert O. Cornthwaite as the lead scientist.
Its 1982 remake The Thing stuck more closely to Campbell's original story. John Carpenter directed the film from a Bill Lancaster screenplay. Prior to John Carpenter's involvement, William F. Nolan, author of Logan's Run, wrote a Who Goes There? screen treatment for Universal Studios in 1978, but it was not published until 2009 in the Rocket Ride Books edition of Who Goes There?; Nolan's alternate take on Campbell's story downplays monster elements in favor of an "imposter" theme, in a vein similar to The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney.
A third adaptation, also titled The Thing, was released on October 14, 2011. It serves as a prequel to the events of Carpenter's film.

====Depictions====

In first film adaptation, the alien is a humanoid invader (i.e., two arms, two legs, a head) from an unknown planet. A plant-based life form, the alien and its race need animal blood to survive. He, or rather it, is a one-alien army, capable of creating an entire army of invaders from seed pods contained in (his) body.
In the 1982 remake of The Thing, director John Carpenter’s idea was to not compete with the direction of the original film. In both the novella and Carpenter's more faithful adaptation, the Thing can imitate any animal-based life form, absorbing the respective hosts' personalities and memories along with their bodies. When the story begins, the creature has already been discovered and released from the ice by another expedition. This version maintains the digestions and transformations alluded to in the original novella, via practical effects such as animatronics.
The 2011 film "The Thing" followed the vision of John Carpenter by acting as a prequel, explaining the fate of the expedition which originally found the creature and its ship. The movie follows Carpenter's depiction, with the creature depicted using a combination of costume effects and CGI.

====The sled dogs (the Thing in action)====

The sled dogs appear in the novella and first two film versions.  They are the first to be assimilated by the Thing in the novella.  In the 1951 adaptation, the alien uses their blood for sustenance. Both the novella and the 1982 adaptation contain one of the most disturbing, and (for some viewers) repulsive scenes: a Thing-dog caught in mid-transformation. In both versions, McCready/MacReady and the others respond in fear, disgust, and anger, destroying the Thing-dog with fire. This is the first confirmation of the Thing's existence, raising immediate doubts about who among the research station scientists and support staff has been assimilated by the Thing.

===Comics===

In 1976, the story was also published in comic book form in issue 1 of Starstream (script by Arnold Drake and art by Jack Abel).[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.comics.org/issue/30564/ |title = Starstream #1 (1976) |publisher = the Grand Comics Database[/tpl]

===Radio drama===

The story has been adapted as a radio drama. BBC Radio first broadcast their version on 24 January 2002.

===Elsewhere===

In December 1936, John W. Campbell published a story titled "Brain Stealers of Mars" in Thrilling Wonder Stories, which also features shape-shifting, mind-reading aliens.   The earlier story has a humorous tone, but takes a philosophical note as members of another alien race describe living stoically alongside the shapeshifters.[tpl]cite book | first = Isaac last = Asimov | title = Before The Golden Age: A Science Fiction Anthology of The 1930s | issue=Book 3 | page=775 | publisher = Doubleday |year= 1974[/tpl]
The Thing is one of the aliens featured in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials. Barlowe's main illustration depicts the Thing halfway through its transformation into a sled dog.
The story is referenced, and embedded within The Rack of Baal, a 'choose-your-own-adventure' gamebook written by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, about a time-travelling special agent called "The Falcon".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=146 |title=Falcon |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08[/tpl] A section of the plot plays out on a frozen world occupied by a single mining station crewed by only a few people. One inhabitant is one called 'Sil McReady', who, in a cynical inversion of the original story, actually turns out to be infected with the alien organism.
The episode "Ice" of the science fiction TV series The X-Files borrows its premise from the storyline. The episode "The Thingy!" of the family action-comedy series The Aquabats! Super Show! also borrows the story's premise, albeit in a much more comedic tone.
In 2010, Canadian science fiction writer Peter Watts published a short story called "The Things"[tpl]cite web|url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/ |title=The Things |publisher=Clarkesworld Magazine |date=January 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-21[/tpl] in which the alien entity from "Who Goes There?" is the first-person narrator. The characters and events in "The Things" are the same as those in the original story. Confused, damaged, and unfamiliar with earth biology, the alien only slowly begins to understand why it has been received with such hostility. "The Things" was nominated for a number of awards, including the Hugo; it won the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for best short story.  In 2011, "The Things" was recorded and released by Escape Pod as an audio podcast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://escapepod.org/2011/06/23/ep298-the-things/ |title=The Things |publisher=Escape Pod, episode 298 |date=June 23, 2011[/tpl]

==Characters in Who Goes There?==

===Secondary magnetic expedition===

Although the expedition based at Big Magnet comprises 37 members, only 17 are named in the story, and all but three by last name alone. By the end of the story, 15 of them have been replaced by alien impostors.
