Later, he was Deputy Attorney General of the United States and worked at the law firm of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. He was senior legal advisor to Barack Obama during Obama's presidential campaign and one of three members of Obama's vice-presidential selection committee. As a result of the Fast and Furious investigation, he became the only cabinet member in US history to be held in contempt of Congress.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/28/eric-holder-contempt-historic-congress-vote | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ed | last=Pilkington | title=Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress after historic vote | date=June 28, 2012[/tpl]

He worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund during his first summer and the United States Attorney during his second summer.

==Career==

After graduating from law school, Holder joined the U.S. Justice Department's new Public Integrity Section during an interval lasting from 1976 to 1988. During his time there, he assisted in the prosecution of Democratic Congressman John Jenrette for bribery discovered in the Abscam sting operation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D9113BF931A35755C0A962958260|title=Indictment of a Congressman: the Legal Case; Prosecutor No Stranger To Corruption in Politics |last=Lewis |first=Neil A. |work=U.S. |format=Article |date=June 2, 1994 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 19, 2008[/tpl] In 1988, Ronald Reagan appointed Holder to serve as a judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.muckety.com/2008/06/05/obama-picks-caroline-kennedy-eric-holder-to-join-johnson-in-vp-search/3221 |title=Obama picks Caroline Kennedy, Holder, Johnson to lead Vice-Presidential candidate search |accessdate=June 29, 2008 |last=Memmott |first=A.

Holder stepped down from the bench in 1993 to accept an appointment as United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from President Bill Clinton. He was the first black American U.S. Attorney in that office. At the beginning of his tenure, he oversaw the conclusion of the corruption case against Dan Rostenkowski, part of the Congressional Post Office scandal. He was a U.S. Attorney until his elevation to Deputy Attorney General in 1997. Holder also served on The George Washington University's Board of Trustees in 1996 and 1997.

===Deputy Attorney General===

In 1997, after the retirement of Jamie Gorelick, Clinton nominated Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General under Janet Reno. Holder was confirmed several months later in the Senate by a unanimous vote.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB1F38F93BA25754C0A961958260 |title=Nominee Confirmed For Deputy Position at the Justice Dept. |accessdate=November 15, 2008|date=July 18, 1997|work=Archives [/tpl] During his confirmation hearing, Holder's opposition to the death penalty was questioned, but he pledged his intention to cooperate with the current laws and Reno, saying, "I am not a proponent of the death penalty, but I will enforce the law as this Congress gives it to us."[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE3DA153FF937A25755C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink |title=Justice Dept.

As Deputy Attorney General, Holder's primary responsibilities were in the areas of budget and personnel issues; this also included resolving disputes among department heads and briefing reporters on policy initiatives, national security issue, and major investigations, including the FBI investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-02-18/us/9902_18_justice.olympics_1_federal-probe-justice-department-bid?_s=PM:US |title=Federal Probe of Salt Lake Olympic Bid Pretty Wide |date=February 18, 1999|publisher=CNN [/tpl] Holder later advised Reno in the matters regarding the Independent Counsel statute. Reno made the decision to permit Kenneth Starr to expand his investigation into the Lewinsky affair, leading to Clinton's impeachment.
In the wake of the murders of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Holder was a vocal proponent of new hate crimes laws in the United States. Holder said that the current laws placed major constraints on the ability of federal investigators and prosecutors to assist in these types of cases.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-03-12/politics/hate.crimes_1_crimes-bill-crimes-legislation-victims?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS|title=Hate Crimes Legislation Introduced in Congress |date=March 12, 1999|publisher=CNN [/tpl]
In his final days with the Clinton administration, Holder carried out his duties with Clinton's last-minute pardon of fugitive and Democratic contributor Marc Rich. Regarding discussions with the White House lawyers on the issue, Holder said he was at first "neutral" on the decision to grant Rich a pardon, but might lean in favor of it if there were national security benefits. Holder said that he was told that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had asked Clinton to grant the pardon. Holder said that, at the time, he did not give the case much thought, because he did not think the pardon would be granted, as no fugitive had ever previously been granted a presidential pardon. He later said he wished that he had looked into it more thoroughly,[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-02-08/justice/pardon.probe.03_1_evasion-and-illegal-oil-marc-rich-pincus-green?_s=PM:LAW |title=Holder Faces Grilling on Marc Rich Pardon |date=February 8, 2001|publisher=CNN [/tpl] and expressed regret over the incident.

Republicans on the House Government Reform Committee disagreed with Holder's version and alleged that he was a knowing participant, according to a 2003 report. They said Holder failed to fully inform prosecutors of the pending pardon, and they criticized his "neutral leaning favorable" opinion to Clinton.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DB1239F930A25750C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Marc Rich Panel Says Top Justice Dept.

Former FBI director, Louis Freeh, commented on the matter in 2009, saying that the Clinton White House had "used" Holder and kept both the FBI and the DOJ in the dark as to their full activities around the last minute pardons.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-16/politics/holder.confirmation_1_marc-rich-rich-case-pardon?_s=PM:POLITICS|title=Former FBI Director: Holder was "used" in Rich Pardon|publisher=CNN | date=January 16, 2009[/tpl]

===Private practice===

From 2001 until he became Attorney General, Holder worked as an attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., representing clients such as Merck and the National Football League. He represented the NFL during its dog fighting investigation against Michael Vick.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/11/19/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-eric-holder.html |title=10 Things You Didn’t Know About Eric Holder |last=Hook |first=Carol S. |date=November 19, 2008 |work=Nation & World: Politics |format=Article |work=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=November 23, 2008[/tpl]
In 2004, Holder helped negotiate an agreement with the Justice Department for Chiquita Brands International in a case that involved Chiquita's payment of "protection money" to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a group on the U.S. government's list of terrorist organizations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/international-news/portfolio/2007/09/17/Chiquita-Death-Squads |title=The Banana War |accessdate=November 14, 2008 |date=October 2007 |last=Gray |first=Kevin |work=International News |publisher=Condé Nast Portfolio[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] In the agreement, Chiquita's officials pleaded guilty and paid a fine of $25 million. Holder represented Chiquita in the civil action that grew out of this criminal case. In March 2004, Holder and Covington & Burling were hired by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to act as a special investigator to the Illinois Gaming Board. The investigation was subsequently canceled on May 18, 2004.[tpl]cite news |last=Fusco |first=Chris |title=Holder omitted Blagojevich link from questionnaire |work= Metro |date =December 17, 2008 |url =http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/blagojevich/1334978,CST-NWS-holder17web.article |format =Article |accessdate =December 17, 2008 [/tpl]

During his years in private practice, Holder represented the Swiss private bank UBS. Because of this, he recused himself from participating in the Department of Justice investigation of UBS's abetting of tax evasion by U.S. account-holders and the prosecution of Brad Birkenfeld. (As Attorney General, he also had to bow out of the Roger Clemens contempt of Congress prosecution because the pitcher was once a client of Covington and Burling.)[tpl]cite web|title=Holder cites conflict of interest|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3969529|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Holder|first=Eric|title=Attorney General Eric Holder Speaks at the UBS Press Conference|url=http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2012/ag-speech-121219.html|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
While D.C. v. Heller was being heard by the Supreme Court in 2008, Holder joined the Reno-led amicus brief, which urged the Supreme Court to uphold Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban and said the position of the Department of Justice, from Franklin Roosevelt through Clinton, was that the Second Amendment does not protect an individual right to keep and bear arms for purposes unrelated to a State's operation of a well-regulated militia. Holder said that overturning the 1976 law "opens the door to more people having more access to guns and putting guns on the streets."
In late 2007, Holder joined then-Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign as a senior legal advisor. He served on Obama's vice presidential selection committee.

===War on Terrorism===

As Attorney General, Holder has been a staunch defender of the President's legal right to prosecute the War on Terror. In May 2011, Holder testified before Congress on the legality of the operation where US special forces killed Osama Bin Laden earlier that month. Holder testified that the operation to kill Bin Laden was legal, stating that international law allows for targeting enemy commanders. To support this point, Holder said that computer evidence seized from the raid demonstrated that Bin Laden was still leading al-Qaeda. Moreover, Holder said, the Navy SEALs conducted themselves in a manner consistent with American values, and that the parameters of the mission included capturing Bin Laden.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13370919 |title=Bin Laden Death 'Not Assassination' – Eric Holder|date=May 12, 2011 | work=BBC News[/tpl]
Holder defended the legality of drone strikes against terrorists. Addressing the death of Anwar al-Aulaqi, an American citizen who was an alleged leader of and recruiter for al-Qaeda operating in Yemen, Holder said "The U.S. government's use of lethal force in self defense against a leader of al-Qaeda or an associated force who presents an imminent threat of violent attack would not be unlawful." He outlined a three-part test to affirm the legality of the strikes: the terrorist poses an imminent threat of violence to the United States, capture is not possible and the operation is conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of the law of war.[tpl]cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/holder-speak-targeted-killings-americans/story?id=15851232#.UCzayHCsZcY|title=Holder: When War on Terror Targets Americans|date=March 5, 2012[/tpl]
In April 2011, Holder announced that accused September 11 attack conspirators Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, Walid bin Attash, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi would be tried by military commissions.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-04/us/guantanamo.tribunals_1_civilian-trials-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-military-commission?_s=PM:US | title=Accused 9/11 Terror Suspects to Face Military Trials| publisher=CNN|date=April 4, 2011[/tpl] This decision was a reversal from Holder's position in 2009, when he had previously stated that he would bring the suspects to New York for trial.
Holder said that he believed the trials could have been held in New York or Virginia, but that Congress imposed restrictions on where the trial could be held, removing the decision from him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=63424|title=Holder Refers 9/11 Co-conspirators to Military Tribunal|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=April 4, 2011[/tpl]

====Voting Rights and Redistricting====

Holder is a staunch proponent of defending the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was reauthorized in 2006 with bipartisan support. Holder has criticized new Voter ID laws in Texas, Florida and other states, which he suggests may be politically motivated. In 2011, Holder said, "The reality is that in jurisdictions across the country, both overt and subtle forms of discrimination remain all too common." He went on to criticize Texas redistricting efforts, where the state had increased its population by four million people, most of whom are Latino, but the state had not allocated any new Congressional seats to represent Hispanic voters.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elana-estrin/eric-holder-voting-rights_b_1149462.html |title=Holder Delivers Voting Rights Speech|work=Huffington Post|date=December 14, 2011|first=Elana|last=Estrin[/tpl]
Under Holder's tenure, the DOJ successfully sued Shelby County, Alabama, for a violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The small town of Calera had re-drawn the city council districts without receiving pre-clearance from the DOJ, which is required by Section 5 in order to ensure that Southern states do not use such tactics to weaken political representation for minority communities. For local elections, Calera had divided the African-American part of town, submerging it into two other districts, and eliminating the city's sole African-American councilman. Calera responded by arguing that the process of pre-clearance with the DOJ should no longer be required. On September 21, 2011, the federal district court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, but the decision is being appealed and may likely be decided by the US Supreme Court.[tpl]cite news |url=http://rollingout.com/politics/alabamas-fight-with-justice-department-over-voting-rights-act-going-to-supreme-court/ |title=Alabama's Fight With Justice Department Over Voting Rights Act Going to Supreme Court|date=June 4, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.naacpldf.org/case/shelby-county-alabama-v-holder/ |publisher=NAACP Legal Defense Fund|title=Shelby County Alabama V Holder[/tpl]
In May 2012, with over a dozen states pushing new voter identification laws, Holder stated that he believed these new laws would hamper the ability of the elderly, students and minorities to vote. Regarding voting rights, he said, "for the first time in our lifetimes, we are failing to live up to one of our most noble ideals.” Holder pledged that the DOJ would act "aggressively" in fighting these new laws. He went on to say that "We have to honor the generations that took extraordinary risks" to achieve the right to vote.[tpl]cite news |url=http://rollingout.com/politics/voting-rights-are-under-attack-says-attorney-general-eric-holder/ |title=Voting Rights Are Under Attack Says Attorney General|date=May 31, 2012[/tpl]
In a speech before the NAACP in July 2012, Holder went on to say that the Texas voter ID laws were a "political pretext to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right."[tpl]cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/07/holder-tells-naacp-texas-voter-id-law-hurts-minorities/1#.UCzDVnCsZcY/ |title=Holder Tells NAACP Texas Voter ID Laws Hurt Minorities|work=USA Today| date=July 10, 2012[/tpl] Holder compared the practices of these states to those in the era of Jim Crow segregation.

====Arizona SB 1070====

In May 2010, Holder expressed concerns over reports he had received regarding "Arizona's tough new immigration law". He said that he feared that the law might "lead to racial profiling". Holder received criticism on the political right for criticizing the law before he had read it in its entirety.[tpl]cite news |title=Holder Is Criticized for Comments on Ariz.

However, in July 2010, after the DOJ reviewed the law, Holder filed suit against Arizona on the grounds that the state law is preempted by federal law.  Holder was quoted as saying, "I understand, first off, the frustration of the people of Arizona and the concerns that they have with regard to the amount of illegal immigration that occurs, but the solution that the Arizona legislature came up with is inconsistent with our federal Constitution."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/10/ftn/main6666467.shtml |publisher=CBS News | title=Holder: Ariz.

The controversial law was litigated before the US Supreme Court, and in June 2012, the majority of provisions were struck down. Holder said that although he was pleased that much of the law had been struck down, he remained concerned over the burden it might place on local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law and the possibility that it might be used to discriminate against the Latino community. He vowed to continue to monitor the impact of the law.http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-ag-801.html |publisher= US Department of Justice | date=June 25, 2012
Holder has also stated that he supports comprehensive immigration reform, adding that it is a "matter of civil rights and human rights."http://atlantablackstar.com/2013/04/27/eric-holder-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants-is-a-matter-of-civil-and-human-rights/| date=April 24, 2013

In February 2011, Holder announced that the DOJ would no longer defend cases involving the Defense of Marriage Act in court. Holder had recommended this course of action to the President, arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, as laws that prohibit the marriage of gay couples do not meet the legal principle of strict scrutiny. Holder cited changing law in support of his action: "Much of the legal landscape has changed in the 15 years since Congress passed DOMA.  The Supreme Court has ruled that laws criminalizing homosexual conduct are unconstitutional. Congress has repealed the military’s Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy. Several lower courts have ruled DOMA itself to be unconstitutional." This decision was prompted by legal deadlines in two federal cases in Connecticut and New York, where same-sex married couples argued that DOMA's ban on federal benefits to those in gay marriages approved by the individual states, violates the Constitution's requirement of equal treatment.http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20035398-503544.html/|title=Obama Administration Will No Longer Defend DOMA|publisher=CBS News |date=February 23, 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
In February 2012, Holder reaffirmed his position and stated that the DOJ would not defend DOMA in a legal challenge brought by members of the US military, who were seeking benefits for their same-sex spouses, including: medical insurance, visitation rights in military hospitals and survivor benefits.[tpl]cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/ag-holder-doj-wont-defend-a-challenge-to-doma-brought-by-members-of-military/|title=AG Holder: DOJ Won’t Defend a Challenge to DOMA Brought by Members of Military|publisher=ABC News|date=February 17, 2012[/tpl]
Holder has also advocated for the interests of the 36,000 same-sex partnerships where Americans are in relationships with non-US citizens. In May 2011, Holder set aside the decision to deport Paul Dorman, an Irish man who was in a same-sex partnership with a New Jersey citizen. Holder then asked immigration officials to reconsider their decision in order to determine whether Dorman can be considered a spouse under New Jersey law and whether Dorman would be considered a spouse under immigration law were it not for the Defense of Marriage Act. This action prompted some other immigration judges to halt the deportation proceeds of other foreigners in same-sex couples.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/30/deportation-citizens-same-sex-partner-canceled/|title=Deportation of Citizen's Same-Sex Partner Canceled |date=June 30, 2011 | work=Fox News[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/05/holder-intervenes-gay-mans-deportation-case/?test=latestnews#ixzz1ydNZ1O1a|title=Holder Intervenes in Gay Man's Deportation Case |publisher=Fox News Channel|date=June 30, 2011[/tpl]

===Crime and Prosecutions===

In 2009, Holder announced and oversaw the federal government spending of $1 billion in grants to law enforcement agencies in every state to pay for the hiring of police officers.
The money comes from the stimulus bill the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and covered the salaries of 4,699 law enforcement officers for three years.[tpl]cite news |title=US to Provide $1 billion to Hire cops |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-07-28/politics/police.stimulus_1_officers-for-three-years-police-officers-law-enforcement?_s=PM:POLITICS |publisher=CNN|date= July 28, 2009[/tpl]
[tpl]cite news |title=Grants and Resources for Community Policing |url= http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=2202 |date= July 28, 2009[/tpl]
On April 1, 2009, Holder announced that he had ordered the dismissal of the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens on corruption charges. Stevens had been found guilty, but hadn't been sentenced; Holder's action effectively vacated Stevens' conviction. Holder was reportedly very angry that the prosecutors had withheld potentially exculpatory evidence from Stevens' attorneys. After the prosecutors had been held in contempt of court for failing to turn over required documents, Holder replaced the entire trial team. Soon afterward, the Justice Department discovered a previously undocumented interview with Bill Allen, the prosecution's star witness. In this interview, Allen gave statements that directly contradicted his testimony at trial, including a claim that he'd been asked to get a note for a repair bill on his house. By nearly all accounts, Holder wanted to send a message that he would not tolerate any behavior he deemed to be prosecutorial misconduct.[tpl]cite news |first=Nina |last=Totenberg |authorlink=Nina Totenberg |title=Justice Dept.

In 2010, in the run up to the referendum on California Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana use for personal recreation, Holder stated that the DOJ would continue to prosecute individuals on the federal level for possession of marijuana even if voters approved a ballot measure.[tpl]cite news |title=Attorney General Holder Opposes California Marijuana Bill |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/16/us-usa-marijuana-california-idUSTRE69F03V20101016|agency=Reuters|date=October 16, 2010[/tpl] However, in the run up to the successful marijuana legalization referendums on Colorado Amendment 64 and Washington Initiative 502 in 2012, Eric Holder and the Department
of Justice remained silent on how they would respond if the ballot measures were enacted by voters. On November 6, 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 and Washington Initiative 502 were passed with 55.3% and 55.7% of the votes respectively. This would lead to a new memo released by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on August 29, 2013.http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf The memo instructed all United States Attorneys to not focus limited prosecutorial resources on state-authorized marijuana related activities, provided they follow eight priorities laid out by the Department of Justice.
On January 20, 2011, the FBI arrested 127 members of Cosa Nostra in New York City. Holder spoke at a press conference afterwards, celebrating the largest mafia sting in United States history.
Under Holder's leadership, the Department of Justice has brought six leak-related prosections against current or former U.S. government employees, while all previous Presidential administrations combined had tried a total of three such cases. Holder was reportedly "surprised" by news reports pointing out this statistic, and was said to have told associates he did not wish leak prosecutions to be his legacy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/us/politics/accidental-path-to-record-leak-cases-under-obama.html?pagewanted=all |title=Administration Took Accidental Path to Setting Record for Leak Cases |last=Savage |first=Charlie |work=The New York Times |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] Several prominent leak prosecutions under Holder have involved communications between criminal defendants and journalists, and the pervasive use of traceable electronic communications between journalists and their sources provided the prosecution with a tool to determine the potential origin of published information.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html?hpw=&pagewanted=all |title=A High-Tech War on Leaks |last=Liptak |first=Adam |work=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] Under Holder, the Justice Department has legally argued that journalists have no legal protection to maintain the confidentiality of their sources, and can be compelled by the government to reveal them, or potentially face criminal contempt charges.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2012/02/no_privilege.html |title=There is No Reporter's Privilege, Leak Prosecutors Insist |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |publisher=Federation of American Scientists Secrecy news |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=February 29, 2012[/tpl]

===Department of Justice Smart on Crime Program===

On 12 August 2013, at the American Bar Association's House of Delegates meeting, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the "Smart on Crime" program, which is "a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug legislation and policies."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=130815AR&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_medium=email | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder | publisher=American Bar Association | work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Carter, Terry | pages=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/SMART_ON_CRIME.PDF | title=Smart on Crime: Reforming The Criminal Justice System | publisher=US Department of Justice | work=Remarks to American Bar Association’s Annual Convention in San Francisco, CA | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | pages=7[/tpl] Holder said the program "will encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes "for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins…"[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=130815AR&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_medium=email | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder | publisher=American Bar Association | work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Carter, Terry | pages=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/SMART_ON_CRIME.PDF | title=Smart on Crime: Reforming The Criminal Justice System | publisher=US Department of Justice | work=Remarks to American Bar Association’s Annual Convention in San Francisco, CA | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | pages=7[/tpl] Running through Holder's statements, the increasing economic burden of over-incarceration was stressed.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=130815AR&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_medium=email | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder | publisher=American Bar Association | work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Carter, Terry | pages=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/SMART_ON_CRIME.PDF | title=Smart on Crime: Reforming The Criminal Justice System | publisher=US Department of Justice | work=Remarks to American Bar Association’s Annual Convention in San Francisco, CA | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | pages=7[/tpl] [tpl]As of | August 2013[/tpl], the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort "limited to the DOJ's policy parameters."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=130815AR&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_medium=email | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder | publisher=American Bar Association | work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Carter, Terry | pages=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=130815AR&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_medium=email | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder | publisher=American Bar Association | work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Carter, Terry | pages=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/SMART_ON_CRIME.PDF | title=Smart on Crime: Reforming The Criminal Justice System | publisher=US Department of Justice | work=Remarks to American Bar Association’s Annual Convention in San Francisco, CA | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | pages=7[/tpl]

===Additional actions===

When questioned about weapons regulations during a news conference to announce the arrest of Mexican drug cartel members, Holder stated that the Obama administration would seek to re-institute the expired Assault Weapons Ban, which he strongly supports.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/02/26/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4831751.shtml|title=Holder Revives Talk of an Assault Weapons Ban|date=February 26, 2009 | publisher=CBS News | first=Brent | last=Lang[/tpl][tpl]cite news|accessdate=May 5, 2009 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/02/26/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4831751.shtml |title=Holder Revives Talk of an Assault Weapons Ban|first=Lang |last=Lang|publisher=CBS News |date=February 26, 2009[/tpl]
After the U.S. government filed suit against the Swiss bank UBS AG, whom Holder had represented during his time in private practice, the attorney general recused himself from all legal matters concerning the bank, which stands accused of conspiracy in U.S. tax fraud.[tpl]cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008676224_apholderbank.html?syndication=rss|title=UBS bank listed among Holder ex-clients|work=The Seattle Times|date=January 27, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSWBT01077020090302|title=U.S., Swiss justice officials meet amid UBS probe|agency=Reuters|date=March 2, 2009|first=Randall|last=Mikkelsen[/tpl]
Holder presented friend and predecessor Janet Reno, Attorney General under the Clinton Administration, the American Judicature Society's (AJS) Justice Award on April 17, 2009. The award is the highest given by the AJS, and recognizes significant contributions toward improvements in the administration of justice within the United States."Holder to Present Reno with AJS's Justice Award" Palazzolo, Joe. The BLT:The Blog of Legal Times. April 17, 2009. Retrieved April 18, 2009.
After the United States diplomatic cables leak in December 2010, Holder said that "We have an active, ongoing, criminal investigation with regard to this matter," Holder said. "We are not in a position as yet to announce the result of that investigation, but the investigation is—is ongoing. To the extent that we can find anybody who was involved in the breaking of American law and who has put at risk the assets and the people that I have described, they will be held responsible," Holder said. "They will be held accountable." Holder's comments leave open a crucial question, which is whether the investigators are looking at how WikiLeaks obtained the documents (not unlike probing a news organization's source), or if they're looking at whether WikiLeaks staffers violated criminal law and should be the ones indicted.[tpl]cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20024033-38.html#ixzz17XbldGQK |title=AG says WikiLeaks criminal probe is 'ongoing' |publisher=CNET |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl]
In March 2011 Holder left open the possibility that the Guantánamo Bay prison camp might live on beyond President Obama's first term. Asked in a congressional hearing whether the prison would be closed by November 2012, Holder said: "I don’t know". He said the Justice Department has established a task force to look at each of the 172 detainees being held at the Guantánamo prison to address how they should be dealt with.  Holder’s comments come just weeks after CIA Director Leon Panetta told a Senate panel that Osama bin Laden would probably be shipped to and held at the Guantánamo Bay facility if he were captured.[tpl]cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/146917-holder-gitmo-may-stay-open-beyond-2012 |title=Gitmo may stay open beyond 2012 |publisher=Thehill.com |accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl]

===Opinion of Bush Policies===

During his confirmation hearings, Holder agreed with Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, that a technique used by U.S. interrogators under the Bush administration known as waterboarding is torture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/15/1745836.aspx |title=Holder: "Waterboarding is torture" |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl] Consequently, Senate Republicans delayed the confirmation vote on Holder though Senate Democrats accused them of applying a double standard.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/21/senate-republicans-to-del_n_159740.html |title=Senate Republicans Delay Holder Confirmation |work=Huffington Post |date=February 21, 2009 |first=Ryan |last=Grim[/tpl] 
He has been critical of Enhanced interrogation techniques and the NSA warrantless surveillance program, accusing the Bush administration of a "disrespect for the rule of law... is not only wrong, it is destructive in our struggle against terrorism."
Holder has stated that he favors closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, although he said in 2002 that the detainees are not technically entitled to Geneva Convention protections.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/11/holder-v-bush-o.html|title=Holder v Bush on War on Terror Tactics|last=Tapper|first=Jake|date=November 18, 2008| work=Political Punch |format=Blog |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=November 23, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/17878/eric_h_holder_jr_attorney_general_nominee.html |title=CFR Profile of Eric Holder |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl]

===Race relations===

Holder gave a speech on race relations on February 18, 2009, in the midst of Black History Month. "Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot in things racial, we have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards," said Holder. "Though race-related issues continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion, and though there remain many unresolved racial issues in this nation, we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial," he said.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2009/ag-speech-090218.html?loc=interstitialskip|title=Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Attorney General Eric Holder at the Department of Justice African American History Month Program|agency=U.S. Department of Justice|date=February 18, 2009[/tpl] The speech stirred some controversy, with some reacting favorably to Holder's comments and others sharply criticizing them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/mitchell/2009/02/attorney_general_eric_holders.html|title=Attorney General Eric Holder's race speech stirs debate|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=February 19, 2009|first=Mary|last=Mitchell[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/19/holder.folo/|title=Holder 'nation of cowards' remarks blasted, praised|publisher=CNN|date=February 19, 2009|first=Ed|last=Hornick[/tpl] Obama later clarified Holder's comments, saying that “I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.... I think the point that he was making is that we're oftentimes uncomfortable with talking about race until there's some sort of racial flare-up or conflict, and that we could probably be more constructive in facing up to the painful legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination."[tpl]cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/03/07/obama-discusses-holders-cowards-comment/|title=Obama Discusses Holder's 'Cowards' Remark|publisher=CNN|date=March 7, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/us/politics/08race.html|title=Attorney General Chided for Language on Race|work=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2009|first=Helene|last=Cooper[/tpl]

===New Black Panther Party voter intimidation incident===

In May 2009, Holder's Department of Justice completed a civil suit originally brought by J. Christian Adams of the Bush Justice Department against the New Black Panther Party, its chairman, and two of its members for voter intimidation due to their conduct during the 2008 election. Two members of the Party had stood outside a polling station during the election in paramilitary uniforms, one carrying a nightstick. Claiming a lack of evidence, the Department of Justice dropped charges against the party, its chairman, and one of the two members who had stood outside the polling station. With the evidence presented, the Department of Justice successfully obtained a narrow injunction against the other. Former lawyers who had served under the Bush Administration have stated that the current DOJ under Holder is unwilling to prosecute minorities for civil rights violations. Three other Justice Department lawyers, in recent interviews, gave the same description of the department's culture, which department officials strongly deny. In the months after the case ended, tensions persisted. Eventually, Christopher Coates (of the Justice's Civil Rights Division) acknowledged telling attorneys at a September 2009 lunch that the Obama administration was interested in filing cases - under a key voting rights section - only on behalf of minorities."Dispute over New Black Panthers case causes deep divisions". The Washington Post, October 22, 2010.
During a meeting with a House subcommittee, Holder argued that the behavior (standing in a menacing way) of the New Black Panther Party was not comparable to historical voter intimidation against minorities, which often involved acts of violence and murder. Holder said, "When you compare what people endured in the South in the '60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, to compare what people subjected to that with what happened in Philadelphia… I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line for my people.""Holder says experiences of ‘my people’ not similar to contemporary voter intimidation". The Daily Caller, March 3, 2011. 
Critics have interpreted this comment as evidence of racial bias on Holder's part, with conservative James Tarantohttp://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/07/james-taranto-why-man-haha-ing/54267/ of the Wall Street Journal arguing that "If he Holder approaches the job with the attitude that any group smaller than all Americans is 'my people', he is the wrong man for the position.""Eric Holder's People". The Wall Street Journal, March 2, 2011.  Claiming the issue was politicized from the start, Democrats [tpl]Who?|date=April 2014[/tpl] have argued that those on the political right, particularly Adams, used this incident for purely political gain.[tpl]cite news|first=Josh|last=Gerstein|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0311/Eric_Holder_Black_Panther_case_focus_demeans_my_people.html|title=Eric Holder: Black Panther case focus demeans 'my people'|publisher=Politico|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2013[/tpl]

===Operation Choke Point===

On January 2014, House Oversight Committee chairman Darrell Issa accused Holder's Department of Justice of attempting to rid of the payday loan industry. In the multi-agency initiative, called "Operation Choke Point," the Department of Justice is scrutinizing banks both big and small over whether they, in exchange for handsome fees, enable businesses to illegally siphon billions of dollars from consumers' checking accounts.[tpl]cite news|first=Jessica|last=Silver-Greenberg|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101365366|title=Justice Department Inquiry Takes Aim at Banks’ Business With Payday Lenders|publisher=CNBC|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014[/tpl]

On June 19, 2012, Issa met with Holder in person to discuss the requested documents.

===Refusal to prosecute financial institutions===

On March 6, 2013, Holder testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the size of large financial institutions has made it difficult for the Justice Department to bring criminal charges when they are suspected of crimes, because such charges can threaten the existence of a bank and therefore their interconnectedness may endanger the national or global economy. "Some of these institutions have become too large,” Holder told the Committee, “It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate."[tpl]cite news|last=Mattingly|first=Phil|title=Too-Big-to-Fail Banks Limit Prosecutor Options, Holder Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-06/too-big-to-fail-banks-limit-prosecutor-options-holder-testifies.html|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Holder|first=Eric|title=Testimony to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=tpjFn7B4D5g|work=video|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=April 13, 2013|date=March 2013[/tpl]
