Victoria Peak is a mountain located in the Sutton Range of the Vancouver Island Ranges.  At 2163 m, it is the third highest peak on Vancouver Island.  The mountain is located on the White River valley and has no mountains of comparable elevation nearby.  It is accessible as a day trip by logging road and is visible from Campbell River and the Discovery Islands.
Like Warden Peak immediately north, Victoria Peak is part of the remnant core of an extinct volcano that has remained after the volcano's slopes have long ago eroded away.
