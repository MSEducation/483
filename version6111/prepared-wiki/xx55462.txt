==Early life and education==

Kenny was born and raised in Syracuse, New York to Paul and Theresa Kenny.[tpl]cite web|title=Tom Kenny: Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/tom-kenny/bio/177150|publisher=T.V Guide|accessdate=21 September 2012[/tpl] As a young child, he loved drawing and collecting record albums in the late 1960s and '70s. He went to Bishop Grimes High School, which is also located in Syracuse. He was friends with comedian Bobcat Goldthwait when they were in school after Bobcat got in trouble with one of the teachers in the school, who dragged him into Kenny's class. The two were friends through school and after college and appeared in films that Bobcat directed and starred in such as Shakes the Clown and World's Greatest Dad.

==SpongeBob SquarePants==

While working on the animated series Rocko's Modern Life, Kenny met marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg, who was also the creative director in the show's fourth season. Years before the airing of Rocko's Modern Life, Hillenburg wrote a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone in 1989, and a friend of his told him that he should create an animated series based on the comic book. After trying to find a main character of the show, Hillenburg drew a square sponge, for which he thought it was funny and decided that he has found his character. After the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life in 1996, Hillenburg began developing the concept, and hired former Rocko crew members. To voice of the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Kenny, previously working with him on that series. Originally, the character was to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but these were changed due to trademark issues. After deciding what character can be named, Hillenburg chose the name SpongeBob, and use the name SquarePants as a family name which "had a nice ring to it".
The series titled premiered on May 1, 1999 on Nickelodeon. In 2000, during its second season, the show became a commercial success. Kenny voices other characters on the show as well: including Gary the Snail, the French narrator (who is parodied as Jacques Cousteau), SpongeBob's father Harold SquarePants, and his live-action portrayal of Patchy the Pirate (along with Hillenburg, who supplied the voice for the character of Potty the Pirate from 2000 until his departure from the show in 2004). After Hillenburg's resign, co-executive producer and writer Paul Tibbitt became the voice of Potty. In 2004, a feature film adaptation of the series, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, premiered on November 14, 2004, and was officially released in theaters on November 19, 2004. In 2010, Kenny was awarded an Annie Award for "Voice Acting in a Television Production" for his role as SpongeBob in SpongeBob's Truth or Square (season 6, episode 23-24). Kenny will reprise his role as SpongeBob in the sequel film that will release in early-2015.
