[[List of birds]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of birds, Birds by classification, Ornithology lists

This page lists living orders and families of birds. The links below should then lead to family accounts and hence to individual species.
Taxonomy is very fluid in the age of DNA analysis, so comments are made where appropriate, and all numbers are approximate. In particular see Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy for a very different classification.

==Paleognathae==

The flightless and mostly giant Struthioniformes lack a keeled sternum and are collectively known as ratites. Together with the Tinamiformes, they form the Paleognathae or "old jaws", one of the two evolutionary superorders.

===Struthioniformes===

Africa and Australasia; 2 species.

===Rheiformes===

South America; 2 species.

===Tinamiformes===

South America; 45 species.

===Casuariiformes===

Australasia;  4 species.

===Apterygiformes===

Australasia; 5 species.

==Neognathae==

Nearly all living birds belong to the superorder of Neognathae or "new jaws". With their keels, unlike the ratites, they are known as carinatae. The passerines alone account for well over 5000 species.totally there are almost 8640 species of birds worldwide
