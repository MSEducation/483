==Composition==

"Whatever You Like" was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel. The song was produced by Jim Jonsin, who produced Lil Wayne's single, "Lollipop". The production team worked on the track when T.I. was in the studio recording his album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-ti7-2008oct07,1,3434444.story|title=T.I.'s 'Whatever You Like': a song for our times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author=Ann Powers|date=2008-10-07|accessdate=2008-11-11[/tpl] The instrumentals for "Whatever You Like" are based on a beat of lead synthesizers and drum pattern. The song runs for 4:09 and speaks about a man who can buy a woman whatever she asks for, as well encourages the woman to ask for anything she wants. It is a slow R&B/Pop song and the chorus contains breathy soft, singing vocals. The song also contains a sample from "Redemption", the opening and closing theme song from the film Rocky II. "Whatever You Like" is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute, and is written in the key of D minor with a chord progression sequence of Dm-Bb-F-C.
A second version of "Whatever You Like" was released in order to be suitable for radio stations. The original version of the track features T.I. saying "Late night sex so wet, it's so tight", while the radio version replaces these lyrics with the line "Baby I can treat you so special, so nice" in the hook and replacing the line "Thing gets so wet/ it hits so right" with "Girl, you smell so fresh, and look so nice" in the breakdown. The music video also uses the edited lyrics. Other changes include replacing the line "Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet" with "Tell 'em other broke brothers be quiet" or "Tell 'em other broke jokers be quiet" in the pre-hook. The 2nd verse also mutes the word "brain" in the line "Brain so good/ could've sworn you went to college" due to a slang definition of the word referring to oral sex.

==Chart performance==

"Whatever You Like" debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100."T.I. - Whatever You Like global chart positions and trajectories". aCharts.us. Retrieved August 14, 2008. In its third week, it achieved the third biggest leap to number one in Billboard Hot 100 chart history when it jumped 70 positions, from number 71 to the top of the chart, breaking the record previously held by Maroon 5's "Makes Me Wonder", which jumped 64 to number one.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044335/ti-sets-new-record-with-hot-100-no-1-jump|title=T.I.

The song's jump can be largely attributed to huge first week digital sales of 205,000, debuting at number one on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs chart. The song held the number one position on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, before being replaced by Pink's "So What." The following week the song knocked off "So What" to return to number one on the Hot 100, marking its fourth week overall at the top of the chart. It remained there for another week, marking its 5th week overall. The next week T.I. replaced himself at number one with the follow-up single "Live Your Life" which hasn't been done since Usher in 2004 with the first and second singles off his album (Yeah! and Burn). After spending two weeks at number two on the Hot 100, "Whatever You Like" again topped the chart by knocking off "Womanizer" by Britney Spears, marking its 6th non-consecutive week at number one on the Hot 100. This was the first time a song returned to number one on the chart after the artist's follow up single had already spent time at number one ("Live Your Life" having already spent a week at number one). It is also only the third song to ever have three separate runs at number one on the Hot 100, following Chic's "Le Freak" in 1979 and Leona Lewis' "Bleeding Love" earlier in 2008.[tpl]cite news | first = Fred| last = Bronson | title = Back in 'Like' Again | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus.jsp | work = | publisher = Billboard | date = 2008-10-23 | accessdate = 2008-10-28 | language = | quote = [/tpl] The song retained the number one position the following week, bringing its total to seven non-consecutive weeks at number one.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043635/ti-continues-hot-100-dominance|title=T.I.

==Music video==

The music video was filmed in Malibu, Los Angeles, California, and was directed by Dave Meyers. Reagan Gomez-Preston plays T.I.'s love interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/08/06/video-ti-whatever-you-like/|title=Video: T.I. - 'Whatever You Like'|work=Rap-Up|accessdate=2009-04-28[/tpl] Cameos include Jackie Long, Lil Duval, Jim Jonsin, and T.I.'s girlfriend Tameka Cottle. The video starts with a girl working at a fast food restaurant. When T.I. comes into the restaurant, after ordering hot wings, he hands the girl a folded up paper with his number on it. She then calls him and T.I. invites her to his house. The video then shows her living the high life, with T.I. treating her to private jet rides, fancy dinners, and buying her many expensive gifts, such as a new car. The video also show clips of her living her normal life with her boyfriend. Right before the end of the video, it shows the release date of T.I.'s new album Paper Trail while T.I. is on the red carpet with his girl. At the end it is revealed it is all merely a fantasy sequence the girl was having, and T.I. had only handed the girl a hundred dollar bill, not his number. The concept of the video is similar to the one for Jay-Z's single "Excuse Me Miss".
