Farnborough International Airshow Radio is the official radio station of the Farnborough International Airshow, and has been part of the airshow's official media outlets for over a decade.  The station is run by a radio broadcasting professional and students from the nearby Farnborough College of Technology.

==History==

The station is overseen by Farnborough International Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of British aerospace industry's body the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC).
The first radio station was set up to coincide with the September 1996 show, in partnership with Farnborough College of Technology, and County Sound Radio, a commercial radio station.  From 2000 the radio station was under the control of the College's media department, led by broadcaster Fred Marden.  The station works closely with Flight International and the Flight Daily News, and often features guest presenters from both publications.  Other notable interviewees include the Red Arrows, MP Gerald Howarth, Trevor Brooking, and Neville Duke.

==2010 Broadcast==

The station was broadcast for the duration of the seven-day international trade fair (and for the prior 'validation week') on 87.7 FM to the Surrey and North East Hampshire area of England and also worldwide online on the Farnborough International website. The station was run by radio broadcasting professional Tony Cook and many students from Farnborough College of Technology. Presenters included local radio legend Ken Wilkinson and the up-and-coming James Warwick.

==2012 Broadcast==

The station did not broadcast in 2012, at the International airshow.
