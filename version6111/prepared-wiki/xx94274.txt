The University of Washington Medical Center opened on May 5, 1959. It grew out of the medical school that the university opened on October 2, 1946. It is home to the world's first pain center and was the location of the world's first long-term kidney dialysis, developed by UW professor Belding H. Scribner, M.D.
In May 2013, it was announced that UW Medicine, which owns and operates the University of Washington Medical Center, and PeaceHealth were coming together in a "strategic affiliation." The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the merger as PeaceHealth is "directed by the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives."[tpl]cite news|last=Ostrom|first=Carol M.|title=UW Medicine, Catholic health system to have ‘strategic affiliation’|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021024295_uwpeacehealthxml.html|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=May 20, 2013[/tpl]
