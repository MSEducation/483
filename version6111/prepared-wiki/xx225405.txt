Augustine A. "Gus" Healy (20 May 1904 – 10 July 1987) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. A dental laboratory proprietor, Healy was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the 1957 general election[tpl]cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=16&MemberID=499&ConstID=30|title=Mr. Augustine Healy|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=5 October 2008[/tpl] but lost his seat at the 1961 general election,[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2640|title=Gus Healy|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=5 October 2008[/tpl] and was instead nominated by the Taoiseach Seán Lemass to the 10th Seanad. Healy regained his Dáil seat at the 1965 general election and, later representing Cork City South–East, retained his seat until retiring at the 1977 general election. 
Healy also served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1964–65 and 1975–76.
Healy was a keen amateur swimmer and a member of Sunday's Well Swimming Club. He continued to promote the sport during his mayoralty and in the 1970s the city's first suburban swimming pool at Douglas was named the Gus Healy municipal swimming pool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundayswellsc.com/History.htm|work=Sundays Well Swimming Club|title=History|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]
