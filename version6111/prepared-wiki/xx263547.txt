A presidential election was held in Seychelles from 19 May to 21 May 2011.http://africanelections.tripod.com/sc.html#2011_Presidential_Election
The election will be contested by at least four candidates:
The elections will be reviewed by independent observers from the Southern African Development Community, La Francophonie and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Local independent NGO groups have applied for accreditation as observers, given their understanding of the Creole language and their knowledge of districts and past polling concerns. The Electoral Commissioner has denied observer status to all local observer applicants. A "cooling-off" period is underway for three days before the election when no electioneeering, campaigning or wearing of campaign material or party colours is permitted by regulation. Electioneering material must be removed from all sites within 500 metres of all polling stations before the elections. The first day of the elections is 19 May 2011 commencing on the Outer Islands, then 20 May 2011 on the Inner Islands and 21 May the main island of Mah√©.
The results continue a similar trend seen in previous presidential elections in Seychelles, with James Michel winning 55% of the votes. The results were announced late at night on Saturday 21 May 2011. The main opposition candidate Wavel Ramkalawan obtained 41%.
