==Biography==

Friedman was born in St. Louis Park, Minnesota – a suburb of Minneapolis – on July 20, 1953. He is the son of Harold and Margaret Friedman. Harold, who was vice president of a ball bearing company, United Bearing, died of a heart attack in 1973, when Tom was nineteen years old. Margaret, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II and studied home economics at the University of Wisconsin, was a homemaker and a part-time bookkeeper. She was also a Senior Life Master duplicate bridge player, and died in 2008. Friedman has two older sisters, Shelly and Jane.
From an early age, Friedman, whose father often brought him to the golf course for a round after work, wanted to be a professional golfer. He played a lot of sports, and became serious about tennis and golf. He caddied at a local country club and in 1970 caddied for the legendary Chi Chi Rodriguez when the US Open came to town.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/friedman.html | title=Why the World Is Flat | work=Wired | date=May 2005 | accessdate=February 6, 2012[/tpl]

Friedman studied at the University of Minnesota for two years, but later transferred to Brandeis University and graduated summa cum laude in 1975 with a degree in Mediterranean studies. While at Brandeis he roomed with psychologist Steven Fox. Friedman taught a class in economics at his alma mater Brandeis University in 2006, and was a commencement speaker at Brandeis in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.brandeis.edu/news/item?news_item_id=9179 |title=Brandeis University :: News |publisher=My.brandeis.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26[/tpl]
After graduating from Brandeis, he attended St Antony's College at the University of Oxford on a Marshall scholarship, earning an M.Phil. in Middle Eastern studies. He names Professor Albert Hourani among his important academic influences.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Journalism career==

Friedman joined the London bureau of United Press International after completing his master's degree. He was dispatched a year later to Beirut, where he lived from June 1979 to May 1981 while covering the Lebanon Civil War. He was hired by The New York Times as a reporter in 1981 and redispatched to Beirut at the start of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. His coverage of the war, particularly the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[tpl]cite news|last=Friedman |first=Thomas L. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9504E4D81138F935A1575AC0A964948260 |title=article by Thomas Friedman on Beirut massacre |publisher=New York Times |date=September 26, 1982 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] won him the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting (shared with Loren Jenkins of The Washington Post).
Alongside David K. Shipler[tpl]clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl] he also won the George Polk Award for foreign reporting.
In June 1984, Friedman was transferred to Jerusalem, where he served as the New York Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief until February 1988. That year he received a second Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, which cited his coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/International-Reporting |title=International Reporting: Past winners & finalists by category|website= The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=March 25, 2012[/tpl]
Afterward he wrote a book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, describing his experiences in the Middle East,[tpl]cite web|title=Thomas L.

Friedman covered Secretary of State James Baker during the administration of United States President George H. W. Bush. Following the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, he became the White House correspondent for the New York Times. In 1994, he began to write more about foreign policy and economics, and moved to the op-ed page of The New York Times the following year as a foreign affairs columnist.  In 2002, Friedman won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary "for his clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Commentary |title=Commentary: Past winners & finalists by category|website=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate= 2012-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2002-Commentary |title=The 2002 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Commentary: Works |website=The Pulitzer Prizes |accessdate=March 25, 2012[/tpl] of ten 2001 articles.)
In February 2002, Friedman met Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and personally encouraged him to make his comprehensive attempt to end the Arab-Israeli conflict by normalizing Arab relations with Israel in exchange for the return of refugees alongside an end to the Israel territorial occupations. Abdullah proposed the Arab Peace Initiative at the Beirut Summit that March, which Friedman has strongly supported since.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/833589.html |title=What Arab initiative?|author= Akiva Eldar|work=Haaretz[/tpl]

==Awards, recognition, and criticism==

Friedman has won the Pulitzer Prize three times:
Additionally, in 2005 he was elected as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/boardmember/138 |title=The Pulitzer Prizes: Board Member Thomas Friedman |publisher=Pulitzer.org |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl]
American journalist and former civil rights litigator Glenn Greenwald, writing for Salon on July 25, 2012, commented: "His status among American elites is the single most potent fact for understanding the nation's imperial decline."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/25/the_value_of_tom_friedman/ | title= The Value of Tom Friedman | work=Salon | date=July 2112 | accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl]
Another American academic and commentator, Haroon Moghul, has described Friedman as hating Islam, stating that: "he hates Muslims enough to want to bomb them."[tpl]cite web|last=Moghul|first=Haroon|title=Islam Invented Democracy|url=http://www.theislamicmonthly.com/islam-invented-democracy/|work=The Islamic Monthly|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]

==Writing style==

Some critics have derided Friedman's idiosyncratic prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies.  Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being "an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations about just how doggone irresistible globalization is – lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a Maureen Dowd and is best taken in small doses."[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E4DF163CF931A15753C1A9649C8B63&fta=y | work=The New York Times | title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Grappling With the Dangers Of the New World Order | date=October 22, 2002 | accessdate=March 28, 2010[/tpl]  Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, "Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up even if you were trying – and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/environment/121617/someone_take_away_thomas_friedman's_computer_before_he_types_another_sentence/?page=entire|author=Matt Taibbi|title=Someone Take Away Thomas Friedman's Computer Before He Types Another Sentence |publisher=New York Press|date= |accessdate=December 18, 2010[/tpl]
In a column for the New York Press, Alexander Cockburn wrote: "Friedman exhibits on a weekly basis one of the severest cases known to science of Lippmann’s condition,--named for the legendary journalistic hot-air salesman, Walter Lippmann, and alluding to the inherent tendency of all pundits to swell in self-importance to zeppelin-like dimensions." Cockburn goes on to demonstrate how Friedman's hubris allowed him to pass off another war correspondent's experience in Beirut as his own.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nypress.com/i-and-i-the-world-according-to-tom-friedman/|author=Alexander Cockburn|title=I and I: The World According to Tom Friedman|publisher=NY Press|date=October 3, 2000|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl]

==Views and opinions==

===Globalization===

Friedman first discussed his views on globalization in the book The Lexus and the Olive Tree (1999). In 2004, a visit to Bangalore, India, and Dalian, China, gave Friedman new insights into the continuing trends of globalization and the forces behind the process, leading him to write a follow-up analysis, The World Is Flat (2005).
One of Friedman's theses states that individual countries must sacrifice some degree of economic sovereignty to global institutions (such as capital markets and multinational corporations), a situation he has termed the "golden straitjacket".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
While Friedman is an advocate of globalization, he also points out (in The Lexus and the Olive Tree[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]page|date=March 2014[/tpl]) the need for a country to preserve its local traditions, a process he termed "glocalization", although the term was already in use by most social anthropology theorists.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In today's global situation, Friedman is concerned about the United States' lack of independence when it comes to energy. He states, "First rule of oil – addicts never tell the truth to their pushers. We are the addicts, the oil producers are the pushers – we’ve never had an honest conversation with the Saudis."[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Friedman expresses a strong stance on America's need to become more energy independent and to lead in technologies concerning environmental compatibility. He believes this will cause the authoritarian rulers in the Middle East to be coerced out of power – as their petrodollar reserves are depleted – by a growing population of young people. He also believes this is the best way to spread stability and modernization in an autocratic and theocratic region.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Friedman argues also that energy independence will strengthen America's economy by basing its energy infrastructure on domestic products (such as biodiesel), and will ease the world tensions caused by burgeoning energy demand, exacerbated by emerging economies such as those of India and China.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Opponents of free trade charge that Friedman does not consider the purchasing power of domestic labor as a key driver in economic output. However, Friedman argues that when low-skill and low-wage jobs are exported to foreign countries, more advanced and higher-skilled jobs will be freed up and made available for those displaced by the outsourcing. He theorizes that as long as those whose jobs are outsourced continue to further their education and specialize in their field, they will find better-paying and higher-skilled jobs.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
He also views American immigration laws as too restrictive and damaging to economic output: "It is pure idiocy that Congress will not open our borders – as wide as possible – to attract and keep the world's first-round intellectual draft choices in an age when everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent."[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/opinion/23friedman.html?_r=1 |title=Laughing and Crying |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 17, 2010 |first=Thomas L. |last=Friedman[/tpl]

===Terrorism===

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Friedman's writing focused more on the threat of terrorism and the Middle East. He was awarded the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary "for his clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat". These columns were collected and published in the book Longitudes and Attitudes.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] For a while, his reporting on post-9/11 topics led him to diverge from his prior interests in technological advances and globalization, until he began to research The World Is Flat.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Friedman called for the U.S. State Department to "shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears", to create a quarterly "War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and  include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls "excuse makers".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In his July 25 column, Friedman wrote against the "excuses" made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow "understandable" is outrageous. "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" Mr. Rubin said, "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them."[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Kosovo War===

During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Friedman wrote the following in The New York Times on April 23, 1999: "Like it or not, we are at war with the Serbian nation (the Serbs certainly think so), and the stakes have to be very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too."[tpl]cite news|author=Thomas Friedman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/opinion/foreign-affairs-stop-the-music.html |title=Stop the Music| work=The New York Times|date=23 April 1999[/tpl]
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) labeled Freidman's remarks "war-mongering, crude race-hatred and war-crime agitation".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2941 |title=CPJ Declares Open Season on Thomas Friedman|website= FAIR[/tpl] Steve Chapman, critical of the response taken by NATO, referred to Friedman as "the most fervent supporter of the air war" and ironically asked in the Chicago Tribune: "Why stop at 1389?

===Iraq===

Friedman supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that the establishment of a democratic state in the Middle East would force other countries in the region to liberalize and modernize.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way you get that compliance out of a thug like Saddam is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/reform/cluster1/2003/0209india.htm |title=Vote France Off the Island |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=February 9, 2003 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair  for "hyping" the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/id/2093620/entry/2093763/| title= Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War: Four Reasons To Invade Iraq| first=Thomas| last=Friedman| date=January 12, 2004| publisher=Slate.com| accessdate=December 7, 2006[/tpl]
In his September 29, 2005, column in The New York Times, Friedman entertained the idea of supporting the Kurds and Shias in a civil war against the Sunnis:"If they the Sunnis won't come around, we should arm the Shiites and Kurds and leave the Sunnis of Iraq to reap the wind."The Endgame in Iraq Sep 29. 2005
Iran's Great Weakness May Be Its Oil, by Thomas Friedman, challenges and debates conflicts about oil.

Let's exploit Iran's oil addiction by ending ours".[tpl]cite web|url=http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/thomas_friedman.html |title=Economist's View: Thomas Friedman: Iran's Great Weakness May Be Its Oil |publisher=Economistsview.typepad.com |date=2007-02-03 |accessdate=2011-10-06[/tpl]
Critics of Friedman's position on the Iraq War have noted his recurrent assertion that "the next six months" will prove critical in determining the outcome of the conflict. A May 2006 study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting cited 14 examples of Friedman's declaring the next "few months" or "six months" as a decisive or critical period, dating from in November 2003, describing it as "a long series of similar do-or-die dates that never seem to get any closer".Tom Friedman's Flexible Deadlines: Iraq's 'decisive' six months have lasted two and a half years May 16, 2006
The blogger Atrios coined the neologism "Friedman Unit" to refer to this unit of time in relation to Iraq, noting its use as a supposedly critical window of opportunity.[ref]The Huffington Post cited it as the "Best New Phrase" of 2006.

In a live television interview aired June 11, 2006, on CNN, Howard Kurtz asked Friedman himself about the concept: "Now, I want to understand how a columnist's mind works when you take positions, because you were chided recently for writing several times in different occasions 'the next six months are crucial in Iraq.'"  Friedman responded, "The fact is that the outcome there is unclear, and I reflected that in my column. And I will continue to reflect."White House Mounts Media Blitz After Killing of Zarqawi June 11, 2006  Responding to prodding from Stephen Colbert, Friedman said in 2007, "We've run out of six months.

===Environment===

In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman described his motivations for writing the book: "My concern is about America.... Demand for clean energy, clean fuel and energy efficiency is clearly going to explode; it’s going to be the next great global industry.

===Israel===

Friedman has been criticized by organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting for defending Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon as a form of "educating" Israel's opponents; according to FAIR, Friedman was explicitly endorsing terrorism by Israel against Lebanese and Palestinians.http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/terrorism-on-the-new-york-times-op-ed-page/ Journalist Glenn Greenwald and professor Noam Chomsky also accused Friedman of endorsing and encouraging terrorism by Israeli forces.http://www.salon.com/2009/01/14/friedman_7/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20090119.htm
Political reporter Belen Fernandez heavily critiques Friedman's commentary regarding Israel. Among other criticisms, Fernandez singles out Friedman's suggestion that Israeli forces were unaware that their allied Lebanese militias carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre while under their guard, contradicting the assessments of other journalists and observers; his encouragement of strong-armed force by the Israeli army against Palestinians; and his opposition to settlements only on the grounds that they are counter-productive, rather than because they violate international law or cause suffering for Palestinians. Fernandez suggests that Friedman is most worried about successfully maintaining Israel's Jewish ethnocracy and actively opposing a "one-man, one-vote" system of democracy.Fernandez, Belen. The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work. Verso Books, 2011, p 99-107
Friedman has also come under criticism from supporters of Israel. In an op-ed, Yitzhak Benhorin criticized Friedman's alleged suggestion that Israel relinquish territory it had confiscated to build settlements.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4028408,00.html
Friedman sparked criticism for writing that congressional ovations for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were "bought and paid for by the Israel lobby."Thomas L. Friedman: Newt, Mitt, Bibi and Vladimir New York Times 13 December 2011.

This indicates that the people’s elected representatives are fully reflecting the will of the voters." New York Times Columnist Tom Friedman Crossed a Line Jerusalem Post, 19 December 2011. Friedman responded to criticism by writing: "In retrospect I probably should have used a more precise term like ‘engineered’ by the Israel lobby – a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that I don’t subscribe to."Friedman responds to criticism over ‘bought and paid for’ jab at Congress JTA, December 20, 2011.

In September 2009, Friedman wrote an article praising China's one-party autocracy, saying that it was "led by a reasonably enlightened group of people"http://beta.mrc.org/articles/friedman-again-hails-communist-chinas-one-party-autocracy-superior-american-democracy and that China's leaders are "boosting gasoline prices" and "overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power."[tpl]cite web|author=12:10 EDT |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/Tom-Friedman-hails-China_s-one-party-autocracy-8229077-59075192.html |title=New York Times columnist Tom Friedman hails China's one-party autocracy |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]. The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, "Friedman's apparent wish for a 'benign' dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'" and William Easterly who quotes Friedman's one-party autocracy assertions[tpl]cite paper|author=William Easterly|url=http://williameasterly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/benevolent-autocrats-easterly-2nd-draft.pdf|title=Benevolent Autocrats|publisher=William Easterly|date=May 2011|pages=2|accessdate=October 26, 2012[/tpl] as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, "Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story" and that, "economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them."[tpl]cite paper|author=William Easterly|url=http://williameasterly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/benevolent-autocrats-easterly-2nd-draft.pdf|title=Benevolent Autocrats|publisher=William Easterly|date=May 2011|pages=44|accessdate=October 26, 2012[/tpl] However in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current Chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, "Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent."[tpl]cite web|author=Thomas Friedman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/opinion/friedman-what-the-locusts-ate.html?src=me&ref=general&_r=0|title=What the Locusts Ate|publisher=NYT |date=June 5, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012[/tpl] When asked if he had "China envy" during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, "You detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/09/16/tom-friedman-china-envy-explained/ |title=Fresh Dialogues Interview with Alison van Diggelen |publisher=Freshdialogues.com |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where "there's a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did."[tpl]YouTube|ws3Yr6JjZyk|BBC Two: The Chinese Are Coming: Episode 2: The Americas (Part 4 of 4), quote can be heard from 11:50 to 12:15 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Friedman's work is popular in China. His book The World is Flat was a bestseller in the country, although criticism of China in the book was removed when it was published in the country.[tpl]cite news|title=The role of Thomas Friedman|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/05/chinese-dream-0|newspaper=The Economist|date=May 6, 2013[/tpl] A translated version of his article from The New York Times, "China Needs Its Own Dream", has been credited with popularizing the phrase "Chinese Dream" in China, a term that was later adopted as a slogan by Xi Jinping. Friedman, in the magazine Foreign Policy, has attributed the phrase to Peggy Liu and her environmental NGO JUCCCE.[tpl]cite news|last=Fish|first=Isaac Stone|title=Thomas Friedman: I only deserve partial credit for coining the 'Chinese dream'|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/03/thomas_friedman_i_only_deserve_partial_credit_for_coining_the_chinese_dream|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=May 3, 2013[/tpl]

===Radical centrism===

In the 2010s, Friedman wrote several columns supporting the politics of radical centrism. In one he stated that, if the "radical center wants to be empowered, it can't just whine.  It needs its own grass-roots movement".Friedman, Thomas L. (20 March 2010).  "A Tea Party Without Nuts".  The New York Times.  Retrieved 25 February 2013.  In another column Friedman promoted Americans Elect, an organization trying to field a radical-centrist candidate for the 2012 U.S. Presidential election.  That column decried "the two-party duopoly that has dominated American political life".Friedman, Thomas (23 July 2011).  "Make Way for the Radical Center".  The New York Times.  Retrieved 23 February 2013.   Friedman's radical-centrist columns received a considerable amount of criticism, particularly from liberals.Marx, Greg (25 July 2011).  "Tom Friedman's 'Radical' Wrongness".  Columbia Journalism Review.  Retrieved 28 February 2013.
