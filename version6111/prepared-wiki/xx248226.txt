===Contamination===

Some researchers were concerned about contamination from the first reports of XMRV-disease associations, and these concerns spread as study after study failed to replicate WPI's results. In December, 2010, four independent articles published in the journal Retrovirology presented evidence that reported XMRV detection could be explained by contamination of laboratory reagents,[tpl]Cite pmid|21171978[/tpl] tissue samples[tpl]Cite pmid|21171966[/tpl] and blood.[tpl]Cite pmid|21171973[/tpl] Samples that were positive for XMRV were also positive for mouse DNA contaminants. Furthermore, the striking identity of XMRV genomic sequences and their similarity to xenotropic MLVs in several human cell lines suggested that XMRV is not a transmissible human pathogen.[tpl]Cite pmid|21171979[/tpl] The British Medical Journal responded with an article entitled, "Chronic fatigue syndrome is not caused by XMRV virus, study shows".[tpl]Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.c7358[/tpl] A fifth study supporting the contamination hypothesis was published in February, 2011,[tpl]Cite pmid|21352548[/tpl] just ahead of the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). At CROI, WPI representatives were absent, and a large amount of negative data was presented. Two groups showed evidence that XMRV is a recombinant of two mouse retroviruses, which infected a prostate cancer cell line during passage through nude mice. Virologist John Coffin, who had previously expressed optimism about the initial WPI data, declared, "It's all contamination." Robert Silverman, who was a co-author of the original XMRV-CFS article but is no longer collaborating with Mikovits, told the Chicago Tribune that he was "concerned about lab contamination, despite our best efforts to avoid it".

===Controversial statements and criticism===

The Whittemore Peterson Institute and its employees have issued statements that have generated additional controversy. Some of these statements have been made to the press, while others are made in presentations to patient groups. Although there is no consensus that XMRV is a human pathogen or even associated with any disease, Mikovits has stated her opinion that the virus "undoubtedly causes some of the symptoms that are associated with" CFS.Virus leads Canadian Blood Services to ban certain donors Joseph Hall, The Toronto Star, 06 April 2010. Elsewhere, however, she notes that causation has not been proven.[tpl]Cite news | last = Grady | first = Denise | title = Virus Is Found in Many With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 8, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/health/research/09virus.html?_r=2 | accessdate =2010-04-22[/tpl]Virus linked to chronic fatigue syndrome According to Mikovits, XMRV "is clearly circulating through the population as is our fear and your fear" and has entered the US blood supply. She has also associated XMRV not only with CFS, but also with autism, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases. There is no evidence that XMRV is associated with these diseases: all studies that have looked for a connection have produced negative results.[tpl]cite journal |author=Satterfield BC, Garcia RA, Gurrieri F, Schwartz CE |title=PCR and serology find no association between xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) and autism |journal=Mol Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=14 |year=2010 |pmid=20946639 |pmc=2964727 |doi=10.1186/2040-2392-1-14 |url=[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|21291619[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|21203514[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|20829105[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|20678193[/tpl] Virologist Vincent Racaniello has accused Mikovits of "inciting fear".
In response to the contradictory British results, Mikovits stated that scientists had doctored their studies to reach a predetermined conclusion as part of an insurance company conspiracy. Annette Whittemore expressed the opinion that the response to her organization's claims was political, while the director of clinical services, Deckoff-Jones, characterized the negative research findings as a "cover-up and baseless attacks against Dr. Mikovits". Mikovits stated that those who reported negative findings did not "believe" in chronic fatigue syndrome and sought to discredit the disorder itself. Critics disputed these charges. A March 2011 editorial in the journal Nature praised Mikovits's defense of her work, but also asked her and her critics to keep an open mind and to be motivated by patients without allowing their scientific programme to be influenced by patients' beliefs.
WPI has also generated criticism for statements defending the use of antiretroviral medications as a treatment for CFS. For some individuals, these medications can have substantial side effects. Jay Levy states that taking anti-HIV medications is "not like taking an aspirin". There is currently no consensus that XMRV is capable of infecting humans, much less causing disease; the rush to prescribe antiretrovirals has been described as premature and based on "an unproven hypothesis". Another criticism is that even if XMRV did cause CFS and antiviral medications were effective against the virus, rigorous trials would be needed to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing. Anecdotal treatments, they say, are unhelpful and possibly harmful to "the million or more individuals experiencing these serious conditions".[tpl]Cite pmid|20936981[/tpl]
The editors at Science in May 2011 requested that the authors of the 2009 Lombardi et al. study retract the article due to many independent studies that did not find an association of XMRV with CFS, and studies that have presented data showing contaminated laboratory reagents may have led to false positive results. Science reported that Mikovits declined the request on behalf of the original authors, labeled the request "premature", and asserted that the original study results were accurate.[ref]
</ref> The editor-in-chief of the journal ''Science'' subsequently published an expression of concern, "Because the validity of the study by Lombardi et al. is now seriously in question".<ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/05/31/science.1208542.full.pdf</ref> In December 2011, ''Science'' retracted the 2009 paper.<ref name="sci" />

===XMRV testing===

WPI was criticized for offering non-FDA-approved XMRV testing through its subsidiary, Viral Immune Pathology Diagnostics (VIP Dx), which was founded by WPI's Vincent Lombardi and was headed by Harvey Whittemore. The tests, which over 1000 patients purchased, cost $249 to $450. Virologist John Coffin observed that the original paper established the virus neither as a cause of CFS nor as a viable marker; in a Science news article, Sam Kean notes that the utility of the test for a patient or a physician is unclear. VIP Dx asserted that it introduced its XMRV test as a more expert alternative after a different company began offering one. Lombardi argued that the test is useful and that their 36% positive test results support the science in the original paper.

===Blood supply safety===

Mikovits has stated that XMRV has "almost certainly entered the U.S. blood supply system, but did not know whether it would be susceptible to the same heat treatments that successfully kill off the AIDS virus in blood products." The  Wall Street Journal has reported that WPI and other laboratories are participating in a United States federal working group to determine the prevalence of XMRV in the blood supply and the suitability of different detection methods. The WPI is also collecting blood from CFS patients who received their diagnosis after a blood transfusion and are planning to conduct their own study on XMRV blood transmission.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303450704575160081295988608.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Potential Risk to Blood Supply Probed | date=4 April 2010[/tpl] The association between XMRV and CFS reported in Science prompted Health Canada,CBCCanadian Blood Services Responds to Possible New Blood Safety Threat the New Zealand Blood Service,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/chronic-fatigue-set-disqualify-blood-donors/5/45805 | title = Chronic Fatigue Set To Disqualify Blood Donors | accessdate = 2010-06-25 | date = 2010-04-21 | last = Atkinson | first = K | publisher = Voxy.co.nz [/tpl] and The Australian Red Cross Blood ServiceBlood Service updates CFS donor policy to restrict individuals with CFS from donating blood in 2010.
