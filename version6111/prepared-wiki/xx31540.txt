Scholars have theorized that Agdistis is part of a continuum of androgynous Anatolian deities, including an ancient Phrygian deity probably named "Andistis" and one called "Adamma", stretching all the way back to the ancient kingdom of Kizzuwatna in the 2nd millennium BC.  There is also some epigraphic evidence that in places Agdistis was considered a healing goddess of wholly benevolent nature.
