CATEGORIES: Salticidae, Endemic fauna of Samoa

Rarahu is a genus of spiders in the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species, Rarahu nitida, is endemic to Samoa.

==Name==

Berland probably adapted the genus name Rarahu from Pierre Loti's book of the same name, which was published in 1880. Loti himself either used the rare Tahitian word "rarahu", meaning (amongst other things) "to eat tapu things", or changed the name of the volcano "Raraku".Mabbott 1946
The species name is from Latin nitida "shining", "handsome", or "neat" (a false cognate).
