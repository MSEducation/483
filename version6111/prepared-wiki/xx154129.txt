Jeffrey Baldwin (20 January 1997 â€“ 30 November 2002) was a Canadian child whose death from septic shock after years of mistreatment by his grandparents, Elva Bottineau and Norman Kidman, led to significant changes in policy by children's aid societies in the granting of custody of children to relatives.

==Life==

Baldwin was born in Doctor's Hospital in Toronto, the son of Yvonne Kidman and Richard Baldwin.  On 28 April 1998, he and his older sister were taken by the Catholic Children's Aid Society after allegations of abuse were levelled against their parents.  They were given into the custody of their maternal grandparents, Elva Bottineau and Norman Kidman. 
In 2000, a worker with the Catholic Children's Aid Society noticed a bruise under Baldwin's eye, but this was dismissed as an accident and no action was taken. 
According to later court testimony, Baldwin and his sister were kept in a locked room at night with furnace vents shut, and when released were forced to eat with their hands from a mat on the floor.

On the evening of 30 November 2002, his grandmother called 911 to report that he was not breathing.  Upon arrival, emergency workers noticed that his body was "covered in sores, bruises and abrasions".  His weight at death was slightly less than his weight at his first birthday, almost five years earlier. [tpl]Ref|thestar20060408a[/tpl]

==Court case==

On 19 March 2003, his grandparents were arrested and charged with first-degree murder for their role in his death.  The trial heard they had kept Jeffrey locked in a bedroom, where he lived in his own feces, and left him to drink from a toilet.  The judge was told that the pair used the children as a source of income, collecting government support checks while offering little in return.  On 7 April 2006 they were convicted of second-degree murder by Justice David Watt in Ontario Superior Court.  Sentencing was delivered on 9 June 2006.  Bottineau was sentenced to 22 years in prison (until 2023) and Kidman 20 years (until 2021), before they respectively become eligible for parole. [tpl]Ref|cbc20060609a[/tpl]

==Crowdfunding campaign==

On 22 November 2013 Todd Boyce, a fellow Canadian unrelated to Jeffrey Baldwin, started a $25,000 crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo over 60 days to erect a bronze statue in Greenwood Park, Toronto depicting Jeffrey dressed as Man of Steel.
