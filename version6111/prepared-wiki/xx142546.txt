When the Muslim army conquered the town of Ayn al-Tamr they found a number of Arab Christian priests in a monastery. One of them was called Nusair another called Serine. They both embraced Islam. Nusair is the father of Mosa Ben Nusair, the supreme commander of the forces which later conquered Spain under the leadership of Tariq bin Ziyad, the second in command for Musa bin Nusayr. Serine, the other convert, is the father of the scholar Ibn Serine who became one of the more celebrated Muslim theologians.
This battle took place in modern day Iraq (Mesopotamia) between the early Muslim Arab forces and the Sassanians along with their Arab Christian auxiliary forces. Ein-ul-tamr is located west of Anbar and was a frontier post which had been established to aid the Sassanids.The Caliph's Last Heritage: A Short History of the Turkish Empire by Mark Sykes
The Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid's command soundly defeated the Sassanian auxiliary force, which included large numbers of non-Muslim Arabs who broke earlier covenants with the Muslims.The Book of Revenue: Kitab Al-Amwal by Abu 'Ubayd Al-Qasim Ibn Sallam, pg 194 According to non-Muslim sources, Khalid ibn al-Walid captured the Arab Christian commander, Aqqa ibn Qays ibn Bashir, with his own hands.Annals of the Early Caliphate by William Muir, pg. 85
After the battle, some Persians had hoped that the Muslim commander, Khalid ibn al-Walid, would be "like those Arabs who would raid withdraw."Poetics of Islamic Historiography: Deconstructing Tabari's History by Boaz Shoshan, pg. 55 However, Khalid continued to press further against the Persians and their allies in the subsequent Battle of Dawmat al-Jandal.
