[[Sercquiais]]

CATEGORIES: Norman language, Sark, Endangered Romance languages

[tpl]lang|roa|Sercquiais[/tpl] also known as Sarkese or Sark-French ([tpl]lang|roa|Lé Sèrtchais[/tpl]) is the Norman dialect of the Channel Island of Sark (Bailiwick of Guernsey). In the island it is sometimes known, slightly disparagingly, as the "patois", a French term meaning "regional language".
Sarkese is in fact a descendant of the 16th century Jèrriais used by the original colonists, 40 families mostly from Saint Ouen, Jersey,[tpl]ref|colonists[/tpl] who settled the then uninhabited island, although influenced in the interim by Dgèrnésiais (Guernsey dialect). It is still spoken by older inhabitants of the island. Although the lexis is heavily anglicised, the phonology retains features lost in Jèrriais since the 16th century. Most of the local placenames are in Sarkese. In former times, there may have been two subdialects of Sercquiais.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/jerriais.shtml#A |title=Voices - Multilingual Nation |publisher=BBC |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2013-07-24[/tpl] It is also closely related to the Auregnais (Alderney) dialect, as well as Continental Norman.
It has suffered greatly in recent years due to a large influx of tax exiles from England who have moved to the island, as well as official neglect.

==Written Sercquiais==

Relatively little Sercquiais has been transcribed, and as there is no widely accepted form, it has received a certain amount of stigma as a result. A ruler of Sark, Dame Sibyl Hathaway, who was a speaker herself, claimed that it could "never be written down", and this myth has continued in the years since then.
The earliest published text in Sercquiais so far identified is the Parable of the Sower ([tpl]lang|roa|Parabol du smeaux[/tpl]) from the Gospel of Matthew. Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, linguist, visited the Channel Islands in September 1862 in order to transcribe samples of the insular language varieties, which he subsequently published in 1863:
{{lang|roa|
Which in the NIV is translated as:

==Phonology==

Sercquiais does not have the voiced dental fricative which is such a distinctive characteristic of St. Ouen in Jersey where most of the colonists came from.
Palatalisation of velars [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl] (see Joret line) is less fully developed in Sercquiais than in Jèrriais. Palatalisation in Jèrriais of [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|tʃ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|dʒ[/tpl] has the equivalent in Sercquiais of [tpl]IPA|/kj/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɡj/[/tpl]. For example hiccup is [tpl]lang|roa|hitchet[/tpl] in Jèrriais and [tpl]lang|roa|hekyet[/tpl] in Sercquiais; war is respectively [tpl]lang|roa|dgèrre[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|roa|gyer[/tpl].
Palatalisation of [tpl]IPA|/tj/[/tpl] in Jèrriais leads to [tpl]IPA|tʃ[/tpl], but in Sercquiais [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] is generally retained: profession, trade in Sercquiais is [tpl]lang|roa|meeti[/tpl], whereas Jèrriais has palatalised to [tpl]lang|roa|mêtchi[/tpl].
[tpl]IPA|dʒ[/tpl] is retained in Sercquiais where Jèrriais has reduced to [tpl]IPA|ʒ[/tpl], as in to eat: [tpl]lang|roa|mãdji[/tpl] (Sercquiais) - [tpl]lang|roa|mangi[/tpl] (Jèrriais).
Final consonants of masculine nouns in the singular are in free variation with null in all positions except in liaison. Final consonants are usually pronounced at ends of phrases. Final consonants are always lost in plural forms of masculine nouns. A cat may therefore be [tpl]lang|roa|kat[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|roa|ka[/tpl] in Sercquiais, but cats are [tpl]lang|roa|kaa[/tpl]. For comparison, Jèrriais cat is usually pronounced [tpl]IPA|/ka/[/tpl], and the plural has the long vowel as in Sercquiais. It can also therefore be seen that length is phonemic and may denote plurality.
Sercquiais has also retained final consonants that have been entirely lost in Jèrriais, such as final [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] in [tpl]lang|roa|pret[/tpl] (meadow - [tpl]lang|roa|pré[/tpl] in Jèrriais as in French).
Metathesis of [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] is uncommon in Sercquiais, and in Jèrriais, by comparison with Dgèrnésiais.
The palatalised l, which in Jèrriais has been generally palatalised to [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl] in initial position and following a consonant, is maintained in Sercquiais.
Gemination occurs regularly in verb conjugations and gerunds, as in Jèrriais but in distinction to Dgèrnésiais.
However, Sercquiais does not geminate palatal fricatives, unlike Jèrriais:

==Conjugation of verbs==

The St. Ouennais origins of Sercquiais can be seen in the 2nd and 3rd person plural forms of the preterite. Sercquiais uses an ending -dr which is typical of the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais, but generally not used elsewhere in Jersey (nor nowadays by younger speakers in St. Ouen).
