The History Aptitude Test (HAT) is a standardized test used as part of the admissions process to Oxford University for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.
The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions. 

==Criticism==

In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/oct/11/accesstouniversity.highereducation
