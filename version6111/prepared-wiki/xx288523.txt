Crossing to Safety is a 1987 semi-autobiographical novel by Wallace Stegner which gained broad literary acclaim and commercial popularity.
Stegner was an American historian, novelist, short story writer and conservationist, who is sometimes called "The Dean of Western Writers".Evelyn Boswell, "New Stegner professor to hit the ground running, Montana State University News Service, Oct. 5, 2010; retrieved 2013-08-13.

Crossing to Safety is Stegner's exploration into the mysteries of friendship, and it extends Stegner's distinguished body of work that had already earned him a Pulitzer Prize (for 1971's Angle of Repose) and the National Book Award (for 1976's The Spectator Bird).  This story is an eloquent and deeply moving meditation on the idealism and spirit of youth, when the world is full of promise, and on the blows and compromises life inevitably inflicts. The narrator, Larry Morgan and his wife Sally settle in to their new home in Madison, Wisconsin, as Larry begins a term teaching creative writing at the university's English department. They soon befriend another couple, Sid and Charity Lang, and learn of Sid's ambition to succeed as a writer.Review, Stegner's Crossing to Safety, Publishers Weekly; retrieved 2013-08-13. As their careers mature, they take different paths, but they spend much of their time together on summer vacations in the small Vermont town where Charity's family has been coming for decades.Crossing To Safety by Wallace Stegner, Booksnob; retrieved 2014.03.14.
Stegner's powerful but unassuming narrative traces the bond that develops between the Langs and the Morgans from their first meeting in 1937 through their eventual separation on the occasion of Charity's death from cancer.
