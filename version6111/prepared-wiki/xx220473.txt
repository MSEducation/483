After making its debut during Summer 2008, the song became a #1 hit on the Hot Latin Tracks in September. As of January 17, 2009, No Me Doy Por Vencido has been at the summit for 17 of the last 19 weeks (only to be interrupted for two weeks in November by Enrique Iglesias' Lloro Por Ti). It would not only hold off Lloro Por Ti from the top spot, but it would hold off other hits such as "Te Regalo Amores" by RKM y Ken-Y, "Dame Tu Amor" by Alacranes Musical, and "Como Duele" by Ricardo Arjona. It was a big success in Spain where it peaked at #4 and sold 40,000 copies. "No Me Doy Por Vencido" was named the fourth best-performing Latin pop song of the decade ending December 31, 2009.[tpl]Cite news |title=Decade-End Charts|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts-decade-end#/charts-decade-end|work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2011-01-28[/tpl]
