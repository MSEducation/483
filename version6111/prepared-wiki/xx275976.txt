[tpl]nihongo|Suiten-gū|水天宮[/tpl] is a Shinto shrine in Chūō, Tokyo, Japan. It is devoted to conception and safe childbirth. In 1818 the ninth daimyo of the Kurume Domain established the Suiten-gū in Edo as a branch of a shrine of the same name in Kurume, Fukuoka. It was inside the grounds of the domain's mansion in the Mita district of what is now Minato, Tokyo, and the domain opened it to the public on the fifth day of every month. In 1871, the Arima family moved from Mita to Akasaka, taking the shrine with it, and in the following year they moved the shrine to its present location, on a site that had been the family's middle mansion.
There are about 25 other shrines of the same name in Japan.
Suitengumae Station is close to this shrine and takes its name from it.
