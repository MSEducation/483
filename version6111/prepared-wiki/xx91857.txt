===2012 tax avoidance controversy===

In June 2012, Carr's involvement in an alleged K2 tax avoidance scheme came to light after an investigation by The Times newspaper.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jun/19/tax-scheme-jimmy-carr-hmrc|title=Tax avoidance scheme used by Jimmy Carr investigated by HMRC|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 June 2012|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=London|first=Shiv|last=Malik[/tpl] The scheme is understood to involve UK earners "quitting" their job and signing new employment contracts with offshore shell companies based in the low tax jurisdiction of Jersey. British Prime Minister David Cameron commented on the issue: "People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets. He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18521468|title=Jimmy Carr tax affairs 'morally wrong' – Cameron|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=20 June 2012[/tpl] Carr has since pulled out of the scheme, apologising for "a terrible error of judgement".
Viewing figures of the episode of his topical show 8 out of 10 Cats, recorded on the day of his apology and broadcast the following day, almost doubled compared with the previous week.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18569728|publisher=BBC News|title=Jimmy Carr: Tax row sees Channel 4 ratings soar|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=25 June 2012[/tpl] Earlier in 2012, Carr lampooned people who avoid paying their taxes during the second series of Channel 4's satirical news programme 10 O'Clock Live. A sketch from the show, in which he poked fun at the 1% tax rate of Barclays Bank and described tax lawyers as being "aggressive" and "amoral", was regarded as having "come back to haunt him".

==Personal life==

Carr lives in North London with his girlfriend, Karoline Copping, a commissioning editor for Channel 5, whom he has been with since 2001.[tpl]cite news|author=Interview by Jon Bennett|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/09/familyandrelationships2|title=What I know about women|publisher=Guardian|date=9 March 2008|accessdate=10 March 2011|location=London[/tpl]
