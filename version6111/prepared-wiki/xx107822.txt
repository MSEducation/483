This is a list of British units in the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783) who fought against the American rebels and their French, Spanish and Dutch allies in the thirteen North American colonies, including battles in Florida and the West Indies. In addition to the regular army it includes German auxiliary units (known collectively as Hessians), and militia and provincial units formed from Loyalists, West Indians, and Canadians. 
No battle honours were ever awarded to British regiments who fought in America as it was seen by the British to be a civil war. Four battle honours were, however, awarded for actions against the French and Spanish in the West Indies and other theatres.
Only three British Army regiments (23rd Dragoons and the 73rd and 78th Foot) raised during the period of the war, many of whom were intended for North America, survived the post-war reduction in the Army. The 23rd Dragoons aka 19th Light Dragoons served in India; the 73rd (renumbered 71st in 1786) later became part of the Highland Light Infantry while the 78th (renumbered 72nd in 1786) became part of the Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-Shire Buffs) in 1881.
Note: An Infantry Unit not listed is the 2nd Regiment of Foot aka Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey); however the 1st Battalion -along with the Honourable Artillery Company-suppressed the Gordon Riots in London 1780. Neither did the 11th Regiment of Foot {Devonshire} nor the 12th Regiment of Foot {Suffolk}; nor the 25th Regiment of Foot aka King's Own Scottish Borderers at Sussex; nor the 32nd Regiment of Foot at Cornwall; the 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot at Herefordshire; nor the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot at East Middlesex nor 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot nor 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot nor the 81st Regiment of Foot (Aberdeenshire Highland Regiment) take part in the American Revolution. The 86th Regiment of Foot (Rutland Regiment), the 87th Regiment of Foot, and the 90th Regiment of Foot (Yorkshire Volunteers) were stationed in the West Indies. The 72nd Highlanders; 83rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Glasgow Volunteers) and the 95th (Yorkshire) Regiment of Foot did take part in defeating a French invasion of Jersey in 1781 (the Battle of Jersey).
