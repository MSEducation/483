==Pre-NASCAR==

Johns began racing in go-karts at the age of nine, Johns spent time on the go-kart dirt tracks throughout Georgia and the southeast. Moving up, he competed in the PARTS, the GAS and the ARCA RE/MAX Series. Along the way, Johns met Bobby Hamilton, who would be his mentor throughout his career.

==Entry into NASCAR==

Johns attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte while an employee at Team Rensi Motorsports. He graduated UNC-Charlotte with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. At the same time, he was promoted to Rensi's head engineer. In 2007, Rensi turned to Johns in driving their #25 car to fill in for NEXTEL Cup driver David Gilliland when his Cup and Busch schedule conflicted in 15 races, sponsored by freecreditreport.com. Johns had two top-twenty finishes and ended the season with a 44th place finish in points. Losing not only both sponsors but Gilliland as well, who had mutually left due to the struggles of Yates Racing, Team Rensi downsized to a one team operation. During the offseason, Johns left Team Rensi and signed a sponsorship deal with family internet portal havfun.com. He and havfun were to compete in the Craftsman Truck Series for Wyler Racing in 2008, but the sponsor money never materialized and the deal fell through before Speedweeks, leaving Johns without a ride.
