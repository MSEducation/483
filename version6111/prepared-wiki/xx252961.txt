CATEGORIES: Cryptographic software

Palcrypt is an open source single file encryption and decryption program. The source code and the installer of the software were released by Pal Microsystems on April 24, 2008 on their website. As of 2009 it is developed and distributed by Machinescript, Inc. Palcrypt (along with AxCrypt) appealed to computer programmers/software developers and new users to file encryption by combining strong encryption methods and algorithms such as AES, the less common IDEA, MD5, SHA-1, and Blowfish with a clean graphical user interface and a simple design, fully integrated in Windows Explorer. Developers offer a forum providing information to novice users and on-line support as well.
