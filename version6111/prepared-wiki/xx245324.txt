The Holy Cross Wilderness is a U.S. Wilderness Area located in San Isabel and White River national forests near Leadville, Minturn, Avon, Edwards, Eagle, and Vail, Colorado.  The [tpl]convert|122797|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] wilderness with [tpl]convert|164|mi|km[/tpl] of trails was established in 1980.  The wilderness was named after its highest peak, [tpl]convert|14005|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] Mount of the Holy Cross.[tpl]cite web |title=Holy Cross Wilderness |publisher=Wilderness.net |url=http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&WID=248 |accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl]
The Holy Cross Wilderness has a history of many hikers, often those who are unprepared, becoming endangered.  Primarily, the hikers who require rescue are unfamiliar with the risks of entering wilderness areas and do not bring adequate equipment and supplies to respond to emergency conditions.  Hikers are frequently stranded or lost due to changing environmental conditions and confusion regarding the surrounding landscape.  Holy Cross Wilderness visitors should carry adequate provisions, the ten essentials, including water, food, firestarter, guide book or map, global positioning device, layers of clothing, headlamp, knife, and cell telephone.  Thorough research and reasonable planning should prevent most tragedies.[tpl]cite newspaper |title=Search called off for missing hiker in rugged Holy Cross Wilderness |publisher=The Denver Post |date=October 15, 2010 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16343363%7Ctitle= |accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Lynn |first=Steve |title=Lost hiker braves wind, cold in cave |publisher=Summit Daily |date=August 2, 2007 |url=http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20070802/NEWS/70802004&parentprofile=search%7Ctitle= |accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl]
