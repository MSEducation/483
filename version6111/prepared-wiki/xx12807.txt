[[1st century]]

CATEGORIES: 1st century, 1st millennium, Centuries

The 1st century was the century that lasted from 1 to 100 according to the Julian calendar. It is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period.
During this period Europe, North Africa and the Near East fell under increasing domination by the Roman Empire, which continued expanding, most notably conquering Britain under the emperor Claudius (43). The reforms introduced by Augustus during his long reign stabilized the empire after the turmoil of the previous century's civil wars. Later in the century the Julio-Claudian dynasty, which had been founded by Augustus, came to an end with the death of Nero in 68. There followed the famous Year of Four Emperors, a brief period of civil war and instability, which was finally brought to an end by Vespasian, 9th Roman emperor, and founder of the Flavian dynasty. The Roman Empire generally experienced a period of prosperity and dominance in this period and the 1st century is remembered as part of the Empire's golden age. 
In the Roman province of Judea, the 1st Century saw the appearance of Christianity. Some scholars maintain this occurred after the ministry and crucifixion of Jesus Christ while others express doubts of the historicity of the ministry and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus
China continued to be dominated by the Han Dynasty, despite a 14-year interruption by the Xin dynasty under Wang Mang. Han rule was restored in 23; Wang Mang's rule represents the watershed between the Western/Former Han and the Eastern/Later Han. The capital was also moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.

===Christianity===

According to the New Testament, during the reign of Tiberius, Jesus, a Jewish religious leader from Galilee, was crucified in Jerusalem on the charge of blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God.  But God raised him from the dead[tpl]bibleverse||Acts|2:24[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|2:32[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|3:15[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|3:26[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|4:10[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|5:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|10:40[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|13:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|13:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|13:37[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Romans|10:9[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:14[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:15[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Galatians|1:1[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Colossians|2:12[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|1|Peter|1:21[/tpl] three days later, see Resurrection of Jesus. Over the next few decades his followers, following the Great Commission, including the apostle Paul, carried his message throughout the Greek-speaking regions of Asia Minor, eventually introducing it to Rome itself. Roman rulers began to persecute the new sect almost immediately (the emperor Nero accused the Christians of starting the fires that destroyed much of Rome in 64 AD), and would continue to do so for centuries, sometimes vigorously, and other times passively.  Christian tradition records that all of Christ's apostles except John the Evangelist suffered martyrdom.
In the 4th century, Christianity was eventually taken up by the emperor Constantine, although one of his successors Julian the Apostate renounced it for paganism and again persecuted the Church.  However, by the end of the 4th century, Emperor Theodosius I proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire.
