Pixar Animation Studios, or simply Pixar ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|s|ɑr[/tpl], stylized as PIXAR), is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. The studio is best known for its CGI-animated feature films created with PhotoRealistic RenderMan, its own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface used to generate high-quality images. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the computer division of Lucasfilm before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986 with funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority shareholder. The Walt Disney Company bought Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion, a transaction which made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder. On December 21, 2012, Pixar Animation Studios became the Lucasfilm's partner company since The Adventures of André and Wally B.. Luxo Jr., a character from an early Pixar film, is the mascot of the studio.
Pixar has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story (1995), and its most recent being Monsters University (2013). All of the films have received both critical and financial success, with the notable exception being Cars 2, which, while commercially successful, received substantially less praise than Pixar's other productions.[tpl]cite web|last=Tyler|first=Josh|title=It's Official, Cars 2 Is Pixar's First Bad Movie|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/It-s-Official-Cars-2-Is-Pixar-s-First-Bad-Movie-25380.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|accessdate=December 22, 2013|date=June 23, 2011[/tpl] All fourteen films have debuted with CinemaScore ratings of at least "A-", indicating a very positive reception with audiences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/world-war-z-begins-international-roll-out-strongly-in-australia-korea/|title=Monsters University’ Global Total $136.5M: #1 N.A.

The studio has earned 27 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and eleven Grammy Awards, among many other awards and acknowledgments. Since the award's inauguration in 2001, most of Pixar's films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, with seven winning: Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Brave (with Monsters, Inc. and Cars being the only two just being nominated for the award). Up and Toy Story 3 were the second and third animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (the first being Beauty and the Beast). On September 6, 2009, executives John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement by the Biennale Venice Film Festival. The award was presented by Lucasfilm founder George Lucas.

==History==

===Early history===

Pixar was founded as The Graphics Group, which was one third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm that was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Dr. Ed Catmull from the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT),[tpl]cite web | author=Hormby, Thomas| publisher=Low End Mac | title =The Pixar Story: Fallon Forbes, Dick Shoup, Alex Schure, George Lucas and Disney | date =January 22, 2007|url =http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/pixar-story-lucas-disney.html | accessdate =March 1, 2007 [/tpl] where he was in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL). At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques—in particular the invention of the "alpha channel" (by Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith);[tpl]cite web|last=Ray Smith|first=Alvy|title=Alpha and the History of Digital Compositing|url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring12/cos426/papers/Smith95c.pdf|publisher=Princeton University - Department of Computer Science|accessdate=December 22, 2013|date=August 15, 1995[/tpl] years later the CGL produced an experimental film called The Works. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for "renders everything you ever saw"); and developed a number of critical technologies for CG—including "particle effects" and various animation tools.
In 1982, the team began working on film sequences with Industrial Light & Magic on special effects. After years of research, and key milestones in films such as the Genesis Effect in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which numbered 40 individuals back then, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 with investment by Steve Jobs shortly after he left Apple Computer. Jobs paid $5 million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5 million cash as capital into the company. A factor contributing to Lucas' sale was an increase in cash flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi. The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull as President and Dr. Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. They were joined on the Board of Directors by Steve Jobs who was Chairman.
Initially, while awaiting the consequences of Moore's law, that would reduce the cost of computing a film, Pixar was a high-end computer hardware company whose core product was the Pixar Image Computer, a system primarily sold to government agencies and the medical community. One of the buyers of Pixar Image Computers was Walt Disney Studios, which was using the device as part of their secretive CAPS project, using the machine and custom software (written by Pixar) to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2-D animation process to a more automated and thus efficient method. The Image Computer never sold well. In a bid to drive sales of the system, Pixar employee John Lasseter—who had long been creating short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr., to show off the device's capabilities—premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/pixar.html|title=Pixar Animation Studios |publisher=Ohio State University [/tpl]
As poor sales of Pixar's computers threatened to put the company out of business, Jobs invested more and more money and took more and more ownership away from the management and employees until after several years he owned essentially all the company for a total investment of $50 million. Lasseter's animation department began producing computer-animated commercials for outside companies. Early successes included campaigns for Tropicana, Listerine, and Life Savers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usask.ca/greenandwhite/issues/2007/winter2007/features/cover_story.php|title=Toy Stories and Other Tales |publisher=University of Saskatchewan [/tpl] In April 1990 Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. The same year Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pixar-Animation-Studios-Company-History.html |title=Pixar Animation Studios – Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl]
During this period, Pixar continued its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner. In 1991, after a tough start of the year when about 30 employees in the company's computer department had to go (including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad),[tpl]cite web|url=http://hem.passagen.se/des/hocg/hocg_1990.htm |title=History of Computer Graphics: 1990–99 |publisher=Hem.passagen.se |accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl] which reduced the total number of employees to just 42, essentially its original number,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/hard-times-for-innovator-in-graphics.html |title=Hard Times For Innovator In Graphics |work=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1991 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |first=Lawrence M. |last=Fisher[/tpl] Pixar made a $26 million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. At that point, the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and CAPS, and Lasseter’s animation department, who made television commercials, some 3-D Stings for Nickelodeon, and a few shorts for Sesame Street, was all that was left of Pixar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allaboutstevejobs.com/bio/long/06.html |title=all about Steve Jobs – Long Bio (6/11) |language=[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] |publisher=Allaboutstevejobs.com |date=April 30, 1990 |accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl]
Despite the total income of these products, the company was still losing money, and Jobs, still chairman of the board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994, Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies, among them Microsoft. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story was probably going to be a success and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season did he decide to give Pixar another chance.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=September 18, 1995|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/09/18/206099/index.htm|title=Steve Jobs' Amazing Movie Adventure Disney Is Betting On computerdom's Ex-boy Wonder To Deliver This Year's Animated Christmas Blockbuster.

Pixar built a new studio in Emeryville which opened in November 2000.

===Disney===

Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7277295_ITM|title=Sequels to `Toy Story,' `Tail,' `Dragonheart' go straight to video. |publisher=The Seattle Times | first=John | last=Hartl | date=July 31, 2000[/tpl] Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html|title=Disney trying to patch things up with Pixar |publisher=Movies Online [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/29/news/companies/pixar_disney/|title=Pixar dumps Disney |publisher=CNN | date=January 29, 2004[/tpl] More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles and Cars. Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.
Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/01/62104|title=Pixar Says 'So Long' to Disney |publisher=Wired|date=January 29, 2004[/tpl] Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm|title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars|author=Grover, Ronald|work=Business Week |date=December 9, 2004|accessdate=February 23, 2007[/tpl]
Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. (In contrast to the earlier Disney/Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee.) The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/26/pixar_perfectionists_cook_up_ratatouille/|title=Pixar Perfectionists Cook Up 'Ratatouille' As Latest Animated Concoction |publisher=Star Pulse [/tpl]
Disney had agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/ | date=January 24, 2006 |publisher=CNN | title=Disney buys Pixar | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica[/tpl] Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition was completed May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority shareholder of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4 Billion Deal |work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | date=January 25, 2006[/tpl] Jobs' new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares.
Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.
As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became Chief Creative Officer (reporting to President and CEO Robert Iger and consulting with Disney Director Roy Disney) of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks. Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Bob Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studio Entertainment. Steve Jobs' position as Pixar's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was also removed, and instead he took a place on the Disney board of directors.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/|title=Disney buys Pixar |publisher=CNN | date=January 24, 2006 | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica[/tpl]
Lasseter and Catmull's oversight of both the Disney and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal. Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the lack of employment contracts. Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville, California location with the "Pixar" sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be "Disney•Pixar" (beginning with Cars).[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&p_theme=oktb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10F4A5FB9BD5E290&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Sale unlikely to change Pixar culture |publisher=Inside Bay Area | first1=Matthew | last1=Bunk | date=January 21, 2006[/tpl] 
Jim Morris, producer of WALL-E, became general manager of Pixar. In this new position, Morris took charge of the day-to-day running of the studio facilities and products.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=September 10, 2008|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991985.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Morris and Millstein named manager of Disney studios | first=Marc | last=Graser | work=Variety | date=September 10, 2008[/tpl]
Catmull later explained that after the merger, to maintain the studios' separate identities and cultures (notwithstanding the fact of common ownership and common senior management), he and Lasseter "drew a hard line" that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.[tpl]cite news|last=Bell|first=Chris|title=Pixar's Ed Catmull: interview|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/10719241/Pixars-Ed-Catmull-interview.html|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|title=An Interview with Disney/Pixar President Dr. Ed Catmull|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/an-interview-with-disneypixar-president-dr-ed-catmull/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=2 April 2012[/tpl]   That rule ensures that each studio maintains "local ownership" of projects and can be proud of its own work.  Thus, for example, when Pixar had issues with Ratatouille (2007) and Disney had issues with Bolt (2008), "nobody bailed them out" and each studio was required "to solve the problem on its own" even when they knew there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.

===Traditions===

While some of Pixar's first animators were former cel animators, including John Lasseter, they also came from stop motion animation and/or computer animation or were fresh college graduates. A large number of animators that make up the animation department at Pixar were hired around the time Pixar released A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. Although Toy Story was a successful film, it was Pixar's only feature film at the time. The majority of the animation industry was, and is still located in Los Angeles, California, while Pixar is located [tpl]convert|350|mi[/tpl] north in the San Francisco Bay Area. Also, traditional 2-D animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.
With the dearth of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north, give up traditional animation, and try computer animation, Pixar's new-hires at this time either came directly from college, or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software (Marionette) is designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.
In an interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley,[tpl]cite web |author=Smiley, Tavis |title =Tavis Smiley |date =January 24, 2007 |publisher=PBS |url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200701/20070124_transcript.html#2 |accessdate=March 1, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Lasseter said that Pixar films follow the same theme of self-improvement as the company itself has: with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family. At the core, Lasseter said, "it's gotta be about the growth of the main character, and how he changes."
One particular tradition has been a part of every Pixar feature film produced for Disney—John Ratzenberger (formerly of Cheers) has voiced characters (even if it's a cameo) from Toy Story to Monsters University.  Pixar paid tribute to their "good luck charm" in the end credits of Cars where internal parodies of three of their films are seen with Ratzenberger voicing the respective characters.  His punchline in the epilogue was "What kind of cut-rate production is this?"
Due to the traditions that have occurred within the film, such anthropomorphic animals and Easter Egg crossovers between movies that have been spotted by fans, in 2013 a blog post by the name The Pixar Theory was published making the argument that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related.[tpl]cite news|last=Dunn|first=Gaby|title="Pixar Theory" connects all your favorite movies in 1 universe|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/pixar-theory-jon-negroni-up-brave-ratatouille/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=The Daily Dot|date=July 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Whitney|first=Erin|title=The (Mind-Blowing) Pixar Theory: Are All the Films Connected?|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/07/12/the-pixar-theory-are-all-the-films-connected/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=Moviefone|date=July 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=McFarland|first=Kevin|title=Read This: A grand unified theory connects all Pixar films in one timeline|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/read-this-a-grand-unified-theory-connecting-all-pi,100084/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=The A.V.

===Sequels and prequels===

Toy Story 2 was originally commissioned by Disney as a 60-minute direct-to-video release. Expressing doubts about the strength of the material, John Lasseter convinced the Pixar team to start from scratch and make the sequel their third full-length feature film.
Following the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their right to do so. In 2004, after Disney and Pixar were unable to agree on a new deal, Disney announced plans to move forward on sequels with or without Pixar, and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney's new CGI division, Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in pre-production, with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010.
Shortly after announcing the resurrection of Toy Story 3, Lasseter fueled speculation on further sequels by saying, "If we have a great story, we'll do a sequel."[tpl]cite web |author=Douglas, Edwards|title=Pixar Mastermind John Lasseter|date=June 3, 2006|publisher=comingsoon.net|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14741|accessdate =March 1, 2007[/tpl] Cars 2, Pixar's first non-Toy Story sequel, was officially announced in April 2008 and released on June 24, 2011.
