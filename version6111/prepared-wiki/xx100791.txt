According to California Miramar University's website, CMU purchased the assets of Pacific Western University – California, including its State of California approval status, in late 2005. As part of the asset sale, an institutions transition plan was implemented that called for PWU (California) to relocate to San Diego and teach out all active students over 18 months.http://www.calmu.edu/main-navigation/alumni-friends/alumni.html   
Pacific Western University (California) (PWU California) was located in Los Angeles from February 1977 to 2005.History, Pacific Western University website, archived May 17, 2007 Pacific Western University (California) operated in Brentwood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, for its first twenty years, then moved to the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, where it remained until relocating to San Diego in January 2006.  
According to a 2006 article in Inside Higher Education, it was reported that PWU (California) intended to change its name.  The article reported that PWU (California) was under new ownership and management, had changed location and wanted to emphasize that the new ownership no longer had any connection with PWU Hawaii. The article said that the school wanted to distance itself from past controversies and that it intended to filed for national accreditation.[ref]

In early 2007 the conditions of the asset transition were complete and the California State Approval was officially transferred to CMU.  At that time Pacific Western University (California) ceased operations.  Later that year California Miramar University filed for accreditation.  As part of the accreditation process the accrediting agency ruled that CMU and PWU California were separate schools that operated with separate academic standards.  The accreditation agencies stipulated that graduates of Pacific Western University (California) would not be eligible to receive CMU diplomas or transcripts and that the records of the two schools should be held separate. To comply with accreditation requirements, CMU transferred copies of all PWU – California institutional and student records to Education Services, which now serves as the official custodian of records for all PWU students.http://www.bppe.ca.gov/transcripts/custodian_records.shtmlhttp://www.calmu.edu/main-navigation/alumni-friends/alumni.html

Prior to 2007 CMU received approval to operate from the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE). The BPPVE was not a recognized accreditor, nor did its approval serve as a substitute for educational accreditation. State Approval meant that the Bureau had determined and certified that each approved institution had met minimum standards as established in state law for integrity, financial stability, and educational quality. To qualify for approval, an institution had to meet standards with regard to course objectives, and content of courses; physical space; equipment and instructional materials. Other approval criteria included the education, experience and qualifications of instructors and administrators; maintenance of student records; compliance with health and safety codes; and policies for refunding unused tuition and fees. State approval was also a prerequisite in order for a private institution to become accredited.Private Postsecondary Educational Opportunities in California brochure. Obtained December 17, 2006.

==Pacific Western University Controversies prior to 2006==

Prior to the founding of California Miramar University in 2005 and the asset sale of Pacific Western University (California) in that same year, http://www.calmu.edu/main-navigation/alumni-friends/alumni.htmlhttp://www.detc.org/school_details.php?id=301 PWU California was the subject of criticism concerning the unaccredited nature of its programs.
In May 2004 the US Government Accountability Office presented the results of an eight-month examination titled "Diploma mills:  Federal Employees Have Obtained Degrees from Diploma Mills and Other Unaccredited Schools, Some at Government Expense" to the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.Diploma Mills: Federal Employees Have Obtained Degrees from Diploma Mills and Other Unaccredited Schools, Some at Government Expense, United States General Accounting Office, Testimony before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, May 11, 2004 According to the report the investigation was conducted to determine whether the federal government had paid for, or governmental officials possessed, degrees from unaccredited schools. After the passage of the Homeland Security Act, Section 4107 of tile 5, U.S. Code was amended. After this act became law in 2002, the federal government could pay for the cost of academic degree training for federal employees only if the college or university providing that training was accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body. As the basis of the report, the GAO searched the Internet for nontraditional, unaccredited post-secondary schools that offered degrees that met their search criteria. The Senate Committee official transcriptHearings Before The Committee on Governmental Affairs United States Senate, One Hundred Eighth Congress Second Session May 11 and 12, 2004 references Pacific Western University in Los Angeles and Pacific Western University in Hawaii as two of the unaccredited schools the GAO found online and mentioned during the hearing.
Later that year, investigative reporters from television station KVOA of Tucson, Arizona, noted that PWU was one of seven schools discussed in the GAO report,"Investigators: Degrees for Sale" (archived at the Internet Archive), KVOA News 4, Tucson, Arizona, November 16, 2004Clarification[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl], KVOA News 4, Tucson, Arizona, December 13, 2004 and reported that Pima Community College in Tucson had reduced the salaries of two faculty members who previously had been paid at the PhD level based on their degrees from PWU. In a subsequent clarification of the original article KVOA reported that one of the two professors contacted the station and disagreed that PWU was a diploma mill. The professor did not feel misled by Pacific Western, as the station reported, because the professor said it was approved by the California Department of Education to be an educational institution and to award degrees.
Internationally, the media responded similarly to Pacific Western University and the GAO Report.Stephen Phillips, A stress-free PhD? A snip at $250, Times Higher Education, November 25, 2005David Nason, Uni can't find any record of Einfeld, Australasian Business Intelligence, August 27, 2006 In Australia, a lecturer at the University of Southern Queensland was banned from using the title of "Doctor" after it was discovered that his PhD had been obtained from Pacific Western University. This article also noted that PWU was listed as approved on two California state websites.Accredited or Unaccredited?, by Martin Kiely, National Guild of Hypnotists
