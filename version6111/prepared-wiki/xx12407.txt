</ref> (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by [[covalent bond]]ing of xenon to oxygen within [[quartz]], hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.<ref>

Unlike the lower mass noble gases, the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron-56 have a net energy cost to produce through fusion, so there is no energy gain for a star when creating xenon.[ref]
