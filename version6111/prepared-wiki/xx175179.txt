CATEGORIES: 2008 Arena Football League season, New Orleans VooDoo

The [tpl]afly|2008[/tpl] New Orleans VooDoo season is the fourth and final season for the franchise. The Voodoo started the season with a 7–2 record, but lost 6 of their last 7 games, finishing with an 8–8 record. This caused them to miss the playoffs, losing a tiebreaker scenario with the New York Dragons who had finished with the same record, and had defeated the VooDoo in the regular season. The team folded 4 months later, but will return in 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/news/?article_id=302 |title=New Orleans VooDoo set to return to AFL |date=September 15, 2010 |work=Arena Football League |accessdate=December 15, 2010[/tpl]
