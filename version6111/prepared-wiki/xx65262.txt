==Concept and creation==

Buzz Lightyear's name was inspired by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the Moon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/toy-story-3/featurette-buzz-lightyear |title=Toy Story 3 Featurette - Buzz Lightyear |publisher=Trailer Addict |date=June 18, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] Aldrin acknowledged the tribute when he pulled a Buzz Lightyear doll out during a speech at NASA, to rapturous cheers. A clip of this can be found on the Toy Story 10th Anniversary DVD. Aldrin did not, however, receive any endorsement fees for the use of his first name.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/magazine/21fob-q4-t.html?_r=1&ref=space|title=Questions for Buzz Aldrin: The Man on the Moon|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|coauthors=Oth, Christian|date=June 15, 2009 and June 21, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-24[/tpl] Note: nytimes.com print-view software lists the article date as June 21, 2009; main article webpage shows June 15.

Joe for Toy Story and decided upon a spaceman figure.[tpl]cite web|first=Josh|last=Tyler|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Watch-John-Lasseter-Explain-The-Origins-Of-Buzz-Lightyear-15001.html|title=Watch John Lasseter Explain The Origins of Buzz Lightyear|publisher=Cinema Blend|date=September 30, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-14[/tpl] He attributes his design to the influence of Apollo astronauts, in particular their clear helmets, skullcaps, communication devices and white suitsDisney's Buzz Lightyear and Wall-E explore space for NASA June 24, 2008, collectspace.com

==Appearances==

===Films===

In Toy Story, Buzz Lightyear is first seen when given as a gift to Andy from his mother at his birthday party. Buzz quickly becomes Andy's favorite toy leading Woody, a cowboy doll who used to hold this distinction, to develop animosity towards Buzz. The friction between Buzz and Woody is put aside at the end of the movie when they help each other escape from a child who is fond of torturing toys, Sid. In Toy Story 2, Buzz must assume the leadership of the toy gang in order to rescue Woody, who is captured by greedy toy collector named Al, intent on selling Woody to a museum in Japan. Buzz and the toys eventually rescue Woody along with two new toys,  Jessie and Bullseye, who come to live in Andy's room along with all the other toys. In Toy Story 3, Woody, Buzz, and the gang accidentally end up in a daycare center, where the leader of the toys is evil Lotso. Buzz is caught spying, and turned back to "demo mode" where he thinks he is a real space ranger and turns against his friends. Buzz turns back to his normal self after he nearly gets crushed by a television set in a garbage truck. After making their way back to Andy's house, Buzz, Woody, Jessie, and the other toys are given by Andy to a little girl named Bonnie. The end credits show the toys embracing their new life with Bonnie.

===Buzz Lightyear of Star Command===

In Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, Buzz is a space ranger working for Star Command, protecting the universe from Evil Emperor Zurg. He works in a team alongside Mira Nova, a Tangean princess with phasing powers, Booster, a janitor from the planet Jo-Ad, and XR, a robot created by the Little Green Men (the aliens from the movies, LGM for short). This version of Buzz is completely different from the one in Toy Story, in looks and personality. Buzz also has had many love interests on the show. He once had a friend and partner named Warp Darkmatter, however, he later joined Zurg and became his primary agent. Buzz also seems to never take off the purple headwear that he has with his Space Ranger uniform. To compare this animation and the Toy Story films, the button between the red and blue ones is green in the Toy Story films and yellow in this animation with the releasing of strings when pressed. Aside from his regular catch phrase, he has a habit of telling villains that "Evil never wins!" The show received a mixed to positive reception.

==Characteristics==

Buzz is a space ranger from the Intergalactic Alliance and is stationed in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.[tpl]cite video|title=Toy Story|year=1995|publisher=Disney-Pixar[/tpl] He is the captain of the Alliance's Team. Lightyear is known for his bravery and courage. Buzz believes that following rules is the way people should live their life. Though a great leader, at times he exhibits rather unemotional, erratic, and impulsive behaviour, a triumvirate of his biggest character flaws. Buzz is said to be Emperor Zurg's son (Ã  la Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back) as mentioned in Toy Story 2, but in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, this is revealed to be a taunt intended to catch Buzz off guard.[tpl]Episode|date=October 2009[/tpl] Either way, this shows that Buzz does not know his father (although as mentioned in Toy Story 2, he was indeed killed, possibly by Zurg, as neither of these facts have been refuted). Buzz is trained in several forms of martial arts and is a highly skilled warrior in hand to hand combat. Being in peak physical condition, Buzz makes a perfect space ranger and is an example to many. Perhaps unexpectedly, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger toy enjoys his closest personal relationships with two cowboy dolls: his best friend in the trilogy is Sheriff Woody Pride and by the end of Toy Story 2, he has developed a crush on Jessie the Cowgirl, which is consummated with their romance in Toy Story 3.
Buzz wears a high-tech space suit, similar to those of modern-day astronauts though more streamlined and iconic. The suit chest features a control panel. On the left hand side of the suit, a large red button activates the suit's flight system. The buttons on the right of the suit have numerous functions such as contacting Star Command, shooting grappling hooks, and activating full throttle. On the toy Buzz of movies however, all they do is make Buzz say different catch phrases. Buzz's suit also protects against the vacuum and cold of space. It can also translate all he says into any language even an outer space dialect. A retractable helmet, when activated, covers Buzz's head and allows him to breathe in space or on planets lacking a sufficient supply of oxygen.  The left arm of the suit has a panel that flips open to reveal a display that contains a mission log in the wrist area to record history and provide records. The right arm contains the weapon system which projects an unusually strong and powerful red-colored laser out of the small cannon on the back of the wrist. Buzz has a utility belt as an upgrade to suit. It has various things such as anti-gravity servos, magnets for climbing purposes, and a grappling hook.

==Action figure==

Toy figure, Buzz Lightyear, with packaging, licensed from the film Toy Story, plastic / cardboard, made for Thinkway Toys[tpl]cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/12/thinkways.html | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Hero Complex | date=December 30, 2009[/tpl] in China, 1995-1999.

The Toy Story Action Figure, Buzz Lightyear was subject to mass sales in the Christmas after the film's release, mainly in the United States and United Kingdom. In 1995, Thinkway didn't think that Toy Story would be that popular hence didn't make enough dolls to meet demand, as referenced in Toy Story 2. When Toy Story 3 came out they made 2 more Buzz Lightyear action figures for the Toy Story Collection, one normal one and an extra one with the utility belt from Toy Story 2. Produced by Thinkway Toys also with the spaceship box from the movies.
In May 2008, NASA and Disney announced that an original Thinkway Toys' Buzz Lightyear action figure would fly aboard the space shuttle Discovery on mission STS-124. The 12-inch toy was to remain on the International Space Station for six months, where it would take part in an experiment and appear in a video downlink from space. The flight was arranged as part of the Toys In Space program that began in 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052908a.html|title=Buzz Lightyear becomes real space ranger|publisher=collectSPACE|accessdate=2008-05-29|date=May 29, 2008[/tpl]

In October 2009, Thinkway Toys released a replica Buzz Lightyear figure based on the figure in the Toy Story movies as part of their Toy Story Collection series of toys. This Buzz Lightyear was much more accurately detailed than the other Buzz Lightyear figures and it has features similar to the figure seen in the movie with similar pop-out wings complete with blinking lights at the wing tips, laser, wrist communicator and the figure has over 65 phrases with original voice. However, the figure lacks the karate chop action.
The figure also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity and comes packaged in the spaceship packaging as seen in the movies.
