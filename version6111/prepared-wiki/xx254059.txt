The Manitoba Group is a stratigraphical unit of middle to late Devonian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 
It takes the name from the province of Manitoba, and was first defined by A.D. Baillie in 1953.Baillie, A.D., 1953. Devonian System of the Williston Basin area. Manitoba Mines Branch, Pub. 52-5.

==Lithology==

The Manitoba Group is composed of alternating cycles of shale, carbonate and evaporite.

==Distribution==

The Manitoba Group occurs in outcrop in southwestern Manitoba and in the sub-surface in southern Saskatchewan, North Dakota and Montana. It reaches a maximum thickness of [tpl]convert|150|m|ft|-1[/tpl] in outcrop and up to [tpl]convert|244|m|ft|-1[/tpl] in the sub-surface.

==Subdivisions==

The following formationas are recognised, from top to bottom:

==Relationship to other units==

The Manitoba Group is conformably overlain by the Duperow Formation and disconformably overlays the Prairie Evaporite Formation or Winnipegosis Formation of the Elk Point Group.
The lower Manitoba Group is equivalent to the Muskeg Formation in northern Alberta, while the upper part correlates with the Beaverhill Lake Formation.
