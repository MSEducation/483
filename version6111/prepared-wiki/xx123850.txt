CATEGORIES: 1997 debut albums, Thirsty Ear Recordings albums

Slush is the 1997 debut album by OP8, a band formed from Lisa Germano, Howe Gelb of Giant Sand, and Joey Burns and John Convertino of Calexico and Giant Sand. The album was released on Thirsty Ear and features covers of "Sand" by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood as well as "Round and Round" by Neil Young.  Its generally mainstream, jazz-inflected songwriting is at times counterbalanced by odd sonic details, including detuned melodic fragments and synthetic noises.

==Track listing==

The album was a critical success, and MTV invited the band to perform several of the songs from the album on their show MTV's Alternative Nation, in 1997. This gave Germano some much needed exposure, and "If I Think Of Love" became somewhat popular, and she released it on her next album, 1998's Slide.
