==History==

John Hendricks founded the channel and its parent company, Cable Educational Network Inc., in 1982.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73614317.html?dids=73614317:73614317&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+19%2C+1988&author=Martie+Zad&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=The+Discovery+Channel%3B+Science%2C+Nature%2C+Adventure+and+Animals+That+Bite&pqatl=google|title=The Discovery Channel; Science, Nature, Adventure and Animals That Bite|date=June 19, 1988|publisher=The Washington Post | first=Martie | last=Zad[/tpl] Several investors (including the BBC, Allen & Company and Venture America) raised $5 million in start-up capital to launch the network.
The Discovery Channel began broadcasting on June 17, 1985. It was initially available to 156,000 households and broadcast for 12 hours each day between 3 p.m. and 3 a.m. About 75 percent of its program content had never been broadcast on U.S. television before.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/movies/cable-tv-notes-a-channel-with-a-difference.html?&pagewanted=all|title=CABLE TV NOTES; A CHANNEL WITH A DIFFERENCE|date=June 16, 1985|publisher=New York Times | first=Steve | last=Schneider | accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl] In its early years, the channel's focus centered on educational programming in the form of cultural and wildlife documentaries, and science and historical specials. It also broadcast some Soviet programming during this time, including the news program Vremya.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963577,00.html|title=Television: The Russians Are Coming|date=February 23, 1987|publisher=Time[/tpl] In 1988, the channel premiered the nightly program World Monitor (produced by The Christian Science Monitor). In 1988, The Discovery Channel debuted an annual programming stunt called Shark Week, the week-long event eventually gained in popularity starting in the 1990s and continues to be shown each summer on the channel to this day. By 1990, the channel was available in over 50 million households. [tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
The channel began to shift its focus in the early 2000s to attract a broader audience, by incorporating more reality-based series focusing on automotive, occupations and speculative investigation series; though the refocused programming strategy proved popular, Discovery Channel's ratings began to decline by the middle of the decade. The drop in viewership was widely attributed to an over-reliance on a few hit series, such as Monster Garage and American Chopper.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] Some critics[tpl]who|date=June 2012[/tpl] said such shows strayed from Discovery's intention of providing more educationally-based shows aimed at helping viewers learn about the world around them. In 2005, Discovery changed its programming focus to include more popular science and historical themes.Dirty Work – 8/14/2006 – Multichannel News The network's ratings eventually recovered in 2006.DCI :: Press and News Releases
On January 4, 2006, Discovery Communications announced anchor Ted Koppel, executive producer Tom Bettag and eight other former staff members from the ABC newsmagazine Nightline were joining Discovery Channel.

In 2007, Discovery Channel's top series included the Emmy-award winning Planet Earth, Dirty Jobs, MythBusters and Deadliest Catch. Discovery Channel's 2008 lineup included Fight Quest and Smash Lab.

==Non-television ventures==

===Pro Cycling Team===

Shortly before the 2004 Tour de France, Discovery Channel announced it would become the primary sponsor of a professional bicycling team starting in 2005, featuring seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong. However, after the 2007 victory with the Spaniard Alberto Contador, Discovery Channel announced its would discontinue the cycling sponsorship, which ended after the 2007 cycling season.

===Discovery Channel Radio===

Discovery Channel Radio was a radio network, whose programming consisted of audio versions of popular programs from the Discovery Communications family of television channels. Discovery Channel Radio was previously carried by XM Satellite Radio, until its removal from the provider in early September 2005. Sirius Satellite Radio dropped Discovery Radio from its lineup on February 21, 2007; it was also formerly carried on both of Canada's major satellite radio services.

===Store===

Discovery Channel also lent its brand to retail stores in malls and other locations across America, as well as an online store. The store's specialty products were educational gifts, most of which were manufactured with the Discovery Channel brand name. On May 17, 2007, Discovery Communications announced it would close its standalone and mall-based stores. Hudson Group will continue to operate the Discovery Channel Airport Stores, and the website remains in operation.[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/17/news/companies/discovery/?postversion=2007051717 | work=CNN | title=Discovery shuttering 103 locations | date=May 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl]

===Telescope===

Discovery Channel is also funding the construction of the Discovery Channel Telescope, in partnership with Lowell Observatory.

Discovery.com is the Discovery Channel's official website, which primarily provides information on the channel's programming and additional content tied to those shows; it also features several exclusive browser-based games, with various science-based or sociological challenges.

==Marketing and branding==

===Taglines===

Discovery Channel's previous taglines had been "Explore Your World" and "There's No Thrill Like Discovery." However in view of its changing focus towards more reality-based programming and away from strictly educational programming, the slogan was changed in the early 2000s to "Entertain Your Brain". The new tagline for the revamped Discovery Channel was "Let's All Discover...", with a continuing phrase or sentence that relates to a show. For example, when advertising for MythBusters, the commercial would end, "Let's All Discover, Why No Myth Is Safe". With the 2008 logo change came a new tagline: "The World is Just...Awesome." The newest image promos include an unreleased mix of the song "Wonders Never Cease" by Morcheeba, from the album entitled The Antidote and the song "Typical" by Mutemath. Their most recent promo I Love the World, created by the 72andSunny agency, contains amended verses and the refrain from the traditional campfire song "I Love The Mountains".

===Logos===

The Discovery Channel's first logo was a television screen picturing a map of the world. For two decades, starting in 1987, the channel's logo incorporated the Discovery wordmark rendered in the Aurora Bold Condensed font with a circlular shape in front of it. The circle usually took the form of a rising sun, or an animated version of the Vitruvian Man.
In 1995, the channel's name was simplified to "Discovery Channel", dropping the "The" from its name. A globe became a permanent part of the logo, and an underline was added to the bottom of the logo. During this time, the company started expanding and launched several new networks. Many of the sister networks used logo designs similar to the one used by Discovery, often incorporating the globe and using the same typeface. Networks that had logos based on Discovery's included Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Discovery Science, Discovery Wings and Discovery Home & Leisure. The logo was changed slightly in 2000 when the word "Channel" was moved into the underline, and the globe was altered to focus on the Pacific Ocean.
On April 15, 2008, before the season premiere of Deadliest Catch, Discovery Channel debuted a new logo, and a new tagline ("The World is Just Awesome"). The logo was designed by Boston-based design firm Viewpoint Creative and replaced the longstanding Aurora Bold Condensed font in the logo with Gotham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viewpointcreative.com/news/index.php?nc=73|title=Viewpoint Creative Designs New Discovery Channel Logo|publisher=Viewpoint Creative[/tpl] The globe has been merged with the "D" in "Discovery".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/132649-Discovery_Times_New_Branding_Campaign_To_Deadliest_Catch_Debut.php|title=Discovery Times New Branding Campaign To ‘Deadliest Catch’ Debut|date=March 31, 2008|publisher=Multichannel News[/tpl] A combination of the "D" in the wordmark and the globe is sometimes used separately, primarily as the channel's logo bug during its programming. Later in 2009, design agency Royale slightly modified the logo, detaching the globe from the "D", and making the word CHANNEL slightly bigger. The modified logo was rolled out to Discovery's international channels during the first half of 2009.

==Controversies==

===RFID===

In August 2008, it was reported by The Consumerist that Discovery Channel had preempted an episode of MythBusters examining RFID security in regard to its implementation in credit cards before its original broadcast because the episode would upset credit card companies, who are major advertisers on Discovery Channel.[tpl]cite web|title=Mythbusters Gagged: Credit Card Companies Kill Episode Exposing RFID Security Flaws|url=http://consumerist.com/5043831/mythbusters-gagged-credit-card-companies-kill-episode-exposing-rfid-security-flaws|accessdate=2008-12-12[/tpl] It was later determined that the decision not to investigate the issue was made by Beyond Productions, the MythBusters production company, and was not made by Discovery Channel or their advertising department.[tpl]cite web|title=Mythbusters Host Retracts RFID Censorship Comments|url=http://consumerist.com/5045633/mythbusters-host-retracts-rfid-censorship-comments|accessdate=2008-12-12[/tpl]

===Enigmatic Malaysia===

An ad promoting Enigmatic Malaysia, a special series on the network meant to highlight the cultural heritages of Malaysia, mistakenly featured Balinese Pendet dancers. This prompted outrage from Balinese dancers, who posted messages demanding that Malaysia apologize over the misinformation, which then sparked a series of street protests.[tpl]cite web|title=Protests over presence of Pendet dance in Malaysia’s tourism ad continue|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/08/23/protests-over-presence-pendet-dance-malaysia%E2%80%99s-tourism-ad-continue.html?page=2|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03|author=Niken Prathivi and Irawaty Wardany|work=Jakarta Post[/tpl] Further demands were made from the local governments, cultural historians as well as the tourism ministry in Indonesia for Malaysia to clarify the situation.[tpl]cite web|author=Jakarta Post|date=2009-08-28|author=I Wayan Juniartha|title=Pendet, the dance that rocks the cradle|work=Jakarta Post|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/08/28/pendet-dance-rocks-cradle.html|accessdate=2009-09-03[/tpl] The Malaysian government reportedly offered an apology, which was rejected by the Indonesian tourism minister, since the apology was given informally by phone, the Indonesian tourism minister demanded a written apology to make it more accountable.[tpl]cite web|date=2009-08-27|title=Indonesian Minister Rejects Malaysian Pendet Apology|author=Dessy Sagita|work=The Jakarta Globe|accessdate=2009-09-03|url=http://thejakartaglobe.com/national/indonesian-minister-rejects-malaysian-pendet-apology/326562[/tpl]

===Romanian RCS&RDS===

In November 2012, the Romanian RCS&RDS, the largest company of its kind on the internal market, interrupted its carriage of Discovery Communications channels, including Discovery Channel. The CEO of Discovery Communications Mark Hollinger sent an open letter in his attempt to counteract the action of RCS&RDS, attracting the attention to the negation of the alleged right of the viewer to choose the viewed channels.http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-media_publicitate-13718443-scrisoare-deschisa-din-partea-ceo-discovery-networks-catre-telespectatorii-romani-suntem-indignati-ceea-intampla-motiv-pentru-care-demarat-discutiile-autoritatile-din-romania-uniunea-europeana.htm In turn, RCS&RDS issued a press statement accusing of hypocrisy Hollinger's discourse attentive at the needs of viewers and attracted attention to the fact that, during negotiations, the main preoccupations of the Discovery representatives was maintaining as high as possible tariffs and monetary gains”.http://www.rcs-rds.ro/comunicat?id=271

===Giant Sharks===

In August 2013 Discovery Channel released a film purporting to be a factual documentary entitled "Megalodon: the monster shark lives", which claimed to show that Carcharadon megalodon still exists. George Monbiot  has claimed that the images used in this documentary, specifically of a megalodon in an image of Nazi U-boats off the coast of South Africa in 1942 was faked.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/feb/21/discovery-channel-giant-shark-documentary-george-monbiot | title=Did Discovery Channel fake the image in its giant shark documentary? | publisher=The Guardian | date=21 February 2014 | accessdate=15 March 2014 | author=Monbiot, George[/tpl] The image appears to have been taken from film footage[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tarrif.net/wwii/movies/uboats.wmv | title=WWII Movies UBoats | publisher=Tarrif.net | accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl] but no shark can be seen in this film. George Monbiot confronted the production company, Pilgrim Studios about this image and other controversial statements in the film, but had received no reply as of 21 February 2014.
Concerns have been raised about the implications of this film considering recent calls for shark culls in Australia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
