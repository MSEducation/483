[[Country Music Star No. 1]]

CATEGORIES: 1969 compilation albums, Glen Campbell compilation albums, English-language compilation albums, Starday Records compilation albums

Country Music Star No. 1 contains recordings of a prestardom Glen Campbell, which were made around 1960-1961. This album, just like the other Starday album Country Soul, was released after Glen Campbell rose to international fame with hits like Gentle on My Mind, By the Time I Get to Phoenix and Wichita Lineman. After a successful lawsuit by Campbell against these releases, both albums were retracted.
