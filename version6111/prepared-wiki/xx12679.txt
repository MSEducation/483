Ziad Samir Jarrah ([tpl]lang-ar|زياد سمير جراح[/tpl], [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Ziyād Samīr Ǧarrāḥ[/tpl]; May 11, 1975[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 11, 2001) was one of the men suspected of perpetrating the September 11 attacks; serving as the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 93, crashing the plane into a field in a rural area near Shanksville—after a passenger uprising—as part of the coordinated attacks.[tpl]Ref label|a|a|none[/tpl]
After a wealthy and secularist upbringing, Jarrah moved to Germany in 1996. He became involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks while attending Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH) in the late 1990s, meeting Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, forming in 1998 what is now known as the Hamburg cell. Jarrah was recruited by Osama bin Laden for the attacks in 1999. Unique among the hijackers, he was close to his family and girlfriend.
Jarrah arrived in the United States in June 2000, where he trained at Florida Flight Training Center from June 2000 to January 2001, after relocating to Florida from New Jersey.
On September 7, 2001, Jarrah flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark. On September 11, Jarrah boarded United Airlines Flight 93, and he is believed to have taken over as the pilot of the aircraft along with his team of hijackers, which included Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi who together made an unsuccessful attempt to crash the plane into the U.S. Capitol, since the passengers started a revolt against the hijackers.[tpl]Ref label|b|b|none[/tpl]

==Spelling of his name==

There are many variations on his name, including "Ziad Jarrah Jarrat", "Ziad Jarrahi", "Ziad Samir al-Jarrah", and "Ziyad Samir Jarrah".[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

==Early life and education==

Jarrah was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to a wealthy family. His parents were nominally Muslim Sunnis, although they lived a secular lifestyle. In his childhood, he had always wanted to fly planes, but his family discouraged this. "I stopped him from being a pilot," his father told the Wall Street Journal a week after the attacks. "I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash."[tpl]cite news|first=Glenn|last=Simpson|title=A Student's Dreams or a Terrorist Plot?|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=September 18, 2001[/tpl]
From 1995 to 1996, while Jarrah was still living in Yemen, according to his family, somebody of the same name rented an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. The landlords claimed it was the same Ziad Jarrah as in the FBI photographs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://boston.com/dailyglobe2/268/nation/Hijack_suspect_lived_a_life_or_a_lie+.shtml|title= Hijack Suspect Lived a Life, or a Lie|last=Neuffer|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=October 25, 2001|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010925140413/http://boston.com/dailyglobe2/268/nation/Hijack_suspect_lived_a_life_or_a_lie+.shtml|archivedate=September 25, 2001[/tpl]
In the spring of 1996, Jarrah moved to Germany with his cousin Salim. They were there to take a certificate course in German at the University of Greifswald required of foreigners studying in Germany who do not speak the language. While sharing an apartment with his cousin, he reportedly attended discos and beach parties, and his attendance at the mosque fell off. He met Aysel Şengün, a Turkish woman studying dentistry, and the two became good friends. They dated on and off for the remainder of his life, and lived together briefly, which vexed his more religious friends.[tpl]cite book|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|page=163|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/books/review/20book.html[/tpl]
In 1997, Jarrah left Greifswald and instead began studying aerospace engineering at the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) in Hamburg, while working at a Volkswagen paint shop in nearby Wolfsburg. While in Hamburg, he rented an apartment from Rosemarie Canel, who would paint a portrait of him that he would bring back as a gift for his mother that December.THE STORY OF ZIAD JARRAH. CBC News (Aired October 10, 2001, Update January 19, 2005, Retrieved on September 13, 2006)
The 9/11 Commission Report states that Jarrah was a member of the Hamburg cell, along with Mohamed Atta and the others. He did not live with any of the others, however, and can be confirmed to only have met with any of them in Hamburg on a single occasion: that of Said Bahaji's wedding at the al-Quds Mosque. The closeness of his connections with the others is not known.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl]

==Training in Afghanistan==

In late 1999, Jarrah, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh decided to travel to Chechnya to fight Russian soldiers. Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi convinced them at the last minute to travel instead to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks.[tpl]cite book|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|pages=165-166[/tpl] They were told they were on a highly secret mission, and were instructed to return to Germany after the operation and enroll in flight school.[tpl]Ref label|c|c|none[/tpl] In October 1999, Ziad Jarrah was filmed at Said Bahaji’s wedding with other 9/11 hijackers, including Marwan al-Shehhi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-05-07-hijackers_x.htm|title=Wedding video shows Sept. 11 hijackers, plotters|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|date=2003-05-07|work=USA Today[/tpl]
In 2006, a video surfaced showing Jarrah, still bearded, reading his will in January 2000 along with Mohamed Atta. Not long after this, Jarrah shaved his beard and began to act in a more secular way, according to Şengün. Many of the future hijackers attempted to hide their radicalism and blend in with the population. Jarrah reported his passport stolen in February 2000 and received a duplicate, just as hijackers Atta and Shehhi had done the previous month.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl]
Jarrah dropped out of the Fachhochschule and began looking at flight schools. He claimed that this was to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot. After looking in several countries, he decided that none of the flight schools in Europe were adequate. At the advice of a childhood friend, he prepared to move to the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl]
