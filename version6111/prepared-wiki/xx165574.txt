FIBA Hall of Fame honors basketball players, coaches and administrators who have contributed to international competitive basketball. It was established by FIBA in 1991. It includes the "Samaranch Library", the biggest basketball library in the world that, as of 2007, has over 10,000 basketball books and 950 magazines from over 65 countries. The Hall of Fame building is a basketball museum built in Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain by the Pedro Ferr√°ndiz Foundation. Initially, induction ceremonies occurred every two years, with the first taking place in 2007. The pattern was interrupted in 2010, when a class was inducted on the day of the 2010 FIBA World Championship Final in Istanbul. After that, no induction took place until 2013, with a class announced in May of that year with induction taking place on 19 June.
