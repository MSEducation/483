</ref> Xenon is also used in [[X-ray crystallography|protein crystallography]]. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] (5 to 50&nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative, which can be used for solving the [[phase problem]].<ref>

==Precautions==

Many oxygen-containing xenon compounds are toxic due to their strong oxidative properties, and explosive due to their tendency to break down into elemental xenon plus diatomic oxygen (O2), which contains much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.[ref]

Xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials.[ref]
