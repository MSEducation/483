PhpGedView is a free PHP-based web application for working with genealogy data on the Internet. The project was founded and is headed by John Finlay.PhpGedView - PGVWiki:History- "I decided to develop PhpGedView because I wanted to update the genealogy area on my web site and decided to look around for a dynamic GEDCOM to HTML converter. I looked at few programs, but was sadly disappointed at the design and layout of them. This led me to begin creating my own. I soon released the first version on SourceForge in June 2002.â€“ John Finlay"EOGN's Announcements: Neumont University offers free PhpGedView:April 19, 2006 - "Neumont University instructor John Finlay graduated in Computer Engineering from Brigham Young University and worked in the BYU Harold B.
