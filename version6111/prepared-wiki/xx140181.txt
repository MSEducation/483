The Sandwich Range is located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States, north of the Lakes Region and south of the Kancamagus Highway.  Although the range is not outstanding for its elevation, it is very rugged and has excellent views of the surrounding lakes, mountains, and forests.
The Sandwich Range extends east-west about 30 miles from Conway, New Hampshire on the Saco River to Campton on the Pemigewasset River.  The Kancamagus Highway runs along the north side of the mountains, from Conway to North Woodstock.  The highest peak in the range is Mount Tripyramid, with an elevation of [tpl]convert|4170|ft[/tpl].Appalachian Mountain Club, White Mountain Guide, 26th ed. (1998), pp. 313-314
The east part of the range drains by various streams into the Saco River and thence into the Atlantic Ocean at Saco, Maine. The west part drains into the East Branch Pemigewasset River and Mad River, thence into the Pemigewasset, Merrimack and into the sea at Newburyport, Massachusetts.
The range shares its name with the town of Sandwich, situated at the range's western end.
