[[Non-Inscrits]]

CATEGORIES: European Parliament party groups

Non-Inscrits (abbreviated NI; [tpl]lang-en|Non-Attached Members[/tpl], abbreviated NAthe English name is also official, but the French name is prevalent even in English texts) are Members of the European Parliament (MEP) who do not sit in one of the recognized political groups.
The MEPs may be part of a national party, or a European political party, but for a political grouping in parliament to be formed there need to be 25 MEPs from seven different states. Being part of a group grants access to state funds and committee seats but the group members must be ideologically tied. Groups of convenience, such as the Technical Group of Independents that previously existed, are no longer allowed and the minimum requirements of groups have been raised forcing less numerous elements to sit as NIs.
Political ideologies displayed by the Non-Inscrits range from social liberalism to populism, conservatism, national conservatism and nationalism. As of 2009 however, the Non-Inscrits mostly consists of far-right parties.http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/07/party-griffin-bnp-european
In the 6th European Parliament, 23 right wing NIs briefly formed the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group at the start of 2007, but it collapsed on 14 November 2007 due to internal disagreements.
