[[Road verge]]

A road verge, (also verge, boulevard, city grass, devil's strip, nature strip,  parking strip, planting strip, sidewalk buffer, tree belt, tree lawn, utility strip, parkway,  etc.) is a narrow strip of grass or plants and sometimes also trees located between the carriageway (roadway) curb (or road surface edge or shoulder) and the boundary (right-of-way line) of a road.
The land is often public property with maintenance usually being a municipal responsibility; however some municipal authorities require that abutting property owners maintain these areas and also the footpath / sidewalks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/sidewalk2/sidewalks210.htm|publisher=Federal Highways Administration|title=Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, Part II Section 10.1.3: Maintenance responsibilities|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl]
Benefits include visual aesthetics, increased safety and comfort of sidewalk users, protection from spray from passing vehicles, and a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights and other public amenities. It is also often part of sustainability for water conservation or the management of urban runoff and water pollution[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rainwatercollecting.com/blog/?p=448|title=Passive Rainwater Harvesting|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/PLP%2005.27.09.pdf|title=Parkway Landscaping Policy|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enewsbuilder.net/watercon/e_article000771115.cfm?x=bbrDcbK,b2FRwTrq,w|title=Pruning the Parkway Strip |accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl] and may provide useful wildlife habitat. Snow that has been ploughed off the street in colder climates may be stored in the area.
The main disadvantage of the road verge is that the right-of-way must be wider, increasing the cost of the road. In some localities a wider verge offers opportunity for later road widening, should the traffic usage of a road demand this. For this reason the footpaths are sited a significant distance from the curb.

==Terminology==

This term has many synonyms and dialectal differences, with some dialects and idiolects without a term for this area and instead using a circumlocution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25362-1923881,00.html|title=The triumph of slang|author=John A.

==Sustainable urban and landscape design==

thumb|right|300px|Planted rain garden in the "tree lawn" zoneIn urban and suburban areas, urban runoff from private and civic properties can be guided by grading and bioswales for rainwater harvesting collection and bioretention within the "tree-lawn" - parkway zone in rain gardens. This is done for reducing runoff of rain and domestic water: for their carrying waterborne pollution off-site into storm drains and sewer systems; and for the groundwater recharge of aquifers.http://www.rainwatercollecting.com/blog/?p=448 www.rainwatercollecting . accessed 7/7/2010
In some cities, such as Santa Monica, California, city code mandates for "Parkways, the area between the outside edge of the sidewalk and the inside edge of the
curb which are a component of the Public Right of Way (PROW) - that the landscaping should require little or no irrigation and the area produce no runoff."  For Santa Monica, another reason for this use of "tree-lawns" is to reduce current beach and Santa Monica Bay ocean pollution that is measurably higher at city outfalls. New construction and remodeling projects needing building permits require that landscape design submittals include garden design plans showing the means of compliance.
In some cities and counties, such as Portland, Oregon, street and highway departments are regrading and planting rain gardens in road verges to reduce boulevard and highway runoff. This practice can be useful in areas with either independent Storm sewers or combined storm and sanitary sewers, reducing the frequency of pollution, treatment costs, and released overflows of untreated sewage into rivers and oceans during rainstorms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/BES/index.cfm?c=34598|title=Sustainable Stormwater Management|accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl]

==Rural roadsides==

In some countries, the road verge can be a corridor of vegetation that remains after adjacent land has been cleared.  Considerable effort in supporting conservation of the remnant vegetation is prevalent in Australia - where significant tracts of land are managed as part of the  roadside conservation strategies by government agencies [tpl]Citation | author1=Western Australia.
