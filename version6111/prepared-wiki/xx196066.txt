[[Monbijou Park]]

CATEGORIES: Parks in Berlin, Mitte

Monbijou Park is a park in former East Berlin, at the Southern end of Oranienburger Strasse, between Oranienburg Strasse, and the River Spree. 
Close to the Friedrichstadt Palast, Neue Synagogue and the Sophienkirche.

==Overview==

Once the grounds of Monbijou Palace and the old English Church of St. George, it's now home to an open-air swimming pool for children. It is a much needed, "shady refuge from the unrelentingly urban landscape of the area". A foot bridge connects the park with the Museuminsel (Museum Island), close to the Bode Museum and Pergamon Museum. There is a bust of poet Adelbert von Chamisso.
