Onwentsia Club is an 18-hole golf course. It is located at the Onwentsia Club facility in Lake Forest, Illinois, U.S., and lies in Lake County. 
The course features 6,645 yards of golf from the longest tees for a par of 71. The course has a rating is 71.9 and it has a slope rating of 127 on Chicago (Bent) grass. 
The course was designed by James Foulis and redesigned by Tom Doak. The course opened in 1895. Onwentsia hosted the 1906 U.S. Open won by Alex Smith.
Neil Smith manages the course as the General Manager.
The club has panoramic views of the property at almost all points, and the Doak redesign keeps the integrity of some holes intact. The fescue and multi-tiered putting surfaces compensate for length on this gem.
The name "Onwentsia" may have been inspired by the Illini name for the tuliptree, which grows in well-watered Illinois ecosystems.
