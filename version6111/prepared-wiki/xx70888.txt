The A9 is a major road running from the Falkirk council area in central Scotland to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso in the far north, via Stirling, Bridge of Allan, Perth and Inverness. At 273 miles (439 km), it is the longest road in Scotland and the fifth-longest A-road in the United Kingdom. Historically it was the main road between Edinburgh and John o' Groats, and has been called the spine of Scotland.http://www.swlg.org.uk/WLN63d.htm swif.org.uk
In the south the road's importance has been eclipsed by (1) the A90 across the Forth Road Bridge and the M90 motorway, which now link Edinburgh more directly with Perth, bypassing Stirling and Bridge of Allan as formerly important bridge points, and (2) the M9, which is now the main road between Edinburgh and Bridge of Allan. Between Edinburgh and Falkirk the old A9 route has been reclassified into the A803 and the B9080 amongst others; part of the route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. Between Falkirk and Bridge of Allan, the A9 survives as a more or less parallel road to the M9.
The link between the M9 and the A9, by Bridge of Allan, is the Keir Roundabout.

==Upgrades==

The 138 mile (222 km) section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness, via Perth, was substantially rebuilt during the 1970s, '80s, and early '90s, but it follows essentially the same route except where it bypasses towns and villages instead of running through their centres. Between Perth and Inverness, the road has been dubbed the Killer, because of accidents and fatalities where dual-carriageway sections merge into single-carriageway - the principal cause being motorists driving at excessive speeds to overtake lines of slower-moving vehicles before the dual carriageway ends. Dangerous overtaking manoeuvres on the long single-carriageway stretches of the road are also common causes of accidents, as are the non-grade separated junctions along the northern sections, where drivers make a right turn across the opposing traffic flow.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotlands-most-dangerous-roads.17121570
Since 2007, the Scottish Government has given serious consideration to converting the entire Perth-Inverness section to dual carriageway with more grade separated junctions, at an estimated cost of £600 million.
In late 2008 the Scottish Government's transport plan for the next 20 years was announced. It brings forward planned improvements to the A9 in an attempt to stimulate the economy and protect jobs.
Work costing a total of £8.5 million was undertaken at Moy, Carrbridge and Bankfoot. Northbound overtaking lanes were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy.
In November 2011 the Scottish Government announced that it will upgrade the entire road from Perth to Inverness to dual carriageway. Work on this project is expected to start in 2015 is scheduled to be completed in 2025, at a cost of £3 billion.http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/projects/a9
In July 2013, the Scottish Government announced a plan to install average speed cameras on the A9 between Perth and Inverness. This has been undertaken with an aim to reduce accidents and fatalities on the road, and will be the second permanent average speed camera scheme in Scotland.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23462860

==Route==

The A9 begins at the M9 junction 5 (Cadgers Brae) north of Polmont and continues through Falkirk,  Larbert and Stirling. It then becomes a primary route dual carriageway at the Kier Roundabout and continues to Perth bypassing Dunblane, Blackford and Gleneagles.
At Broxden Junction on the outskirts of Perth, the A9 meets the M90 Motorway, carrying traffic from Fife and the Forth Road Bridge.  Broxden Junction is one of the busiest and most important road junctions in Scotland, with links to all seven Scottish cities.
The section between Perth and Inverness is often cited as being the most dangerous section of the road, and regularly appears in lists of Scotland's most dangerous roads.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotlands-most-dangerous-roads.17121570 This portion of the road is mostly single-carriageway, however improvements have seen sections of dual carriageway constructed, as well as shorter overtaking lanes to reduce frustration and accidents. All the towns on this section of the route have now been bypassed.
In the north, beyond Inverness, the A9 designation has been transferred in response to construction of new bridges across the Moray Firth (the Kessock Bridge), the Cromarty Firth and the Dornoch Firth; and so that the A9 leads not to John o' Groats but to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso, where a government-supported ferry service takes traffic to and from Stromness in Orkney. Therefore various towns and villages which were on the A9 are now seriously distanced from this trunk road.[ref]Towns and villages which were on the A9 but now quite remote from it:
Between Perth and Inverness, the A9 forms part of Euroroute E15.  Inverness is the northern terminus of this route, and it runs south to the southern Spanish town of Algeciras.
