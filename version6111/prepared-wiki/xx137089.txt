Phusion operates as Drink Four Brewing Company.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-08-24/news/0908230370_1_caffeine-energy-drinks-alcoholic|title=Caffeinated alcoholic drinks stir up legal concerns: Four Loko, Four Maxed, Joose target of state attorneys general group|last=Hughlett|first=Mike|date=2009-08-24|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2010-05-29[/tpl] Four Loko, the company's most popular beverage, debuted in the United States market in 2005 and is available in 48 states, and in Canada, Puerto Rico, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Honduras, and Europe. The name "Four" is derived from the original energy drink's four main ingredients: alcohol, caffeine, taurine, and guarana.
Four branded products have been the object of legal, ethical, and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to the underaged and the danger of combining alcohol and caffeine. After the beverage was banned in several states, a product reintroduction in December 2010 removed caffeine, taurine, and guarana as ingredients, and the malt beverage is no longer marketed as an energy drink.[tpl]cite web|title=Four Loko Back on Shelves: Alcoholic Energy Drink No Longer Contains Caffeine|url=http://www.kesq.com/news/26409357/detail.html| first = Philippe | last = Djegal | date = April 24, 2012 | location = Coachella Valley, California | publisher = KESQ-TV | accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl]

==Restrictions on sale==

In 2009, a group of US state attorneys general[tpl]Which|date=July 2011[/tpl] began active investigations of companies which produced and sold caffeinated alcohol beverages, on the grounds that they were being inappropriately marketed to a teenage audience and that they had possible health risks (blackouts).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local-beat/Chicago-Malt-Liquor-Energy-Drinks-54553897.html|title=Chi-based Malt Liquor Energy Drink Maker Investigated|last=Bryant|first=Steve|date=August 24, 2009|work=NBC Chicago|accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl] The attorneys general were also concerned that these drinks could pose health risks by masking feelings of intoxication.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124779531662955515.html|title=Drinks With a Jolt Draw New Scrutiny|last=Kesmodel|first=David|date=July 17, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl] In December 2008, Anheuser-Busch, manufacturer of Tilt and Bud Extra, as well as MillerCoors, manufacturer of Sparks agreed to reformulate their drinks.

The drink came under major fire in 2010, as colleges and universities across the United States began to see injuries and blackouts related to the drink's use. The University of Rhode Island banned this product from their campus on November 5, 2010.[tpl]cite news | url = http://media.www.ramcigar.com/media/storage/paper366/news/2010/11/05/News/Four-Loko.Drink.Banned.In.Student.Handbook-3955037.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition | title = Four Loko drink banned in Student Handbook | newspaper = College Times | first = Hania | last = Zaman | date = November 5, 2010 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110715153249/http://www.ramcigar.com/news/four-loko-drink-banned-in-student-handbook-1.2036816 | archivedate = July 15, 2011[/tpl] The state of Washington banned Four Loko after nine university students aged 17 to 19 from Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington became ill at a house party in Roslyn, Washington.
