"Integument" is a general term in biology that refers most commonly to the natural covering of an organism or an organ, such as its skin, husk, shell, or rind.
It derives from integumentum, which means "a covering" in Latin. In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a cloak or a disguise.[tpl]cite book | author = Marchant, J.R.V. ; Charles Joseph F. | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1952 | isbn =  [/tpl] In English "integument" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of "clad" or "coated", as with a skin or husk.[tpl]cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford Eng. |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]

==Botanical usage==

In botany the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ, but when the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope of one or more layers, each of two or more cell layers, covering the ovule, leaving only a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or seed coat.

==Zoological usage==

The integument of an organ in zoology typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the integumentary system, where "integumentary" is a simile for "cutaneous".
In arthropods, the integument, or external "skin", consists of a single layer of epithelial ectoderm from which arises the cuticle,[tpl]cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument[/tpl] an outer covering of chitin the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

==Derivative terms and sundry usages==

Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, "peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion"Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth & Co. London, 4th ed 1928) and integumented (as opposed to bare).[tpl]cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R.
