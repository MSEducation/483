==Medicinal usage==

===Historical===

Horehound has been mentioned in conjunction with medicinal use dating at least back to the first century BC, where it appeared as a remedy for respiratory ailments in the treatise De Medicina by Roman encyclopaedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/4*.html#9 The Roman agricultural writer Columella lists it as a remedy for expelling worms in farm animals in his important first-century work On Agriculture.https://www.archive.org/stream/onagriculturewit02coluuoft/onagriculturewit02coluuoft_djvu.txt Since then, horehound has appeared for similar purposes in numerous herbals over the centuries, such as The Herball, or, Generall historie of plantes by John Gerard, and Every Man His Own Doctor: or, The Poor Planter’s Physician by Dr. John Tennent.http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/ideas/text7/homemedicalguides.pdf

===Modern===

Several modern scientific studies have been conducted on the usefulness of horehound. For example, a 2011 study concluded that the essential oil of M. vulgare contains potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties,Zeid Zarai, et al. "The in-vitro evaluation of antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of Marrubium vulgare L. essential oil grown in Tunisia", "Lipids in Health and Disease, 2011; 10:161" while a 2012 study found marrubiin, one of the primary active compounds found in horehound, to possess "antidiabetic, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties".[tpl]cite journal |author=N.

==As an invasive weed==

Horehound was introduced to southern Australia in the 19th century as a medicinal herb.  It became a weed of native grasslands and pastures where it was introduced with settlers’ livestock, and was first declared under noxious weeds legislation. It now appears to have reached its full potential distribution.
It occupies disturbed or overgrazed ground, and is favoured by grazing because it is highly unpalatable to livestock. It may persist in native vegetation that has been grazed.

==As biocontrol==

Marrubium vulgare is also used as a natural grasshopper repellent in agriculture.

==In astrology==

According to John Gower in Book 7 of the Confessio Amantis, this plant was the herb of the fourth star of Nectanabus' astrology, Capella. Gower uses the older name, Alhaiot (VII:1338).
