[[Neurophysics]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroscience

Neurophysics (or neural physics) is the branch of biophysics dealing with the nervous system including the brain and the spinal cord and the nerves. The term is a portmanteau of neurology and physics, to represent an emerging science which investigates the fundamentally physical basis for the brain, hence the basis for cognition.
The field covers a wide spectrum of phenomena from molecular and cellular mechanisms to techniques to measure and influence the brain and to theories of brain function. It can be viewed as an approach to neuroscience that is based on solid understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.
