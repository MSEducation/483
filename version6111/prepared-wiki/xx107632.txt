The Firestone Country Club is a private golf club in the United States, located in Akron, Ohio. It is a regular stop on the PGA Tour and has hosted the PGA Championship three times.
The club comprises three courses—those of the North, South, and West—each of which hosted a televised golf event, respectively the American Golf Classic, the CBS Golf Classic and the World Series of Golf, in 1974; no other club has hosted three televised golf events in the same calendar year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.clubcorp.com/Clubs/Firestone-Country-Club/About-the-Club/General-Information/History |title=History – 80 years of renowned golf |accessdate=August 1, 2013[/tpl]

The North and West courses also serve as the home course for the University of Akron Zips golf team.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gozips.com/sports/mgolf/2012-13/2012-13MediaGuide |title=http://www.gozips.com/sports/mgolf/2012-13/2012-13MediaGuide |title=2012–13 Akron Men's Golf Media Guide |accessdate=August 1, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Harvey Firestone commissioned the club in 1929 as a park for employees of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Its first course, the South, was designed by Bert Way. It opened on August 10, 1929 with Firestone driving the first ball. A major redesign by Robert Trent Jones added over 50 bunkers, two ponds and brought the course up to a 7,189 yard par 70. The course was redesigned by Golforce in 1985.
The North course was designed by Robert Trent Jones and opened in 1969. Firestone's West was the last course to be added, opening in 1989. First conceived by Geoffrey Cornish and Brian Silva, it went through a redesign in 2002 by Tom Fazio.
A driving range was added in 1994; it was the first area of the club open to the public. Finally, in 1995, a nine-hole course, the Raymond C. Firestone, was opened for public play.

==Tournaments==

The Rubber City Open was the first tournament to be held at Firestone. It began in 1954 and was held yearly until 1959. The PGA Championship has been held at the South Course three times: 1960, 1966, and 1975. This exposure led to a new event, the American Golf Classic, which ran from 1961 to 1976.
Since 1962, the World Series of Golf, now known as the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, has been held at Firestone, usually on the South course.
During the 1975 PGA Championship's third round of play, Jack Nicklaus pulled out a remarkable par on the 16th hole, considered to be the hardest hole on Firestone's courses. He then went on to close the four-stroke lead held by Bruce Crampton, ultimately winning his 4th PGA Championship. Tiger Woods also had a memorable moment when his "shot in the dark" on the 18th hole grabbed him the victory at the 2000 World Golf Championships-NEC Invitational (NEC was the title sponsor through 2005).
Firestone's North is used less frequently in televised events, but hosted the 1976 American Golf Classic as well as the 1994 World Series of Golf.

===South Course – The Monster===

This course was designed from the start to be championship level. It has been the host of over 70 professional tournaments. After scoring a triple-bogey on the 16th hole during the first PGA Championship held at the course, Arnold Palmer called it a "Monster". The name stayed and struck such a chord with frustrated golfers that the entire South course is now known fondly as "The Monster".

===North Course===

A championship level course, the North is famous for its many lakes and streams. While considered the most scenic course of the three, it has only been host to two tournaments.

===West Course===

The final championship course on the grounds and host to the annual Ohio Senior Open.
