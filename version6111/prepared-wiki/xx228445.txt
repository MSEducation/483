John Gell was created a baronet in 1642 (see Gell baronets).
The Baronetcy was extinct in 1719 and the estate passed to John Eyre who changed his name to Gell.

The north entrance front has three storeys and seven bays, flanked by tower wings with pyramidal roofs.English Heritage; Images of England, architectural description of listed building accessed 13 December 2008
