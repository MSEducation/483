==College career==

===2007 season===

Lee was the third-string quarterback at LSU behind then-senior Matt Flynn and redshirted sophomore Ryan Perrilloux. Considering his age, Lee redshirted the 2007 season.

===2008 season===

For the 2008 season, junior Ryan Perrilloux was projected to be the starting quarterback for LSU, but he was dismissed from the team for breaking team rules.[tpl]cite web |title= Sources: Dismissed LSU QB Perrilloux failed drug test |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3378148 |publisher=espn.com |last=Staff |first=ESPN |accessdate=2012-08-19[/tpl] Andrew Hatch started the first three games as quarterback, but was injured in the third game (Auburn). Beginning with the fourth game (Mississippi State), Lee started eight games as quarterback, compiling a 4-4 record. Three of the losses came against teams that were ranked #1 at some point during the year. Against Troy University, Lee and Jordan Jefferson led the largest comeback in LSU history taking an LSU team that trailed 31 to 3 in the 3rd quarter and scoring 37 unanswered points.[tpl]cite web |title=LSU rallies from 28 down to trip Troy in Baton Rouge |url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283200099 |publisher=espn.com |last=Staff |first=ESPN |accessdate=2012-08-19[/tpl] An ankle injury ended Jarrett's season against Ole Miss, accounting for his fourth loss of the season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=785346 |title=Jarrett Lee biography |publisher=lsusports.net (official site of LSU athletics) |accessdate=October 23, 2009[/tpl] For the season, Lee threw an NCAA leading 7 interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. However, as one of only three freshman quarterbacks who have started more than six games for LSU, Lee put together one of the most prolific seasons for a freshman quarterback in LSU history, throwing for 1,873 yards and 14 touchdowns, second behind true freshman Tommy Hodson for yards and touchdowns.[tpl]cite web |title= LSU Tigers Career Passing Leaders - Since 1970 |url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=320809024&period=0 |publisher=Totalfootballstats.com |last=Staff |first= Totalfootballstats.com |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl]

Despite Lee's commendable performance for most of the season,[tpl]cite web |last=Mandel |first=Stewart |date=November 3, 2011 |title=Tigers' Lee went from backup to SEC's most efficient quarterback| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/stewart_mandel/11/03/lsu-jarrett-lee/index.html| publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] Lee was pulled for his poor performance in the November game against Alabama. Lee finished the game 3 of 7 (43%) for 24 yards with 2 interceptions and a passer rating of 14.5. Lee was 2 of 2 for 19 yards when Jefferson was briefly substituted for Lee to pick up a third and one on the fifth play of the game. Following a Lee interception which led to a blocked Alabama field goal attempt, Jefferson came in for Lee again, played the rest of the first half, and started the second half.  Lee was given another chance in the second half but immediately threw his second interception of the game which led to an Alabama field goal[tpl]cite web |title= LSU kicks winning field goal in OT for defensive-minded win over Alabama |url= http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=313090333 |publisher=espn.com |last= Associated Press |first= |accessdate=2012-05-09[/tpl]

Although Jefferson had a perfect passing game against Ole Miss, the second most passing yards of the season in the game against Arkansas, and LSU gained its most yardage and yards per play in the three games that Jefferson started as QB, the decision to give the starting role back to Jordan Jefferson was not without some controversy,[tpl]cite web |last=Landry |first=Rob |date=November 13, 2011 |title=Body Shots: Miles' QB decision puzzling, potentially costly|url=http://www.lsureveille.com/sports/body-shots-miles-qb-decision-puzzling-potentially-costly-1.2670045?MMode=true#.TtxR77KVrUA |publisher=lsureville.com |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] and was questioned by some media and fans throughout the rest of the season.[tpl]cite web |last=Guilbeau |first=Glenn |date=December 11, 2011 |title=Les Miles' treatment of Jarrett Lee a sore spot for some LSU fans|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20111211/SPORTS0202/111211001/Les-Miles-treatment-Jarrett-Lee-sore-spot-some-LSU-fans|publisher=shreveporttimes.com |accessdate=2011-12-11[/tpl] This criticism reached a peak after the loss to Alabama in the National Championship game, where Lee did not enter the game despite a poor performance by Jefferson.[tpl]cite web |last=Handwerger |first=Bradley |date=January 10, 2012|title=Handwerger: Sticking with Jefferson dooms LSU in title game |url=http://www.wwltv.com/sports/Handwerger-sticking-with-Jefferson-dooms-LSU-in-title-game-BCS-136994558.html|publisher=wwltv.com |accessdate=2012-01-10[/tpl] LSU finished the game as the only team in BCS championship history to not score a point. This caused heated exchanges from some fans and media, with the sharpest public criticism coming from Bobby Hebert in a post-game outburst where he demanded to know why Miles did not put Lee into the game. Most people believe that Bobby Hebert’s embarrassing tantrum was motivated by the fact that Bobby Hebert’s son, T-Bob, did not play in the game.[tpl]cite web |last=Hinton|first=Matt |date=January 10, 2012|title=Video: Bobby Hebert wants to know why Les Miles didn’t pull Jordan Jefferson, too|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/video-bobby-hebert-wants-know-why-les-miles-121110828.html|publisher=yahoo.com |accessdate=2012-01-10[/tpl] Many fans believe that Lee would not have made a difference in the outcome of the game because Lee had a poor history against Alabama. In his four games against Alabama, Lee had completed less than 42% of his passes with 7 interceptions, only 1 TD, and a passer rating of 68.7. 
Lee finished the 2011 season with a passer rating of 152.0. He did not qualify to be the highest rated SEC QB, and there were several other non-qualifying SEC QBs with a higher passer rating. Lee was selected by ESPN as the All-SEC senior team quarterback.[tpl]cite web |last=Low|first=Chris |date=December 26, 2011|title=2011 All-SEC senior team|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/35708/2011-all-sec-senior-team|publisher=espn.com |accessdate=2012-05-06[/tpl]
A week after the BCS title game, Lee was invited to play in The Casino Del Sol All Star Game in Tucson. In the game, Lee finished 13 of 18 for 176 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Lee played his second All-Star game in less than 1 week in The NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. In that game, Lee completed 2 of 6 passes for 36 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Thomas.
