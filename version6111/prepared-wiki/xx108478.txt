Moira Shearer, Lady Kennedy (17 January 1926 â€“ 31 January 2006), was an internationally renowned British ballet dancer and actress.

==Early life==

She was born Moira Shearer King in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, the daughter of Harold Charles King. In 1931 her family moved to Ndola, Northern Rhodesia, where her father worked as a civil engineer and where she received her first dancing training under a former pupil of Enrico Cecchetti.[tpl]cite journal|title = Moira Shearer|publisher = Dancers of To-day|issue=2|last = Fisher|first = Hugh|year = 1952[/tpl] She returned to Britain in 1936 and trained with Flora Fairbairn in London for a few months before she was accepted as a pupil by the Russian teacher Nicholas Legat. After three years with Legat, she joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. After the outbreak of the World War II, her parents took her to live in Scotland.  She made her debut with Mona Inglesby's International Ballet[tpl]cite news | publisher = The Independent | date = 13 October 2006 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mona-inglesby-419831.html | accessdate =22 April 2010 | location=London | title=Mona Inglesby[/tpl] in 1941 before moving on to Sadler's Wells in 1942.

==Film career==

Her first "claim to fame" is as Posy Fossil in the advertisements for the Noel Streatfeild book  Ballet Shoes while she was training under Flora Fairbairn, a good friend of Streatfeild's.
She came to international attention for her first film role as Victoria Page in the Powell & Pressburger ballet-themed film The Red Shoes, (1948). Even her hair matched the titular footwear, and the role and film were so powerful that although she went on to star in other films and worked as a dancer for many decades, she is primarily known for playing "Vicky".
Shearer retired from ballet in 1953, but she continued to act, appearing as Titania in A Midsummer Night's Dream at the 1954 Edinburgh Festival. She worked again for Powell on The Tales of Hoffmann and on the controversial film Peeping Tom (1960), which damaged Powell's own career.
In 1972, she was chosen by the BBC to present the Eurovision Song Contest when it was staged at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. According to author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor's The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History, Shearer accepted the role of hostess because her children wanted something to tease her with in the future.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. ISBN 978-1-84442-994-3. She also wrote for The Daily Telegraph newspaper and gave talks on ballet worldwide.
The choreographer Gillian Lynne persuaded her to return to ballet in 1987 to play L. S. Lowry's mother in A Simple Man for the BBC.
Along with her continued work in film, in the mid-1960s, Shearer danced (and sang) the role of Morgan le Fay in the original London production of Camelot, directed and choreographed by her Red Shoes co-star, Sir Robert Helpmann.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
