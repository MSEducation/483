The Victory Destroyer Plant was a United States Naval Shipbuilding yard operational from 1918 to 1920 in Quincy, Massachusetts. It was then reused as a civil airport, and later Naval Air Station Squantum. It was owned by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, and was constructed in order to relieve destroyer construction at the nearby Fore River Shipyard.[tpl]cite web|title=Destroyer History Foundation|url=http://destroyerhistory.org/destroyers/bethsq/|publisher=Destroyer History Foundation|accessdate=9 June 2013|year=2013[/tpl]
