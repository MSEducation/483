The male is 4Â mm long. Its cephalothorax is brown, but darker around the eyes. The abdomen was damaged, but is thought to be grey-brown with yellow sides. Traces of a brown median band were visible. The legs are grey-orange with brown spines; the first pair is orange-brown and lighter inside. The male pedipalp is similar to that of Phlegra.

The genus name is derived from the original word for Hungary, Magyar. Zabka named another salticid genus in 1985 Lechia, after his home country Poland. Both species occur in Vietnam.
