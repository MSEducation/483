[[Car glass]]

CATEGORIES: Car windows

Car glass includes windscreens, side and rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows can be either fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered as an extension of the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.
Today most cars use laminated glass as it does not shatter in sharp pieces and so does not harm the driver and passengers.
