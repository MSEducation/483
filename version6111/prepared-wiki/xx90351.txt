[[Surrendered wife]]

CATEGORIES: Self-help books

The Surrendered Wives movement is inspired by a book, The Surrendered Wife by Laura Doyle. Its supporters suggest that women should relinquish what Doyle deems to be inappropriate control of their husbands and focus on their own happiness in order to bring romance back to their relationship.

==Philosophy==

The author of the core book of this movement maintains that she does not advocate submissiveness or the surrendering of one's self; she proposes the surrendering of control over others. Indeed, in Things Will Get as Good as You Can Stand (subtitled When you learn that it is better to receive than to giveâ€“ The Superwoman's Practical Guide to Getting as Much as She Gives),[tpl]cite book| last=Doyle|first=Laura| title=Things Will Get as Good as You Can Stand |year=2006 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0743258623 |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/things-will-get-as-good-as-you-can-stand-laura-doyle/1100301811?ean=9780743245159| edition=2| month=Feb[/tpl] Doyle says women turn away praise, validation, and even help to appear to be in control.
The author herself writes:

The "Surrendered Wives" movement is centered around six basic principles:
Continuing in an abusive, alcoholic, or adulterous relationship is not promoted or condoned.
Having female support is cited by Laura Doyle as a critical component for success for the woman who chooses to surrender. To this end there are a number of trained coaches around the globe who assist women to implement the principles into their lives and marriages. Face to Face group seminars, phone coaching, on-line chat circles and an on-line seminar are available.

==Criticism and praise==

Her critics see Doyle as advocating that women should be submissive to their husbands,[tpl]cite web| last=Craig|first=Amanda |title=How i became a surrendered wife| url=http://www.amandacraig.com/pages/journalism_01/journalism_01_item.asp?journalism_01ID=26| work=Features| publisher=Sunday Times |location=London |date=2004-09-01[/tpl] even referring to 'Stepford wives'. Former Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward compared the movement to slavery saying "There is no such thing as an adult who can entirely subvert themselves to another person. That's called slavery and I think we abolished that several hundred years ago." She also claimed that "If a man wants that sort of relationship, he actually doesn't want a relationship, he wants a doll. He wants a puppet, he wants total control and that's not the definition of a relationship."[tpl]cite news |last=Harvey|first=Peter| title=Under the thumb| url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/peter-harvey/270407/under-the-thumb| accessdate=27 August 2013| newspaper=60 Minutes| date=2007-06-03| author2=Greenaway, Nick|location=Australia[/tpl]
Doyle responds that many critics appear to have little knowledge of the principles described in the book and simply react to what they imagine the book says.

==Sequel==

The Surrendered Single is a book to help single women attract a good man according to the principles of Surrendering. Doyle advocates the surrender of inappropriate control of another. A surrendered single is a woman who chooses to apply the principles of surrendering to her life so as to serenely attract a good man rather than desperately seek a mate.
Doyle says that the basic principles of a Surrendered Single are that she:
