==Detention==

María Lourdes Afiuni was incarcerated on 17 December 2009 at the National Institute of Feminine Orientation (INOF), a women's prison on the outskirts of Caracas; her cell is close to convicts whom she sentenced to jail, and she reports she has been threatened.  Responding to concerns that Lourdes Afiuni's life was in danger, Venezuelan authorities reported on 29 December that she was being held separately from the general prison population.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url= http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/114686/Nacional/Fiscal%C3%ADa-sostiene-que-condiciones-de-reclusi%C3%B3n-de-jueza-Afiuni-son-las-adecuadas |title= Fiscalía sostiene que condiciones de reclusión de jueza Afiuni 'son las adecuadas' |date= 28 December 2009 |work= El Nacional |accessdate= 21 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |work=Wall Street Journal |date= 29 December 2009 |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091229-703067.html |title= Venezuela Says Prison Conditions 'Adequate' For Jailed Judge |work=Wall Street Journal |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url= http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/115559/Nacional/ONG-exige-traslado-de-la-jueza-Afiuni-a-otro-sitio-de-reclusi%C3%B3n |title= ONG exige traslado de la jueza Afiuni a otro sitio de reclusión |date =5 January 2010 |work= El Nacional |accessdate= 29 January 2010[/tpl]

==Reaction==

President Hugo Chávez called the judge a "bandit", applauded her arrest, and said she should be put away in prison for 30 years.[tpl]cite news |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091217-713532.html |title= Venezuela's Chavez Criticized Over Hasty Arrest Of Judge |work= Wall Street Journal | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Chavez stated, "A judge who frees a criminal is much, much, much more serious than the criminal himself. This judge should get the maximum penalty... 30 years in prison. That judge has to pay for what she has done." He also suggested that she had been bribed, and that Simon Bolivar would have had her shot.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/15/chavez-venezuela-judge-cedeno |publisher= guardian.co.uk |title= Hugo Chávez demands jailing of judge who freed banker: Venezuelan president calls for María Afiuni to 'pay' for release of Eligio Cedeño, who was facing corruption charges |author= Carroll, Rory |date= 15 December 2009 | accessdate= 14 April 2010 | location=London[/tpl]  The Caracas Bar Association asserts that the judge's decision to free Cedeño was legal, while the government says it was improper to release him without prosecutors present at the hearing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9CO0VAO2.htm |title= Venezuelan banker halted in Miami, seeks asylum |work=Business Week[/tpl]
Several international groups have expressed concern about the arrest of Judge Afiuni. In December 2009, three independent human rights experts of the United Nations' (UN) Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called for Judge Afiuni's immediate and unconditional release;[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-venezuela17-2009dec17,0,7129748.story  |title= U.N. criticizes Venezuela's President Chavez for judge's arrest |work=LA Times |accessdate= 14 April 2010 | date=17 December 2009[/tpl] they said, "Reprisals for exercising their constitutionally guaranteed functions and creating a climate of fear among the judiciary and lawyers' profession serve no purpose except to undermine the rule of law and obstruct justice". In January 2010, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a protective measure in favor of Maria Lourdes Afiuni.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url= http://noticiaaldia.com/2010/01/tsj-suspende-sin-goce-de-sueldo-a-afiuni/ |title= TSJ suspende sin goce de sueldo a Afiuni |date= 15 January 2010 |publisher= Noticia al Dia |accessdate= 29 January 2010[/tpl] Other groups speaking out against the government's arrest of Judge Afiuni include the Episcopal Conference of Venezuela,[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url= http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/119125/Nacional/Conferencia-Episcopal-llama-al-di%C3%A1logo-y-deplora-agresiones |title= Conferencia Episcopal llama al diálogo y deplora agresiones |date= 25 January 2010 |work =El Nacional |accessdate= 29 January 2010[/tpl] Human Rights Watch, the U.S. Department of State,[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1247767 |title= EE.UU. advierte a Chávez que respete los DD.HH. y la libertad de expresión |date= 26 March 2010 |work= La Nacion |accessdate= 14 April 2010[/tpl] and the Law Society of England and Wales.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/vietnamese-lawyer-escapes-death-sentence |title= Vietnamese lawyer escapes death sentence |date= 28 January 2010 |publisher= Law Society of England and Wales |accessdate= 30 January 2010[/tpl] A director of Human Rights Watch said, "Once again the Chávez government has demonstrated its fundamental disregard for the principle of judicial independence."The Human Rights Foundation has circulated a petition calling for Afiuni’s immediate release. “Afuini’s is an open and shut case that exposes the despotic nature of the Chávez regime like few others,” said HRF president Thor Halvorssen. “Judge Afiuni has withstood years of vitriol by a subservient supreme court and scores of judges that fear something similar will happen to them if they dare to let her go.”[tpl]cite web|last=Pizano|first=Pedro|title=Venezuela: HRF calls on Venezuelan authorities to release Judge María Lourdes Afiuni, publishes legal report on her case|url=http://humanrightsfoundation.org/Venezuela-HRF-calls-for-Afiuni-release-publishes-legal-report-17-01-2013.php|work=Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl]  
On 8 July 2010, the European Parliament stated that it "Condemns the public statements made by the President of the Republic of Venezuela, insulting and denigrating the judge, demanding a maximum sentence and requesting a modification of the law to enable a more severe penalty to be imposed; considers that these statements are aggravating the circumstances of her detention and constitute an attack on the independence of the judiciary by the President of a nation, who should be its first guarantor."European Parliament resolution of 8 July 2010 on Venezuela, in particular the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2010-0289+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN
In July 2011, Noam Chomsky—who according to The Observer "Chávez has long considered ... one of his best friends in the west"—published an open letter asking the government of Venezuela for "a humanitarian act that ends the judge's detention".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/03/noam-chomsky-hugo-chavez-democracy |title= Noam Chomsky criticises old friend Hugo Chávez for 'assault' on democracy|author= Carroll, Rory |date= 3 July 2011 |work= The Observer |accessdate= 3 July 2010 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]es icon[/tpl]  [tpl]cite news |url= http://www.globovision.com/news.php?nid=194535 |title= Chomsky confía en que Chávez libere a Afiuni tras pedírselo en carta pública |author= Globovision/EFE |date= 7 July 2011 |work= Globovision |accessdate= 7 July 2010[/tpl] Chomsky stated, "I am convinced that she must be set free, not only due to her physical and psychological health conditions, but in conformance with the human dignity the Bolivarian revolution presents as a goal. In times of worldwide cries for freedom, the detention of María Lourdes Afiuni stands out as a glaring exception that should be remedied quickly, for the sake of justice and human rights generally and for affirming an honourable role for Venezuela in these struggles."

==Release==

Afiuni was released on June 14, 2013 but remained on trial.
