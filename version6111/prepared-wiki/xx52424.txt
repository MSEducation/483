==History==

Hobby Airport opened in 1927 as a private landing field in a [tpl]convert|600|acre|adj=on[/tpl] pasture known as W.T. Carter Field. The airfield was served by Braniff and Eastern Airlines. The site was acquired by the city of Houston and was named Houston Municipal Airport in 1937."History of Hobby Airport," Houston Airport System The airport was renamed Howard R. Hughes Airport in 1938. Howard Hughes was responsible for several improvements to the airport, including its first control tower, built in 1938.
The airport's name changed back to Houston Municipal because Hughes was still alive at the time and regulations did not allow federal improvement funds for an airport named after a living person.
The city of Houston opened and dedicated a new air terminal and hangar in 1940.
In 1950 Pan Am started a DC-4 nonstop to Mexico City. In 1954 an expanded terminal building opened to support the 53,640 airline flights that carried 910,047 passengers.1940 Air Terminal Museum – Houston Aviation History Timeline The airport was renamed Houston International Airport the same year.
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 26 weekday departures on Eastern, 20 Braniff (plus four departures a week to/from South America), nine Continental, nine Delta, nine Trans-Texas, four National, two Pan American and one American. There were nonstops to New York and Washington, but not to Chicago or Denver or anywhere west of there. Later in 1957 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started Douglas DC-7C flights to Amsterdam via Montreal.  KLM then introduced Douglas DC-8 jets from Hobby before moving to Houston Intercontinental Airport (now George Bush Intercontinental Airport), where they remain today with Boeing 747-400s nonstop to Amsterdam.timetableimages.com, KLM timetables
In 1967 the airport was renamed after former Texas governor William P. Hobby.
George Bush Intercontinental Airport opened in 1969 because of expansion limitations at Hobby, and all airlines at Hobby moved there. The Civil Aeronautics Administration recommended years earlier that Houston plan to replace Hobby."WILLIAM P. HOBBY AIRPORT." The Handbook of Texas
