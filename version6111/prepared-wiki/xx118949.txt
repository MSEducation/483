Eddie Einhorn (born on January 3, 1936 in Paterson, New Jersey) is minority owner and Vice Chairman of the Chicago White Sox. 
Einhorn produced the nationally syndicated radio broadcast of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in 1958. In 1960, he founded the TVS Television Network to telecast college basketball games to regional networks at a time that the sport was of no interest to the national networks. The first broadcast was Bradley University vs. St. Bonaventure University from Madison Square Garden. Einhorn helped put together the first national broadcast of college basketball for the Game of the Century between the Houston Cougars and UCLA Bruins in 1968. He later sold his interest in the network and became the head of CBS Sports.   
He was formerly the owner of the IWA wrestling promotion in United States in 1975.  The promotion was originally intended to be the first one to run cards nationally and promoted mainly in the midwest and even ran cards in the Carolinas. 
Einhorn grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and has resided in Alpine, New Jersey.[tpl]cite news|last=Cahillane|first=Kevin|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6D61430F936A1575AC0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=WORTH NOTING; White Sox Fans?
