==Early life and academia==

Born in Colchester, Essex, England, Roger Penrose is a son of Lionel Penrose and Margaret Leathes,Penrose and his father shared mathematical concepts with Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher which were incorporated into a lot of pieces, including Waterfall, which is based on the 'Penrose triangle', and Up and Down and the grandson of the physiologist John Beresford Leathes. His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose. Penrose is the brother of mathematician Oliver Penrose and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose. Penrose attended University College School and University College, London, where he graduated with a first class degree in mathematics. In 1955, while still a student, Penrose reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore–Penrose inverse,Penrose, R. "A Generalized Inverse for Matrices" Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 51, 406–413, 1955 after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar (1951). Penrose earned his PhD at Cambridge (St John's College) in 1958, writing a thesis on "tensor methods in algebraic geometry" under algebraist and geometer John A. Todd. He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form" and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose. As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:
In 1965, at Cambridge, Penrose proved that singularities (such as black holes) could be formed from the gravitational collapse of immense, dying stars.Ferguson, 1991: 66 This work was extended by Hawking to prove the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems.
In 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2). In 1969, he conjectured the cosmic censorship hypothesis. This proposes (rather informally) that the universe protects us from the inherent unpredictability of singularities (such as the one in the centre of a black hole) by hiding them from our view behind an event horizon. This form is now known as the "weak censorship hypothesis"; in 1979, Penrose formulated a stronger version called the "strong censorship hypothesis". Together with the BKL conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979 dates Penrose's influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the Universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.[tpl]cite conference | author = R.

Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. Penrose developed these ideas based on the article Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistiqueJaromír Korčák (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité d'organisation, Bull. de l'Institute Int'l de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299. (1938; an English translation Two Basic Types of Statistical Distribution) by Czech geographer, demographer and statistician Jaromír Korčák. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.25.14267 |first=Paul |last=Steinhardt |title=New perspectives on forbidden symmetries, quasicrystals, and Penrose tilings |journal=PNAS |volume=93 |issue= 25|pages=14267–14270 |year=1996 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/25/14267.full |pmid=8962037 |pmc=34472 |postscript= |bibcode = 1996PNAS...9314267S [/tpl] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity. He was influential in popularising what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).
In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Grodon. Roger Penrose worked at Rice University form 1983 to 1987.http://ricehistorycorner.com/2013/05/22/roger-penrose-at-rice-1983-87/

==Later Activity==

In 2004 Penrose released The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, a 1,099-page book aimed at giving a comprehensive guide to the laws of physics. He has proposed a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.[tpl]cite web  | title =If an Electron Can Be in Two Places at once, Why Can't You?  | url =http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/cover/article_view?b_start:int=0&-C= | accessdate = 27 October 2008[/tpl]

==An earlier universe==

In 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in WMAP data of the CMB sky, of an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe.[tpl]cite arXiv |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.G. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Concentric circles in WMAP data may provide evidence of violent pre-Big-Bang activity |year=2010 |volume=v1 |eprint=1011.3706 |class=astro-ph.CO[/tpl] He mentions this evidence in the epilog of his 2010 book Cycles of Time,Roger Penrose, Cycles of Time, Vintage; Reprint edition (1 May 2012) a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis, that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and the smoothness is real. In simple terms, he believes that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. This was a daring step, relying on certain conjectures being proved, but these have subsequently been proved. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which messes up time.

==Physics and consciousness==

Penrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In The Emperor's New Mind (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls correct quantum gravity). Penrose uses a variant of Turing's halting theorem to demonstrate that a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic. (E.g., imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON if a given Turing machine halts, and OFF if the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the Turing machine, however there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)
Penrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence because it is an algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because things such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.
The Penrose/Lucas argument about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.[ref]
Criticism of the Lucas/Penrose argument that intelligence can not be entirely algorithmic:
Sources that indicate Penrose's argument is generally rejected:
Sources that also note that different sources attack different points of the argument:
Penrose responded to criticism of The Emperor's New Mind with his follow up 1994 book Shadows of the Mind, and in 1997 with The Large, the Small and the Human Mind. In those works, he also combined his observations with that of anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff.
Penrose and Hameroff have argued that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in Physical Review E,Tegmark, Max. 2000. "The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes". Physical Review E. vol 61. pp. 4194–4206. calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: "Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John A. Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'". Tegmark's paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose–Hameroff position.
In their reply to Tegmark's paper, also published in Physical Review E, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszynski and Hameroff[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.65.061901 |author=Hagan, S., Hameroff, S., and Tuszyński, J. |title=Quantum Computation in Brain Microtubules? Decoherence and Biological Feasibility |journal=Physical Review E |volume=65 |page=061901 |arxiv=quant-ph/0005025 |year=2002|bibcode = 2002PhRvE..65f1901H [/tpl][tpl]Cite book |author=Hameroff, S. |contribution=Consciousness, Neurobiology and Quantum Mechanics |editor-last=Tuszynski |editor-first=Jack |title=The Emerging Physics of Consciousness |publisher=Springer |pages=193–253 |year=2006 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25 ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40 Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals. It was supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and gel states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits. Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy. thumb|Roger Penrose in the University of Santiago de Compostela to receive the Fonseca Prize.
Finally, it is suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction. In the last decade, some researchers who are sympathetic to Penrose's ideas have proposed an alternative scheme for quantum processing in microtubules based on the interaction of tubulin tails with microtubule-associated proteins, motor proteins and presynaptic scaffold proteins. These proposed alternative processes have the advantage of taking place within Tegmark's time to decoherence.
Hameroff, in a lecture in part of a Google Tech talks series exploring quantum biology, gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFFbxoHp3s |title=Clarifying the Tubulin bit/qubit – Defending the Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR Model (Quantum Biology) |publisher=YouTube |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012[/tpl] In addition to this, a recent 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.[tpl]cite web|author=Journal of Cosmology.com |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/Cosmology160.html |title=Journal of Cosmology |publisher=Quantumconsciousness.org |date=4 July 1992 |accessdate=13 August 2012[/tpl]
Phillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist Charles Seife's description of Penrose as "one of a handful of scientists" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.
In January 2014 Hameroff and Penrose announced that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anirban_Bandyopadhyay |title=Anirban Bandyopadhyay on ResearchGate |accessdate=2014-02-22[/tpl] confirms the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm |title=Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2014-02-22[/tpl]  A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of Physics of Life Reviews.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hameroff|first=Stuart|coauthors=Roger Penrose|title=Consciousness in the universe: A review of the ‘Orch OR’ theory|journal=Physics of Life Reviews|date=2014|volume=11|issue=1|pages=39-78|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513001188|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]

===Religious views===

Penrose does not hold to any religious doctrine,[ref]
 Quoting Penrose's blurb for Harris's book Letter to a Christian Nation.[/ref] and refers to himself as an atheist. In the film A Brief History of Time, he said, "I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along – it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it."See A Brief History of Time, quote starts at about 1:08:10 in the video. Penrose is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.
