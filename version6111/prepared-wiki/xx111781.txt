[[Mundolinco]]

CATEGORIES: International auxiliary languages, Esperantido

Mundolinco is a constructed language created by the Dutch author J. Braakman in 1888. It is notable for apparently being the first Esperantido, i.e. the first Esperanto derivative.
Major changes from Esperanto include combining the adjective and adverb with the grammatical ending -e (where Esperanto uses -a for adjectives and -e for adverbs), changes to the verb conjugations, an increase in the number of Latin roots, and new affixes such as the superlative suffix -osim- where Esperanto uses the particle plej. It seems there was no accusative or adjectival agreement. 
Numerals 1â€“10: un, du, tres, cvarto, cvinto, siso, septo, octo, nono, desem.
There are no diacritics in the alphabet.
