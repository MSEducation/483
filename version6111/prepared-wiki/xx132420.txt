==History==

Originally, the station was locally owned by Harry Hoth's Pikes Peak Broadcasting Company under the call letters KRDO-FM.  The station signed on in the late 1960s broadcasting an easy listening/beautiful music format.  
In 1994 KRDO-FM dropped the format due to its decline nationwide and flipped it to adult contemporary and adopted the moniker "Peak 95.1."  In 1998 Peak 95.1 evolved into a Hot AC format.  
After being purchased by Citadel Broadcasting, Cat Country 95.1 officially began broadcasting on July 1, 2006, stunting by repeatedly playing Brooks & Dunn's "Play Something Country" while temporarily using the its former KRDO-FM call letters. After several days of stunting, the station began its regular mainstream country programming, featuring a complete air staff.  The calls were also changed to KATC-FM. Citadel would revive the Peak moniker in late 2006 on sister station 92.9 FM with the new call letters KKPK. The KRDO-FM calls were quickly picked up by station that was formally operated by Pikes Peak Broadcasting and now is operated by News-Press & Gazette Company/Pikes Peak Radio, LLC.
Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html|accessdate=September 16, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Business Journal|date=September 16, 2011[/tpl]
