==Early years==

Wei was the oldest of four children, brought up by Chinese Communist Party cadres. In 1966,  Wei joined the Red Guards as a 16 year-old student during the Cultural Revolution.魏京生. Retrieved on 12 December 2010. He lived in remote rural areas in Northern China and was able to speak with  peasant farmers about the widespread famines that had occurred a few years before, during the Great Leap Forward.Wei, The Courage to.., p. 276; and Autobiography, same source. He uncovered the role that the communist government under Mao Zedong played in causing the famines, and it forced Wei to start questioning the nature of the system he lived under. Wei would later write about this period: "I felt as if I had suddenly awakened from a long dream, but everyone around me was still plunged in darkness.""Wei Jingsheng Autobiography", The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings, p. 246. In 1973, he began working as an electrician at the Beijing Zoo.

==Democracy Wall==

Wei did not publicly voice his feelings until 1978, when he decided to take part in the newly emerged Democracy Wall movement taking place in Beijing. On 5 December 1978, he posted an essay he authored to the wall, entitled, the Fifth Modernization as a response to Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's essay, the Four Modernizations. Wei's basic theme in the essay is that democracy should be also be a modernization goal for China along with the other four proposed by Deng (the four being: industry, agriculture, science and technology, and national defense).Schell, Orville.

Wei signed the essay with his real name and address. The essay immediately caused a stir because of its boldness and because it was not anonymous. It was also the only essay to address Deng Xiaoping by name, and refer to him as a dictator.   

==Arrest and imprisonment==

Wei was also known for his editorial work in the short-lived magazine Exploration (探索) in 1979. He had also published a letter under his name in March 1979 denouncing the inhuman conditions of the Chinese Qincheng Prison, where the 10th Panchen Lama was imprisoned.Excerpts from Qincheng: A Twentieth Century Bastille, published in Exploration, March 1979
"On March 25, hearing through the grapevine that a crackdown was imminent, Wei and his colleagues rushed out a special edition of Explorations entitled 'Do We Want Democracy or a New Dictatorship?'"Schell. Discos and Democracy, p. 278. "Wei and some thirty other Democracy Wall activists were rounded up after. That October, Wei Jingsheng was brought to trial and accused of 'supplying military intelligence China's war with Vietnam to a foreigner and of openly agitating for the overthrow of the government of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system in China.'"[tpl]cite book|author=Orville Schell|title=Discos and Democracy: China in the Throes of Reform|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zoijP-xuLWkC&pg=PT279|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=22 May 1989|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-26187-6|page=279[/tpl]Yang, Benjamin. 1998 (1998).
