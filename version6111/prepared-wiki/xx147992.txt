[[Panna caste]]

CATEGORIES: Sinhalese castes

Panna caste is a derogatory term used for the once esteemed bodhi vamsa caste. During the colonial period it is erroneously termed as a grass cutting caste. However, non of the historical sources indicate that there came a caste for cutting grass with sri maha bodhi.

==Etymology of the word panna==

The term "panna" may have derived by its association with temples (pannasala) or scripts (panna in pali language). Earlier they were known as "aramikas" who managed temple property. this is once an esteemed profession as it is indicated in mahawamsa, king aggabodhi I donated hundred of his relatives as aramikas. 

==history==

The caste traces its origin to arrival of sri maha bodhi. Deepavamsa, the first document of history in sri lanka, mentions following persons as came with or associated with sri mahabodhi.
When referring to mahavamsa, it is stated during the time of king parakramabahu I, three lambakarnas were sent to south india for a coronation festival. Hence it is obvious that the gotra lambakarnas were modern day bodhi vamsa caste. most of the writers forget about deepavamsa and try to associate bodhi vamsa caste with the many castes barring the brahamin, kshatriya, and vaishya castes mentioned in the much later written sinhala bodhivamsa to promote govi supremacy myth. During the colonial era (1597-1948)  the status of this caste gradually declined as south indian originated radala caste and govi caste rose to prominence.
