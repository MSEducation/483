===Sponsors===

Beginning in 2002, the game became known as the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl. In 2003, Bridgestone became the presenting sponsor of the game, and its full title became the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl presented by Bridgestone. Both sponsors are based in Nashville. Previous sponsors of the bowl game included American General Life & Accident (now a subsidiary of AIG) in the inaugural 1998 game, and the now-defunct "homepoint.com" in the 1999 game. There was no sponsor in 2000 and 2001. Bridgestone dropped its presenting sponsorship following the 2007 game. Beginning with the 2010 game, Franklin American Mortgage served as title sponsor, though Gaylord still served as a major sponsor of the event.http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/128897 The new name is the Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl.

===Conferences===

The game initially featured a matchup between representatives of the Southeastern Conference and the Big East Conference. The Big East was replaced by the Big Ten Conference in 2002. Beginning with the 2006 game the Big Ten Conference was replaced by the Atlantic Coast Conference. The ACC also took part in the 2005 game, when Virginia appeared because the SEC did not have enough bowl-eligible teams.
