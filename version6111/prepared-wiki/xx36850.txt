I'm the Man is the name of the second EP by the band Anthrax.  The album was released in 1987 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island Records.  The band, Eddie Kramer and Paul Hammingson produced the album, which includes the single "I'm the Man". I'm the Man was certified platinum by the RIAA and its title song is considered among the first rap metal songs.  
It is a comedy/novelty song which parodies the style of the Beastie Boys, as well as the main guitar riff being based on the melody of the Jewish folk song "Hava Nagila" (guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Spitz—as well as all the members of the Beastie Boys—are Jewish). On live performances, Joey Belladonna and Charlie Benante would switch places, Benante performing some of the raps and Belladonna drumming. A 7" single also appeared, containing only tracks 2 and 3. As of 2006, I'm the Man had sold over 178,000 copies in the U.S since the beginning of the SoundScan era.http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/anthrax/222300-latest-sales-number-anthrax.html

==I'm the Man samples==

The beginning of "I'm the Man" features an electric guitar sample of Jewish folk song "Hava Nagila", which can also be heard in the chorus. The chorus' lyrics are borrowed from one of Taylor Negron's lines in the Rodney Dangerfield movie "Easy Money." Rather than using a sample, the lines are performed by Frankie Bello. Anthrax even used one of Sam Kinison's famous primal screams for the song.
In "I'm the Man", at about 1:55 - 1:56 (depending on the version) a sample of the Metallica song "Master of Puppets" from their 1986 album Master of Puppets can be heard. A few times after "I'm The Man" is said, you can hear "Shut Up" from Run–D.M.C.'s "You Talk Too Much" off their 1985 album King of Rock. Quite a few times throughout "I'm the Man" the "Yeah" that begins the song "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" by the Beastie Boys on their 1986 debut, Licensed to Ill is sampled.
