CATEGORIES: Geography of Galway (city)

Claddagh ([tpl]Irish place name|an Cladach|the shore[/tpl]) is an area close to the centre of Galway city, where the Corrib River meets Galway Bay. It was formerly a fishing village, just outside the old city walls. It is just across the river from the Spanish Arch, which was the location of regular fish markets where the locals supplied the city with seafood as recently as the end of the 19th century. People have been gathering seafood and fishing from the area for millennia. It is one of the oldest former fishing villages in Ireland - its existence having been recorded since the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
