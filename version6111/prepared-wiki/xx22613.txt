CATEGORIES: Law in the United Kingdom, Statutory law

The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandSection 2 of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 (17 Geo.

Each of the three major jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland  and Northern Ireland) also has its own laws and legal system.

==Modern sources of legislation==

===Parliament of the United Kingdom===

The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Westminster Parliament or "Westminster") is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London.
U.K. Legislation may take the form of Acts (passed directly by Parliament) or Statutory Instruments, made under the authority of an Act of Parliament by either a government minister or by the Queen-in-Council. The latter are generally subject either to parliamentary approval (affirmative procedure) or parliamentary disallowance (negative procedure). Prerogative instruments, made by the Sovereign under the royal prerogative are another source of U.K.-wide legislation.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].

===Scottish Parliament===

The Scottish Parliament is the national, unicameral legislature of Scotland, located in the Holyrood area of the capital, Edinburgh. The Parliament, informally referred to as "Holyrood",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/education/resources/teachingResources/wordBank.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Word Bank |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=14 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).
The Scottish Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]the areas in which it can make laws[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]by explicitly specifying powers that are "reserved" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom: all matters that are not explicitly reserved are automatically the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |title=Scotland Act 1998: Scottish Parliament Reserved Issues |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) |accessdate=14 November 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070519074917/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |archivedate =19 May 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.Murkens, Jones & Keating (2002) pp11 The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report â€“ 12 May 1999 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=5 November 2006[/tpl]
Scottish Statutory Instruments made by the Scottish Government are another source of legislation. As with Statutory Instruments made by the British government, these are generally subject to either approval or disallowance by the Scottish Parliament

===National Assembly for Wales===

The National Assembly for Wales has the power to make legislation in Wales. The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate in the 20 areas that are devolved without having to consult the UK parliament, nor the Secretary of State for Wales.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12648649 | work=BBC News | title=Wales says Yes in referendum vote | date=4 March 2011[/tpl] The Assembly may also delegate authority to enact legislation through Welsh Statutory Instruments.

===Northern Ireland Assembly===

The Northern Ireland Assembly is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.  Legislation of the Assembly empowers the Northern Island Executive to issue Statutory Rules in a variety of areas.
