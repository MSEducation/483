Homeopathy [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-homeopathy.ogg|ˌ|h|oʊ|m|i|ˈ|ɒ|p|ə|θ|i[/tpl] (also spelled homoeopathy or homœopathy; from the Greek [tpl]lang|el|ὅμοιος[/tpl] hómoios "like-" and [tpl]lang|el|πάθος[/tpl] páthos "suffering") is a system of alternative medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like, according to which a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people will cure similar symptoms in sick people. Homeopathy is a pseudoscience; its remedies have been found to be no more effective than  placebo.
Hahnemann believed that the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic remedies addressed these. The remedies are prepared by repeatedly diluting a chosen substance in alcohol or distilled water, followed by forceful striking on an elastic body.[tpl]explain[/tpl] Dilution usually continues well past the point where no molecules of the original substance remain.[tpl]citation |contribution=Dynamization and Dilution |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine |publisher=Creighton University Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826082134/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archivedate=2002-08-26 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-24[/tpl] Homeopaths select remedies by consulting reference books known as repertories, and by considering the totality of the patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.[tpl]citation |author=Hahnemann S|title =The Organon of the Healing Art |year =1833 |edition=5th |at=aphorisms 5 and 217 |isbn=0-87983-228-2[/tpl]

==History==

===Historical context===

Homeopaths claim that Hippocrates may have originated homeopathy around 400 BC, when he prescribed a small dose of mandrake root to treat mania, knowing it produces mania in much larger doses.[tpl]Citation|doi=10.1001/jama.1894.02420900001001|title=Modern Homeopathy and Medical Science|year=1894|last1=Hemenway|first1=Henry Bixby|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|issue=11|pages=367[/tpl] In the 16th century, the pioneer of pharmacology Paracelsus declared that small doses of "what makes a man ill also cures him." Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843) gave homeopathy its name and expanded its principles in the late 18th century. At that time, mainstream medicine used methods like bloodletting and purging, and administered complex mixtures, such as Venice treacle, which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.[ref]

instead, he advocated the use of single drugs at lower doses and promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of how living organisms function, believing that diseases have spiritual, as well as physical causes.[tpl]cite book|author=W.

===Hahnemann's concept===

The term "homeopathy" was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807.
Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist William Cullen into German. Being skeptical of Cullen's theory concerning cinchona's use for curing malaria, Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and joint pain: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the "law of similars" that had been proposed by ancient physicians.[tpl]cite book|author1=Robert W. Ullman|author2=Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman|title=The Patient's Guide to Homeopathic Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LColT6LtubcC&pg=PA1|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=1 October 1994|publisher=Picnic Point Press|isbn=978-0-9640654-2-0|pages=1–2[/tpl] An account of the effects of eating cinchona bark noted by Oliver Wendell Holmes, and published in 1861, failed to reproduce the symptoms Hahnemann reported.[tpl]rp|128[/tpl] Hahnemann's law of similars is a postulate rather than a true law of nature.The Dental Cosmos: A Monthly Record of Dental Science, Editor Edward C. Kirk, D.D.S., Vol. XXXVI, p. 1031-1032
Subsequent scientific work shows that cinchona cures malaria because it contains quinine, which kills the Plasmodium falciparum parasite that causes the disease; the mechanism of action is unrelated to the symptoms of cinchonism.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/homeopathy-and-evidence-based-medicine-back-to-the-future-part-i/ | title=Homeopathy and Evidence-Based Medicine: Back to the Future | publisher=Science Based Medicine | date=January 4, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2013 | author=Atwood, Kimball[/tpl]

===="Provings"====

Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as "homeopathic proving". These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by clearly recording all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.[tpl]cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&pg=PA101|accessdate=24 January 2013|year=1922|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-693-3|page=101[/tpl] A collection of provings was published in 1805, and a second collection of 65 remedies appeared in his book, Materia Medica Pura, in 1810.[tpl]cite book|author=Anne Taylor Kirschmann|title=A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VSoIGDKsVosC&pg=PA11|accessdate=28 January 2013|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3320-9|page=11[/tpl]
Because Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects. Hahnemann believed that this process aroused and enhanced "the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances".[ref]

.

[/ref]
He gathered and published a complete overview of his new medical system in his 1810 book, The Organon of the Healing Art, whose 6th edition, published in 1921, is still used by homeopaths today.

====Miasms and disease====

In  The Organon of the Healing Art, Hahnemann introduced the concept of "miasms" as "infectious principles" underlying chronic disease.[tpl]cite book|author1=J. H. Clarke|author2=John Henry Clarke|title=Homeopathy Explained|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUGIWuo4qc8C&pg=PA22|accessdate=12 January 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Nanopathy|pages=22–|id=GGKEY:JWCD56EF80T[/tpl] Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, and thought that initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases; if however these symptoms were suppressed by medication, the cause went deeper and began to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs. Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly opposing their symptoms, as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all "disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency". The underlying imputed miasm still remains, and deep-seated ailments can be corrected only by removing the deeper disturbance of the vital force.
Hahnemann originally presented only three miasms, of which the most important was psora (Greek for "itch"), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed scabies, and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as epilepsy, cancer, jaundice, deafness, and cataracts.[ref]

[tpl]Page needed|date=March 2011[/tpl][/ref] 
Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including tuberculosis and cancer miasms.
The law of susceptibility implies that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called "miasms" to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] Hahnemann rejected the notion of a disease as a separate thing or invading entity, and insisted it was always part of the "living whole".[ref]

[tpl]Page needed|date=March 2011[/tpl][/ref] Hahnemann coined the expression "allopathic medicine", which was used to pejoratively refer to traditional Western medicine.[tpl]Citation|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&pg=PA18|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York[/tpl]
Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In 1978, Anthony Campbell, then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by George Vithoulkas claiming that syphilis, when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system, saying that "The unfortunate layman might well be misled by Vithoulkas' rhetoric into refusing orthodox treatment".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.minimum.com/reviews/science-homeopathy.htm |title= The Science of Homoeopathy, by G. Vithoulkas |publisher= British Homoeopathic Journal |volume= 67 |date= October 1978 |accessdate= 2 October 2013[/tpl]
Vithoulkas' claims conflict with scientific studies, which indicated penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.
The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as genetics, environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.[tpl]citation |author=Shelton, Jay W. |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it Really Works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4[/tpl][tpl]rp|148–9|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===

Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. Dr. John Franklin Gray (1804–1882) was the first practitioner of homeopathy in the United States, beginning in 1828 in New York City.  The first homeopathic schools opened in 1830, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States. By 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States. Because medical practice of the time relied on ineffective and often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time.[tpl]Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E. |last2=Kaptchuk |first2=TJ |title=Homeopathy revisited |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=156 |issue=19 |pages=2162–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8885813 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.19.2162[/tpl] Homeopathic remedies, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic remedies less likely to be killed by the treatment that was supposed to be helping them. The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science-based medicine.[ref]

[tpl]Page needed|date=March 2011[/tpl][/ref]
One reason for the growing popularity of homeopathy was its apparent success in treating people suffering from infectious disease epidemics.
During 19th century epidemics of diseases such as cholera, death rates in homeopathic hospitals were often lower than in conventional hospitals, where the treatments used at the time were often harmful and did little or nothing to combat the diseases.[ref]Death rates in conventional hospitals were typically two- to eight-fold higher than in homeopathic hospitals for patients with these infectious diseases; see

[tpl]Page needed|date=March 2011[/tpl][/ref]
From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science. Sir John Forbes, physician to Queen Victoria, said in 1843 that the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, "an outrage to human reason". James Young Simpson said in 1853 of the highly diluted drugs: "No poison, however strong or powerful, the billionth or decillionth of which would in the least degree affect a man or harm a fly."
19th-century American physician and author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. was also a vocal critic of homeopathy and published an essay in 1842 entitled Homœopathy and Its Kindred Delusions. The members of the French Homeopathic Society observed in 1867 that some of the leading homeopathists of Europe not only were abandoning the practice of administering infinitesimal doses but were also no longer defending it. The last school in the U.S. exclusively teaching homeopathy closed in 1920.

===Revival in the 20th century===

According to Paul Ulrich Unschuld, the Nazi regime in Germany were fascinated by homeopathy, and spent large sums of money on researching its mechanisms, but without gaining a positive result. Unschuld further argues that homeopathy never subsequently took root in the United States, but remained more deeply established in European thinking.[tpl]cite book|author=Paul Ulrich Unschuld|title=What Is Medicine?: Western and Eastern Approaches to Healing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bPMTlS1pzEUC&pg=PA171|accessdate=7 September 2013|date=9 August 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94470-1|page=171[/tpl]
In the United States the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (sponsored by Royal Copeland, a Senator from New York and homeopathic physician) recognized homeopathic remedies as drugs. In the 1950s, there were only 75 pure homeopaths practicing in the U.S. However, by the mid to late 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback and sales of some homeopathic companies increased tenfold. Some homeopaths give credit for the revival to Greek homeopath George Vithoulkas, who performed a "great deal of research to update the scenarios and refine the theories and practice of homeopathy" beginning in the 1970s,[tpl]Cite journal | volume = 138 | issue = 5 | pages = 393–399 | last = Jonas | first = WB | coauthors = TJ Kaptchuk, K Linde | title = A critical overview of homeopathy. | journal = Annals of internal medicine | date = 2003-03 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-5-200303040-00009[/tpl][ref]

Whichever is correct, mainstream pharmacy chains recognized the business potential of selling homeopathic remedies.
Bruce Hood has argued that the increased popularity of homeopathy in recent times may be due to the comparatively long consultations practitioners are willing to give their patients, and to an irrational preference for "natural" products which people think are the basis of homeopathic remedies.[tpl]cite book|author=Bruce M. Hood|title=SuperSense|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ijERHh6DFUC&pg=PA157|accessdate=7 September 2013|date=7 April 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-186793-4|page=157[/tpl]

==Remedies and treatment==

Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies: materia medica and repertories. A homeopathic materia medica is a collection of "drug pictures", organised alphabetically by "remedy,".  These entries describe the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists remedies associated with specific symptoms.
Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. 
Examples include arsenicum album (arsenic oxide), natrum muriaticum (sodium chloride or table salt), Lachesis muta (the venom of the bushmaster snake), opium, and thyroidinum (thyroid hormone).
Homeopaths also use treatments called "nosodes" (from the Greek nosos, disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue. Homeopathic remedies prepared from healthy specimens are called "sarcodes".
Some modern homeopaths have considered more esoteric bases for remedies, known as "imponderables" because they do not originate from a substance, but from electromagnetic energy presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or lactose. Examples include X-rays
and sunlight.
Today, about 3,000 different remedies are commonly used in homeopathy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Some homeopaths also use techniques that are regarded by other practitioners as controversial. 
These include "paper remedies", where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, as well as the use of radionics to prepare remedies. 
Such practices have been strongly criticised by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.

===Preparation===

In producing remedies for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamisation" or "potentisation", whereby a substance is diluted with alcohol or distilled water and then vigorously shaken by 10 hard strikes against an elastic body in a process homeopaths call "succussion". Hahnemann advocated using substances that produce symptoms like those of the disease being treated, but found that undiluted doses intensified the symptoms and exacerbated the condition, sometimes causing dangerous toxic reactions. He therefore specified that the substances be diluted, due to his belief that succussion activated the "vital energy" of the diluted substance and made it stronger. To facilitate succussion, Hahnemann had a saddle-maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.
transcript). Insoluble solids, such as quartz and oyster shell, are diluted by grinding them with lactose ("trituration").

===Dilutions===

Three logarithmic potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the "centesimal" or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. 
A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100. 
This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.[ref]
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the volume-volume percentage method.[/ref] A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100−6=10−12 (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. 
In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies. The end product is often so diluted as to be indistinguishable from the dilutant (pure water, sugar or alcohol).  There is also a decimal potency scale (notated as "X" or "D") in which the remedy is diluted by a factor of 10 at each stage.http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp
Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 1060). In Hahnemann's time, it was reasonable to assume the remedies could be diluted indefinitely, as the concept of the atom or molecule as the smallest possible unit of a chemical substance was just beginning to be recognized. 
The greatest dilution reasonably likely to contain even one molecule of the original substance is 12C.
Critics and advocates of homeopathy alike commonly attempt to illustrate the dilutions involved in homeopathy with analogies.For further discussion of homeopathic dilutions and the mathematics involved, see Homeopathic dilutions. 
Hahnemann is reported to have joked that a suitable procedure to deal with an epidemic would be to empty a bottle of poison into Lake Geneva, if it could be succussed 60 times.
Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a "pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans", which is approximately correct.[ref]
A 12C solution produced using sodium chloride (also called natrum muriaticum in homeopathy) is the equivalent of dissolving 0.36 mL of table salt, weighing about 0.77 g, into a volume of water the size of the Atlantic Ocean, since the volume of the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas is 3.55×108 km3 or 3.55×1020 L :

[/ref]
One-third of a drop of some original substance diluted into all the water on earth would produce a remedy with a concentration of about 13C.[ref]
The volume of all water on earth is about 1.36×109 km3:

[/ref][ref]Gleick PH, Water resources, In

[/ref]  A popular homeopathic treatment for the flu is a 200C dilution of duck liver, marketed under the name oscillococcinum. As there are only about 1080 atoms in the entire observable universe, a dilution of one molecule in the observable universe would be about 40C. Oscillococcinum would thus require 10320 more universes to simply have one molecule in the final substance.[ref]
</ref>
The high dilutions characteristically used are often considered to be the most controversial and implausible aspect of homeopathy.[tpl]Citation |last1=Fisher |first1=P |title=The Memory of Water: a scientific heresy? |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=141–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17678808 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.008[/tpl]

====Dilution debate====

Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. Remedies at potencies below 4X are considered an important part of homeopathic heritage.[tpl]cite journal | author = van Haselen, R. | title = To which extent should potency choice in homeopathy be "regulated": has European legislation gone too far? | journal = Wien Med Wochenschr. | volume = 155 | issue = 21-22 | pages = 479–81 | date = Nov 2005 | pmid = 16425107 | doi = 10.1007/s10354-005-0231-z [/tpl]
Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally used lower dilutions such as "3X" or "6X", rarely going beyond "12X".
The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines.  
Those favoring low dilutions stressed pathology and a stronger link to conventional medicine, while those favoring high dilutions  emphasised vital force, miasms and a spiritual interpretation of disease.
Some products with such relatively lower dilutions continue to be sold, but like their counterparts, they have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect beyond that of a placebo.

===Provings===

A homeopathic proving is the method by which the profile of a homeopathic remedy is determined.[tpl]Citation |last1=Dantas |first1=F |last2=Fisher |first2=P |last3=Walach |first3=H |last4=Wieland |first4=F |last5=Rastogi |first5=D |last6=Teixeira |first6=H |last7=Koster |first7=D |last8=Jansen |first8=J |last9=Eizayaga |first9=J |displayauthors=9 |title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic pathogenetic trials published from 1945 to 1995 |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=4–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17227742 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.005[/tpl]
At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with remedies at a 30C dilution, and most modern provings are carried out using ultradilute remedies in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain. During the proving process, Hahnemann administered remedies to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a "drug picture". 
The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day.
They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation. 
After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.
Provings have been described as important in the development of the clinical trial, due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of statistics in medicine.[ref]

[tpl]Page needed|date=March 2011[/tpl][/ref] The lengthy records of self-experimentation by homeopaths have occasionally proven useful in the development of modern drugs: For example, evidence that nitroglycerin might be useful as a treatment for angina was discovered by looking through homeopathic provings, though homeopaths themselves never used it for that purpose at that time.
The first recorded provings were published by Hahnemann in his 1796 Essay on a New Principle.
His Fragmenta de Viribus (1805) contained the results of 27 provings, and his 1810 Materia Medica Pura contained 65.
For James Tyler Kent's 1905 Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica, 217 remedies underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.
Though the proving process has superficial similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different in that the process is subjective, not blinded, and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving.[tpl]citation |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm |title=Are the principles of Homeopathy scientifically valid? |publisher=Creighton University School of Medicine [/tpl] As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.

===Physical, mental, and emotional state examination; repertories===

Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.
From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient. A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings, supplemented with clinical data, is known as a "homeopathic materia medica". 
But because a practitioner first needs to explore the remedies for a particular symptom rather than looking up the symptoms for a particular remedy, the "homeopathic repertory", which is an index of symptoms, lists after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it.
Repertories are often very extensive and may include data extracted from multiple sources of materia medica.
There is often lively debate among compilers of repertories and practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion.
The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic materia medica was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students, Clemens von Bönninghausen, created the Therapeutic Pocket Book, another homeopathic repertory.
The first such homeopathic repertory was Georg Jahr's Symptomenkodex, published in German (1835), which was then first translated to English (1838) by Constantine Hering as the Repertory to the more Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica.
This version was less focused on disease categories and would be the forerunner to Kent's later works.
It consisted of three large volumes. Such repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.
Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. "Classical homeopathy" generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms, while "clinical homeopathy" involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.

===Pills===

Homeopathic pills are made from an inert substance (often sugars, typically lactose), upon which a drop of liquid homeopathic preparation is placed.[tpl]Citation |pmid=17710203 |year=2007 |last1=Sagar |first1=SM |title=Homeopathy: Does a teaspoon of honey help the medicine go down? |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=126–7 |pmc=1948865 |journal=Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.) |postscript=.[/tpl]

==="Active" ingredients===

The list of ingredients seen on remedies may confuse consumers into believing the product actually contains those ingredients. According to normal homeopathic practice, remedies are prepared starting with active ingredients that are often serially diluted to the point where the finished product no longer contains any biologically "active ingredients" as that term is normally defined.
James Randi and the 10:23 campaign groups have demonstrated the lack of active ingredients in homeopathic products by taking large overdoses. None of the hundreds of demonstrators in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US were injured and "no one was cured of anything, either".[tpl]cite web |author=Coghlan A|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18455-mass-drug-overdose--none-dead.html |title=Mass drug overdose – none dead |date=1 February 2010|publisher= New Scientist |work= |accessdate=2012-04-20[/tpl]
While the lack of active compounds is noted in most homeopathic products, there are some exceptions such as Zicam Cold Remedy, which is marketed as an "unapproved homeopathic" product.Label data It contains a number of highly diluted ingredients that are listed as "inactive ingredients" on the label.  Some of the homeopathic ingredients used in the preparation of Zicam are galphimia glauca,[tpl]Citation |last1=Teut |first1=Michael |last2=Dahler |first2=JÖrn |last3=Schnegg |first3=Christoph |title=A Homoeopathic Proving of Galphimia glauca |journal=Forschende Komplementärmedizin / Research in Complementary Medicine |volume=15 |pages=211–7 |year=2008 |doi=10.1159/000148825 |issue=4[/tpl] histamine dihydrochloride (homeopathic name, histaminum hydrochloricum),Description of Histaminum Hydrochloricum luffa operculata,Luffa operculata L. COGN Sponge Cucumber and sulfur. 
Although the product is marked "homeopathic", it does contain two ingredients that are only "slightly" diluted: zinc acetate (2X = 1/100 dilution) and zinc gluconate (1X = 1/10 dilution), which means both are present in a concentration that contains biologically active ingredients. In fact, they are strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/health/policy/17nasal.html?hp | title=FDA Warns Against Use of Zicam | publisher=New York Times | author=Harris, Gardinier | date=June 16, 2009 [/tpl] a condition termed anosmia. This illustrates why taking a product marked "homeopathic", especially an overdose,Sam Jones, "Homeopathy protesters to take 'mass overdose' outside Boots", The Guardian, 29 January 2010> can still be dangerous because it may contain biologically active ingredients, though as discussed previously, most homeopathic preparations contain no active ingredients. Because the manufacturers of Zicam label it as a homeopathic product (despite the relatively high concentrations of active ingredients), it is exempted from FDA regulation by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).

===Related treatments and practices===

====Isopathy====

Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies, known as "nosodes", are made up either from things that cause the disease or from products of the disease, such as pus. Many so-called "homeopathic vaccines" are a form of isopathy.[ref]
</ref>

====Flower remedies====

Flower remedies can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the Bach flower remedies, which were developed by the physician and homeopath Edward Bach. Although the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force" as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower remedies are prepared in "gentler" ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the remedies are not succussed.[tpl]Citation |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308[/tpl] There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower remedies being effective.[tpl]Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title="Flower remedies": a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462[/tpl]

====Veterinary use====

The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals, termed "veterinary homeopathy", dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.[tpl]Citation |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010[/tpl] The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, veterinary surgeons who use homeopathy may belong to the Faculty of Homeopathy and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may be treated only by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy. The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial; the little existing research on the subject is not of a high enough scientific standard to provide reliable data on efficacy.[tpl]Citation |last1=Hektoen |first1=L |title=Review of the current involvement of homeopathy in veterinary practice and research |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=224–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16113167[/tpl] Other studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.
The UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DeFRA) has adopted a robust position against use of "alternative" pet remedies including homeopathy.Alternative pet remedies: Government clampdown

====Electrohomeopathy====

Electrohomeopathy is a treatment devised by Count Cesare Mattei (1809–1896), who proposed that different "colors" of electricity could be used to treat cancer. Popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy".[tpl]cite journal|pmid=18340908|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=4|issue=1|pages=86–100|pmc=1692573|journal=Medical library and historical journal[/tpl]

==Evidence and efficacy==

The low concentration of homeopathic remedies, which often lack even a single molecule of the diluted substance, has been the basis of questions about the effects of the remedies since the 19th century. Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of "water memory", according to which water "remembers" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise.[tpl]Citation |title=When to believe the unbelievable |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6176 |page=787 |year=1988 |pmid=3386722 |doi=10.1038/333787a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333Q.787.

===Plausibility===

The proposed mechanisms for homeopathy are precluded from having any effect by the laws of physics and physical chemistry.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Grimes | first1 = D.

The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations often leave none of the original substance in the final product. The modern mechanism proposed by homeopaths, water memory, is considered erroneous since short-range order in water only persists for about 1 picosecond.[tpl]Citation |last1=Teixeira |first1=J |title=Can water possibly have a memory? A sceptical view |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=158–62 |year=2007 |pmid=17678811 |doi =10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.001[/tpl] Existence of a pharmacological effect in the absence of any true active ingredient is inconsistent with the observed dose-response relationships characteristic of therapeutic drugs[tpl]Citation |last1=Levy |first1=G |title=Kinetics of drug action: An overview |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=78 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=754–61 |year=1986 |pmid=3534056 |doi =10.1016/0091-6749(86)90057-6[/tpl] (whereas placebo effects are non-specific and unrelated to pharmacological activity[tpl]Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title=Placebo: new insights into an old enigma |journal=Drug Discovery Today |volume=12 |issue=9–10 |pages=413–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17467578 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2007.03.007[/tpl]). The proposed rationale for these extreme dilutions – that the water contains the "memory" or "vibration" from the diluted ingredient – is counter to the laws of chemistry and physics, such as the law of mass action.

====High dilutions====

The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy preclude a biologically plausible mechanism of action. Homeopathic remedies are often diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.[tpl]Citation |last1=Milgrom |first1=L |title=Conspicuous by its absence: the Memory of Water, macro-entanglement, and the possibility of homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=209–19 |year=2007 |pmid=17678819 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.002[/tpl] Homeopaths contend that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active remedy, in contrast to therapeutically inert water.

Furthermore, since water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, critics point out that water is therefore an extreme dilution of almost any conceivable substance. By drinking water one would, according to this interpretation, receive treatment for every imaginable condition. For comparison, ISO 3696: 1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation. This water may not be kept in glass as contaminants will leach out into the water.ISO 3696: 1987
Practitioners of homeopathy hold that higher dilutions — described as being of higher potencye.g. Dana Ullman, MPH. Essential Homeopathy: What It Is and What It Can Do for You. New World Library, Novato. California, January 2002.

Essential Homeopathy: What It Is and What It Can Do for You. New World Library, Novato. California, January 2002. ISBN 1-57731-206-6. p. 62: "Homeopaths often simply prescribe one dose of one high-potency remedy, and these more powerful remedies tend to be more susceptible to being neutralized than lower-potency medicines."  This idea is inconsistent with the observed dose-response relationships of conventional drugs, where the effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body.

Physicist Robert L. Park, former executive director of the American Physical Society, is quoted as saying,
"since the least amount of a substance in a solution is one molecule, a 30C solution would have to have at least one molecule of the original substance dissolved in a minimum of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 1060 molecules of water. This would require a container more than 30,000,000,000 times the size of the Earth."
Park is also quoted as saying that, "to expect to get even one molecule of the 'medicinal' substance allegedly present in 30X pills, it would be necessary to take some two billion of them, which would total about a thousand tons of lactose plus whatever impurities the lactose contained".
The laws of chemistry state that there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether.[tpl]Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title=Is homeopathy a clinically valuable approach? |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=547–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16165225 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2005.09.003[/tpl] This limit, which is related to Avogadro's number, is roughly equal to homeopathic potencies of 12C or 24X (1 part in 1024).
Scientific tests run by both the BBC's Horizon and ABC's 20/20 programs were unable to differentiate homeopathic dilutions from water, even when using tests suggested by homeopaths themselves.[ref]

Since better quality trials have become available, the evidence for efficacy of homeopathy preparations has diminished; the highest-quality trials indicate that the remedies themselves exert no intrinsic effect.[tpl]rp|206|date=November 2012[/tpl] A review conducted in 2010 of all the pertinent studies of "best evidence" produced by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that "the most reliable evidence – that produced by Cochrane reviews – fails to demonstrate that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo."[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Ernst | first1 = E. | title = Homeopathy: What does the "best" evidence tell us? | journal = Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 192 | issue = 8 | pages = 458–460 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20402610 | url = https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/homeopathy-what-does-best-evidence-tell-us | authorlink1 = Edzard Ernst [/tpl]

====Publication bias and other methodological issues====

The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a "statistically significant" positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%—a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.[tpl]Citation |last1=Sterne |first1=J.

Positive results are much more likely to be false if the prior probability of the claim under test is low.

====Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy====

Both meta-analyses, which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other systematic reviews of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Liberati | first1 = A. | last2 = Altman | first2 = D.

 The evidence of bias the primary studies weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most "original" subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.[tpl]Citation |last1=Linde |first1=K |last2=Scholz |first2=M |last3=Ramirez |first3=G |last4=Clausius |first4=N |last5=Melchart |first5=D |last6=Jonas |first6=WB |title=Impact of Study Quality on Outcome in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Homeopathy |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=631–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10391656 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00048-7[/tpl] 
In 2002, a systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic remedy exerts clinical effects different from placebo.
In 2005, The Lancet medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the Swiss government's Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine, or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects.
A 2006 meta-analysis of six trials evaluating homeopathic treatments to reduce cancer therapy side-effects following radiotherapy and chemotherapy found that there was "insufficient evidence to support clinical efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer care".[tpl]Citation |last1=Milazzo |first1=S |last2=Russell |first2=N |last3=Ernst |first3=E |title=Efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer treatment |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=282–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16376071 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.09.025[/tpl]
A 2007 systematic review of homeopathy for children and adolescents found that the evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhea was mixed. No difference from placebo was found for adenoid vegetation, asthma, or upper respiratory tract infection. Evidence was not sufficient to recommend any therapeutic or preventative intervention, and the delay in medical treatment may be harmful to the patient.
In 2012, a systematic review evaluating evidence of homeopathy's possible adverse effects concluded that "homeopathy has the potential to harm patients and consumers in both direct and indirect ways".[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Posadzki | first1 = P. | last2 = Alotaibi | first2 = A. | last3 = Ernst | first3 = E. | title = Adverse effects of homeopathy: A systematic review of published case reports and case series | journal = International Journal of Clinical Practice | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 1178–1188 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23163497 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/ijcp.12026 [/tpl] One of the reviewers, Edzard Ernst, supplemented the article on his blog, writing: "I have said it often and I say it again: if used as an alternative to an effective cure, even the most 'harmless' treatment can become life-threatening."

Clinical studies of the medical efficacy of homeopathy have been criticised by some homeopaths as being irrelevant because they do not test "classical homeopathy".[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4183916.stm |title=Homoeopathy's benefit questioned  |periodical =BBC News  |date=2005-08-26 |accessdate =2009-01-09 [/tpl]  There have, however, been a number of clinical trials that have tested individualized homeopathy. A 1998 review[tpl]Citation |last1=Linde |first1=Klaus |last2=Melchart |first2=Dieter |title=Randomized Controlled Trials of Individualized Homeopathy: A State-of-the-Art Review |journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=371–88 |year=1998 |pmid=9884175 |doi=10.1089/acm.1998.4.371[/tpl] found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded "that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies." Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.[tpl]rp|209|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In a 2012 article published in the Skeptical Inquirer,[tpl]cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Edzard|title=Homeopathy: A Critique of Current Clinical Research|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=36|issue=November/December|pages=39–42|year=2012|publisher=Center for Inquiry[/tpl] Edzard Ernst reviewed the publications of the research group that has published most of the clinical studies of homeopathic treatment from 2005 to 2010.  A total of 11 articles, published in both conventional and alternative medical journals, describe three randomized clinical trials (one article), prospective cohort studies without controls (seven articles) and comparative cohort studies with controls (three articles).  The diseases include a wide range of conditions from knee surgery, eczema, migraine, insomnia to "any condition of elderly patients".  Ernst's evaluation found numerous flaws in the design, conduct and reporting of the clinical studies. Examples include: little detail of the actual homeopathic treatment administered, misleading presentation of controls (comparison of homeopathic plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment, but presented as homeopathic versus conventional treatment); and similar data in multiple articles.  He concluded that the misinterpreted weak data made the homeopathy appear to have clinical effects which can be attributed to bias or confounding, and that the "casual reader can be seriously misled".

===Explanations of perceived effects===

In 1987, French immunologist Jacques Benveniste submitted a paper to the journal Nature while working at INSERM. The paper purported to have discovered that basophils, a type of white blood cell, released histamine when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, skeptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, Nature assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of Nature editor and physicist Sir John Maddox, American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic James Randi. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."[ref]

This is no crime but science as usual and only the future knows." James Randi stated that he doubted that there had been any conscious fraud, but that the researchers had allowed "wishful thinking" to influence their interpretation of the data.

Patients who choose to use homeopathy rather than evidence-based medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment of serious conditions such as cancer.

====Adverse reactions====

Some homeopathic remedies involve poisons such as Belladonna, arsenic,  and poison ivy which are highly diluted in the homeopathic remedy, only in rare cases are the original ingredients present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic remedies. Instances of arsenic poisoning have occurred after use of arsenic-containing homeopathic preparations. Zicam Cold remedy Nasal Gel, which contains 2X (1:100) zinc gluconate, reportedly caused a small percentage of users to lose their sense of smell; 340 cases were settled out of court in 2006 for [tpl]nowrap|12 million U.S. dollars[/tpl]. In 2009, the FDA advised consumers to stop using three discontinued cold remedy products manufactured by Zicam because it could cause permanent damage to users' sense of smell.[ref]Sources:
