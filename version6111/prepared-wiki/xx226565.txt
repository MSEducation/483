Pennterra is a Georgian farmhouse near Thurmont, Maryland.  The house is notable for its locally-quarried stonework and its unusually fine proportions. The house was built at about the same time as nearby Strawberry Hill, which was built in 1783.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=361&COUNTY=Frederick&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Frederick|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
