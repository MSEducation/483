The Mount Remarkable District Council is a local government area located between the top the Spencer Gulf and the base of the Southern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. The district encompasses a wide variety of towns, including coastal ports and agricultural centres. The economy of the region is largely based on agriculture.

==History==

The Flinders Ranges region has been one of the first areas settled by pioneers, with the land being used mainly for extensive sheep grazing and sporadic mining. Most of the rural land is held under perpetual and pastoral leases.[ref]

The Mount Remarkable District Council was formed when Port Germein District Council and Wilmington District Council areas merged in 1980. The council is named after the nearby peak of Mount Remarkable, named by Edward John Eyre in 1840, in reference to the way it stood out against the surrounding landscape.[ref]
