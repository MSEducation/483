The name comes from Old Norse word Móðguland which is derived from the river name Móðga, which can be linked with the Old Norse word móðigr which means "brave".  Austre means "eastern."[tpl]cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nedenes amt|edition=8|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W. C.

==History==

The parish of Østre Moland was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). According to the 1835 census the municipality had a population of 4,513.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhd.uit.no/dok/nos09.html|title=Hjemmehørende folkemengde Aust-Agder 1801-1960|author=Registreringssentral for historiske data|publisher=University of Tromsø|language=Norwegian[/tpl]  On 1 January 1875, a small part of Arendal (population: 22) was transferred to Østre Moland.
On 1 May 1878, Østre Moland was split into three to create two new municipalities: Barbu (population: 4,874) and Tromøy (population: 2,320).  This split left Østre Moland with 2,524 inhabitants.  On 1 July 1919, another rural district Stokken (population: 1,683) was separated from Østre Moland, leaving it with a population of 1,289. At the same time the name was changed to Austre Moland.
On 1 January 1962, a major municipal merger took place.  Austre Moland (population: 1,607) was merged with Stokken (population: 2,783), Flosta (population: 1,205), and the Strengereid area of Tvedestrand (population: 375) to form the new municipality Moland.  On 1 January 1964, the farm Holtegården with 5 inhabitants, which had been a part of Austre Moland until 1962, was moved to Tvedestrand municipality.
On 1 January 1992, Moland (population: 8,148) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Arendal (population: 12,478).  Øyestad, Tromøy, and Hisøy were also merged into Arendal at the same time.[tpl]cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|date=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
