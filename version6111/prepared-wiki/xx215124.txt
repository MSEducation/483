==Iowa Cubs==

==Movies To Go==

==KKDM==

In 1995, Eychaner signed on KKDM as an alternative rock station and also owned a local movie rental chain.  The station, known as "107 dot 5 KKDM" or just "The Dot", was successful and had a large following among young adults at the time. After Eychaner sold the station to Clear Channel in 1999, the company swapped the formats of KCCQ and KKDM, resulting in KKDM becoming "Kiss 107" and KCCQ becoming "Channel Q".
Rich is the brother of Illinois businessman Fred Eychaner.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=25640|title=Baseball history includes gay owner of minor league Cubs franchise|last=Forman|first=Ross|date=February 24, 2010|work=Windy City Times|accessdate=1 June 2013[/tpl]
