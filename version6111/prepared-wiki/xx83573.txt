The name comes from feijão, Portuguese for "beans".
The basic ingredients of feijoada are beans with fresh pork or beef. In northwest Portugal (chiefly Minho and Douro Litoral), it is usually made with white beans; in the northeast (Trás-os-Montes), it is generally prepared with kidney beans, and includes other vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage. The stew is best prepared over low heat in a thick clay pot.
It is usually served with rice and assorted sausages, such as chouriço, morcela (blood sausage), farinheira, and others, which may or may not be cooked in the stew.

==Variants==

Modern variants of the dish are based on ancient Feijoada recipes from the Portuguese regions of Beira, Estremadura, and Trás-os-Montes. In Brazil, feijoada (feijoada brasileira) is often considered the national dish.

===Brazilian feijoada===

Feijoada has been described as a national dish of Brazil.Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans - Google Books p. 180.1001 Foods To Die For - Madison Books, Andrews McMeel Publishing,LLC - Google Books p. 571.Let's Go Brazil 1st Edition - Google Books p. 208. The Brazilian feijoada (feijoada brasileira) is prepared with black beans, a variety of salted pork or beef products, such as pork trimmings (ears, tail, feet), bacon, smoked pork ribs, and at least two types of smoked sausage and jerked beef (loin and tongue) and in Sergipe they usually add vegetables like cabbage, kale, potatoes, carrots, okra, pumpkin, chayote and sometimes banana. They are added at the end of the cooking, on top of the meat, so they are cooked by the vapors of the beans and meat stew.
This stew is best prepared over low fire in a thick clay pot. The final dish has the beans and meat pieces barely covered by a dark purplish-brown broth. The taste is strong, moderately salty but not spicy, dominated by the flavors of black bean and meat stew.
Feijão com arroz is the rice and black beans without the addition of the meat.
