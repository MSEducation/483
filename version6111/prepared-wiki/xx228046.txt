Prior to the American Civil War it had a male academy, female academy, masonic lodge, and several stores.  The community was originally named Spring Hill, but a community by the same name near Mobile was granted a post office under that name after the Civil War, when Spring Hill had lost its post office.  In order to have a new post office established, the name was changed to Old Spring Hill.[tpl]cite book |title=The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama |author=Marengo County Heritage Book Committee |year=2000 |publisher=Heritage Publishing Consultants |location=Clanton, Alabama |isbn=1-891647-58-X |pages=11 [/tpl][tpl]Gnis|168680[/tpl]
