[[Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis]]

CATEGORIES: Vascular diseases

Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis,  or Mönckeberg's sclerosis,  also called medial calcific sclerosis, is a form of arteriosclerosis or vessel hardening, where calcium deposits are found in the muscular middle layer of the walls of arteries (the tunica media).[tpl]DorlandsDict|one/000008416|Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis[/tpl]  It is an example of dystrophic calcification. Its clinical significance and etiology are not well understood and its relationship to atherosclerosis and other forms of vascular calcification are the subject of disagreement.[tpl]cite journal |author=Micheletti RG, Fishbein GA, Currier JS, Singer EJ, Fishbein MC |title=Calcification of the internal elastic lamina of coronary arteries |journal=Mod.

==Signs and symptoms==

Typically, Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is not associated with symptoms unless complicated by atherosclerosis, calciphylaxis, or accompanied by some other disease.[tpl]cite book |author=Steinmann, Beat U.; Royce, Peter M. |title=Connective tissue and its heritable disorders: molecular, genetic, and medical aspects |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-471-25185-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] However presence of Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is associated with poorer prognosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ono K, Tsuchida A, Kawai H, et al. |title=Ankle-brachial blood pressure index predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1591–8 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12761260 |doi= |url=[/tpl] This is probably due to vascular calcification causing increased arterial stiffness, increased pulse pressure and resulting in exaggerated damage to the heart and kidneys.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dao HH, Essalihi R, Bouvet C, Moreau P |title=Evolution and modulation of age-related medial elastocalcinosis: impact on large artery stiffness and isolated systolic hypertension |journal=Cardiovasc. Res. |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=307–17 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15820199 |doi=10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.012 |url=[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Often Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is discovered as an incidental finding in an X-ray radiograph, on mammograms,  in autopsy, or in association with investigation of some other disease, such as diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease.  Typically calcification is observed in the arteries of the upper and lower limb although it has been seen in numerous other medium size arteries. In the radial or ulnar arteries it can cause "pipestem" arteries, which present as a bounding pulse at the end of the calcific zone. It may also result in "pulselessness." Epidemiological studies have used the ratio of ankle to brachial blood pressure (ankle brachial pressure index, ABPI or ABI) as an indicator of arterial calcification with ABPI >1.3 to >1.5 being used as a diagnostic criterion depending on the study.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hirschl M, Francesconi M, Hirschl MM |title=media sclerosis: clinical aspects in diabetic patients |language=German |journal=VASA |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=216–21 |year=1991 |pmid=1950137 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Newman AB, Siscovick DS, Manolio TA, et al. |title=Ankle-arm index as a marker of atherosclerosis in the Cardiovascular Health Study.

==Cause==

Minor degrees of calcification of the cardiovascular system are common in elderly people,[tpl]cite journal |author=Amann K |title=Media calcification and intima calcification are distinct entities in chronic kidney disease |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1599–605 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18815240 |doi=10.2215/CJN.02120508 |url=[/tpl] and the prevalence of vascular calcification is increased by some diseases (see Epidemiology section). 
Vascular calcification results from the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite) as  a consequence of disordered calcium phosphate regulation in the blood vessel. Hydroxyapatite is secreted in vesicles that bleb out from vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes in the arterial wall. The mechanism of vascular calcification is not fully understood, but probably involves a phenotypic change in the vascular smooth muscle cells in the wall with activation of bone-forming programs. Numerous regulators of calcification such as osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, matrix gla protein and fetuin-A, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-induceing ligand protein have been implicated in this process.[tpl]cite journal |author=Liu Y, Shanahan CM |title=Signalling pathways and vascular calcification |journal=Front.

It is unclear whether Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis is a distinct entity or forms part of a spectrum of vascular calcification that includes atherosclerosis and calcification in the inner layer of the artery wall (tunica intima), calcification of the internal elastic lamina, calcification of cardiac valves and widespread soft tissue calcification.[tpl]cite journal |author=Couri CE, da Silva GA, Martinez JA, Pereira Fde A, de Paula FJ |title=Mönckeberg's sclerosis - is the artery the only target of calcification? |journal=BMC Cardiovasc Disord |volume=5 |issue= |pages=34 |year=2005 |pmid=16343348 |pmc=1326214 |doi=10.1186/1471-2261-5-34 |url=[/tpl] The existence of Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis has been disputed and it has been proposed that it is a part of a continuum of atherosclerotic disease:[tpl]cite journal |author=McCullough PA, Agrawal V, Danielewicz E, Abela GS |title=Accelerated atherosclerotic calcification and Mönckeberg's sclerosis: a continuum of advanced vascular pathology in chronic kidney disease |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1585–98 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18667741 |doi=10.2215/CJN.01930408 |url=[/tpl]  the majority of atherosclerotic plaques contain some calcium deposits[tpl]cite journal |author=Tanimura A, McGregor DH, Anderson HC |title=Calcification in atherosclerosis. I. Human studies |journal=J. Exp. Pathol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=261–73 |year=1986 |pmid=2946818 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Tanimura A, McGregor DH, Anderson HC |title=Calcification in atherosclerosis. II. Animal studies |journal=J. Exp. Pathol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=275–97 |year=1986 |pmid=3783282 |doi= |url=[/tpl] and calcification of the internal elastic lamina is common in pathological specimens labelled as Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis. However studies in animals suggest that a predominantly medial pattern of vascular calcification reflects different underlying mechanisms of disease,[tpl]cite journal |author=Amann K |title=Media calcification and intima calcification are distinct entities in chronic kidney disease |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1599–605 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18815240 |doi=10.2215/CJN.02120508 |url=[/tpl] and despite involvement of the internal elastic lamina, evidence of inflammation is rare in Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis.

==Epidemiology==

The prevalence of Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis increases with age and is more frequent in diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic inflammatory conditions, hypervitaminosis D and rare genetic disorders, such as Keutel syndrome. The prevalence of Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis in the general population has been estimated as 1.5;[tpl]cite journal |author=Meijer WT, Hoes AW, Rutgers D, Bots ML, Hofman A, Grobbee DE |title=Peripheral arterial disease in the elderly: The Rotterdam Study |journal=Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=185–92 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9484982 |doi= 10.1161/01.ATV.18.2.185|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Kröger K, Stang A, Kondratieva J, et al. |title=Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease - results of the Heinz Nixdorf recall study |journal=Eur.
