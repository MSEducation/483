==Kotowaza==

A [tpl]nihongo|Japanese proverb|諺, ことわざ|kotowaza[/tpl] may take the form of:
Although "proverb" and "saying" are practically synonymous, the same cannot be said about "idiomatic phrase" and "four-character idiom".  Not all kan'yōku and yojijukugo are proverbial. For instance, the kan'yōku 狐の嫁入り kitsune no yomeiri (Literally: a fox's wedding. Meaning: a sun-shower) and the yojijukugo 小春日和 koharubiyori (Literally: small spring weather. Meaning: Indian summer – warm spring-like weather in early winter) are not proverbs. To be considered a proverb, a word or phrase must express a common truth or wisdom; it cannot be a mere noun.

===Usage===

The Japanese commonly use proverbs, often citing just the first part of common phrases for brevity. For example, one might say [tpl]nihongo|I no naka no kawazu|井の中の蛙|a frog in a well[/tpl] to refer to the proverb [tpl]nihongo|I no naka no kawazu, taikai o shirazu|井の中の蛙、大海を知らず|a frog in a well cannot conceive of the ocean[/tpl].  Whereas proverbs in English are typically multi-worded phrases ("kill two birds with one stone"), Japanese [tpl]nihongo|yojijyukugo|四字熟語[/tpl] borrows from Chinese and compactly conveys the concept in one word [tpl]nihongo|Isseki nichou|一石二鳥|one stone two birds[/tpl].
The heavy employment of proverbs enables Japanese language to be concise. Evidence might be found in Japanese animation and manga, but also appears in news and cultural programs, and in much fiction.

===Origin===

Because traditional Japanese culture was tied to agriculture, many Japanese proverbs are derived from agricultural customs and practices. Some are from the Go game (e.g., fuseki o utsu 布石を打つ), the tea ceremony (e.g. ichi go ichi e 一期一会), and Buddhism. Many four-character idioms are from Chinese philosophy written in Classical Chinese, in particular "The Analects" by Confucius. ([tpl]nihongo||井の中の蛙|a frog in a well[/tpl] is Classical Chinese, from Zhuangzi.)
