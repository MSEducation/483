[[Carbon sink]]

CATEGORIES: Carbon dioxide, Carbon sequestration, Climate forcing agents, Photosynthesis, Gas technologies

A carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period. The process by which carbon sinks remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is known as carbon sequestration. Public awareness of the significance of CO2 sinks has grown since passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which promotes their use as a form of carbon offset. There are also different strategies used to enhance this process.
The natural sinks are:
Natural sinks are typically much larger than artificial sinks. The main artificial sinks are:
Carbon sources include: 

==Kyoto Protocol==

Because growing vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide, the Kyoto Protocol allows Annex I countries with large areas of growing forests to issue Removal Units to recognize the sequestration of carbon. The additional units make it easier for them to achieve their target emission levels.
Some countries seek to trade emission rights in carbon emission markets, purchasing the unused carbon emission allowances of other countries. If overall limits on greenhouse gas emission are put into place, cap and trade market mechanisms are purported to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604191032/http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archivedate=4 June 2007 | title=Electricity, Renewables, and Climate Change: Searching for a Cost-Effective Policy | author=Karen Palmer and Dallas Burtraw | publisher=Resources for the Future|format=PDF[/tpl]  There is as yet no carbon audit regime for all such markets globally, and none is specified in the Kyoto Protocol.  National carbon emissions are self-declared.
In the Clean Development Mechanism, only afforestation and reforestation are eligible to produce certified emission reductions (CERs) in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012). Forest conservation activities or activities avoiding deforestation, which would result in emission reduction through the conservation of existing carbon stocks, are not eligible at this time.[tpl]cite journal |author=Manguiat, M.

==Storage in terrestrial and marine environments==

===Soils===

Soils represent a short to long-term carbon storage medium, and contain more carbon than all terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere combined.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Soil Science |volume=166 |issue=11 |pages=858–71 |last=Swift |first=Roger S. |title=Sequestration of Carbon by soil |date=November 2001 |doi=10.1097/00010694-200111000-00010 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Batjes |first=Niels H. |journal=European Journal of Soil Science |volume=47 |pages=151–63 |title=Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world  |year=1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x |issue=2 [/tpl] Plant litter and other biomass accumulates as organic matter in soils, and is degraded by chemical weathering and biological degradation.  More recalcitrant organic carbon polymers such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, aliphatic compounds, waxes and terpenoids are collectively retained as humus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Klaus Lorenza, Rattan Lala,  Caroline M. Prestonb, Klaas G.J. Nieropc |title=Strengthening the soil organic carbon pool by increasing contributions from recalcitrant aliphatic bio(macro)molecules |journal=Geoderma |volume=142 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–10 |date=15 November 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.07.013 [/tpl]  Organic matter tends to accumulate in litter and soils of colder regions such as the boreal forests of North America and the Taiga of Russia. Leaf litter and humus are rapidly oxidized and poorly retained in sub-tropical and tropical climate conditions due to high temperatures and extensive leaching by rainfall. Areas where shifting cultivation or slash and burn agriculture are practiced are generally only fertile for 2–3 years before they are abandoned.  These tropical jungles are similar to coral reefs in that they are highly efficient at conserving and circulating necessary nutrients, which explains their lushness in a nutrient desert.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]  Much organic carbon retained in many agricultural areas worldwide has been severely depleted due to intensive farming practices.
Grasslands contribute to soil organic matter, stored mainly in their extensive fibrous root mats. Due in part to the climatic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced grass-fires.  While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the humic material.  They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of char that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.
Forest fires release absorbed carbon back into the atmosphere, as does deforestation due to rapidly increased oxidation of soil organic matter.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
Organic matter in peat bogs undergoes slow anaerobic decomposition below the surface.  This process is slow enough that in many cases the bog grows rapidly and fixes more carbon from the atmosphere than is released.  Over time, the peat grows deeper.  Peat bogs inter approximately one-quarter of the carbon stored in land plants and soils.[tpl]cite web  |last=Chester  |first=Bronwyn |title=The case of the missing sink  |publisher=McGill Reporter  |date=20 April 2000 |url=http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/15/roulet/ |accessdate=8 July 2008[/tpl]
Under some conditions, forests and peat bogs may become sources of CO2, such as when a forest is flooded by the construction of a hydroelectric dam. Unless the forests and peat are harvested before flooding, the rotting vegetation is a source of CO2 and methane comparable in magnitude to the amount of carbon released by a fossil-fuel powered plant of equivalent power.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 | title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed | publisher=New Scientist | date=24 February 2005 | accessdate=8 July 2008 | author=Duncan Graham-Rowe[/tpl]

===Regenerative agriculture===

Current agricultural practices lead to carbon loss from soils. It has been suggested that improved farming practices could return the soils to being a carbon sink. Present worldwide practises of overgrazing are substantially reducing many grasslands' performance as carbon sinks.C.Michael Hogan. 2009. Overgrazing. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC The Rodale Institute says that Regenerative agriculture, if practiced on the planet’s 3.6 billion tillable acres, could sequester up to 40% of current CO2 emissions.http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/Rodale_Research_Paper.pdf They claim that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to mitigate global warming. When using biologically based regenerative practices, this dramatic benefit can be accomplished with no decrease in yields or farmer profits.[tpl]cite web|title=The Farming Systems Trial|url=http://66.147.244.123/~rodalein/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FSTbookletFINAL.pdf|publisher=Rodale Institute|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] Organically managed soils can convert carbon dioxide from a greenhouse gas into a food-producing asset.
In 2006, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, largely from fossil fuel combustion, were estimated at nearly 6.5 billion tons.Carbon Dioxide and Our Ocean Legacy, by Richard A. Feely et. al If a 2,000 (lb/ac)/year sequestration rate was achieved on all [tpl]convert|434000000|acre|km2[/tpl] of cropland in the United States, nearly 1.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be sequestered per year, mitigating close to one quarter of the country's total fossil fuel emissions.

===Oceans===

Oceans are at present CO2 sinks, and represent the largest active carbon sink on Earth, absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air.Earth Institute News, Columbia University, 18 Nov. 2009 On longer timescales they may be both sources and sinks – during ice ages [tpl]CO2[/tpl] levels decrease to ~180 ppmv, and much of this is believed to be stored in the oceans. As ice ages end, [tpl]CO2[/tpl] is released from the oceans and [tpl]CO2[/tpl] levels during previous interglacials have been around ~280 ppmv. This role as a sink for CO2 is driven by two processes, the solubility pump and the biological pump.[ref]
