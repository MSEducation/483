==History==

===Etymology===

The origin of the word Khartoum is uncertain. One theory argues that khartoum is derived from Arabic kharṭūm خرطوم meaning 'trunk' or 'hose', probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles.Room, Adrian (2006), Placenames of the World (Second edition)., McFarland. ISBN 0-7864-2248-3. P. 194. Captain J. A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought that the name was most probably from the Arabic qurtum, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel.[tpl]Cite jstor|41710712[/tpl]

===Founding (1821–1899)===

Khartoum was established [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] north of the ancient city of Soba in 1821 by Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army, but the settlement quickly grew into a regional center of trade. It also became a focal point for the slave trade. Later, it became the administrative center of Sudan and official capital.
Troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began a siege of Khartoum on 13 March 1884, against defenders led by British General Charles George Gordon. The siege ended in a massacre of the Anglo-Egyptian garrison. The heavily damaged city fell to the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and all its inhabitants were put to death.[tpl]citation|last=Hammond|first=Peter|title=Slavery, Terrorism & Islam|publisher=Christian Liberty Books|place=Cape Town, South Africa|year=2005[/tpl]
Omdurman was the scene of the bloody Battle of Omdurman on 2 September 1898, during which British forces under Herbert Kitchener defeated the Mahdist forces defending the city.
In 1899, Khartoum became the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Several explanations have been offered for the design of the new, Anglo-Egyptian Khartoum. One is that Kitchener laid out the city's streets in a Union flag pattern as a symbol of British dominance. Another is that the grid system and diagonal streets of the city were designed to converge in a way that would allow machine-guns to sweep the town. However, there is no contemporary evidence to support either of these suggestions.Home, Robert K., Of Planting and Planning: the making of British colonial cities (1997), p.41 Thirdly, there exists a seemingly accurate suggestion with direct contemporary evidence, presented in the book Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man: ``How long has Egypt remained down-trodden and in darkness? -England now has altered that, and Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, a Freemason, has already commenced the building of a university at Khartoum. Britain's sons are now forming a great kingdom from the Cape to Cairo. The only other countries of importance in which Freemasonry exists, and which have their temples and lodges (whose members may not be classed as British) are the United States and Germany. Many of the latter are now English 431 and American subjects; perhaps in time all will be. Many of the former are of British descent, and in our opinion the prophecies point to the ultimate union of these before the time of the next glacial epoch. When these islands will become cold and buried under ice, where will be the centre of learning and knowledge? Egypt-Khartoum.'`.Churchward, Albert, "Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man" (1910) In summation, it is most likely that Kitchener and other Freemasons designed the layout of Khartoum based on their mathematical and related principles, possibly to be suitable as a great city of influence during, as indicated, "the next glacial epoch."

===Modern history (20th–21st centuries)===

In 1973, the city was the site of an anomalous hostage crisis in which members of Black September held ten hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of whom were diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released (see 1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations). A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded "The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/67584.pdf |title=The Seizure of the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum |publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2014-01-28|archivedate=2006-12-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061216201523/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/67584.pdf[/tpl]
The first oil pipeline between Khartoum and the Port of Sudan was completed in 1977.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums at the outskirts of the city. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict have settled around Khartoum.
In 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996 when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and launched cruise missile attacks (20 August) on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in northern Khartoum. The destruction of the factory produced diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The ruins of the factory are now a tourist attraction.
After the sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan, John Garang, at the end of July 2005, there were three days of violent riots in the capital. The riots finally died down after Southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The situation could have been much more dire; even so, the death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4734517.stm |title=World | Africa | Riots after Sudan VP Garang dies |publisher=BBC News |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl]

On 10 May 2008 the Darfur rebel group of the Justice and Equality Movement moved into the city where they engaged in heavy fighting with Sudanese government forces. Their soldiers included minors and their goal was the toppling of Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government, though the Sudanese government succeeded in beating back the assault.Curfew in capital as Sudanese army clash near Khartoum with Darfur rebels – Sudan Tribune 10 May 2008Sudanese rebels 'reach Khartoum' – BBC News 10 May 2008PHOTOS: Sudan capital after today's attack from Darfur JEM – Sudan Tribune 10 May 2008
