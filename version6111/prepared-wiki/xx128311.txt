He served as John A. McCone Professor of International Relations at USC from 1995 until his death in 2007. Previously, he was a senior professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and before that was a full Professor at Yale University by age 29.http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14186.html From 1992-1993, he was the President of the International Studies Association (ISA).

==Research and Influence==

His 1996 book, Rediscoveries and reformulations: humanistic methodologies for international studies (Cambridge U, ISBN 978-0-521-46130-6) collected his essays that offer humanistic alternatives to the conventional scientific approaches within international studies. Professor Alker was one of the 12 key contemporary thinkers covered in the 1997 book "The Future of International Relations," edited by Iver Neumann. His writings have influenced numerous scholars. 
His former students recall his generosity with time and his intellectual creativity. Rather than rewarding only the PhD students who followed his own research program, as some professors do, he stimulated and inspired a wide variety of budding intellects.http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pubs_news/alker_tribute.pdf Prof. Joshua Goldsteinhttp://www.joshuagoldstein.com/, wrote: "He was consciously, purposefully multi-methodological and multi-theoretical. He always pushed his students to find other theoretical perspectives and to use multiple methodologies. That had a huge effect on my career."http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14186.html Prof. Thomas J. Biersteker wrote: "When I think of the intellectual legacy of Hayward Alker, a number of phrases come immediately to mind – enormous intellect, insatiable curiosity, exuberant enthusiasm for ideas, intellectual breadth, extraordinary generosity, and most of all, immense vitality... Hayward had an influence on the profession and scholarship of international relations that went far beyond the small number of us who were fortunate enough to have been his students... I have received testimonies from prominent scholars at Oxford, Brown, and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva – from individuals who were never formally students of Hayward’s – about his impact on their work."http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pubs_news/alker_tribute.pdf Prof. Patrick Jacksonhttp://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/ptjack.cfm wrote: "He was a thoughtful reader even of the work of a young scholar who had not been one of his students, or even one of his grandstudents. I find that attitude somewhat rare in academia these days... And his enthusiasm -- for methodological pluralism, for humanistic-but-rigorous IR scholarship, for ideas -- was contagious!"http://duckofminerva.blogspot.com/2007/08/hayward-alker.html
A memorial conference in his honor was held at the Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown University, 6–7 June 2008. A festschrift in his honor resulted in a book, Alker and IR: Global Studies in an Interconnected World (Routledge 2011, ISBN 978-0-415-61597-6), edited by Renée Marlin-Bennett. Another book, edited by Tahir Amin, is entitled Word Orders in Central Asia: Essays in honor of Hayward R. Alker (Brown University, forthcoming). The Department of International Relations at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan, inaugurated the Dr Hayward R. Alker Library in his honor in 2009, containing hundreds of books and papers from Alker's collection.http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online//Regional/10-Apr-2009/Dr-Hayward-Alker-IR-library-set-up-at-QAU
The USC Center for International Studies has a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship named in his honor.http://usccis.org/pages/3943/HAYWARD_R._ALKER_POST-DOCTORAL_RESEARCH_COMPETITION_2011-2012.htm The ISA posthumously recognized him with its Susan Strange Award, which recognizes a person whose intellect most challenges conventional wisdom in the international studies community.
