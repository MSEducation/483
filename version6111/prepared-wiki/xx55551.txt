==The Hedonistic Imperative==

Pearce is primarily known as the author of The Hedonistic Imperative, a 1995 book-length manifesto in which he theorizes how to "eradicate suffering in all sentient life" through paradise engineering.[tpl]cite web|title=The Future and You: August 27, 2008 Episode|url=http://thefutureandyou.libsyn.com/august_27_2008_episode[/tpl] In Pearce's view, suffering is not necessary for humans and only exists because humanity evolved through methods that emphasized survival, rather than happiness.[tpl]cite book|last=Colson|first=Charles W.|title=Human Dignity in the Biotech Century: A Christian Vision for Public Policy|publisher=InterVarsity|year=2004||page=167|isbn=0830827838[/tpl] He writes that mental suffering will someday be seen as a relic of the past, just as physical suffering during surgery was effectively eliminated with the advent of anesthesia.[tpl]cite news|title=The End of Suffering |publisher=Philosophy Now Magazine |year=2006|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/56/The_End_of_Suffering |accessdate=2014-01-12[/tpl]
In his work, Pearce outlines how drugs and technologies, including genetic engineering and nanotechnology, could enable the end of suffering in all sentient life.Lifeboat Foundation Bios: David Pearce In the short term, Pearce argues, well-being can be helped by designer drugs, especially since safer mood-brighteners are becoming more readily available.Humanity+ Transhumanism Resources In the long-term, however, suffering could be abolished by genetic engineering through biotechnology.

==Transhumanism==

In 1998, Pearce co-founded Humanity+, the international transhumanism association, with fellow philosopher Nick Bostrom, now the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University.[tpl]cite web|title=Humanity+ FAQ #45|url=http://humanityplus.org/learn/transhumanist-faq/#answer_45[/tpl] The association, then known as the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), is a nonprofit organization that advocates transhumanism — an international cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.[tpl]cite journal| last=Bostrom | first=Nick | authorlink = Nick Bostrom |title = A history of transhumanist thought|journal = Journal of Evolution and Technology |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/history.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]
Pearce's ideas have inspired a strain of transhumanism based on paradise engineering. Pearce is  vegan, and the increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed to his influence.[tpl]cite book|last=Fairlie|first=Simon|title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2010||pages=230-1|isbn=1603583254[/tpl]

==Quotes==

 "The Hedonistic Imperative outlines how genetic engineering and nanotechnology will abolish suffering in all sentient life. This project is ambitious but technically feasible. It is also instrumentally rational and ethically mandatory. The metabolic pathways of pain and malaise evolved only because they once served the fitness of our genes. They will be replaced by a different sort of neural architecture. States of sublime well-being are destined to become the genetically pre-programmed norm of mental health. The world's last aversive experience will be a precisely dateable event."Philosophical "-Isms" - Philosophy Research Base - erraticimpact.com
