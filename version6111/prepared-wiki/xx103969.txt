Epsilon Geminorum (ε Gem, ε Geminorum) is a star in the constellation of Gemini.  It has the traditional name Mebsuta (also Melboula or Melucta). Epsilon Geminorum is located on the outstretched right "leg" of the twin Castor. The apparent visual magnitude of +3.06 makes it one of the brighter stars in this constellation.
The distance to this star can be determined directly using parallax measurements, yielding a value of [tpl]Convert|840|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl], although this result has a relatively large margin of error of [tpl]Convert|40|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off[/tpl]. Because Epsilon Geminorum is located near the ecliptic it can be occulted by the Moon or a planet. Just such an occultation  took place on April 8, 1976 by Mars, which allowed the oblateness of the planet's outer atmosphere to be measured. Prior to that, the star was occulted by Mercury on June 10, 1940.

==Properties==

The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G8 Ib, where the luminosity class of Ib indicates this is a lower luminosity supergiant star. Alternatively, it may be a star that has passed through the asymptotic giant branch stage and possesses a detached shell of dust. The estimated mass of this star is over 19 times the mass of the Sun, and it has expanded to a radius measured at around 105–175 times that of the Sun. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
Epsilon Geminorum is radiating around 8,500 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,662 K. It is this temperature that gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. A surface magnetic field with a strength of [tpl]nowrap|–0.14 ± 0.19 G[/tpl] has been detected on this star. This topologically complex field is most likely generated by a dynamo formed from the deep convection zone in the star's outer envelope.

==In culture==

The name Mebsuta has its roots in ancient Arabic, where it and the star Mekbuda (Zeta Geminorum) were the paws of a lion. Mebsuta (Mabsūṭah مبسوطة) comes from a phrase referring to the outstretched paw.
