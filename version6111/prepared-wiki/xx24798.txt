==Early life and career==

Miller was born on a farm in Clarinda, Iowa, to Lewis Elmer Miller and Mattie Lou (née Cavender). He attended grade school in North Platte in western Nebraska. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri. Around this time, Miller had finally made enough money from milking cows to buy his first trombone and played in the town orchestra. Originally, Miller played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916.Yanow, Scott. Classic Jazz. San Francisco: Backbeat, 2001. Print. In 1918, the Miller family moved again, this time to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. In the fall of 1919, he joined the high school football team, Maroons, which won the Northern Colorado Football Conference in 1920. He was named the Best Left End in Colorado.http://www.cityoffortmorgan.com/index.aspx?NID=242 Fort Morgan Colorado During his senior year, Miller became very interested in a new style of music called "dance band music." He was so taken with it that he formed his own band with some classmates. By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glennmiller.org/history.html|title=Glenn Miller History|publisher=Glenn Miller Birthplace Society|accessdate=March 8, 2011[/tpl]
In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he joined Sigma Nu Fraternity,"Famous Sigma Nu's", Oregonstate.edu. Retrieved on July 29, 2011. but spent most of his time away from school, attending auditions and playing any gigs he could get, including with Boyd Senter's band in Denver. He dropped out of school after failing three out of five classes one semester, and decided to concentrate on making a career as a professional musician. He later studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed what became his signature theme, "Moonlight Serenade".[tpl]Wayback |date=20090219020019 |url=http://schillingersystem.com/whois.htm |title="Who Is Joseph Schillinger?"[/tpl], The Schillinger System.  In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. He also played for Victor Young, whose Los Angeles studio orchestra accompanied Judy Garland and Bing Crosby, allowing him to be mentored by other professional musicians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.music.us/biography/artist/491/glenn_miller.html |title=Glenn Miller Biography - Music Artist Band Biographies - Artists Bands Bio - FREE MP3 Downloads |publisher=Music.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18[/tpl] In the beginning, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. However, when Jack Teagarden joined the Pollack's band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. From then, he realized that, rather than being a trombonist, his future lay in writing music. He also had a songbook published in Chicago entitled Glenn Miller's 125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone by the Melrose Brothers in 1927.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] During his stint with Pollack, Miller wrote several musical arrangements of his own. He also co-wrote his first composition, "Room 1411", written with Benny Goodman and released as a Brunswick 78, 4013, credited to Benny Goodman's Boys."Benny Goodman's Boys", Red Hot Jazz.  In 1928, when the band arrived in New York City, he sent for and married his college sweetheart, Helen Burger. He was a member of Red Nichols's orchestra in 1930, and because of Nichols, Miller played in the pit bands of two Broadway shows, Strike Up the Band and Girl Crazy (where his bandmates included big band leaders Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa).
During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Miller managed to earn a living working as a freelance trombonist in several bands. On a March 21, 1928 Victor session, Miller played alongside Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra, directed by Nat Shilkret.Conner, D. Russell, and Warner W.

During this period, Miller arranged and played trombone on several significant Dorsey Brothers OKeh sessions including "The Spell of The Blues", "Let's Do It" and "My Kinda Love", all with Bing Crosby vocals.

In the early-to-mid-1930s, Miller also worked as a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers, first when they were a Brunswick studio group (under their own name and providing accompaniment for many of The Boswell Sisters sessions), and finally when they formed an ill-fated co-led touring and recording orchestra.Simon (1980), pp. 65–66. Miller composed the songs "Annie's Cousin Fanny",Simon (1980), p. 9."Annie's Cousin Fanny" was recorded for Decca and Brunswick, a total of three times. The Brunswick release is catalogued Brunswick 6938 and one of the Decca recordings is catalogued Decca 117-A. These recordings are from the summer of 1934. See the website "Dorsey Brothers Orchesta", RedHotJazz.com for more information about dates "Dese Dem Dose","Dese Dem Dose" was recorded February 6, 1935 and released on the Decca label. For more information and where the preceding sentence was taken from, see "Dorsey Brothers Orchesta", RedHotJazz.com "Harlem Chapel Chimes", and "Tomorrow's Another Day" for the Dorsey Brothers Band in 1934 and 1935. In 1935, he assembled an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble, developing the arrangement of lead clarinet over four saxophones that eventually became the sonic keynote of his own big band. Members of the Noble band included future bandleaders Claude Thornhill, Bud Freeman and Charlie Spivak.  Glenn Miller made his first movie appearance in the 1935 Paramount Pictures release The Big Broadcast of 1936 as a member of the Ray Noble Orchestra performing "Why Stars Come Out at Night".The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935) – Full cast and crew list., Internet Movie Database. The Big Broadcast of 1936 starred Bing Crosby, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Ethel Merman, Jack Oakie, and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and also featured other performances by Dorothy Dandridge and the Nicholas Brothers, who would appear with Miller again in two movies for Twentieth Century Fox in 1941 and 1942.
Glenn Miller compiled several musical arrangements and formed his first band in 1937. The band failed to distinguish itself from the many others of the era, and broke up after playing its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut on January 2, 1938.George Thomas Simon, Glenn Miller and His Orchestra, New York: Crowell, 1974, ISBN 978-0-690-00470-0, p. 105. Benny Goodman said in 1976, "In late 1937, before his band became popular, we were both playing in Dallas. Glenn was pretty dejected and came to see me. He asked, 'What do you do? How do you make it?' I said, 'I don't know, Glenn. You just stay with it.'"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tuxjunction.net/glennmiller.htm |title=Music in the Miller Mood|author=Spink, George[/tpl]

==Success from 1938 to 1942==

Discouraged, Miller returned to New York. He realized that he needed to develop a unique sound, and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonized within a single octave. George T. Simon discovered a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz for Glenn Miller. Miller hired Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. According to Simon, "Willie's tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound."Simon (1980), p. 122. With this new sound combination, Glenn Miller found a way to differentiate his band's style from the many bands that existed in the late thirties. Miller talked about his style in the May, 1939 issue of Metronome magazine. "You'll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal ... We're fortunate in that our style doesn't limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing clarinet most of the time, lets you know whose band you're listening to. And that's about all there is to it."[tpl]Cite book|title=Simon Says: The Sights and Sounds of the Swing Era|last=Simon |first=George T.|authorlink=George T.

==Critical reaction==

In 2004, Miller orchestra bassist Herman "Trigger" Alpert explained the band's success: "Miller had America's music pulse ... He knew what would please the listeners.""Glenn Miller: 'A Memorial, 1944–2004'", Big Band Library. Retrieved on July 29, 2011. Although Miller had massive popularity, many jazz critics of the time had misgivings. They believed that the band's endless rehearsals—and, according to critic Amy Lee in Metronome magazine, "letter-perfect playing"—diminished any feeling from performances.Simon (1980), p. 241. They also felt that Miller's brand of swing shifted popular music away from the "hot jazz" bands of Benny Goodman and Count Basie, and toward commercial novelty instrumentals and vocal numbers.For an example, see a mention in Time magazine from November 23, 1942. "U.S. jive epicures consider the jazz played by such famous name bands as Tommy Dorsey's or Glenn Miller's a low, commercial product.", Time, web: "Music: Jive for Epicures", Time. For years, even after Miller died, the Miller estate maintained an unfriendly stance toward critics that derided the band during Miller's lifetime.[tpl]Cite book|title=A Life In The Golden Age of Jazz: A Biography of Buddy De Franco |last=Zammarchi |first=Fabrice |authorlink=Fabrice Zammarchi |year=2005 |publisher=Parkside|location=Seattle|isbn=0-9617266-6-0|pages=232–234|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TFlmAAAACAAJ [/tpl] Miller was often criticized for being too commercial. His answer to the criticism was, "I don't want a jazz band".Albertson, Chris, Major Glenn Miller and the Army Air Force Band, 1943–1944, Bluebird/RCA, 1987. Liner notes.Another reference by Miller's friend George T. Simon, states "Miller resented critics who focused almost entirely on his band's jazz or lack of it. (Leonard Feather was a pet peeve)...." see Simon (1971),The Sights and Sounds of the Big Band Era, p. 275. Many modern jazz critics still harbor similar antipathy toward Miller.As recently as 1997 on a website administered by JazzTimes, Miller is listed as an example of an overrated jazz musician by Doug Ramsey.  "Miller was a businessman who discovered a popular formula from which he allowed little departure. A disproportionate ratio of nostalgia to substance keeps his music alive." see http://jazztimes.com/articles/24803-who-s-overrated-who-s-underrated for Ramsey's credentials see http://jazztimes.com/contributors/27-doug-ramsey[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/31/040531crmu_music|title=Stride and Swing: The Enduring Appeal of Fats Waller and Glenn Miller|work=The New Yorker|year=2004[/tpl]
Jazz critics Gunther SchullerAmong Gunther Schuller's credentials are Professor of Composition at Yale University, Artist in Residence at the University of Wisconsin Madison and former president of the New England Conservatory of Music. He is also the past recipient of the Pulitzer Prize. See Wisc.edu URL: Wisc-schuller. (1991) and Gary GiddinsGary Giddins is a New York based jazz and film critic who has written for the Village Voice and the New York Sun. He won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Visions of Jazz: The First Century. See "Biography", GaryGiddins.com. (2004) have separately defended the Miller orchestra for whatever deficiencies earlier critics have found. In an article written for The New Yorker in 2004, Gary Giddins says he feels that these early critics erred in denigrating Miller's music, and that the popular opinion of the time should hold greater sway. The article states: "Miller exuded little warmth on or off the bandstand, but once the band struck up its theme, audiences were done for: throats clutched, eyes softened. Can any other record match 'Moonlight Serenade' for its ability to induce a Pavlovian slaver in so many for so long?" Schuller, notes, "Miller sound was nevertheless very special and able to penetrate our collective awareness that few other sounds have..."Schuller, pp. 662, 670, 677. He compares it partially to "Japanese Gagaku and Hindu music" in its purity. Schuller and Giddins do not take completely uncritical approaches to Miller. Schuller says that Ray Eberle's "lumpy, sexless vocalizing dragged down many an otherwise passable performance." However finally Schuller notes: "How much further Miller's musical and financial ambitions might have carried him must forever remain conjectural. That it would have been significant, whatever form(s) it might have taken, is not unlikely."

==Reaction from musical peers==

Louis Armstrong thought enough of Miller to carry around his recordings, transferred to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour.  "Armstrong liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky."Armstrong, Louis. "Reel to Reel." The Paris Review. Spring 2008: 63. Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: "with Shearing's locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller's saxophone section) in the middle the quintet's harmonies."Zwerin, Mike.

And coming at the end of the frenetic bebop era, the timing seemed to be right.'" Frank Sinatra and Mel Tormé held the orchestra in high regard. Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and song-writing career in the 1940s. Mel Tormé met Glenn Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé's father and Ben Pollack. Tormé and Miller discussed "That Old Black Magic" which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because "all good lyric writers are great readers."[tpl]Cite book|title=It Wasn't All Velvet |last=Torme |first=Mel|authorlink=Mel Tormé|year=1988 |publisher=Penguin|location=New York |isbn=0-86051-571-0|pages=42–44|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7eeuPQAACAAJ&dq=mel+torme+it+wasn%27t+all+velvet [/tpl] In an interview with George T.
