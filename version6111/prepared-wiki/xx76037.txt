The Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus) is a small hawk of the genus Buteo. During the summer some subspecies are distributed over eastern North America, as far west as British Columbia and Texas; they then migrate south to winter in the neotropics from Mexico down to southern Brazil.[tpl]cite web|last=Lepage |first=D.|year= 2003|title= Broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus)|work=Avibase|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?lang=EN&avibaseid=79F3C681417F2056[/tpl] Other subspecies are all-year residents on Caribbean islands.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged Hawks' wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered, somewhat pointed appearance. There are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. Although the Broad-winged Hawk's numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation.

==Description==

The Broad-winged Hawk is a relatively small Buteo, with a body size from [tpl]convert|32|to|44|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and weighing anywhere from [tpl]convert|265|to|560|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl]. The tail is relatively short, measuring [tpl]convert|14.5|-|19|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. The tarsus measures from [tpl]convert|5.6|to|6.6|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].Broad-winged Hawk, Life History, All About Birds.  Cornell Lab of OrnithologyRaptors of the World by Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead & Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001), ISBN 978-0-618-12762-7 As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males.[tpl]cite journal|last=Safina|first=C.|title=Selection for reduced male size in raptorial birds: the possible roles of female choice and mate guarding|journal=Oikos|volume=43|issue=2|pages=159–164|year=1984|doi=10.2307/3544764[/tpl] Broad-winged Hawks have relatively short and broad wings, pointed at the end, which have a tapered appearance unique to the species. The wingspan can range from [tpl]convert|74|to|100|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], with the extended wing bone (standard measurement) measuring [tpl]convert|22.7|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Adults' bodies are a dark brown with a white belly and chest containing horizontal barring. Their tail can be a dark grey-black with white lines along the middle, base and tip. The young hawks have a slightly different colouring with more white and longitudinal barring instead of horizontal barring. There are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. The light morph of this bird is most likely to be confused with the Red-shouldered Hawk, but they have a longer, more heavily barred tail and wings with a solid rufous color in the adult which are usually distinctive. Rare dark morphs are a darker brown on both upperparts and underparts. Dark-morph Short-tailed Hawks are similar but are whitish under the tail with a single subterminal band.

==Taxonomy==

This species, Buteo platypterus, is in the family Accipitridae, which is placed in the order Falconiformes (or Accipitriformes). Currently the species is split up into six subspecies; each is named for its distribution,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] as listed below:[tpl]cite web|publisher=Global Raptor Information Network|date=5 August 2010|accessdate=5 October 2011|title= Species account: Broad-winged Hawk Buteo platypterus|url=http://www.globalraptors.org/grin/SpeciesResults.asp?specID=8118[/tpl]

==Habitat and distribution==

Broad-winged Hawks have a wide range in North America and South America, from southern Canada to southern Brazil. Their breeding range is in the northern and eastern parts of North America and some, not all, migrate in the winter to Florida, southern Mexico and northern South America.[tpl]cite book|last1=Stiles|first1=F. G.|last2=Skutch|first2=A. F.|title=A Guide to the Birds of Costa Rica|year=1990|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9600-4[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first=Steven L.|last=Hilty|title=Birds of Venezuela| isbn= 978-0-7136-6418-8|publisher=Christopher Helm|year=2003|edition=2nd.[/tpl] There are five subspecies that are endemic to the Caribbean that do not migrate. Thus, Broad-winged Hawks are partial migrants.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Those subspecies that do migrate will fly in flocks of more than forty up to hundreds of thousands at heights anywhere from [tpl]convert|550|m|ft[/tpl] to approximately [tpl]convert|1300|m|ft[/tpl]. They soar using thermals to carry them through their journey of [tpl]convert|3000|-|6000|km|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gauthreaux|first1=S. A., Jr.|last2=Kerlinger|first2=P.|title=Seasonal timing, geographic distribution, and flight behaviour of Broad-winged Hawks during spring migration in South Texas: a radar and visual study|journal=The Auk|volume=102|issue=4|pages=735–743|year=1985|url = http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v102n04/p0735-p0743.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Fall migration lasts for 70 days as birds migrate about [tpl]convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] per day from North America, through Central America to South America without crossing salt water.[tpl]cite journal|last1 = Haines|first1 = Aaron M.|last2 = McGrady|first2 = Mike J.|last3 = Martell|first3 = Mark S.|last4 = Dayton|first4 = B.

Broad-winged Hawks stay in areas up to an elevation of about [tpl]convert|2000|m|ft[/tpl]. They breed in deciduous forests good for nesting and forage primarily in wetlands and meadows. While some birds have acclimatized themselves to living near humans even those birds avoid human settlements and interactions. In the winter the migrating subspecies of the hawks seek out similar conditions to their overwintering home, so they settle in deciduous and mixed forests.Ivory, A. and Kirschbaum, K. 1999.

Although the Broad-winged Hawk's numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation. Since there are no threats to its survival, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Behaviour==

===Vocalization===

These hawks use vocalizations for communication with their mates and offspring. Also in territorial displays towards intruders like the Red-tailed Hawks or other threatening animals. The call sounds like a very high pitched kee-ee, almost like a whistle. When confronted with a threat Broad-winged Hawks will emit an alarm call consisting of stuttered and squealing whistles.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Diet===

Broad-winged Hawks are carnivores. The types of food they eat depends on the time of year. During the summer or nesting season the parents and ultimately their chicks will eat small mammals, such as chipmunks, shrews, and voles, frogs, lizards, and sometimes even other nesting birds.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fitch|first=H. S.|title=Observations of the food and nesting of the Broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) in northeastern Kansas|journal=Condor|volume=76|issue=3|pages=331–333|year=1974|doi=10.2307/1366347|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v076n03/p0331-p0333.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] In the winter months Broad-winged Hawks have been observed feeding on insects, frogs, snakes, crabs, and some small mammals. To catch their prey Broad-winged Hawks will watch from low branches hiding in the foliage until a target is spotted. From their roost they will do a short fast glide to capture the prey. They give special attention to preparing their food for consumption, skinning frogs and snakes and plucking prey birds' feathers. Most small mammals on the other hand will be eaten whole. They rarely drink water and are able to survive solely with the water present in their prey.[tpl]verify credibility|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Reproduction===

These birds will have only one mate during the breeding season, possibly because the male also helps a small amount with the rearing of the chicks.[tpl]cite journal|last=Matray|first=F. P.|title=Broad-winged Hawk Nesting and Ecology|journal=The Auk|volume=91|issue=2|pages=307–324|year=1974|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v091n02/p0307-p0324.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] They will breed between April and August starting when they reach sexual maturity at about two years old.
To attract and court females, the males will perform a courtship display flight including cartwheels, dives, and other aerial acrobatics. Birds meet in the air, hook their feet together and spiral down together.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arndt|first=J. E.|title=Cartwheeling Behaviour in the Broad-winged Hawk, Buteo platypterus|journal=The Canadian Field Naturalist|volume=109|issue=1|pages=119–120|year=1995|url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/35456963[/tpl] They will also compete and fight with other males for the chance to mate with a female. If one of the males is successful, the mating pair will have only one brood that season consisting of one to four eggs.
Both the male and female will build the nest out of sticks and twigs in a deciduous tree before the eggs are to be laid. Once they are though, the brown-spotted eggs are usually [tpl]convert|49|x|39|mm|in[/tpl] and weigh about [tpl]convert|42|g|oz[/tpl]. The female will then develop a brood patch and incubate the eggs for 28 days or longer before they hatch.
The hatchlings will appear semi-altricial; incapable of any complex coordination but have open eyes and are covered in down feathers.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Lyons|first1=D. M.|last2=Mosher|first2=J. A.|title=Morphological growth, behavioural development and parental care of Broad-winged hawks|journal=Journal of field ornithology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=334–344|year=1987|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v058n03/p0334-p0344.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Chicks will have rapid body growth until they are almost at adult body size at which time they are capable of walking, flying and eating without parental help. While in the nest the female gives most of the parental care, protecting and taking care of the chicks. It is not unusual to have the male provide some food for the female and offspring but his visits are short lived.
Once a prey item is obtained for the nest, the female will tear off pieces and will feed the chicks until they are able to rip meat off on their own. Often the chicks will fight for possession of the offered morsel, the younger ones usually losing and not getting enough.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mueller|first=H. C.|title=The relationship of hunger to predatory behaviour in hawks (Falco sparverius and Buteo platypterus)|journal=Animal behaviour|volume=21|pages=513–520|year=1973|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(73)80011-9|issue=3[/tpl]
Broad-winged Hawks will protect their nests in a show of aggression (i.e. diving and chasing) towards any suspected threat but they generally will not make physical contact.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=P. L.|last2=Morrison|first2=J. L.|last3=Terry|first3=M.|title=Potential factors influencing nest defense in diurnal North American raptors|journal=Journal of Raptor Research|volume=40|issue=2|pages=98–110|year=2006|doi=10.3356/0892-1016(2006)4098:PFINDI2.0.CO;2|editor1-last=Belthoff|editor1-first=James R.|issn=0892-1016[/tpl] Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, crows, porcupines and American Black Bears. Adults have been known to fall to Red-tailed Hawks, Great Horned Owls, Bald Eagles, and Golden Eagles.[tpl]cite web|last=Goodrich|first= L. J.|first2=S. C. |last2=Crocoll |first3= S.

Some young, even after that time, will remain in the area of the nest for several weeks more.[tpl]verify credibility|date=October 2011[/tpl]
