Theognostus (Greek: ΘΕΟΓΚΝΟΣΤΟΥΣ; Latin: Teognostus; ca. 210 - 270) was a late 3rd century Alexandrian theologian.George Thomas Stokes, 'Theognostus', in Wace (ed), A Dictionary of Christian Biography, (Hendrickson), p. 1864. He is known from quotes by Athanasius[ref]
Athanasius, 'Letter 4 to Serapus', in De Decretis Synodi Nicæni (In Defence of the Nicene Synod).[/ref] and Photios I of Constantinople. Philip of Side says that he presided over the school of Alexandria after Pierius (AD 265).Henry Dodwell, dissertation on Irenaeus, page 488.  Although a disciple of Origen of Alexandria no reference of him can be found by Eusebius or Jerome. The main textual point of reference is derived from Athanasius.

==Works==

He wrote a seven-volume work called Hypotyposes, extant at the time of Photius' quotation. Some of the more notable quotations of book two appear Arian;
the Son is spoken of as a creature, which is to say a created being.
In book three his references to the Spirit are unorthodox and reminiscent of Origen. In book five he spoke of angels and devils as embodied.
In books six and seven he treated the Incarnation in a more orthodox manner than book two, and Athanasius regarded him as a useful witness against Arianism. Under the influence of Origen of Alexandria Theognostus expounded on the trinity, divine redemption and the afterlife.  His work was very much in line with the Christian Hellenistic philosophy prevalent within the school of Alexandria at the time.    
Much of his theology would later be adopted by Gregory of Nyssa.Ante-Nicene Fathers;  Philip Schaff, VIII The fragments of Theognostus are collected in Martin Joseph Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae 3:407–422. Translations into English can be found in the Ante-Nicene Fathers (available at WikiSource). Most of the 2nd book was later published in 1902 by Franz Diekamp.
