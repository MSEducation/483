KROQ-FM (106.7 FM) — branded 106.7 KROQ — is a commercial modern rock radio station licensed to Pasadena, California serving the Greater Los Angeles area. The call sign is pronounced "kay rock." It is the flagship station of Loveline hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky, and The Kevin and Bean Morning Show. The station has studios at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles, and the transmitter is based in the Verdugo Mountains.

==History==

===KPPC===

Originally, 106.7 FM was KPPC-FM, owned by the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. They broadcast religious programming with a co-owned AM station. As the church encountered difficulties operating the stations, they sold the two stations to an outside company, Crosby-Avery Broadcasting, with the church retaining the right to broadcast its services over both stations. Until 1969, the station still broadcast from the basement of the church.
In 1967, Tom and Raechel Donahue created a freeform progressive rock format at co-owned KMPX in San Francisco.[tpl]cite book|last=Douglas|first=Susan Jeanne|title=Listening in: radio and the American imagination, from Amos 'n' Andy and Edward R. Murrow to Wolfman Jack and Howard Stern|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ty4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=1 April 1999|publisher=Times Books|isbn=978-0-8129-2546-3|page=270[/tpl] KMPX became a big success, and in 1968, the Donahues were sent to Pasadena to introduce the format to the ailing KPPC-FM.
The following year, after a few bounced paychecks, dress code regulations, and other rules changes, The Donahues and the disc jockeys at both KMPX and KPPC walked out on the stations in what was called by some at the time as "The Great Hippie Strike." The former KMPX and KPPC staffers were later hired at Metromedia-owned KSAN in San Francisco and KMET in Los Angeles. KPPC hired new staffers and kept the freeform format, though they floundered for several years following the strike. In 1969, the two stations were sold to the National Science Network.[tpl]cite book|title=Billboard|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=12 August 1972|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=27|id=[tpl]ISSN|00062510[/tpl][/tpl]
In April 1970, the studios were moved out of the church basement. In September of that year, the FM transmitter was moved to Flint Peak, a mountaintop adjacent to Pasadena, and the station's power was significantly upgraded.

===KROQ AM and KROQ-FM===

Country music station KBBQ (1500 AM) in Burbank became KROQ in September 1972, changing its format to Top-40 and hiring established disc jockeys from other stations.Historic Los Angeles Hilltops The new KROQ called itself the "ROQ of Los Angeles". In 1973 KROQ's owners bought the struggling KPPC-FM from National Science Network, which was forced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to sell their stations due to compliance issues, changed the calls to KROQ-FM and hired Shadoe Stevens to create a new rock format described as high energy "all-cutting-edge-rock-all-the-time" and began simulcasting as "The ROQs of L.A.: Mother Rock!" (KPPC (AM) was sold to Universal Broadcasting, and remained on the air with its limited-schedule of Wednesday evening and Sunday operation until subsequent owners took the station — by then, KBLV — off the air permanently in 1996.)
The two stations were wildly successful initially with the new format, but poor money management by the general managers resulted in more bounced paychecks, and in 1974, Shadoe quit and the entire staff walked out, shutting the stations down. In 1976, the FCC ordered KROQ to return to the airwaves or surrender the stations' licenses.[tpl]cite book|title=Broadcasting|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wOJDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=January 1982|publisher=Broadcasting Publications.|page=102[/tpl] With barebones equipment, KROQ returned to the airwaves, broadcasting initially from the transmitter location, followed by a penthouse suite in the Pasadena Hilton Hotel, then across the street from the Hilton (117 S. Los Robles). At that time, Shadoe Stevens was re-hired as a programming consultant and air personality with others like Los Angeles radio legends "The Obscene" Steven Clean and Frazer Smith. At this time Rodney Bingenheimer also joined the station introducing many new and local bands, including The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and The Runaways on his Sunday night show.
The management of KROQ once again had problems maintaining payroll, and the staffers again quit, taking all of the station's records with them. Bingenheimer was the only one who stayed. KROQ scrambled to find new air personalities. One of the new on-air talents was Jed Gould, aka Jed the Fish, who was with the station from 1978 until late 2012. Around this time, the owners pared down to one station when they sold the weak-signalled KROQ AM, which switched to an ethnic format briefly, then went off the air in 1986 when the new owners lost their lease on the property where the transmitting towers were located. 
By 1978, new wave and punk rock were becoming increasingly popular, and KROQ started adding more of it to their freeform format. Shadoe Stevens once again left the station and Rick Carroll took over as program director in late 1979 and took the new music and combined it with a Top 40 formatic structure.[tpl]cite book|title=Los Angeles Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0l0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=November 2001|publisher=Emmis Communications|pages=90–|id=[tpl]ISSN|15229149[/tpl][/tpl] Subsequently, KROQ became an even greater success. The "Rock of the Eighties" was born. 
The station still mixed the new music of the Talking Heads and Blondie with established artists such as The Rolling Stones, AC/DC and Lynyrd Skynyrd, but by 1982, the station was full-fledged modern rock.
The station's proximity to Hollywood and the Los Angeles punk rock scene gave it a unique place in the development of the new wave and alternative rock genres, and KROQ quickly became one of the most influential radio stations in broadcast history, particularly when Carroll, as a consultant, took the "Rock of the 80s" format to other stations, including 91X in San Diego, KMGN FM in Bakersfield, California, KYYX in Seattle and The Quake in San Francisco.
In 1986, KROQ was purchased at a then record $45 million by Infinity Broadcasting,[tpl]cite news|last=Himmelsbach|first=Erik|title=The alternative revolution|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/image/la-et-125kroq3dec03,0,103491.story|accessdate=April 8, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 3, 2006[/tpl] which merged with CBS in 1997, and is now owned by CBS Radio.
KROQ helped to launch the careers of previously low-key Southern California bands The Offspring, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime, and No Doubt. They pride themselves on being "world famous" for their discovery of up-and-coming artists and are often the first station to promote new rock bands before their large-scale success.

==KROQ today==

Originally located at 117 S. Los Robles Ave. in Pasadena, the station moved to 3500 W. Olive Ave. in Burbank in 1987 as part of the purchase agreement and to be closer to the music industry. In 2002, the station was moved to a facility at 5901 Venice Boulevard in the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles.
Unlike most other (Class B, but with grandfathered greater than B facilities) FM stations in Los Angeles whose transmitters are atop Mount Wilson, KROQ's (Class B) transmitter is located on Tongva Peak (which replaced Flint Peak in Glendale at an altitude of 2500 ft), which results in somewhat weaker signal coverage.
In 2004, KROQ began broadcasting in HD Radio for a higher quality broadcast. On February 20, 2006, KROQ added streaming music from the radio station to its website. On June 9, 2006, KROQ launched an HD sub-carrier, KROQ HD-2, which airs new wave and alternative tracks from the 1980s which were popular during KROQ's 80's heyday (and is also branded "KROQ 2: Roq of the 80s"). This somewhat justified the dropping of the long-running Flashback Lunch, until then nearly the sole remnant of the new wave and '90s modern rock days.
In February 2010, CBS Radio, which controls the live stream, blocked access for listeners outside of the United States. Ironically, the station still uses the "World Famous KROQ" slogan to this day. 
Steve Jones, from Indie 103.1, began a Sunday night show in 2010, called "Jonesy's Jukebox" that runs from 7-9PM.[tpl]cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|title=Steve Jones and "Jonesy's Jukebox" to return to the LA airwaves -- via KROQ|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/10/steve-jones-and-jonesys-jukebox-to-return-to-the-la-airwaves-via-kroq.html|accessdate=October 29, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 6, 2010[/tpl]
