==Professional career==

Giancarlo began his professional gaming career in early 2005, when he made his international debut at the global
finals in South Korea for the World e-Sports Games, alongside the new Swedish team of Begrip Gaming. 
There, Begrip defeated all opponents, including the defending champions Catch-Gamers and won the prize pot
of 50,000 USD.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]  Following this victory, Giancarlo dropped out of high school to concentrate on his 
Call Of Duty career. In 2009, Giancarlo was nominated for the eSports Award 2009, under the categories 
for "Newcomer of the Year" and "Best Call Of Duty Player".[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]  In early 2006, Giancarlo left Begrip alongside his 
teammate Kristoffer Nordlund, (known also as "Tentpole), and signed a contract with Fnatic and became a permanent 
member of the team. Giancarlo's first year in Fnatic proved to be successful, having the team earn upwards of 100,000 USD,
which was acknowledged by Turtle Entertainment.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]  During 2006, Fnatic won the Cyberathlete Professional League Championship, 
the World Tour, along with a silver medal at the Electronic Sports World Cup. Giancarlo was once again nominated 
for the eSports Award and won the Call Of Duty Player of the Year Award. However, Fnatic faced a major
slump from 2007 through 2008, as the team failed to win any major tournaments and only achieved a handful 
of medals. The team regained its form and chemistry in 2009, however, with the retirement of Oscar 
"Archi" Torgersen and Oscar "ins" Holm and the recruitment of Christopher "GeT_RiGhT" Alesund and Rasmus "GuX" Ståhl.
During 2009, Fnatic was the single most-dominant team, having garnered gold medal victories at the Intel Extreme Masters Global Challenge, European Finals and World Championship, ESWC 2009, e-Stars Seoul, KODE5 
and World eSports Masters. In 2009, Giancarlo was nominated for the eSports Award 2009, under the category of 
"Regional eSports Player of the Year Northern Europe", but lost to his teammate Alesund, who won the main 
category for eSports Player of the Year. Fnatic could not repeat its success from 2009 in the 2010 season, 
however, as the team found itself at odds with the Ukrainians from Natus Vincere- the single most-dominant 
team in the history of the professional Counter-Strike scene, with their winnings being upward of 220,000 USD. 
Following this underwhelming year, Giancarlo, along with his teammates Alesun and Ståhl, attempted to have 
Fnatic replace the team's in-game leader, Patrik "cArn" Sättermon, as well as its captain, Harley "dsn" Örwall, 
with SK Gaming's Jimmy "allen" Allén and Robert "RobbaN" Dahlström. This was, however, not approved, 
so Giancarlo and Alesund left Fnatic and joined SK Gaming. Early 2011 proved to be slow for SK, as they 
failed to impress at their first event, IEM European 
Championship Finals, being unable to surpass the group stage, while Gianky's previous team won the event 
themselves. SK Gaming managed to regain their form, however, and finished as the second highest-earning
team of 2011, behind the Polish team of ESC Gaming. On July 26, 2012, it was reported that SK Gaming had 
gone into a state of disarray, with the head coach, Anton Budak, resigning from the organization, along with Patrik 
Giancarlo and his teammates Robert Dahlström and Christopher Alesund. According to Budak, this came as a result of SK
refusing to send the players to GameGune 2012. The following August, it was announced that Giancarlo would be making 
a transition joining the team Ninjas in Pyjamas, which included Alesund in its roster.
