CATEGORIES: Districts of Prague

Prague 1, formally the Prague 1 Municipal District (Městská část Praha 1), is a second-tier municipality in Prague. It is co-extensive with the national administrative district (správní obvod) of the same name.
Prague 1 includes most of the medieval heart of the city. All of Staré Město (the Old Town) and Josefov (the Jewish Quarter) are in the district, as are most of Malá Strana (the Little Quarter), Hradčany and Nové Město (the New Town). Tiny parts of Holešovice and Vinohrady round out the district. The district has remained intact since its creation in 1960.
Most of Prague 1 is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Almost all of Prague's major tourist sites, including Prague Castle, Old Town Square, the Charles Bridge and the above-mentioned Jewish Quarter, are in the district. The Parliament of the Czech Republic and the offices of the government are in Malá Strana, while the main building of Charles University is in Staré Město.
As of the end of 2004, 32,552 people lived in 18,821 homes in the district. The district covers 5.53 km² (1,366 acres).
A Prague 1 address is considered quite prestigious, and real estate here is the most expensive in the city.
Filip Dvořák of the Civic Democratic Party is the current mayor of Prague 1. He was elected in 2009 to replace former mayor Petr Hejma.
