[[Black operation]]

CATEGORIES: Secret government programs

A black operation or black op is a covert operation by a government, a government agency, or a military organization. This can include activities by private companies or groups. Key features of a black operation are that it is clandestine, it has negative overtones, and it is not attributable to the organization carrying it out.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith, Jr.|first=W.

Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., Inc. 1974, p. 267. "There are three classifications into which the intelligence community officially divides clandestine broadcast stations. A black operation is one in which there is a major element of deception."Djang, Chu, From Loss to Renewal: A Tale of Life Experience at Ninety, Authors Choice Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, p. 54. "(A black operation was) an operation in which the sources of propaganda were disguised or mispresented in one way or another so as not to be attributed to the people who really engineered it." 
A single such activity may be called a "black bag operation"; that term is primarily used for covert or  clandestine surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://intelnews.org/2008/12/16/04-11/|title=Tallinn government surveillance cameras reveal black bag operation|date=December 16, 2008|work=Intelnews|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] Such operations are known to have been carried out by the FBI,[tpl]cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2007/06/as_part_of_its_/|title=FBI to Boost ‘Black Bag’ Search Ops|last=Rood|first=Justin|date=June 15, 2007|work=ABC News|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] the Central Intelligence Agency,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.matthewaid.com/post/32043919336/the-cia-code-thief-who-came-in-from-the-cold|title=The CIA Code Thief Who Came in from the Cold|work=matthewald.com|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] Mossad, MI6 and the intelligence services of other nations.

==Etymology==

"Black" may be used as a generic term for any government activity that is hidden or secret. For example, some activities by military  and intel agencies are funded by a classified "black budget," of which the details, and sometimes even the total, are hidden from the public and from most congressional oversight.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_09/c3973050.htm|title=Dirty Secrets Of The "Black Budget"|date=February 27, 2006|work=Business Week|accessdate=June 12, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/pentagons-black-budget-tops-56-billion/|title=Pentagon’s Black Budget Tops $56 Billion|last=Shachtman|first=Noah|date=February 1, 2010|work=Wired|accessdate=June 12, 2012[/tpl]
