[[NTU method]]

CATEGORIES: Heat transfer

The Number of Transfer Units (NTU) Method is used to calculate the rate of heat transfer in heat exchangers (especially counter current exchangers) when there is insufficient information to calculate the Log-Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD). In heat exchanger analysis, if the fluid inlet and outlet temperatures are specified or can be determined by simple energy balance, the LMTD method can be used; but when these temperatures are not available The NTU or The Effectiveness method is used.
A quantity:
The effectiveness(E), is the ratio between the actual heat transfer rate and the maximum possible heat transfer rate:
where:
Effectiveness is dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. If we know E for a particular heat exchanger, and we know the inlet conditions of the two flow streams we can calculate the amount of heat being transferred between the fluids by:
For any heat exchanger it can be shown that:
For example, the effectiveness of a parallel flow heat exchanger is calculated with:
Or the effectiveness of a counter-current flow heat exchanger is calculated with:
Similar effectiveness relationships can be derived for concentric tube heat exchangers and shell and tube heat exchangers. These relationships are differentiated from one another depending on the type of the flow (counter-current, concurrent, or cross flow), the number of passes (in shell and tube exchangers) and whether a flow stream is mixed or unmixed.
