==History==

===Early history===

The original Saxon settlement of Swindon sat in a defensible position atop a limestone hill. It is referred to in the Domesday Book as Suindune, believed to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon words "swine" and "dun" meaning "pig hill" or possibly Sweyn's hill, where Sweyn is a personal name.
Swindon was a small market town, mainly for barter trade, until roughly 1848. This original market area is on top of the hill in central Swindon, now known as Old Town.John Chandler, Swindon Decoded, The Hobnob Press 2005, ISBN 0-946418-37-3.
The Industrial Revolution was responsible for an acceleration of Swindon's growth. It started with the construction of the Wilts and Berks Canal in 1810 and the North Wilts Canal in 1819. The canals brought trade to the area and Swindon's population started to grow.

===Railway town===

Between 1841 and 1842, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Swindon Works was built for the repair and maintenance of locomotives on the Great Western Railway (GWR).  The GWR built a small railway village to house some of its workers. The Steam Railway Museum and English Heritage, including the English Heritage Archive, now occupy part of the old works. In the village were the GWR Medical Fund Clinic at Park House and its hospital, both on Faringdon Road, and the 1892 health centre in Milton Road – which housed clinics, a pharmacy, laundries, baths, Turkish baths and swimming pools – was almost opposite.
From 1871, GWR workers had a small amount deducted from their weekly pay and put into a healthcare fund – its doctors could prescribe them or their family members free medicines or send them for medical treatment. In 1878 the fund began providing artificial limbs made by craftsmen from the carriage and wagon works, and nine years later opened its first dental surgery. In his first few months in post the dentist extracted more than 2000 teeth. From the opening in 1892 of the Health Centre, a doctor could also prescribe a haircut or even a bath. The cradle-to-grave extent of this service was later used as a blueprint for the NHS.‘’Background’’ – The Mechanics Institution Trust, Swindon. Retrieved on 23 July 2007.

The Mechanics' Institute, formed in 1844, moved into a building looking rather like a church and included a covered market, on 1 May 1855. The New Swindon Improvement Company, a co-operative, raised the funds for this path self-improvement and paid the GWR £40 a year for its new home on a site at the heart of the railway village. It was a groundbreaking organisation that transformed the railway's workforce into some of the country's best-educated manual workers.1850-1870 – The Mechanics Institution Trust, Swindon.

A former Institute secretary formed the New Swindon Co-operative Society in 1853 which, after a schism in the society's membership, spawned the New Swindon Industrial Society that ran a retail business from a stall in the market at the Institute. The Institute also nurtured pioneering trades unionists and encouraged local democracy.This is Our Heritage — 1996 lecture by Swindon labour movement historian Trevor Cockbill.

When tuberculosis hit the new town, the Mechanics' Institute persuaded the industrial pioneers of North Wiltshire to agree that the railway's former employees should continue to receive medical attention from the doctors of GWR Medical Society Fund, which the Institute had played a role in establishing and funding.Background – The Mechanics Institution Trust, Swindon.

Swindon's 'other' railway, the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway, merged with the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway to form the Midland & South Western Junction Railway, which set out to join the London & South Western Railway with the Midland Railway at Cheltenham. The Swindon, Marlborough & Andover had planned to tunnel under the hill on which Swindon's Old Town stands but the money ran out and the railway ran into Swindon Town railway station, off Devizes Road in the Old Town, skirting the new town to the west, intersecting with the GWR at Rushey Platt and heading north for Cirencester, Cheltenham and the LMS, whose 'Midland Red' livery the M&SWJR adopted.
During the second half of the 19th century, Swindon New Town grew around the main line between London and Bristol. In 1900, the original market town, Old Swindon, merged with its new neighbour at the bottom of the hill to become a single town.
On 1 July 1923, the GWR took over the largely single-track M&SWJR and the line northwards from Swindon Town was diverted to Swindon Junction station, leaving the Town station with only the line south to Andover and Salisbury.Swindon's Other Railway — the Swindon, Marlborough & Andover Railway.

During the first half of the 20th century, the railway works was the town's largest employer and one of the biggest in the country, employing more than 14,500 workers. Alfred WilliamsLeonard Clark, Alfred Williams – His Life and Work, David and Charles 1969 (1877–1930) wrote about his life as a hammerman at the works.Alfred Williams, Life in a railway factory, first published 1915, 2007 edition published by Sutton Publishing ISBN 978-0-7509-4660-5
The works' decline started in 1960, when it rolled out Evening Star, the last steam engine to be built in the UK.''Evening Star — Steam Locomotive, BBC, 29 November 2006. Retrieved on 21 July 2007. The works lost its locomotive building role and took on rolling stock maintenance for British Rail. In the late 1970s, much of the works closed and the rest followed in 1986.
The Community Centre in the Railway Village was originally the Barrack accommodation for Railway Employees of the GWR. The building became the Railway Museum in the 1960s, before this was moved to the newly completed STEAM Museum in the 2000s.

===Modern period===

David Murray John, Swindon's town clerk from 1938 to 1974, is seen as a pioneering figure in Swindon's post-war regeneration; his last act before retirement was to sign the contract for Swindon's tallest building, which is now named after him.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.swindonweb.com/?m=8&s=115&ss=462&c=1168&t=The%20David%20Murray%20John%20 |title=SwindonWeb – Brunel Tower David Murray John  |work=swindonweb.com  |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]

==Governance==

The local council was created in 1974 as the Borough of Thamesdown, out of Swindon Borough and Highworth Rural Councils. It was not initially called Swindon, because the borough covers a larger area than the town and encompasses villages and land. It was eventually renamed to Borough of Swindon in 1997, however. The borough became a unitary authority on 1 April 1997,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951774_en_1.htm |title=The Wiltshire (Borough of Thamesdown)(Structural Change) Order 1995 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] following a review by Local Government Commission for England. The town is therefore no longer under the auspices of Wiltshire Council.
The borough consists of parished and non-parished areas. Parished areas include Bishopstone and Hinton Parva, Blunsdon St Andrew, Castle Eaton, Chiseldon, Covingham, Hannington, Haydon Wick, Highworth, Inglesham, Liddington, South Marston, Stanton Fitzwarren, Stratton St Margaret, Wanborough and Wroughton. In 2015 Nythe will be granted its independence from Stratton St Margaret and become a new parish in its own right.
The executive comprises a leader and a cabinet made up from the Conservative Group. The council as of the 2011 election has a majority of Conservative councillors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/council/html/hx.stm |title="BBC News – Election 2011" (BBC News)accessed 6 May 2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl]
Swindon is represented in the national parliament by two MPs.  Robert Buckland (Conservative) was elected for the South Swindon seat in May 2010 with a 5.5% swing from Labour and Justin Tomlinson, also Conservative, represents North Swindon after a 10.1% swing at the same election. Prior to 1997, there was a single seat for Swindon, although much of what is now in Swindon was then in the Devizes seat.

==Geography==

The town has an area of approximately [tpl]convert|40|km²|0|abbr=out[/tpl].
Swindon has a temperate climate, with roughly equal length winters and summers. The landscape is dominated by the chalk hills of the Wiltshire Downs to the south and east. The hill that makes up what is known as Old Town consists of Purbeck and Portland stone; this was quarried from Roman times up until the 1950s.[tpl]cite book|author=Crittall, Elizabeth |coauthors=Rogers, Kenneth & Shrimpton, Colin|title=A history of Swindon to 1965|year=1983|publisher=Wiltshire Library & Museum Service|isbn=0-86080-107-1|chapter=Geology[/tpl] The area that was known as New Swindon is made up of mostly Kimmeridge clay with outcrops of Corrallian clay in the areas of Penhill and Pinehurst. Oxford clay makes up the rest of the borough. The River Ray forms the town's western boundary, including its tributary of the River Cole.

===Climate===

Swindon experiences a maritime climate type, as with all of the British Isles. This results in comparatively mild winters, and comparatively cool summers compared with what might otherwise be expected of its latitude. The nearest official weather station is RAF Lyneham, about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] west south west of Swindon town centre. The weather station's elevation is 145 metres, compared to the typical 100 metres encountered around Swindon town centre, so is likely to be marginally cooler throughout the year.
The absolute maximum is 34.9c (94.8f) recorded during August 1990. In an average year the warmest day should reach 28.7c (83.7f) and 10.3 days should register a temperature of 25.1c (77.2f) or above
The absolute minimum is −16.0c (3.0f), recorded in January 1982, and in an average year 45.2 nights of air frost can be expected.
Sunshine, at 1565 hours a year is typical for inland parts in much of Southern England, although significantly higher than most areas further north.
Annual rainfall averages slightly under [tpl]convert|720|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] per year with 123 days reporting over 1 mm of rain.

At the junction of two Roman roads, the town has developed over the centuries, with the assistance of the GWR and the canals, into a transport hub. It has two junctions (15 and 16) onto the M4 motorway and is on the ex-GWR main line to London.
Swindon railway station opened in 1842 as Swindon Junction, and, until 1895, every train stopped for at least 10 minutes to change locomotives. As a result, the station hosted the first recorded railway refreshment rooms.LTC Rolt, Isambard Kingdom Brumel, Penguin 1957.
Swindon bus operators are Thamesdown and Stagecoach. The local council acknowledges the need for more car parking as part of its vision for 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swindon.gov.uk/roadstransport/roadsandtransport-carparkinggeneral-link|title=Car Parking – General Information|accessdate=17 January 2007|publisher=Swindon Borough Council|work=Transport & Streets[/tpl] Swindon is one of the locations for an innovative scheme called Car share. It was set up as a joint venture between Wiltshire County Council and a private organisation which now has over 300,000 members registered. Despite the name, however, it is a carpool or ride-sharing rather than a car share scheme, seeking to link people willing to share transport.
The town contains a roundabout called Magic Roundabout. This is not one roundabout but five, the central point of which is a contra-rotational hubAerial view from Google maps at the junction of five roads: (clockwise from South) Drove Road, Fleming Way, County Road, Shrivenham Road and Queens Drive.

It was called Swindon Viewpoint, a community television project run mainly by enthusiasts from the basement of a Radio Rentals branch on Victoria Road. It was followed by the more commercial Swindon's Local Channel, which included pay-per-view films.Swindon Cable — Swindon View Point — The Local Channel, Swindoncable.co.uk.

===Higher education===

Swindon is the UK's largest centre of population without its own university (by comparison, there are two universities in nearby Bath, which is half Swindon's size). In March 2008, a proposal was put forward by former Swindon MP, Anne Snelgrove, for a university-level institution to be established in the town within a decade, culminating in a future 'University of Swindon' (with some touting the future institution to be entitled 'The Murray John University, Swindon', after the town's most distinguished post-war civic leader). In October 2008, plans were announced for a possible University of Swindon campus to be built in east Swindon to the south of the town's Great Western Hospital, close to the M4-A419 interchange. However, these plans are currently mothballed.
However, Oxford Brookes University has its Ferndale Campus in North-Central Swindon, containing its School of Health and Social Care since 1999.

==Sports==

===Football===

Swindon Town F.C. play at the County Ground near the town centre. They have been Football League members since joining the then new Third Division (southern section) in 1920, and won promotion to the Second Division for the first time in 1963. They won their only major trophy to date, the Football League Cup, in 1969 beating Arsenal 3-1, at Wembley Stadium, and won the Anglo-Italian Cup the following year as the Football Association forbade Swindon from competing in the European Cup because they were in Division 3. They won promotion to the First Division in 1990, but stayed in the Second Division due to financial irregularities, only to reach the top flight (by then the Premier League) three years later. Their spell in the top flight lasted just one season, and then came a second successive relegation. A brief spite saw them promoted at the first attempt as champions of the new Division Two, but they were relegated again four years later and in 2006 fell back into the fourth tier for the first time since 1986, although promotion was gained at the first attempt. They were relegated again four years later. Notable former players of the club include John Trollope, Don Rogers, John Moncur, Fraser Digby, Duncan Shearer, Paul Bodin, Alan McLoughlin, Paul Rideout, Mike Summerbee, Shaun Taylor, Jan Åge Fjørtoft and Phil King. Notable former managers include Lou Macari, Ossie Ardiles, Glenn Hoddle, John Gorman, Steve McMahon, Jimmy Quinn (a former player of the club), Colin Todd, Roy Evans, Andy King, Dennis Wise and Paul Sturrock. Under the charismatic reign of manager Paolo Di Canio, Swindon became League Two champions in 2011–12 and currently play in League One, the third-highest tier.
The town also has two non-league clubs: Swindon Supermarine F.C., playing in Southern League Division One South and West, and Highworth Town F.C., based in Highworth and playing in the Hellenic Football League.

===Motor sports===

==In popular culture==

Books set in Swindon include The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, and the Thursday Next novels by Jasper Fforde. Fforde's Thursday Next novels feature an alternative-universe Swindon that includes a parodic "Seven Wonders of Swindon". Robert Goddard's Into the Blue, Out of the Sun and "Never Go Back" feature the central character of Harry Barnett from Swindon, and all three novels start in the town. Terry Jones, the former Monty Python member gave Swindon a backhanded reference in one of the short stories in his 2011 collection, "Evil Machines".  The story "The Lift that Took People to Places They Didn't Want to Go" ends with the section "...But actually... the evil elevator hadn't changed at all.  In fact it went on secretly taking people to places they didn't want to go.  For every time the lift took the inhabitants of Swindon back down to the ground floor, they stepped out of the department store and onto the streets of Swindon, and so found themselves somewhere they didn't want to be."
