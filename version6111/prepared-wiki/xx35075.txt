==Building history==

When the old "West Gate" of the town was demolished in 1799, it was replaced with a hotel, and this in turn was replaced by the present building, designed by E.A. Lansdowne, in 1884. The proprietor of the Westgate Hotel at that time was Mr Samuel Dean."Did Newport have a Town Wall?" at newportpast.com

==Role in 1839 uprising==

On 4 November 1839 local politician and activist John Frost led a march of 3000 Chartists into the centre of Newport. Here he discovered several Chartists had been arrested and were held in the Westgate Hotel. Troops protecting the hotel opened fire on the marchers, killing over 20 people and wounding 50 more.John Frost: Leader of the Chartist Rebellion, BBC Wales southeast, last update August 2009.

==Recent developments==

In 1991 statues commemorating the 1839 Chartist uprising were installed on Commercial Street at the front of the Westgate Hotel. The hotel also featured in the now-destroyed Chartist Mural.
The building is a Grade II listed building, but is currently on the Buildings at Risk Register as substantially unoccupied and beginning to cause concern. The main staircase and richly decorated public rooms are amongst the best surviving examples of their period.[tpl]cite report |page=54 |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/report/cont033562.pdf |title=Register of Buildings at Risk |publisher=Newport City Council |date=June 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011[/tpl]
