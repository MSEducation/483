==Early career==

He taught social studies and coached basketball at several high schools in North Carolina. In 1984 he received a job as a graduate assistant coach for the men's basketball team at Clemson University.

He led the Falcons to a 181–91 record in his nine years as their coach, including one berth in the NAIA championship game.

In 1995 Lutz was named the head coach at Gardner–Webb University, but resigned two weeks after accepting the job in order to become an assistant coach at his alma mater under head coach Jeff Mullins. He served as an assistant under Mullins (1995–96) and his successor, Melvin Watkins (1996–98). When Watkins accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&M University, Lutz was promoted and became the eighth head coach of the Charlotte 49ers on April 9, 1998.
The 49ers enjoyed consistent success during Lutz's tenure, reaching the NCAA Tournament five times (1999, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005), plus three appearances in the NIT (2000, 2006 and 2008). In 2005 Lutz was a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award.
On February 23, 2008, Charlotte won at home over Saint Louis 81–64, giving Lutz 183 wins at Charlotte and the all-time mark for wins by a 49ers coach, passing Mullins' 182 wins accumulated between 1985 and 1996.
Lutz' 49ers were expected to contend for their first NCAA Tournament berth as an Atlantic 10 member in 2009-10.  With eight games to go in the season, they had a record of 18-5 and seemed well on their way to a bid.  However, they went 1-7 the rest of the way.  They bottomed out in the first round of the Atlantic 10 Tournament against UMass when they came out of a timeout with six men on the court.  The resulting technical foul derailed a last-ditch rally, and they lost the game.  After not even receiving an NIT bid, Lutz was fired on March 15, 2010.Charlotte 49ers fire Bobby Lutz as coach - ESPN He compiled a 218–158 record at UNC Charlotte,Charlotte endorses Lutz with five-year extension - Men's College Basketball - ESPNBobby Lutz hire gives Iowa State experience on bench - ESPN and is the school's winningest men's basketball coach.[tpl]cite news|last=Hobbs|first=Chris|title=49ers release Catawba County native from contract|url=http://www2.hickoryrecord.com/content/2010/mar/15/49ers-release-catawba-county-native-contract/sports-college/|newspaper=The Hickory Record|date=March 15, 2010[/tpl]  He then spent a season as an assistant coach with the Iowa State Cyclones under head coach Fred Hoiberg.
