[[List of Swedish noble families]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish noble families, Lists of families, Swedish nobility

This is a list of Swedish noble families, which are divided into two main groups:
The introduced nobility is divided into three ranks: Comital families, Baronial families and untitled noble families (in addition, members of the royal family hold ducal titles).
The unintroduced nobility consists of families of princely, ducal, marquis, comital, baronial, and untitled noble rank. This group notably includes several branches of the House of Bernadotte with foreign (princely and comital) noble titles (such as Count of Wisborg).
The vast majority of both introduced and unintroduced noble families are untitled.

==Introduced nobility==

The introduced noble families are listed in the Palace of the Nobility according to the official numbering system which roughly corresponds to the order of introduction. Lower numbers indicate older nobility. Higher numbers indicate later introduction, and usually means that the family belongs to the younger nobility, even though introduction may occasionally not have followed immediately upon ennoblement. In the case of families of Countly or Baronial status, higher numbers indicate that it was raised to a higher title at a later point in time. Branches of the same family may have been introduced under different numbers and may appear in more than one place in the list.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riddarhuset.se/jsp/admin/archive/sbdocarchive/atter_i_AK07_vapendatabasen.pdf |title=Ätter i vapendatabasen |language=Swedish |format=PDF |publisher=riddarhuset.se |accessdate=2009-03-07[/tpl]
