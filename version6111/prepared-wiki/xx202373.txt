Bromous acid is an acid with the formula HBrO2.  It has bromine in the +3  oxidation state. The salts of bromous acid are called bromites. The acid is not stable and only occurs as an intermediate; for example, in the oxidation of hypobromites.Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier ISBN 0-12-352651-5

==Chemistry==

Bromous acid can be produced by classical chemical or electrochemicals method via anodic oxidation.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Also disproportioning of hypobromous acid will give bromous acid and hydrobromic acid.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Lastly, a synproportion reaction of bromic acid and hydrobromic acid gives bromous acid.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2009[/tpl]

==Compounds==

Several bromites are stable and have been isolated. For example NaBrO2· 3H2O and Ba(BrO2)2·H2O.

==Use==

Bromites can be used for the reduction of permanganates to manganates.
