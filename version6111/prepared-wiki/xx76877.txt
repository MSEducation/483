The Rt Rev. Dr Charles Inglis (1734 â€“ 24 February 1816) was an Irish clergyman who was consecrated the first Church of England bishop of the Diocese of Nova Scotia.  He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church (Halifax).

==Life==

He was born in 1734, the son of Rev. Archibald Inglis, the rector of Glencolmcille, Donegal, Ireland.
After the abolition of the Scottish Episcopacy in 1689 he became rector of Killybegs, Donegal, but in 1755 he went to America and worked as a teacher. In 1758 he was ordained as a priest in London and spent several years in Delaware before moving to Trinity Church in New York in 1765.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ulster-scots.com/uploads/donegalbooklet2.pdf| title= Sons and Daughters of Donegal|accessdate = 3 October 2013[/tpl]
Following the British occupation of New York in 1777, Inglis was promoted from curate to rector of Trinity Church. As a Loyalist, it is recorded that Inglis prayed aloud for King George III while George Washington was in the congregation. The church was quickly surrounded by militia.[tpl]cite book |last=Hein |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors=Gardiner H.

On 11 August 1787, George III created the Diocese of Nova Scotia by Letters Patent, and named Inglis its first bishop.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=12910|startpage=373|date=7 August 1787|accessdate=2008-04-08[/tpl] The independence of the thirteen colonies which would form the United States had led to the creation of a new, autonomous, Anglican church there, with Samuel Seabury as the first bishop, but Inglis was the first Church of England bishop in North America, though technically his see was "the Province of Nova Scotia". Eager to increase the status of Anglicanism in the colonies, he supported the 1789 foundation of King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia, as an exclusive academy for sons of the Anglican elite. He also backed several missionary efforts to turn the majority of the population from their dissenting religious beliefs. These efforts were largely unsuccessful. Bishop Inglis died on 24 February 1816.
