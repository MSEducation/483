"Pátria" ("Fatherland") is the national anthem of East Timor. It was first used when East Timor unilaterally declared its independence from Portugal in 1975, shortly before the Indonesian invasion. It was officially adopted as the national anthem when East Timor finally regained its independence in 2002.
The music was composed by Afonso de Araujo, and the words were written by the poet Francisco Borja da Costa, who was killed on the day of the invasion. It is only sung in Portuguese, there is as yet no version in Tetum, the country's national and co-official language.
