Hyperdontia is the condition of having supernumerary teeth, or teeth that appear in addition to the regular number of teeth. They can appear in any area of the dental arch and can affect any dental organ. 

==Types==

Supernumerary teeth can be classified by shape and by position. The shapes include the following:
When classified by position, a supernumerary tooth may be referred to as a mesiodens, a paramolar, or a distomolar.
The most common supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which is a malformed, peg-like tooth that occurs between the maxillary central incisors.
Fourth and fifth molars that form behind the third molars are another kind of supernumerary teeth.

==Causes==

There is evidence of hereditary factors along with some evidence of environmental factors leading to this condition. Hyperdontia is rare in people with no other associated diseases or syndromes.[tpl]cite journal |authors=M.N. Pereira, L.E. de Almeida, M.T.

Dental X-rays are often used to diagnose hyperdontia.
It is suggested that supernumerary teeth develop from a second tooth bud arising from the dental lamina near the regular tooth bud or possibly from splitting the regular tooth bud itself. Supernumerary teeth in deciduous (baby) teeth are less common than in permanent teeth.

==Related conditions==

A similar condition is hypodontia, in which there are fewer than the usual number of teeth.
Hyperdontia is seen in a number of disorders, including Gardner's syndrome and cleidocranial dysostosis, where multiple supernumerary teeth are seen that are usually impacted.
