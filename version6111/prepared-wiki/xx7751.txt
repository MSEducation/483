The Economy of Burma (Myanmar) is an emerging economy with an estimated nominal GDP of $51.93 billion[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indexmundi.com/burma/gdp_%28official_exchange_rate%29.html |title=Burma |accessdate = 24 November 2012 |work=The World Factbook | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] and a purchasing power adjusted GDP of $83.74 billion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indexmundi.com/burma/gdp_%28purchasing_power_parity%29.html |title=Burma |accessdate = 24 November 2012 |work=The World Factbook | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] Real growth rate is estimated at 5.5% for the 2011 fiscal year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gfmag.com/gdp-data-country-reports/214-myanmar-gdp-country-report.html#axzz2DAG4kGX6 |title=Burma |accessdate =24 November 2012 |work=Myanmar Country Report | publisher=Global Finance[/tpl]
Historically, Burma was the main trade route between India and China since 100 BC. The Mon Kingdom of lower Burma served as important trading center in the Bay of Bengal. After Burma was conquered by British, it became the wealthiest country in Southeast Asia. It was also once the world's largest exporter of rice. It produced 75% of the world's teak and had a highly literate population.[tpl]cite book |last=Steinberg |first=David L. |date=February 2002 |title=Burma: The State of Myanmar |publisher=Georgetown University Press |id=ISBN[/tpl]
After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalization. The government also tried to implement a poorly thought out Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96%. The 1962 coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalize all industries.  The catastrophic program turned Burma into one of the world's most impoverished countries.
In 2011, when new President Thein Sein's government came to power, Burma embarked on a major policy of reforms including anti-corruption, currency exchange rate, foreign investment laws and taxation. Foreign investments increased from US$300 million in 2009-10 to a US$20 billion in 2010-11 by about 667%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taste-of-democracy-sends-burmas-fragile-economy-into-freefall-2357511.html | title=Taste of democracy sends Burma's fragile economy into freefall | publisher=The Independent | date=20 September 2011 | accessdate=25 September 2011 | author=Joseph Allchin[/tpl] Large inflow of capital results in stronger Burmese currency, kyat by about 25%.

==History==

===Pre-colonial era===

According to Michael Adas, Ian Brown, and other economic historians of Burma, Burma's pre-colonial economy in Burma was essentially a subsistence economy, with the majority of the population involved in rice production and other forms of agriculture.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Robert H.|title=The State in Myanmar|publisher=NUS Press|year=2009|pages=38–40|isbn=978-9971-69-466-1[/tpl] Burma also lacked a formal monetary system until the reign of King Mindon Min in the middle 19th century. Land was technically owned by the Burmese monarch.[tpl]cite book|last=Steinberg|first=David I.|title=Burma, the state of Myanmar|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2001|pages=125–127|isbn=978-0-87840-893-1[/tpl] Moreover, exports, along with oil wells, gem mining and teak production were controlled by the monarch. Burma was vitally involved in the Indian Ocean trade. Logged teak was a prized export that was used in European shipbuilding, because of its durability, and became the focal point of the Burmese export trade from the 1700s to the 1800s.[tpl]cite book|last=Goodman|first=Michael K.|title=Consuming space: placing consumption in perspective|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2010|pages=241|isbn=978-0-7546-7229-6[/tpl]

===Colonial era (1885 - 1948)===

During British occupation, Burma was the second wealthiest country in Southeast Asia after the Philippines. It was also once the world's largest exporter of rice. During British administration, Burma supplied oil through the Burmah Oil Company. Burma also had a wealth of natural and labor resources. It produced 75% of the world's teak and had a highly literate population. The country was believed to be on the fast track to development.

===Independence===

After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu attempted to make Burma a welfare state and adopted central planning. Rice exports fell by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96%. Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |accessdate=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San José State University[/tpl]  The 1962 coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalize all industries, with the exception of agriculture.

===Military rule (1988 - 2011)===

After 1988, the regime retreated from totalitarian socialism. It permitted modest expansion of the private sector, allowed some foreign investment, and received much needed foreign exchange.[tpl]cite book | author=Stephen Codrington | year=2005 | title=Planet geography | publisher =Solid Star Press | page =559 | isbn=0-9579819-3-7[/tpl] The economy is rated in 2009 as the least free in Asia (tied with North Korea).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/Burma|title=Index of Economic Freedom: Burma|year=2009[/tpl] All fundamental market institutions are suppressed.

Inflation averaged 30.1% between 2005 and 2007. Inflation is a serious problem for the economy. In April 2007, the National League for Democracy organized a two-day workshop on the economy. The workshop concluded that skyrocketing inflation was impeding economic growth. "Basic commodity prices have increased from 30% to 60% since the military regime promoted a salary increase for government workers in April 2006," said Soe Win, the moderator of the workshop. "Inflation is also correlated with corruption." Myint Thein, an NLD spokesperson, added: "Inflation is the critical source of the current economic crisis."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7064|title=High Inflation Impeding Burma's Economy, Says NLD |publisher=The Irrawaddy|date=30 April 2007|accessdate=30 April 2007[/tpl]
In recent years, both China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit. Many nations, including the United States and Canada, and the European Union, have imposed investment and trade sanctions on Burma. The United States banned all imports from Burma, though this restriction was since lifted. Foreign investment comes primarily from People's Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, India, and Thailand.[tpl]cite news | first =David | last =Fullbrook | url =http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FK04Ae03.html | title =So long US, hello China, India | publisher =Asia Times |date=4 November 2004 | accessdate =14 July 2006[/tpl]

===Economic liberalization (2011-present)===

In 2012, the Asian Development Bank formally began re-engaging with the country, to finance infrastructure and development projects in the country.
.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-01/adb-preparing-first-myanmar-projects-in-25-years-as-thein-opens.html|title=ADB Preparing First Myanmar Projects in 25 Years as Thein Opens|last=Yap|first=Karl Lester M.|date=1 March 2012|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] The $512 million loan is the first issued by the ADB to Myanmar in 30 years and will target banking services, ultimately leading to other major investments in road, energy, irrigation and education projects.
In March 2012, a draft foreign investment law emerged, the first in more than 2 decades. This law would oversee unprecedented liberalization of the economy. Foreigners will no longer require a local partner to start a business in the country, and will be able to legally lease land.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/16/us-myanmar-investment-idUSBRE82F0IY20120316|title=Exclusive: Myanmar drafts new foreign investment rules|last=Aung Hla Htun|date=16 March 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl] The draft law also stipulates that Burmese citizens must constitute at least 25% of the firm's skilled workforce, and with subsequent training, up to 50-75%. The draft includes a proposal to transform the Myanmar Investment Commission from a government-appointed body into an independent board. This could bring greater transparency to the process of issuing investment licenses, according to the proposed reforms drafted by experts and senior officials.
In a first ever countrywide study the Myanmar government found that 37 per cent of the nation’s population are unemployed and an average of 26 per cent live in poverty.

Myanmar on January 28 has announced deals with international lenders to cancel or refinance nearly $6 billion of its debt, almost 60 per cent of what it owes to foreign lenders. Japan wrote off US$ 3 Billion, nations in the group of Paris Club wrote off US$ 2.2 Billion and Norway wrote off US$ 534 Million.

==Industries==

The major agricultural produce is rice which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's rice fields, including 98% of the irrigated areas.[tpl]PDFlink|Myanmar and IRRI|21.2 KB[/tpl], Facts About Cooperation, International Rice Research Institute. Retrieved on 25 September 2007. In 2011, Myanmar's total milled rice production accounted for 10.26 million tons, an increase from the 1.8 per cent back in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://investvine.com/myanmar-rice-exports-could-double-by-2020/|title=Myanmar rice exports could double by 2020|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Inside Investor|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl]

The private sector dominates in agriculture, light industry, and transport activities, while the military government controls energy, heavy industry, and rice trade.

===Garment production===

In March 2012, 6 of Thailand's largest garment manufacturers announced that they would move production to Burma, principally to the Yangon area, citing lower labor costs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Six-top-garment-makers-fleeing-to-low-wage-Burma-30178149.html|title=Six top garment makers fleeing to low-wage Burma|last=Pratruangkrai|first=Petchanet|date=17 March 2012|work=The Nation|accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl]

===Gemstones===

The Union of Myanmar's rulers depend on sales of precious stones such as sapphires, pearls and jade to fund their regime. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Burma's "Valley of Rubies", the mountainous Mogok area, [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires.Gems of Burma and their Environmental Impact
In 2007, following the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Myanmar, human rights organizations, gem dealers, and US First Lady Laura Bush called for a boycott of a Myanmar gem auction held twice yearly, arguing that the sale of the stones profits the dictatorial regime in that country.CBC - Gem dealers push to ban Burmese rubies after bloody crackdown Debbie Stothard of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma stated that mining operators used drugs on employees to improve productivity, with needles shared, raising the risk of HIV infection: "These rubies are red with the blood of young people." Brian Leber (41-year-old jeweler who founded The Jewellers' Burma Relief Project) stated that: "For the time being, Burmese gems should not be something to be proud of. They should be an object of revulsion. It's the only country where one obtains really top quality rubies, but I stopped dealing in them. I don't want to be part of a nation's misery. If someone asks for a ruby now I show them a nice pink sapphire."Reuters, Move over, blood diamonds
Richard W. Hughes, author of Ruby and Sapphire, a Bangkok based gemologist who has made many trips to Burma makes the point that for every ruby sold through the junta, another gem that supports subsistence mining is smuggled over the Thai border.Burma Embargo & the Gem Trade Burma's gemstone industry is a cornerstone of the Burmese economy with exports topping $1 billion.http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/myanmars-jade-millionaires-fuel-property-surge-southeast-asia/548164
The permits for new gem mines in Mogoke, Mineshu and Nanyar state will be issued by the ministry according to a statement issued by the ministry on February 11. While many sanctions placed on the former regime were eased or lifted in 2012, the US has left restrictions on importing rubies and jade from Myanmar intact. According to recent amendments to the new Myanmar foreign investment law, there is no longer a minimum capital requirement for investments, except in mining ventures, which require substantial proof of capital and must be documented through a domestic bank. Another important clarification in the investment law is the dropping of foreign ownership restrictions in joint ventures, except in restricted sectors, such as mining, where FDI will be capped at 80 per cent.

===Tourism===

Since 1992, the government has encouraged tourism. Until 2008, fewer than 750,000 tourists entered the country annually,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/cit/006/0097/cit0060097.pdf |title=The Politics of Tourism in Myanmar |accessdate=17 October 2008|last=Henderson |format=PDF |first=Joan C. |publisher=Nanyang Technological University[/tpl] but there has been substantial growth over the past years. In 2012, 1.06 million tourists visited the country,Myanmar tourism statistics, http://www.myanmartourism.org/tourismstatistics.htm and 1.8 million are expected to visit by the end of 2013.
Tourism is thus a growing sector of the economy of Burma. Burma has diverse and varied tourist attractions and is served internationally by numerous airlines via direct flights. Domestic and foreign airlines also operate flights within the country. Cruise ships also dock at Yangon.  Overland entry with a border pass is permitted at several border checkpoints. The government requires a valid passport with an entry visa for all tourists and business people. As of May 2010, foreign business visitors from any country can apply for a visa on arrival when passing through Yangon and Mandalay international airports without having to make any prior arrangements with travel agencies.{http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/522/news01.html} Both the tourist visa and business visa are valid for 28 days, renewable for an additional 14 days for tourism and 3 months for business.  Seeing Burma through a personal tour guide is popular. Travelers can hire guides through travel agencies.

The junta's forced labour programmes were focused around tourist destinations which have been heavily criticised for their human rights records. Even disregarding the obviously governmental fees, Burma’s Minister of Hotels and Tourism Major-General Saw Lwin recently admitted that the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services. Not to mention the fact that only a very small minority of impoverished ordinary people in Burma ever see any money with any relation to tourism.Burma Digest Much of the country is completely off-limits to tourists, and the military very tightly controls interactions between foreigners and the people of Burma.  They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment, and in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit "unnecessary contact" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people.The Tourism Campaign - Campaigns - The Burma Campaign UK

A major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Due to this, Burma remains a poor country with no improvement of living standards for the majority of the population over the past decade. The main causes for continued sluggish growth are poor government planning, internal unrest, minimal foreign investment and the large trade deficit. One of the recent government initiatives is to utilize Burma's large natural gas deposits. Currently, Burma has attracted investment from Thai, Malaysian, Filipino, Russian, Australian, Indian, and Singaporean companies.http://www.financialexpress-bd.com/index3.asp?cnd=12/15/2006&section_id=24&newsid=46742&spcl=no Trade with the US amounted to $243.56 million as of February 2013, accounting for 15 projects and just 0.58 per cent of the total, according to government statistics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://investvine.com/us-looks-to-boost-myanmar-trade-investment/|title=US to boost Myanmar trade, investment|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Inside Investor|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]

Thai rulers have for centuries been toying with the idea of building a canal across the Kra Isthmus, linking the Gulf of Thailand directly to the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean to avoid the journey round peninsular Malaysia through the Strait of Malacca.”[tpl]cite news|title=Geopolitical consequences: Rite of passage|url=http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578174-opening-up-myanmar-could-transform-rest-asia-rite-passage|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=25 May 2013[/tpl] Dawei would give Thailand that connection. China, by far the biggest investor in Burma, has focused on constructing oil and gas pipelines that “crisscross the country, starting from a new terminus at Kyaukphyu, just below Sittwe, up to Mandalay and on to the Chinese border town of Ruili and then Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.”[tpl]cite news|title=Geopolitical consequences: Rite of passage|url=http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578174-opening-up-myanmar-could-transform-rest-asia-rite-passage|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=25 May 2013[/tpl] This would prevent China from “having to funnel oil from Africa and the Middle East through the bottleneck around Singapore.”[tpl]cite news|title=Geopolitical consequences: Rite of passage|url=http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578174-opening-up-myanmar-could-transform-rest-asia-rite-passage|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=25 May 2013[/tpl]

==Humanitarian aid==

The level of international aid to Burma ranks amongst the lowest in the world (and the lowest in the Southeast Asian region)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/uk-to-become-top-donor-to-burma/14523|title=UK to become top donor to Burma|last=Wade|first=Francis|date=2 March 2011|work=Democratic Voice of Burma|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl]—Burma receives the $4 per capita in development assistance, as compared to the average of $42.30 per capita.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.refintl.org/where-we-work/asia/burma|title=Burma|work=Refugees International|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/country/burma/faq-burma.cfm|title=Australia's aid to Burma—Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|date=30 June 2011|work=AusAid|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl]
In April 2007, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified the financial and other restrictions that the military government places on international humanitarian assistance in the Southeast Asian country. The GAO report, entitled "Assistance Programs Constrained in Burma," outlines the specific efforts of the Burmese government to hinder the humanitarian work of international organizations, including by restricting the free movement of international staff within the country.  The report notes that the regime has tightened its control over assistance work since former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt was purged in October 2004.  Furthermore, the reports states that the military government passed guidelines in February 2006, which formalized Burma's restrictive policies.  According to the report, the guidelines require that programs run by humanitarian groups "enhance and safeguard the national interest" and that international organizations coordinate with state agents and select their Burmese staff from government-prepared lists of individuals.  United Nations officials have declared these restrictions unacceptable.
U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) said that the report "underscores the need for democratic change in Burma, whose military regime arbitrarily arrests, tortures, rapes and executes its own people, ruthlessly persecutes ethnic minorities, and bizarrely builds itself a new capital city while failing to address the increasingly urgent challenges of refugee flows, illicit narcotics and human trafficking, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases."

==Impact on population==

The current state of the Burmese economy has also had a significant impact on the demographics of Burma, as economic hardship results in extreme delays of marriage and family building. The average age of marriage in Burma is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women, almost unparalleled in the region, with the exception of developed countries like Singapore.[tpl]cite journal |author=Myat Mon |year=2008 |title=The Economic Position of Women in Burma |journal=Asian Studies Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=243–255 |doi=10.1111/1467-8403.00076 [/tpl]http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldmarriage/worldmarriagepatterns2000.pdf Burma also has a low fertility rate, of 2.07 children per woman (2010), especially as compared to other Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing, like Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41), representing a significant decline from 4.7 in 1983, despite the absence of a national population policy.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Gavin W. |year=2007 |title=Delayed Marriage and Very Low Fertility in Pacific Asia |journal=Population and Development Review |publisher=The Population Council, Inc. |volume=33 |issue=33 |pages=453–478 |url=http://dahuang.dhxy.info/population/Delayed_Marriage_Fertility09.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2007.00180.x [/tpl] This is at least partly attributed to the economic strain that additional children place on the family income, and has resulted in the prevalence of illegal abortions in the country, as well as use of other forms of birth control.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ba-Thike |first1=Katherine  |year=1997 |title=Abortion: A Public Health Problem in Myanmar |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |publisher=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=94–100 |jstor=3775140 |doi= 10.1016/s0968-8080(97)90010-0[/tpl]
