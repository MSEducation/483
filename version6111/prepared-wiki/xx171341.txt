CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro (city)

São Conrado is an affluent neighborhood in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is nestled in between the wealthy neighborhoods of Barra da Tijuca to the southwest and Leblon to the northeast. São Conrado is famous for its hang gliding (popular with locals and tourists alike), Fashion Mall which houses over 150 stores carrying national and international designers, and golf course. The neighborhood, or bairro, is made up of sophisticated residential buildings, night clubs, and elegant restaurants. Contrasting with the wealth, however, is the sight of the Favela da Rocinha, Brazil's largest shantytown and one of the largest in the world, which clings to the famous Morro Dois Irmãos, or Two Brothers Mountain. It is also very well known for the mansions on the foot of the Pedra da Gávea mountain, the largest seaside granite rock on Earth.
For years, the neighborhood has been the most expensive and sought-after area in Rio, with celebrities such as Xuxa and even the mayor calling the area home.
