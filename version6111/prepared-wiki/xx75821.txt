==History and landmarks==

There are many pre-historic sites in Sund from the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages.
The Medieval church of Sund is dedicated to John the Baptist and was built sometime in the 13th century. It is the largest church in Åland. Inside the church there is a five-meter-tall crucifix, the tallest in all of Scandinavia.
Kastelholm Castle ([tpl]lang-sv|Kastelholms slott[/tpl]) is the only castle in Åland, and is partially in ruins. The castle was built on a small island that was surrounded by water and moats filled with several lines of poles. It was first mentioned in 1388 in the contract of Queen Margaret I, where a large portion of the inheritance of Bo Jonsson Grip was given to her. The heyday of the castle was in the 15th and 16th centuries. King John III kept his deposed brother Eric XIV in captivity in the castle in the Fall of 1571. Today, it is partially restored and a popular tourist attraction. The whole castle was opened to the public in 2001.
The Bomarsund Fortress ([tpl]lang-sv|Bomarsunds fästning[/tpl]) is one of the most interesting historical places in Sund. After Sweden had lost the Finnish War of 1808–09, fought against Russia, both Åland and Finland became part of the Russian Empire. Russia began to build a fortress in Sund in 1830 in accordance with the orders of Emperor Nicholas I. People of various cultural backgrounds came to Sund from all over Russia to build the fortress. A town, Gamla Skarpans, was built and another settlement, Nya Skarpans, was established inside the fortress. However, the fortress, designed for 5000 men and 500 cannons, was never finished because in 1854 during the Crimean War English and French troops invaded and blew it up. Today, in addition to the fortress, there are the ruins of Gamla Skarpans and two watchtowers nearby, all open to visitors.
The Outdoor Museum Jan Karlsgården ([tpl]lang-sv|Jan Karlsgården friluftsmuseum[/tpl]) is next to Kastelholm Castle. There are old buildings from all over Åland, such as windmills, a steam sauna and a blacksmith's shop.
The Prison Museum Vita Björn ([tpl]lang-sv|Fängelsemuseet Kronohäktet Vita Björn[/tpl]) is also near the Kastelholm Castle. It was originally built in 1784 to serve as a prison and operated until as recently as 1975. Today it is a museum.
