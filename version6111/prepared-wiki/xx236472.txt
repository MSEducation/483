====Final three regular season games====

Jefferson's final three regular season games were LSU's most productive games in 2011 for total yards and yards per play.[tpl]cite web |title=LSU Game-by-Game Statistics |url=http://www.lsusports.net/src/data/lsu/assets/docs/fb/11stats/teamgbg.htm?DB_OEM_ID=5200 |publisher=lsusports.net |last=Staff |first=LSUSports |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl] In all three games, LSU gained over 450 yards; LSU had gained over 450 yards only once in the prior nine games.

LSU averaged nearly 10 points more per game and nearly doubled the rushing yards when Jefferson started as QB. Jefferson finished the regular season with a passer rating of 163.5, highest among SEC starting QBs. Of LSU's final three regular season opponents, one-third of the opponents were ranked in the Top 25 at the end of the season. Arkansas was ranked 5th. Neither Ole Miss nor Western Kentucky received a Top 25 vote. Of LSU's first eight regular season opponents, only one-fourth of the opponents were ranked. Oregon was ranked 4th, and West Virginia was ranked 17th. Auburn was the only other team to receive a Top 25 vote.

===College career statistics===

Jefferson threw for 4,733 yards and 34 touchdowns during his career. He ranks fifth for career wins by a starting quarterback at LSU with 24. He is fifth in LSU history in passing touchdowns (34) and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (12). He is sixth in LSU history in career passing yards (4,733), sixth in completion percentage (58.7), sixth in career completions (398), and sixth in attempts (678).
Jefferson holds the LSU record for rushing yards by a quarterback with 1,018 yards. Jefferson’s ability to run the ball forced opposing defenses to account for him which allowed LSU to defeat opponents through its rushing attack. LSU’s emphasis on its ground game coupled with Jefferson sharing time with Jarrett Lee reduced Jefferson’s passing yardage. Thus, Jefferson threw for less than 100 yards in 11 games, or 34% of all games he started. However, of those 11 games, LSU only lost 3 games.
