==Science communication==

Sanford, known as "Dr. Kiki," produces and appears in a number of science education programs. Sanford says of her work, "My shtick is Dr. Kiki reaches out to people who don’t necessarily like science to get them to see it as something enjoyable. My goal is to get people who maybe flunked chemistry or didn’t do well on their science fair project to say, ‘This is really interesting.’"[tpl]cite web|title=Kirsten "Dr. Kiki" Sanford, Host and Science Expert|url=http://www.tvweek.com/talking-tv/dealmakers/2008/04/kirsten_dr_kiki_sanford_host_a.php|publisher=TVweek.com|accessdate=25 July 2012[/tpl]
