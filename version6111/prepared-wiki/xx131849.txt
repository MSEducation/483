It ran for twenty-seven episodes on Japan's TV Tokyo between April 1, 2007 and September 30, 2007. It was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, written by veteran playwright Kazuki Nakashima and had been in development since the participation of the famed animator in the Abenobashi mecha themed episodes by the same studio. Gurren Lagann takes place in a fictional future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages.

Using a mecha known as Lagann, Simon and Kamina reach the surface and start fighting alongside other humans against Lordgenome's forces.

==Plot==

===Story===

Gurren Lagann takes place in a fictional future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages, and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers, finds solace in his best friend and older brother figure, an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gurrenlagannthemovieusa.com/mecha/mecha.html|title=Gurren Lagann the Movie - Childhood's End - - The Lights in the Sky are Stars - ON DVD!|publisher=Gurren Lagann Movie Committee|accessdate=May 22, 2012|quote=Gozu: "A giant Gunmen"; Enki: "Viral's Gunmen"[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/gurrenlagann/mecha/ganmen.html|title=ガンメン|trans_title=Gunmen|publisher=Sony Music Entertainment Japan|accessdate=May 22, 2012[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, a giant Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann), and it is used to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through to the surface world.
Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen piloted by beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Simon's Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her, but allows her to join when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many that came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other humans, who captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace, where they defeat Lordgenome and the Beastman army.
Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government. As soon as the world's population reaches one million people, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce the moon's collision with Earth, which will wipe out all life on the planet and prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. With guidance from a resurrected Lordgenome, who had hidden mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals, Team Dai-Gurren prevents the moon's collision, rescues Nia, and destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away and die as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals. Simon spends the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant while his comrades set out to contact other races throughout the galaxy to help prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe.

===Main characters===

==Production==

Gurren Lagann was first announced in July 2007 with Aniplex and Konami assisting Gainax in its making. Konami director Koichi Natsume suggested possibilities of the series getting multiple sequels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-07-11/gainax-announces-new-anime|title=Gainax Announces New Anime|date=July 11, 2006|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] The series was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi who was a fan of the mecha genre and ever since he started working he has wanted to work in a mecha series. After working on Re: Cutey Honey with Kazuki Nakajima, Imaishi appointed him as the writer, believing him to be the best choice. Imaishi was surprised with how much material Nakajima could condense into 27 episodes. Imaishi had finished writing the main storyline long before the reaching the end which facilitated the staff in making the episodes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/news/20071110mog00m200035000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071225213002/http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/news/20071110mog00m200035000c.html|title=グレンラガン：ヒロインの悲劇は「ハッピーエンドのつもり」　今石洋之監督語る|accessdate=October 12, 2013|date=November 10, 2007|language=Japanese|archivedate=December 25, 2007[/tpl] According to Gainax president Hiroyuki Yamaga the series was in planning phases for a long time. Producer Yasuhiro Takeda used the time to research how would the characters live underground although this aspect is briefly used. Once the series started production, the team did not have much time to research materials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/interview-gainax-gurren-lagann-staff_article_87027.html|title=Interview with Gainax / Gurren Lagann Staff|author=Yeh, Jason|date= August 26, 2008|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl]
In contrast to other popular series, Imaishi decided to include drills as the robot's main weapons despite its impact on the suspension of disbelief. Imaishi also wanted the series to only have robots. The robots were made organic so that they would be easier to animate. Nevertheless, animating episode 15 was challenging to the staff due to the several amount of shots it required. Its animator Sushio called himself the "super animator" for his work. Deciding the design of the Gurren Lagann was complicated since it was the basis for the other mechas appearing in the story.
In the making of the series, the team wanted to focus more on the underground life and Simon's imprisonment but their ideas could not be used. In the eighth episode Kamina dies in order to provide Simon character development and make him become the main character. Simon's development kept on going until the final arc when staff planned ideas to make him surpass Kamina. The ending was written to finalize Simon's growth and not leave signs of a sequel. The final had the pre-planned tragic event of Nia's death which left several staff members saddened. While the staff acknowledged how people were not satisfied with the sad conclusion, they noted that there were still issues that made her survival difficult for the characters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/the-secrets-of-gurren-lagann-answered--6714.phtml|title=The secrets of Gurren Lagann answered!|publisher=Japanator|accessdate=October 12, 2013[/tpl] Once the series ended, Yamaga had the idea of releasing a film that retells the events of the series to expand the audience.

===Influences===

In an interview, the writer Kazuki Nakashima cites Ken Ishikawa, co-creator of Getter Robo, as one of Gurren Lagann's influences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://img710.imageshack.us/i/1259714556574.jpg/|title=Interview with Kazuki Nakajima|accessdate=July 8, 2010[/tpl] Gurren Lagann occasionally pays homage to Ishikawa's Getter Robo, particularly towards the end of the series, where the scale becomes absurd, with the robots steadily becoming bigger and bigger, much like Getter Robo more specifically, the manga version of Getter Robo Go. The final enemy also bears a striking resemblance to La Gooth of Records of Nothingness, another work by Ishikawa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://isiya.hamazo.tv/e1581434.html|title=天元突破グレンラガン|trans_title=Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|author=Ishikawa, Ken|publisher=Hamazo|date=December 23, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2010|language=Japanese[/tpl] Nakashima, however, wanted to conclude the story of Gurren Lagann in a more reasonable fashion than what Ishikawa usually does in his works. According to Jason Green from Anime News Network, the anime was influenced by previous Gainax anime, particularly in the character development of the protagonist Simon, who goes through three stages in his character development during the three arcs of the series. Each of these stages in his development were influenced by protagonists from several previous Gainax anime: Shinji Ikari from the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster, and Ken Kubo from Otaku no Video.[tpl]cite web|author=Jason Green|date=September 7, 2008|title=Dig For Fire: The Roots of Gurren Lagann|publisher=Anime News Network|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2008-09-07|accessdate=2008-09-09[/tpl] The animation on the show pays special tribute to the animation and character designs of Yoshinori Kanada.

===Conflicts===

Takami Akai, the producer of the series and a co-founder of Gainax, announced that he would resign his position effective episode five, which aired on April 29, 2007, over comments that he made regarding posts on the Japanese textboard 2channel. Akai and another Gainax employee, Keiko Mimori, made disparaging remarks about comments criticizing the animation style of the fourth episode of Gurren Lagann, which was completely directed by guest and friend Osamu Kobayashi. With regard to reading the fan criticisms, Akai stated that it was "like putting his face next to an anus and breathing deeply." Fans later became aware of his comments, and he announced his departure from the company he helped found.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-04-27/co-founder-takami-akai-steps-down-from-gainax| title=Co-Founder Takami Akai Steps Down From Gainax's Board|publisher=Anime News Network|date=April 27, 2007|accessdate=2007-05-01[/tpl]
As a result of the series airing at a child-friendly time slot, the staff members had problems with episode 6. Although that episode had a subplot involving peeking into the women's bath, the television stations believed it was suitable when reading the script. Once they completed the animation footage, the station said they could not air that.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-07-28/gainax-on-gurren-lagann|title=Interview: Gainax on Gurren Lagann|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=October 12, 2013|date=July 28, 2008|author=Loo, Egan[/tpl]

===Manga===

The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann manga, illustrated by Kotaro Mori, started serialization in the June 2007 issue of MediaWorks' magazine Dengeki Comic Gao!. The manga ended serialization in Dengeki Comic Gao! with the April 2008 issue when the magazine was discontinued, but continued serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh with the June 2008 issue and continued until the July 2013 issue. Ten tankōbon volumes were published between September 27, 2007 and June 27, 2013 in Japan under ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Comics imprint. Bandai Entertainment licensed the manga and released it in English in North America (although only as far as the sixth volume before ceasing operations).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-26/bandai-entertainment-picks-up-gurren-lagann-manga|title=Bandai Entertainment Picks Up Gurren Lagann Manga| publisher=Anime News Network|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-27[/tpl] The story of the manga follows the same plotline as the anime, however, there are several changes to the layout of events, and the addition of backstories that essentially fills in gaps from the anime, such as the relationship between Dayakka and Kiyoh.
A spin-off manga entitled [tpl]Nihongo|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Gurren Gakuen-hen|天元突破グレンラガン −紅蓮学園篇−[/tpl] was serialized in Comp Ace between August 26, 2008 and January 26, 2009; a single tankōbon volume was released on March 26, 2009. The manga takes the characters from the original story and puts them in a school in a parallel world. In the manga, Simon attends [tpl]Nihongo|Dai-Gurren Academy|ダイグレン学園|Dai Guren Gakuen[/tpl] with his friend Kamina, and childhood friend Yoko. Simon, who lives in a run down apartment building, wishes for a normal life, and meets the mysterious Nia one day when she trips down the stairs. She immediately takes a liking to Simon and declares him her husband. Kamina finds another "aniki" in Nia, who shares his hot-blooded style. She enrolls in Dai-Gurren Academy, and all three must deal with the threat of students from Teppelin Academy, who wish to bring Nia back to her father, the principal. Another spin-off manga titled [tpl]Nihongo|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 4-koma Kingdom: Yoko no Oheso-hen|天元突破グレンラガン4コマKINGDOM ヨーコのおヘソ編|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 4-panel Kingdom: Yoko's Belly Button Chapter[/tpl] was published by Futabasha in 2008 as a compilation of various short stories.

===Video games===

An online video game was developed by Konami called [tpl]Nihongo|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Chōzetsu Hakkutsu ONLINE|天元突破グレンラガン 超絶発掘ONLINE||literally "''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Superior Excavation Online"[/tpl]. Beta testing had ended on April 16, 2007. The player takes up the role of a driller and drills for treasures in first person view. There is a shop to purchase drills—the shopkeeper is an original character named Asaki. The player can also collect digital trading cards. The game was canceled at the closed beta stage, as installing the game crashed Windows indefinitely. Konami even had to send out 500GB external hard drives to beta users so that they could back up files while reinstalling their operating systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theotaku.com/news/view/konami_hits_the_brakes_on_gurren_lagann_mmo/2579/|title=Konami Hits the Brakes on Gurren Lagann MMO|accessdate=2007-09-15|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080221005549/http://www.theotaku.com/news/view/konami_hits_the_brakes_on_gurren_lagann_mmo/2579/|archivedate=2008-02-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/gurren-lagann/online/notice.html|title=Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann game online service suspension notification|accessdate=2007-09-15|language=Japanese[/tpl]
A game for the Nintendo DS was released October 25, 2007, not only featuring the characters from the series, but also containing a special episode set in the early stages of the story as a pre-order bonus. In June 2010, Gainax re-acquired the video game rights to the series from Konami, which allowed Banpresto to include it in the latest installment of its storied Super Robot Wars franchise, 2nd Super Robot Wars Z: Destruction Chapter, released in April 2011.
