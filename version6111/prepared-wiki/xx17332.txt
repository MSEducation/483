[[Peridot]]

CATEGORIES: Gemstones

Peridot ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛr|ɨ|d|oʊ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛr|ɨ|d|ɒ|t[/tpl]) is gem-quality olivine. Olivine is a silicate mineral with formula of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4. As peridot is the magnesium-rich variety (forsterite) the formula approaches Mg2SiO4.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name peridot is uncertain. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests an alteration of Anglo–Norman pedoretés (classical Latin pæderot-), a kind of opal, rather than the Arabic word faridat, meaning "gem".
The Middle English Dictionary's entry on peridot includes several variations : peridod, peritot, pelidod and pilidod – other variants substitute y for the i's seen here. http://books.google.com/books?id=XR52pY68WOUC&lpg=PA818&dq=peridotus&pg=PA818#v=onepage&q=peridotus&f=false Middle English Dictionary Ed Kuhn Part 3
The earliest use in England is in the register of the St Albans Abbey, in Latin, and its translation in 1705 is possibly the first use of "peridot" in English. It records that on his death in 1245 Bishop John bequeathed various items to the Abbey: "He gave also three noble Rings, in one whereof is an Oriental Sapphire, of wonderful bigness: In another is the Stone call'd Peridot, in the middle whereof is set a Sapphire of great beauty; it is said to be good against the Cramp, and is made almost in the form of a Buckler: in the third Ring is also an Oriental Sapphire, but less than the former."http://books.google.com/books?id=gjrnAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22effigies%20of%20nero%22%20cotton&pg=PA628#v=onepage&q=peridot&f=false  The antiquities and history of Ireland By Sir James Ware, 1705: Cotton Library Folio 88 b, Nero D VII

==Appearance==

Peridot is one of the few gemstones that occur in only one color, an olive green. The intensity and tint of the green, however, depends on how much iron is contained in the crystal structure, so the color of individual peridot gems can vary from yellow--to olive--to brownish-green. The most valued color is a dark olive-green.

==Occurrence==

===Geologically===

Olivine, of which peridot is a type, is a common mineral in mafic and ultramafic rocks, and it is often found in lavas and in peridotite xenoliths of the mantle, which lavas carry to the surface; but gem quality peridot only occurs in a fraction of these settings. Peridot can be also found in meteorites.
Olivine in general is a very abundant mineral, but gem quality peridot is rather rare. This mineral is precious.
Peridot olivine is mined in Egypt, Arkansas, Arizona on the San Carlos Reservation, Hawaii, Nevada, and New Mexico at Kilbourne Hole, in the US; and in Australia, Brazil, China, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar (Burma), Norway, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.

===In meteorites===

Peridot crystals have been collected from some Pallasite meteorites. A famous Pallasite was offered for auction in April 2008 with a requested price of close to $3 million at Bonhams, but remained unsold.Fukang Meteorite auction at Bonhams

==Gemology==

It is sometimes mistaken for emeralds and other green gems. In fact notable gemologist George Frederick KunzKunz, Gems and Precious Stones, on Peridot  discussed the confusion between emeralds and peridots in many church treasures, notably the "Three Magi" treasure in the Dom of Cologne, Germany.
The largest cut peridot olivine is a 310 carat (62 g) specimen in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
Peridot olivine is the birthstone for the month of August.[tpl]cite web|title=August Birthstone|url=http://www.americangemsociety.org/august-birthstones|publisher=American Gem Society|accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl]
