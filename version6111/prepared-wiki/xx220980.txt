The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 to support the free software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to create, distribute and modify computer software,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/about/ |title=Free software is a matter of liberty, not price|publisher=Free Software Foundation| accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl] with the organization's preference for software being distributed under copyleft ("share alike") terms,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl] such as with its own GNU General Public License.[tpl]cite web|title=What Is Copyleft? |url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl]  The FSF was incorporated in Massachusetts, USA, where it is also based.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&UpdateAllowed=&FEIN=042888848|title=FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC. Summary Screen | publisher=The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Commonwealth, Corporations Division|accessdate=2009-04-06[/tpl]
From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community.
Consistent with its goals, only free software is used on FSF's computers.[tpl]cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html | title = Linux, GNU, and freedom | accessdate = 2006-12-10 | author = Stallman, Richard M. | authorlink = Richard Stallman | year = 2002 | work = Philosophy of the GNU Project | publisher = GNU Project [/tpl]

==History==

The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting free software development.  It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and tapes, and employed developers of the free software system.[tpl]cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html | title=The GNU Project | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=June 24, 2012[/tpl]  Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement.  The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning they publish them and have the ability to make revisions as needed.[tpl]cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html | title=Licenses | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=June 24, 2012[/tpl]
In March 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM alleging that IBM's contributions to various free software, including FSF's GNU, violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was subpoenaed on November 5, 2003.[tpl]cite web | last = Heise | first = Mark | title = SCO Subpoena of FSF | publisher = Free Software Foundation | date=  2003-11-05 | url = http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-subpoena.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-11[/tpl] During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.[tpl]cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Bradley | authorlink = Bradley M.

In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the GNU General Public License after significant outside input.[tpl]cite web |title=GNU General Public License |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html |accessdate=15 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html |title=gplv3.fsf.org comments for discussion draft 4[/tpl]
The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the GNU system, such as GNU Compiler Collection. As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the copyleft requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL) when copyright infringement occurs on that software. While other copyright holders of other software systems adopted the GPL as their license, FSF was the only[tpl]By whom|date=May 2011[/tpl] organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software so licensed[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] until Harald Welte launched gpl-violations.org in 2004.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, Eben Moglen.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In late 2001, Bradley M. Kuhn (then Executive Director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and Peter T. Brown, formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against Linksys and OpenTV, became frequent.[tpl]cite web | last = Meeker | first = Heather | title = The Legend of Linksys | date=  2005-06-28 | url = http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090419230853/http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml | archivedate = 2009-04-19[/tpl] Hosted on the Wayback machine.[tpl]cite web | last =  Gillmor  | first = Dan | title = GPL Legal Battle Coming? | publisher = SiliconValley.com (a division of the San Jose Mercury News) | date=  2003-05-21 | url = http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030524174013/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |archivedate = 2003-05-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last =  Turner | first = David | coauthors = Bradley M.

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.[tpl]cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Dennis | date=  2004-01-11 | title = A Great Learning Opportunity for Software Lawyers — Upcoming GPL Seminar | url = http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928125310/http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html  |archivedate = 2007-09-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url= http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | publisher= Slashdot | last = Lord | first = Timothy | date=  2003-07-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses[/tpl]
In December 2008 FSF filed a lawsuit against Cisco for using GPL-licensed components shipped with Linksys products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.[tpl]cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Free Software Foundation lawsuit against Cisco a first | date = 2007-12-13 | publisher = Arstechnica.com | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081211-free-software-foundation-lawsuit-against-cisco-a-first.html | accessdate = 2008-12-11[/tpl] In May 2009, FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.[tpl]cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Cisco settles FSF GPL lawsuit, appoints compliance officer | date = 2009-05-21 | publisher = Arstechnica.com | url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/05/cisco-settles-fsf-gpl-lawsuit-appoints-compliance-officer.ars | accessdate = 2009-10-06[/tpl]
From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the law around it.[tpl]cite web | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses | url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | accessdate = 2008-07-04 | date = 2003-07-18[/tpl]  Usually taught by Bradley M. Kuhn and Daniel Ravicher, these seminars offered CLE credit and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/press/2004-01-02-nyc-seminars.html |title=FSF To Host Free Software Licensing Seminars and Discussions on SCO v.

==High priority projects==

The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "there is a vital need to draw the free software community's attention".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html |title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=January 4, 2009 |publisher=Free Software Foundation |authorlink=Free Software Foundation[/tpl] The FSF considers these projects "important because computer users are continually being seduced into using non-free software, because there is no adequate free replacement."
Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the Free Java implementations, GNU Classpath, and GNU Compiler for Java, which ensure compatibility for the Java part of OpenOffice.org, and the GNOME desktop environment (see Java: Licensing).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
The effort has been criticized[tpl]according to whom|date=March 2014[/tpl] for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.FSF's High-Priority Driver Project Doesn't Move Phoronix, April 20, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel)

==Hardware endorsements==

The FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom hardware certification" program. To be granted certification, a product must use 100% Free Software, allow user installation of modified software, be free of back doors and conform with several other requirements.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/criteria | title=Respects Your Freedom hardware certification requirements | publisher=Free Software Foundation | date=Jan 27, 2012 | accessdate=4 February 2014 | author=Josh Gay[/tpl]
Currently, a total of four products have been granted the certification:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom | title=Respects Your Freedom certified products | publisher=Free Software Foundation | date=Oct 9, 2012 | accessdate=4 February 2014 | author=Gay, Josh[/tpl]

The FSF's board of directors includes:
Previous board members include:
1999 show that De Icaza was not on the board on 1998-11-01 and was as of 1999-11-01, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates.

Changes to board composition are usually made at the annual meeting; which occurred on February 25, 2002.)
2000 show that Moglen was not on the board on 1999-11-01 and was as of 2000-11-01, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates. Those documents further indicate that the 2000 Annual meeting occurred on July 28, 2000; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.[/ref] until 2007Moglen announced his intention to resign in his blog ([tpl]cite web | last = Moglen | first = Eben | authorlink = Eben Moglen | title = And Now ...

The resignation likely occurred at the 2007 annual meeting of the directors; the exact date of that meeting is unknown.)
The FSF Board of Directors is elected by the Voting Membership, whose powers include at least this are outlined in the by-laws: [tpl]quote|In addition to the right to elect Directors as provided in the by-laws and such other powers and rights as may be vested in them by law, these Articles of Organization or the by-laws, the Voting Members shall have such other powers and rights as the Directors may designate.|Articles of Amendment|Free Software Foundation, Inc.[/tpl]
There are currently no known documents available that indicate the composition of the FSF's Voting Membership.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
John Sullivan is the current FSF Executive Director. Previous members that occupied the position were Peter Brown (2005–2010) and Bradley M. Kuhn (2001–2005).
At any given time, there are usually around a dozen employees.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board | title = Meet the staff of the Free Software Foundation [/tpl]  Most, but not all, work at the FSF headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite web | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm | title = Certificate of Change of Principal Office | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts | date=  2005-05-26 | url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2005/0526/000000000/4122/200516698270_1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-07-04 [/tpl]
Eben Moglen and Dan Ravicher previously served individually as pro bono legal counsel to the FSF. Since the forming of the Software Freedom Law Center, legal services to the FSF are provided by that organization.
On November 25, 2002, the FSF launched the FSF Associate Membership program for individuals.The site member.fsf.org first appears in the Internet Archive in  December 2002, and that site lists the date of the launch as 25 November 2002.

==Criticism==

Linus Torvalds has criticized FSF for using GPLv3 as a weapon in their fight against DRM. Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues.[tpl]cite web|author=à 21:00 |url=http://linuxfr.org/nodes/85904/comments/1230981 |title=Original version |publisher=LinuxFr.org |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl]
On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at Linux Magazine, criticized the Defective by Design campaign by the FSF as "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software.[tpl]cite web| title = The Party of Gno.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 | url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html[/tpl] FSF responded to this criticism by saying "that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns", and "that if one is taking an ethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement."In defense of negativity — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software.
