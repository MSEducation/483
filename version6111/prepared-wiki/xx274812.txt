Luigi Bisi (Milan, 1814 – Milan, 1886) was an Italian painter.

==Biography==

Luigi was born into a family of artists
Luigi's father, and two paternal uncles Michele and Giuseppe were painters. Giuseppe's wife, and Luigi's aunt, Ernesta, and her daughter, his cousing Fulvia Bisi were also painters. Luigi's son, Emilio, would become a sculptor. 
Luigi Bisi completed his training as a pupil of Francesco Durelli at the Brera Academy. He took part in the Brera exhibitions on a regular basis from 1831 to 1872 with a thematic repertoire of perspective views and monumental interiors repeated in a range of variations, which became one of his specialities. It was in 1837 that he established his position on the Milanese art scene winning the full approval of critics, who described him as the heir of Giovanni Migliara, and was appointed as a member of the Brera Academy’s decorative arts committee. Recognised as the undisputed founder of the school of perspective genre painting, he taught perspective at the Brera Academy in addition to his work as an artist. 
He also served on various restoration committees for important buildings in Milan and took part as an architectural designer in a whole range of competitions for renovation of the city’s monumental edifices within the framework of the post-unification drive for urban revival. His career came to a fitting close with the prestigious award of the Order of the Crown of Italy (1872) and appointment as president of the Brera Academy (1880). Among his pupils were Leopoldo Burlando and Giovanni Pessina.
