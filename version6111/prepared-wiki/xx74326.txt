[[Conformal group]]

CATEGORIES: Conformal geometry

In mathematics, the conformal group is the group of transformations from a space to itself that preserve all angles within the space.  More formally, it is the group of transformations that preserve the conformal geometry of the space.  Several specific conformal groups are particularly important:
All conformal groups are Lie Groups.
