[[Sartuul]]

CATEGORIES: History of Mongolia, Mongol peoples

Sartuul ([tpl]Lang-mn|Сартуул[/tpl]) is one of the Mongol clans. Today, they primarily live in the Zavkhan Province of Mongolia. 
The origin of the Sartuul people is Turkic merchants and artisans from Khwarizm. According to Pelliot, Sartuul means merchant in plural. Mongols called Muslim merchant a Sart or the place he came from as Sartagchinii gazar. After the Mongol invasion of Central Asia, many Khwarizmi and other Turks settled in Mongolia. They were loyal to Batmunkh Dayan khan and his successors. And they were appointed as one clan of Khalkhas. Sartuul people had already mixed with Mongols.
After the death of Gersenz Huntaiji, who was a son of Batmunkh Dayan Khaan, his wife divided Khalkha Mongol among her 7 sons. One of his sons, Daldan hundlun received Tangud (Descendants of Xi xia dynasty) and the Sartuul tribes. Since then, Chingissid princes from House of Daldan hundlun had ruled them. Some of them moved to northern Mongolia around Baikal a few decades later and mixed with the ancestors of the Buryats. 
9 khutagts of Khalkha and 2 presidents of Mongolia are from Sartuul. Today Sartuul Khalkhas are numerous and divided into 22 subclans that dwell on Zavkhan province.
There is a saying in Mongolia that Sartuul means Sartai Uul (Mountain with the Moon). This is a doubtful theory based on the spelling or accent of the name. It may come from "Sart oolu" which means "child of Sart" in Turkic.
