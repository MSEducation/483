Margaret "Maggie" Simpson is a cartoon character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She first appeared on television in the Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox Broadcasting Company which debuted December 17, 1989.
Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this being a running gag, being used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. Therefore, she is the least seen and heard in the Simpson family.
Maggie's squeaking and occasional speaking parts are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.

==Role in The Simpsons==

The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age, and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=78[/tpl] Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness.[tpl]cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff |Network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-19 |season=03 |number=12[/tpl] When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.[tpl]cite episode |title=And Maggie Makes Three |episodelink=And Maggie Makes Three |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Crittenden, Jennifer; Scott, Swinton O. |network=Fox |airdate=1995-01-22 |season=06 |number=13[/tpl]
During the earlier seasons of the show, Maggie's equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor,[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11[/tpl] but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11[/tpl]
Maggie has performed a number of feats that suggest she is a baby genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center,[tpl]cite episode |title=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |episodelink=A Streetcar Named Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff |network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-01 |season=4 |number=2[/tpl] and written her name on an Etch A Sketch.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11[/tpl] Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy.[tpl]cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |episodelink=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1990-12-20 |season=02 |number=09[/tpl] Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands,[tpl]cite episode |title=Who Shot Mr. Burns? |episodelink=Who Shot Mr. Burns? |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Oakley, Bill |network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-21 |season=06 |number=25[/tpl] and in a more intentional manner during "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.[tpl]cite episode |title=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |episodelink=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Gould, Dana; Michels, Pete |network=Fox |airdate=2002-05-22 |season=13 |number=22[/tpl]
Maggie is usually frightened and exasperated by Homer's attempts to bond with her, but has on several occasions stepped in to save Homer's life: once from drowning,[tpl]cite episode |title=Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder |episodelink=Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Anderson, Mike |network=Fox |airdate=1999-11-14 |season=11 |number=6[/tpl] once from being shot by mobsters, once from being kidnapped by a tow truck driver,[tpl]cite episode |title=Midnight Towboy |episodelink=Midnight Towboy |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Gillis, Stephanie; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2007-10-07 |season=19 |number=3[/tpl] and once from being shot by Russ Cargill, head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.[tpl]cite video |title=The Simpsons Movie |medium=Film |publisher=20th Century Fox |date=2007-07-27[/tpl]

==Character==

===Creation===

Matt Groening first conceived Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction,[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |date=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. The baby of the family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister.[tpl]cite news |title=Matt Groening |author=Sadownick, Doug |publisher=Advocate, Issue 571 |date=1991-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family |accessdate=2008-01-19 |author=Rose, Joseph |date=2007-08-03 |publisher=The Oregonian[/tpl] Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987 in the short "Good Night".[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14[/tpl] In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie and the rest of the family remained the main characters on this new show.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer' |accessdate=2006-09-01 |author=Kuipers, Dean |date=2004-04-15 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archivedate=March 8, 2008[/tpl]
The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "Fear of Flying", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "Principal Charming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening "couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles".Silverman, David; Reardon, Jim; Groening, Matt. (2005). Illustrated commentary for "Treehouse of Horror V", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".Groening, Matt. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Scully, Mike; Jean, Al; Brooks, James L.; Silverman, David |date=2007 |title=The Simpsons Movie: A Look Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=The Sun[/tpl] Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.

===Voice===

With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but participates in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie's first lines were spoken in "Good Night", the first short to air on The Tracey Ullman Show, after the family falls asleep. On this occasion, Liz Georges provided the voice of Maggie.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/guides/tracey.ullman.html |title=The Simpsons on The Tracey Ullman Show |publisher=The Simpsons Archive |accessdate=2008-09-30[/tpl]

==Reception==

Nancy Basile at About.com said her favorite Maggie scenes on The Simpsons are the ones that show her acting more like an adult than a one-year old. Some of her favorite Maggie scenes include scenes from "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" and "Lady Bouvier's Lover" where Maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy, Baby Gerald, and the one scene from "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie" in which Bart is supposed to babysit Maggie, but she escapes and takes Homer's car for a ride.[tpl]cite web |url=http://animatedtv.about.com/cs/faqs/a/simpsonbios_5.htm |title=Maggie Simpson — A Biography of Simpsons Baby Maggie Simpson |accessdate=2008-09-12 |author=Basile, Nancy |publisher=About.com[/tpl] Basile also added that "whether watching 'The Happy Elves' or falling down, Maggie is the cutest baby in the Simpson family". Comedian Ricky Gervais named "And Maggie Makes Three" his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where Homer puts up pictures of Maggie over his desk gave him "a lump in the throat thinking about it".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1176431,00.html |title=Best in D'oh |accessdate=2008-09-12 |date=March 24, 2006 |author=Snierson, Dan |publisher=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl] Todd Everett at Variety called the scene in "Lisa's First Word" where Maggie speaks her first word "quite a heart-melter".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900193.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |title=The Simpsons Maggie's First Word |last=Everett |first=Todd |date=December 7, 1992 |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2008-09-14[/tpl]
