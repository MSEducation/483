==Monsoon==

Tokio Hotel released "Monsoon" - their first English-language single - in Europe on May 18, 2007. The vocals and melodies in "Monsoon" are one semitone lower than its German counterpart - most likely due to the age at which Bill Kaulitz, the vocalist, recorded the German version.
"Monsoon" also appears in the music video game Guitar Hero: World Tour and the European versions of the games Guitar Hero: On Tour and Rock Band.
The song was performed at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich Germany."~Monsoon" at MTV Europe Music Awards 2007

==Music video==

The music video for the German version of the song features a stage looking like it was shot underwater. It starts off with the lead singer Bill Kaulitz holding a black candle sitting next to a broken door with no building behind it, then the candle's flame goes out. Many scenes feature Bill singing underwater and upside down. There is one scene where it looks like the guitarist, Bill's twin brother, Tom Kaulitz is singing along in a mirror like door then disappears. The ending chorus part of the video shows the band playing in rain.
The music video for the English version of the song, "Monsoon", was shot in Cape Town, South Africa in early May 2007. It features scenes of the band in a Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter and then free falling and landing on the ground. After they land, the band members walk to a stage (although scenes of them on the stage are already shown before the free fall scene) and start performing. As the song nears the end and the beat intensifies, a storm rumbles and heavy rain starts to fall on the band as they play. The video also shows scenes of lead singer Bill Kaulitz in the back of a black driver-less Cadillac limousine with a typewriter.
The video entered the TRL Countdown charts in July 2008.
