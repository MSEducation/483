However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.

==Relationship to other writing systems==

===Latin script===

A number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a Latin alphabet, such as Azerbaijani, Uzbek and Romanian (in Republic of Moldova in 1989, in Romania throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991,  some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except Transnistria, where Moldovan Cyrillic is official), Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan, but Uzbekistan still uses both systems. The Russian government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all federal subjects of Russia, to promote closer ties across the federation.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as Chechen and Ingush speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.
