[[Cytidine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleosides, Pyrimidones

Cytidine is a nucleoside molecule that is formed when cytosine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond.  Cytidine is a component of RNA.
If cytosine is attached to a deoxyribose ring, it is known as a deoxycytidine.

==Dietary sources of cytidine==

Dietary sources of cytidine include foods with high RNA (ribonucleic acid) content,[tpl]cite journal |author=Jonas DA |title=Safety considerations of DNA in food |journal=Ann Nutr Metab. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=235–54 |year=2001 |pmid=11786646 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=anm45235 |doi=10.1159/000046734 |author-separator=, |author2=Elmadfa I |author3=Engel KH |display-authors=3 |last4=Heller |first4=K.J. |last5=Kozianowski |first5=G. |last6=kÖNig |first6=A. |last7=mÜLler |first7=D. |last8=Narbonne |first8=J.F. |last9=Wackernagel |first9=W.[/tpl] such as organ meats, Brewer's yeast, as well as pyrimidine-rich foods such as beer. During digestion, RNA-rich foods are broken-down into ribosyl pyrimidines (cytidine and uridine), which are absorbed intact.  In humans, dietary cytidine is converted into uridine,[tpl]cite journal |author=Wurtman RJ, Regan M, Ulus I, Yu L |title=Effect of oral CDP-choline on plasma choline and uridine levels in humans |journal=Biochem Pharmacol. |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=989–92 |date=Oct 2000 |pmid=10974208 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-2952(00)00436-6 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(00)00436-6[/tpl] which is probably the compound behind cytidine's metabolic effects.

==Cytidine analogs==

There are a variety of cytidine analogs with potentially useful pharmacology.  For example, KP-1461 is an anti-HIV agent that works as a viral mutagen,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aidsnews.org/2007/10/kp-1461.html | title = New Kind of Antiretroviral, KP-1461 | author = John S. James | publisher = AIDS Treatment News[/tpl] and zebularine exists in E. coli and is being examined for chemotherapy.  Low doses of azacitidine and its analog decitabine have shown results against cancer through epigenetic demethylation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-03-scientists-reprogram-cancer-cells-doses.html | title = Scientists reprogram cancer cells with low doses of epigenetic drugs | date = March 22, 2012 | publisher = Medical XPress[/tpl]
