[[End term]]

CATEGORIES: Term logic

The end terms in a categorical syllogism are the major term and the minor term (not the middle term). These two terms appear together in the conclusion and separately with the middle term in the major premise and minor premise, respectively.
Example:
The end terms are in italics. S is the minor term, P is the major term, and M is the middle term.
