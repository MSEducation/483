The Muslim Brotherhood is financed by contributions from its members, who are required to allocate a portion of their income to the movement. Some of these contributions are from members who work in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12823-2004Sep10.html|title=In Search of Friends Among The Foes U.S. Hopes to Work With Diverse Group |work=The Washington Post|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=28 November 2012|first1=John|last1=Mintz|first2=Douglas|last2=Farah[/tpl]
The Muslim Brotherhood started as a religious social organization; preaching Islam, teaching the illiterate, setting up hospitals and even launching commercial enterprises. As its influence grew, it began to oppose British rule in Egypt, starting in 1936.[tpl]citation|last=Delanoue|first=G.|contribution=al-Ik̲h̲wānal-Muslimūn|work = Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Brill Publishers[/tpl] Many Egyptian nationalists accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of violent killings during this period.Chamieh, Jebran, Traditionalists, Militants and Liberal in Present Islam, Research and Publishing House, 1995, p. 140.

==Beliefs==

The Brotherhood's English language website describes the principles of the Muslim Brotherhood as including firstly the introduction of the Islamic Sharia as "the basis for controlling the affairs of state and society" and secondly, work to unify "Islamic countries and states, mainly among the Arab states, and liberating them from foreign imperialism".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=813|title=The Principles of The Muslim Brotherhood[/tpl]
According to a spokesman, the Muslim Brotherhood believe in reform, democracy, freedom of assembly, press, etc.
 We believe that the political reform is the true and natural gateway for all other kinds of reform. We have announced our acceptance of democracy that acknowledges political pluralism, the peaceful rotation of power and the fact that the nation is the source of all powers. As we see it, political reform includes the termination of the state of emergency, restoring public freedoms, including the right to establish political parties, whatever their tendencies may be, and the freedom of the press, freedom of criticism and thought, freedom of peaceful demonstrations, freedom of assembly, etc. It also includes the dismantling of all exceptional courts and the annulment of all exceptional laws, establishing the independence of the judiciary, enabling the judiciary to fully and truly supervise general elections so as to ensure that they authentically express people's will, removing all obstacles that restrict the functioning of civil society organizations, etc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/faq.php|title=interview w/Dr. Mohamed El-Sayed Habib |publisher=Ikhwan Web|accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] 
Its founder, Hassan Al-Banna, was influenced by Islamic reformers Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, with the group itself being influenced by Sufism.Paulo G. Pinto, "Sufism and the religious debate in Syria." Taken from Public Islam and the Common Good, pg. 184. Volume 95 of Social, economic, and political studies of the Middle East and Asia. Eds. Armando Salvatore and Dale F. Eickelman. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2004. ISBN 9789004136212Carl W. Ernst, Following Muhammad: Rethinking Islam in the Contemporary World, pg. 180. Part of the Islamic Civilization and Muslim Networks series. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. ISBN 9780807875803 In the group's belief, the Quran and Sunnah constitute a perfect way of life and social and political organization that God has set out for man. Islamic governments must be based on this system and eventually unified in a Caliphate. The Muslim Brotherhood's goal, as stated by Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna was to reclaim Islam's manifest destiny, an empire, stretching from Spain to Indonesia.Davidson, Lawrence (1998) Islamic Fundamentalism Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn., ISBN 0-313-29978-1 pp. 97–98; The Brotherhood strongly opposes Western colonialism, and preaches that Islam will bring social justice, the eradication of poverty and corruption, and political freedom (to the extent allowed by the laws of Islam).
On the issue of women and gender the Muslim Brotherhood interprets Islam conservatively. Its founder called for "a campaign against ostentation in dress and loose behavior", "segregation of male and female students", a separate curriculum for girls, and "the prohibition of dancing and other such pastimes ... ""Toward the Light" in Five Tracts of Hasan Al-Banna, trans. by Charles Wendell (Berkeley, 1978), ISBN 0-520-09584-7 pp. 126f.
The Muslim Brotherhood is a movement, not a political party, but members have created political parties in several countries, such as the Islamic Action Front in Jordan and Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank and the newly created Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt. These parties are staffed by Brotherhood members but kept independent from the Muslim Brotherhood to some degree, unlike Hizb ut-Tahrir which is highly centralized.The Future of Political Islam, Graham E. Fuller, Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), p. 138.
There are breakaway groups from the movement, including the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and Al Takfir Wal Hijra.The Salafist Movement, Frontline (PBS) Prominent figures of the Brotherhood include Sayyid Qutb, a highly influential extremist and anti-Semitic thinker of Islamic supremacism, and the author of Milestones.*[tpl]cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2014 |title=The Inclusive Dynamics of Islamic Universalism: From the Vantage Point of Sayyid Qutb’s Critical Philosophy |journal=Comparative Philosophy |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=29–54 |doi= [/tpl] Osama bin Laden criticized the Brotherhood, and accused it of betraying jihad and the ideals of Qutb."Muslim Brotherhood vs Al Qaeda" 19 January 2010"MB Chief Criticism" 30 December 2007

===Mottos===

The Brotherhood's "most frequently used slogan" (according to the BBC) is  "Islam is the Solution" (الإسلام هو الحل).[tpl]cite web|title=Profile: Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405|work=25 December 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl] Another well known slogan is "Allah is our objective.

==Organization==

From the TranscriptsZeid al-Noman, "Ikhwan in America", pp. 15–16. the following hierarchical Organisation structure can be derived:
It has the following divisions (not complete):
– Executive leadership
– Organizational office
– Secretariat general
– Educational office
– Political office
– Sisters office
The Muslim Brotherhood aimed to build a transnational organization, founding groups in Lebanon (in 1936), Syria (1937), and Transjordan (1946). It also recruited among the foreign students in Cairo where its headquarters became a center and meeting place for representatives from the whole Muslim world.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In each country there is a Branch committee with a Masul (leader) appointed by the General Executive leadership with essentially the same Branch-divisions as the Executive office has. To the duties of every branch belong fundraising, infiltrating and overtaking other Muslim organisations for the sake of uniting the Muslims to dedicate them to the general goals of the Muslim Brotherhood.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Founding===

Hassan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Ismailia in March 1928 along with six workers of the Suez Canal Company, as a Pan-Islamic, religious, political, and social movement.*[tpl]cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=A genealogical inquiry into early Islamism: the discourse of Hasan al-Banna |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=61–85 |doi= 10.1080/13569317.2012.644986|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569317.2012.644986#.UpUxao01ffZ[/tpl] The Suez Canal Company helped Banna build the mosque in Ismailia that would serve as the Brotherhood's headquarters, according to Richard Mitchell's The Society of Muslim Brothers.London: Oxford University Press, 1969, p. 9 According to al-Banna, contemporary Islam had lost its social dominance, because most Muslims had been corrupted by Western influences. Sharia law based on the Qur'an and the Sunnah were seen as laws passed down by God that should be applied to all parts of life, including the organization of the government and the handling of everyday problems.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Al-Banna was populist in his message of protecting workers against the tyranny of foreign and monopolist companies. It founded social institutions such as hospitals, pharmacies, schools, etc. Al-Banna held highly conservative views on issues such as women's rights, opposing equal rights for women, but supporting the establishment of justice towards women. The Brotherhood grew rapidly going from 800 members in 1936, to 200,000 by 1938 and 500,000 in 1948.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Post–World War II===

In November 1948, following several bombings and assassination attempts, the Egyptian government arrested 32 leaders of the Brotherhood's "secret apparatus" and banned the Brotherhood.Chamieh, Jebran, Traditionalists, Militants and Liberal in Present Islam, Research and Publishing House, 1995, p.140 At this time the Brotherhood was estimated to have 2000 branches and 500,000 members or sympathizers.Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage 1985, p.179 In succeeding months Egypt's prime minister was assassinated by a Brotherhood member, and following that Al-Banna himself was assassinated in what is thought to be a cycle of retaliation.
In 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood were accused of taking part in the Cairo Fire that destroyed some 750 buildings in downtown Cairo – mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners.Wright, Lawrence (2 June 2008)."The Rebellion Within, An Al Qaeda mastermind questions terrorism". The New Yorker
In 1952 Egypt's monarchy was overthrown by a group of nationalist military officers (Free Officers Movement) who had formed a cell within the Brotherhood during the first war against Israel in 1948.Hussein Mohamed Ahmed Hamouda, Asrār Ḥarakat aḍ-Ḍubbāṭ al-ʾAḥrār wa l-Ikhwān al-Muslimūn, al-Zahrā’ al-i‘lām al-‘arabī (1994), Chapter 6, section 4: see  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9434122 However after the revolution Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of the 'free officers' cell, after deposing the first President of Egypt, Muhammad Neguib, in a coup, quickly moved against the Brotherhood, blaming them for an attempt on his life. The Brotherhood was again banned and this time thousands of its members were imprisoned, many being tortured and held for years in prisons and concentration camps. In the 1950s and 1960s many Brotherhood members sought sanctuary in Saudi Arabia.Commins, David, The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia, I. B. Tauris, 2006, p.152
In the 1970s after the death of Nasser and under the new President (Anwar Sadat), the Egyptian Brotherhood was invited back to Egypt and began a new phase of participation in Egyptian politics.Kepel, Gilles, Jihad: the Trail of Political Islam, p. 83 Imprisoned Brethren were released and the organization was tolerated to varying degrees with periodic arrests and crackdowns until the 2011 Revolution.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Mubarak-era===

During the Mubarak era, observers both defended and criticized the Brotherhood. It was the largest opposition group in Egypt, calling for "Islamic reform", and a democratic system in Egypt. It had built a vast network of support through Islamic charities working among poor Egyptians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=51850|title=ISocial programs bolster appeal of Muslim Brotherhood|agency=IRIN|accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl] According to ex-Knesset member and author Uri Avnery the Brotherhood was religious but pragmatic, "deeply embedded in Egyptian history, more Arab and more Egyptian than fundamentalist."  It formed "an old established party which has earned much respect with its steadfastness in the face of recurrent persecution, torture, mass arrests and occasional executions. Its leaders are untainted by the prevalent corruption, and admired for their commitment to social work."'Our Muslim Brothers,'. CounterPunch, 22–24 June 2012.  It also developed a significant movement online.[tpl]cite web|author=Courtney C.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood became "in effect, the first opposition party of Egypt's modern era." Despite electoral irregularities, including the arrest of hundreds of Brotherhood members, and having to run its candidates as independents (the party being technically illegal), the Brotherhood won 88 seats (20% of the total) compared to 14 seats for the legal opposition.
During its term in parliament the Brotherhood "posed a democratic political challenge to the regime, not a theological one," according to one The New York Times journalist,Traub, James (29 April 2007). "Islamic Democrats?". The New York Times. Retrieved 6 September 2011 while another report praised it for attempting to transform "the Egyptian parliament into a real legislative body", that represented citizens and kept the government "accountable".[tpl]Wayback |date=20061001175005 |url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer240/shehata_stacher.html |title="The Brotherhood Goes to Parliament" [/tpl].

But fears remained about its commitment to democracy, equal rights, and freedom of expression and belief—or lack thereof.Fawzi, Sameh (8 December 2005). "Brothers and Others". Al Ahram Weekly. Retrieved 6 September 2011  In December 2006, a campus demonstration by Brotherhood students in uniforms, demonstrating martial arts drills, betrayed to some such as Jameel Theyabi "the group's intent to plan for the creation of militia structures, and a return by the group to the era of 'secret cells'".The Brotherhood's Power display Dar Al-Hayat (18 December 2006) Another report highlighted the Muslim Brotherhood's efforts in Parliament to combat what one member called the `current US-led war against Islamic culture and identity,' forcing the Minister of Culture (Farouk Hosny) to ban the publication of three novels on the ground they promoted blasphemy and unacceptable sexual practices.Bradley, John R., Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p. 62  In October 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood issued a detailed political platform. Amongst other things it called for a board of Muslim clerics to oversee the government, and limiting the office of the presidency to Muslim men. In the "Issues and Problems" chapter of the platform, it declared that a woman was not suited to be president because the post's religious and military duties "conflict with her nature, social and other humanitarian roles."   While proclaiming "equality between men and women in terms of their human dignity," the document warned against "burdening women with duties against their nature or role in the family."Bradley, John R., Inside Egypt, Palgrave MacMillan, (p. 65).
Internally, some leaders in the Brotherhood disagreed on whether to adhere to Egypt's 32-year peace treaty with Israel. A deputy leader declared the Brotherhood would seek dissolution of the treaty,[tpl]cite news|title=Muslim Brotherhood seeks end to Israel treaty|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/3/muslim-brotherhood-seeks-end-to-israel-treaty|work=The Washington Times[/tpl] while a Brotherhood spokesman stated the Brotherhood would respect the treaty as long as "Israel shows real progress on improving the lot of the Palestinians."[tpl]cite news|title=Live Blog: Egypt in Crisis, Day 8|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20030175-503543.html|publisher=CBS News|date=1 February 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

===Bahrain===

In Bahrain, the Muslim Brotherhood is represented by the Al Eslah Society and its political wing, the Al-Menbar Islamic Society. Following parliamentary elections in 2002, Al Menbar became the largest joint party with eight seats in the forty seat Chamber of Deputies. Prominent members of Al Menbar include Dr Salah Abdulrahman, Dr. Salah Al Jowder, and outspoken MP Mohammed Khalid. The party has generally backed government sponsored legislation on economic issues, but has sought a clampdown on pop concerts, sorcery and soothsayers. It has strongly opposed the government's accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the grounds that this would give Muslim citizens the right to change religion, when in the party's view they should be "beheaded".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/1yr_arc_Articles.asp?Article=136119&Sn=BNEW&IssueID=28339&date=2-22-2006 |title=Gulf Daily News|publisher=Gulf Daily News|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl]
In March 2009, the Shi'a group The Islamic Enlightenment Society held its annual conference with the announced aim of diffusing tension between Muslim branches. The society invited national Sunni and Shi'a scholars to participate. Bahraini independent Salafi religious scholars Sheikh Salah Al Jowder and Sheikh Rashid Al Muraikhi, and Shi'a clerics Sheikh Isa Qasim and Abdulla Al Ghoraifi spoke about the importance of sectarian cooperation. Additional seminars were held throughout the year.International Religious Freedom Report 2009, U.S. Department of State, 26 October 2009
In 2010, the U.S. government sponsored the visit of Al-Jowder, described as a prominent Sunni cleric, to the United States for a three-week interfaith dialogue program in several cities.International Religious Freedom Report 2010, U.S. Department of State, 17 November 2010Bahrain: The Political Structure, Reform And Human Rights, Kenneth Katzman, Eurasia Review, 18 February 2011

===Syria===

The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was founded in the 1930s (according to lexicorient.com) or in 1945, a year before independence from France, (according to journalist Robin Wright). In the first decade or so of independence it was part of the legal opposition, and in the 1961 parliamentary elections it won ten seats (5.8% of the house). But after the 1963 coup that brought the Baath Party to power it was banned.Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows: the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, p. 241. It played a major role in the mainly Sunni-based movement that opposed the secularist, pan-Arabist Baath party. This conflict developed into an armed struggle that continued until culminating in the Hama uprising of 1982, when the rebellion was crushed by the military.[tpl]cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/mus_br_syria.htm |title=Muslim Brotherhood of Syria |publisher=Looklex encyclopedia |date=20 September 2000 |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl]
Membership in the Syrian Brotherhood became a capital offence in Syria in 1980 (under Emergency Law 49, which was revoked in 2011), but the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Palestinian group, Hamas, was located in the Syria's capital Damascus, where it was given Syrian government support. This has been cited as an example of the lack of international centralisation or even coordination of the Muslim Brotherhood.Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press (2008), p. 248.
The Brotherhood is said to have "resurrected itself" and become the "dominant group" in the opposition by 2012 during the Syrian civil war according to the Washington Post newspaper.Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood is gaining influence over anti-Assad revolt By Liz Sly, The Washington Post 12 May 2012 But by 2013 another source described it as having "virtually no influence on the conflict".[tpl]cite web|last=Ibish|first=Hussein|title=Is this the end of the failed Muslim Brotherhood project?|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/is-this-the-end-of-the-failed-muslim-brotherhood-project|work=October 5, 2013|publisher=The National|accessdate=8 October 2013|quote=The Syrian Brotherhood was the most influential political force in the opposition after the uprising against the Damascus dictatorship began.

===Jordan===

The Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood was formed in 1942, and is a strong factor in Jordanian politics. While most political parties and movements were banned for a long time in Jordan such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Brotherhood was exempted and allowed to operate by the Jordanian monarchy. The Jordanian Brotherhood has formed its own political party, the Islamic Action Front, which has the largest number of seats of any party in the Jordanian parliament.[tpl]cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/mus_br_jordan.htm |title=Muslim Brotherhood / Jordan |publisher=Looklex Encyclopedia|date=20 September 2000|accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl]
The Muslim Brotherhood is playing an active role in the unrest in several Arab countries in January 2011. For example, at a rally held outside the Egyptian Embassy in Amman on Saturday, 29 January 2011 with some 100 participants, Hammam Saeed, head of the Muslim Brotherhood of Jordan and a close ally of the Hamas's Damascus-based leader, Khaled Meshaal, said: "Egypt's unrest will spread across the Mideast and Arabs will topple leaders allied with the United States." However, he did not specifically name Jordanian King Abdullah II.[tpl]Cite news|author=Commentator |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Jordans-opposition-Arabs-will-topple-tyrants/articleshow/7385868.cms|title=Jordan's opposition: Arabs will topple tyrants |work=The Times of India|date=30 Januaey 2011|accessdate=30 January 2011[/tpl]

As government repression hardened under the Baath Party from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged as one of the main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but participates in the political process.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/iip.htm |title=Iraqi Islamic Party |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl] Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.

===Israel and the Palestinian Territories===

'Abd al-Rahman al-Banna, the brother of the Muslim Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, went to the British Mandate for Palestine and established the Muslim Brotherhood there in 1935. Al-Hajj Amin al-Husseini, eventually appointed by the British as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in hopes of accommodating him, was the leader of the group in Palestine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=11146 |title=FrontPage Magazine – The Muslim Brotherhood, Nazis and Al-Qaeda |publisher=Archive.frontpagemag.com |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] Another important leader associated with the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine was 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an inspiration to Islamists because he had been the first to lead an armed resistance in the name of Palestine against the British in 1935.Cohen, 1982, p. 144. In 1945, the group established a branch in Jerusalem, and by 1947 twenty-five more branches had sprung up, in towns such as Jaffa, Lod, Haifa, Nablus, and Tulkarm, which total membership between 12,000 to 20,000.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Brotherhood members fought alongside the Arab armies during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and, after Israel's creation, the ensuing Palestinian refugee crisis encouraged more Palestinian Muslims to join the group. After the war, in the West Bank, the group's activity was mainly social and religious, not political, so it had relatively good relations with Jordan, which was in control of the West Bank after 1950. In contrast, the group frequently clashed with the Egyptian regime that controlled the Gaza Strip until 1967.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shadid|first=Mohammed K|title=The Muslim Brotherhood Movement in the West Bank and Gaza|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=Apr 1988|volume=10|issue=2|pages=658–682|jstor=3992661|doi=10.1080/01436598808420076[/tpl]
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Brotherhood's goal was "the upbringing of an Islamic generation" through the restructuring of society and religious education, rather than opposition to Israel, and so it lost popularity to insurgent movements and the presence of Hizb ut-Tahrir.0253208661 Eventually, however, the Brotherhood was strengthened by several factors:

Likewise, antagonistic and sometimes violent opposition to Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other secular nationalist groups increased dramatically in the streets and on university campuses.

During the First Intifada (1987–93), Hamas militarized and transformed into one of the strongest Palestinian militant groups.

The brotherhood first had an impact inside Saudi Arabia in 1954 when thousands of Egyptian brethren sought to escape president Gamal Abdun-Nasser's clampdown, while (the largely illiterate) Saudi Arabia was looking for teachers -- who were also conservative pious Arab Muslims -- for its newly created public school system.[tpl]cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|pages=144, |quote=In the 1960s, when Faisal became king, he championed the creation of public schools across the kingdom for boys -- and also girls. The largely illiterate nation had few qualified teachers, so the government dispatched emissaries abroad, mostly to Egypt and Jordan, to recruit teachers with substantive skills who also were devout Muslims. A hallmark of King Faisal's reign was an effort to create an Islamic alliance in the Middle East to counter the Arab nationalism of Egypt's president, Gamel Abdel Nasser. When Nasser, a nationalist strongman and sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia, turned on his country's conservative Muslim Brotherhood, King Faisal welcomed those religious conservatives into Saudi Arabia as scholars and teachers, reinforcing the fundamentalist hold on the young Ministry of Education, founded in 1954 under his predecessor and half-brother, King Saud.[/tpl] MB members "obeyed orders of the ruling family and ulama to not attempt to proselytize or otherwise get involved in religious doctrinal matters within the Kingdom, but "methodically ... took control of Saudi Arabia’s intellectual life" by publishing books and participating in discussion circles and salons held by princes.

MB members became "entrenched both in Saudi society and in the Saudi state, taking a leading role in key governmental ministries".  In particular, many established themselves in Saudi educational system. One expert on Saudi affairs (Stephane Lacroix) has stated: "The education system is so controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, it will take 20 years to change -- if at all.

The Muslim Brotherhood's brand of Islam and Islamic politics differs from the strict Salafi creed, Wahhabiyya, officially held by the state of Saudi Arabia, and the organization does not have "a formal organizational presence" in the Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|title=The Muslim Brotherhood In Saudi Arabia (comments by Thomas Hegghammer)|url=http://www.globalmbwatch.com/2008/07/08/the-muslim-brotherhood-in-saudi-arabia/|publisher=GlobalMB[/tpl] This is not discrimination as the Saudi government doesn’t allow any political group or party to function openly.
Relations between the Saudi ruling family and the Brotherhood became strained with Saudi opposition to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the willingness of Saudi government to allow US troops to be based in the Kingdom to fight Iraq. The Brotherhood  supported the Sahwah "Awakening" movement that pushed for political change in the Kingdom.[tpl]cite journal|last=McCants|first=William|title=Islamist Outlaws|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=March 17, 2014|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141038/william-mccants/islamist-outlaws|accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl]

The Muslim Brotherhood is the political arm of the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, commonly known as Islah. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh made a lot of effort to entrench the accusations of being in league with Al Qaeda, but he failed to present any, even a weak, evidence to support his claims.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2095702,00.html |title=Yemen's President Saleh Speaks: The Interview Transcript |work=Time |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2012[/tpl]

==Elsewhere in Africa==

===Morocco===

The Justice and Development Party was the largest vote-getter in Morocco's 2011 election, and as of October 2013, held the office of Prime Minister. It is historically affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood,Justice and Development Party, Ikhwanweb, the Muslim Brotherhood's official English language website. however, despite this, the party has reportedly "ostentatiously" praised the King of Morocco, while "loudly insisting that it is in no sense whatsoever a Muslim Brotherhood party"—a development one source (Hussein Ibish), calls evidence of how "regionally discredited the movement has become."

===Algeria===

The Muslim Brotherhood reached Algeria during the later years of the French colonial presence in the country (1830–1962).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Sheikh Ahmad Sahnoun led the organization in Algeria between 1953 and 1954 during the French colonialism.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Brotherhood members and sympathizers took part in the uprising against France in 1954–1962, but the movement was marginalized during the largely secular FLN one-party rule which was installed at independence in 1962. It remained unofficially active, sometimes protesting the government and calling for increased Islamization and Arabization of the country's politics.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
When a multi-party system was introduced in Algeria in the early 1990s, the Muslim Brotherhood formed the Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP, previously known as Hamas), led by Mahfoud Nahnah until his death in 2003 (he was succeeded by present party leader Boudjerra Soltani). The Muslim Brotherhood in Algeria did not join the Front islamique du salut (FIS), which emerged as the leading Islamist group, winning the 1991 elections and which was banned in 1992 following a military coup d'état, although some Brotherhood sympathizers did. The Brotherhood subsequently also refused to join the violent post-coup uprising by FIS sympathizers and the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) against the Algerian state and military which followed, and urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and a return to democracy. It has thus remained a legal political organization and enjoyed parliamentary and government representation. In 1995, Sheikh Nahnah ran for President of Algeria finishing second with 25.38% of the popular vote. During the 2000s (decade), the party—led by Nahnah's successor Boudjerra Soltani—has been a member of a three-party coalition backing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

===Sudan===

Until the election of Hamas in Gaza, Sudan was the one country were the Brotherhood was most successful in gaining power, its members making up a large part of the government officialdom following the 1989 coup d'état by General Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
In 1945, a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt visited Sudan and held various meetings inside the country advocating and explaining their ideology.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Sudan has a long and deep history with the Muslim Brotherhood compared to many other countries. By April 1949, the first branch of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood organization emerged.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] However, simultaneously, many Sudanese students studying in Egypt were introduced to the ideology of the Brotherhood. The Muslim student groups also began organizing in the universities during the 1940s, and the Brotherhood's main support base has remained to be college educated.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] In order to unite them, in 1954, a conference was held, attended by various representatives from different groups that appeared to have the same ideology. The conference voted to establish a Unified Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood Organization based on the teachings of Imam Hassan Al-banna.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
An offshoot of the Sudanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Charter Front grew during the 1960, with Islamic scholar Hasan al-Turabi becoming its Secretary general in 1964. The Islamic Charter Front (ICM) was renamed several times most recently being called the National Islamic Front (NIF). Turabi has been the prime architect of the NIF as a modern Islamist party. He worked within the Institutions of the government, which led to a prominent position of his organization in the country. NIF supported women's right to vote and ran women candidates. The Muslim Brotherhood/NIF's main objective in Sudan was to Islamize the society "from above" and to institutionalize the Islamic law throughout the country where they succeeded.
The Brotherhood penetrated into the ruling political organizations, the state army and security personal, the national and regional assemblies of Sudan. They also launched their own mass organizations among the youth and women such as the shabab al-binna, and raidat al-nahda, and launched educational campaigns to Islamize the communities throughout the country.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] At the same time, they gained control of several newly founded Islamic missionary and relief organizations to spread their ideology. The Brotherhood members took control of the newly established Islamic Banks as directors, administrators, employees and legal advisors, which became a source of power for the Brotherhood.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The Sudanese government has come under considerable criticism for its human rights policies, links to terrorist groups, and war in southern Sudan and Darfur.
The conservatism of at least some elements of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood was highlighted in an 3 August 2007 Al-Jazeera television interview of Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood leader Sheikh Sadeq Abdallah bin Al-Majed. As translated by the Israeli-based MEMRI, Bin Al-Majed told his interviewer that "the West, and the Americans in particular ... are behind all the tragedies that are taking place in Darfur", as they "realized that it Darfur is full of treasures"; that "Islam does not permit a non-Muslim to rule over Muslims;" and that he had issued a fatwa prohibiting the vaccination of children, on the grounds that the vaccinations were "a conspiracy of the Jews and Freemasons".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/opener_latest.cgi?ID=SD168507|title=Al-Jazeera Interviews – Muslim Brotherhood Leader in Sudan[/tpl]

===Somalia===

Somalia's wing of the Muslim Brotherhood is known by the name Harakat Al-Islah or "Reform Movement". Nonetheless, the Brotherhood, as mentioned earlier, has inspired many Islamist organizations in Somalia. Muslim Brotherhood ideology reached Somalia in the early 1960s, but Al-Islah movement was formed in 1978 and slowly grew in the 1980s. Al-Islah has been described as "a generally nonviolent and modernizing Islamic movement that emphasizes the reformation and revival of Islam to meet the challenges of the modern world", whose "goal is the establishment of an Islamic state" and which "operates primarily in Mogadishu".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35382.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2004. Somalia |publisher=State.gov |date=1 January 2004 |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl]
The founders of the Islah Movement are: Sh. Mohamed Ahmed Nur, Dr. Ali Sheikh Ahmed, Dr. Mohamed Yusuf Abdi, Sh. Ahmed Rashid Hanafi, and Sh. Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] The organization structured itself loosely and was not openly visible on the political scene of Somali society.
They chose to remain a secret movement fearing the repressive regime of Siad Barre but are considered[tpl]by whom|date=December 2013[/tpl] the first ever opposition to the dictatorship.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] However, they emerged from secrecy when the regime collapsed in 1991 and started working openly thereafter. Most Somalis were surprised to see the new group they had never heard of, which was in the country since the 1970s in secrecy.
According to the Islah by-law, every five years the organization has to elect its Consultative (Shura) Council which elects the chairman and the two Vice-chairman. During the last 30 years, four chairmen were elected. These are Sheikh Mohamed Geryare (1978–1990), Dr. Mohamed Ali Ibrahim (1990–1999), Dr. Ali Sheikh Ahmed (1999–2008) and Dr. Ali Bashi Omar Roraye (2008–2013).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Dr. Ali Bashi is a medical doctor, a former university professor and a member of the transitional parliament (2000–2008). During the 1990s, Al-Islah devoted much effort to humanitarian efforts and providing free basic social services.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The leaders of Al-Islah played a key role in the educational network and establishing Mogadishu University. Through their network, they educate more than 120,000 students in the city of Mogadishu. Many other secondary schools such as the University of East Africa in Bosasso, Puntland, are externally funded and administered through organizations affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islamic organization Al-Islah. In Somalia, they are known to be a peaceful organization that does not participate in any factional fighting and rejects the use of violence.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Today the group's membership includes urban professionals and students. According to a Crisis Group Report, Somalia's Islamists, "Al-Islah organization is dominated by a highly educated urban elite whose professional, middle class status and extensive expatriate experiences are alien to most Somalis."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Although Al-Islah have been criticized by some hardcore Islamists who considered them to be influenced by imperialist western values, Al-Islah speaks of democratic peaceful Somalia.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] They promote women's rights, human rights, and other ideas, which they argue that these concepts originate from Islamic concepts.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Al-Islah is gaining momentum in the Somali societies for their humanitarian work and moderate view of Islam, which is compatible to modernisation and respect of human rights.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Currently, Islah initiated to establish political party under the name of Justice and Unity Party which is open for all citizens of Somalia.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Tunisia===

Like their counterparts elsewhere in the Islamic world in general, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has influenced the Tunisian Islamists. One of the notable organization that was influenced and inspired by the Brotherhood is Ennahda (The Revival or Renaissance Party), which is Tunisia's major Islamist political grouping. An Islamist founded the organization in 1981. While studying in Damascus and Paris, Rashid Ghannouchi embraced the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he disseminated on his return to Tunisia.

===Libya===

The Libyan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1949, but it was not able to operate openly until after the 2011 Libyan civil war. It held its first public press conference on 17 November 2011, and on 24 December the Brotherhood announced that it would form the Justice and Construction Party (JCP) and contest the General National Congress elections the following year.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-libya-muslim-brotherhood-idUSTRE7AG2OY20111117 | agency=Reuters | title=Muslim Brotherhood goes public with Libya summit | date=17 November 2011[/tpl]
Despite predictions based on fellow post-Arab Spring nations Tunisia and Egypt that the Brotherhood's party would easily win the elections, it instead came a distant second to the National Forces Alliance, receiving just 10% of the vote and 17 out of 80 party-list seats.[tpl]cite web|title=National Congress party results|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/07/18/party-results/|publisher=Libya Herald|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl] Their candidate for Prime Minister, Awad al-Baraasi was also defeated in the first round of voting in September, although he was later made a Deputy Prime Minister under Ali Zeidan.[tpl]cite news|last1=Wahab|first1=Ashraf Abdul|last2=Cousins|first2=Michel|title=Abushagur elected as Prime Minister|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/12/abushagur-elected-prime-minister/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Libya Herald|date=12 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=9403|title=Libyan Prime Minister Nominates His Government Line-Up|date=30 October 2012|work=Tripoli Post[/tpl] A JCP Congressman, Saleh Essaleh is also the vice speaker of the General National Congress.[tpl]cite news|title=National Congress elects two vice speakers|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/08/10/national-congress-elects-two-vice-speakers/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Libya Herald|date=10 August 2012[/tpl]

===Mauritania===

Changes to the demographic and political makeup of Mauritania in the 1970s heavily contributed to the growth of Islamism within Mauritanian society. Periods of severe drought resulted in urbanization, as large numbers of Mauritanians moved from the countryside to the cities, particularly Nouakchott, to escape the drought. This sharp increase in urbanization resulted in new civil associations being formed, and Mauritania's first Islamist organisation, known as Jemaa Islamiyya (Islamic Association) was formed by Mauritanians sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.Mauritania’s Islamists-Carnegie Middle East Center. Carnegie-mec.org.
There was increased activism relating to the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s, partially driven by members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.
In 2007 the National Rally for Reform and Development, better known as Tewassoul, was legalized as a political party. The party is associated with the Mauritanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.

===United States===

According to The Washington Post, U.S. Muslim Brotherhood supporters "make up the U.S. Islamic community's most organized force" by running hundreds of mosques and business ventures, promoting civic activities, and setting up American Islamic organizations to defend and promote Islam.In Search Of Friends Among The Foes. The Washington Post. In 1963, the U.S. chapter of Muslim Brotherhood was started by activists involved with the Muslim Students Association (MSA). U.S. supporters of the Brotherhood also started other organizations including:  North American Islamic Trust in 1971, the Islamic Society of North America in 1981, the American Muslim Council in 1990, the Muslim American Society in 1992 and the International Institute of Islamic Thought in the 1980s. In addition, according to 'An Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America,' the "Understanding of the Role of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America," and the goal of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America is identified as the following, "The process of settlement is a "Civilization-Jihadist Process" with all the word means. The Ikhwan must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other religions." Ikhwan meaning brothers or brotherhood.http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhoodhttp://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judges/hlf2/09-25-08/Elbarasse%20Search%203.pdf

===United Kingdom===

In 1996, the first representative of the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK, Kamal el-Helbawy, an Egyptian, was able to say that "there are not many members here, but many Muslims in the UK intellectually support the aims of the Muslim Brotherhood." He added that at that time, the object of the MB in the UK was only to disseminate information on Islam, Islamic issues and movements, and to rectify the distortions and misunderstandings created by "different forces against Islam".[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
In September 1999, the Muslim Brotherhood opened a "global information centre" in London. A press notice published in Muslim News stated that it would "specialize in promoting the perspectives and stances of the Muslim Brotherhood, and communicate between Islamic movements and the global mass media."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In April 2014, David Cameron United Kingdom's prime minister launched an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood's activities in the UK and it's alleged extremism activities. Egypt welcomed the decision. After Cameron's decision, the Muslim Brotherhood reportedly moved its headquarters from London to Austria attempting to avoid the investigation.

===Indonesia===

Several parties and organizations in Indonesia are linked or at least inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood, although none has a formal relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the Muslim Brotherhood linked Parties is PKS (Prosperous Justice Party) with 10% seats in the parliament based on the Indonesian legislative election, 2009. The PKS relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was confirmed by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader.Qaradhawi, DR.

==Criticisms==

The Brotherhood was criticised by Ayman al-Zawahiri in 2007 for its refusal to advocate the violent overthrow of the Mubarak regime. Issam al-Aryan, a top Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood figure, denounced the al-Qaeda leader: "Zawahiri's policy and preaching bore dangerous fruit and had a negative impact on Islam and Islamic movements across the world."[tpl]cite journal |last= Jones |first= Seth G. |year= 2012 |title= Think Again: Al Qaeda |url= http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/04/23/think_again_al_qaeda?page=0,4 |journal= Foreign Policy |issue= May/June 2012 |accessdate= 28 April 2012 [/tpl]
Dubai police chief, Dhahi Khalfan, accused Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood of an alleged plot to overthrow the UAE government. He referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as "dictators" who want "Islamist rule in all the Gulf States".Muslim Brotherhood subversion in Gulf States. The Jerusalem Post.

===Motives===

Numerous officials and reporters question the sincerity of the Muslim Brotherhood's pronouncements. These critics include, but are not limited to:

===Status of non-Muslims===

===Response to criticisms===

According to authors writing in the Council on Foreign Relations magazine Foreign Affairs:  "At various times in its history, the group has used or supported violence and has been repeatedly banned in Egypt for attempting to overthrow Cairo's secular government. Since the 1970s, however, the Egyptian Brotherhood has disavowed violence and sought to participate in Egyptian politics."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9248/|title=Does the Muslim Brotherhood Have Ties to Terrorism|last=Crane|first=Mary|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations[/tpl] Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor, called it "conservative and non-violent";[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12325128 | publisher=BBC News | title=Egypt unrest: What if Mubarak goes? | date=31 January 2011[/tpl] The Brotherhood has condemned terrorism and the 9/11 attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~kurzman/terror.htm|title=Muslim Brother Hood Condemns 9/11 attack[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?ID=14069&LevelID=1&SectionID=71|title=Morsi: 9/11 a global calamity, not only for U.S.[/tpl]
The Brotherhood itself denounces the "catchy and effective terms and phrases" like "fundamentalist" and "political Islam" which it claims are used by "Western Media" to pigeonhole the group, and points to its "15 Principles" for an Egyptian National Charter, including "freedom of personal conviction... opinion... forming political parties... public gatherings... free and fair elections..."
Similarly, some analysts maintain that whatever the source of modern Jihadi terrorism and the actions and words of some rogue members, the Brotherhood now has little in common with radical Islamists and modern jihadists who often condemn the Brotherhood as too moderate. They also deny the existence of any centralized and secretive global Muslim Brotherhood leadership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301faessay86208/robert-s-leiken-steven-brooke/the-moderate-muslim-brotherhood.html|title=The Moderate Muslim Brotherhood|archiveurl=http://archive.is/JdIX|archivedate=25 May 2012[/tpl] Some claim that the origins of modern Muslim terrorism are found in Wahhabi ideology, not that of the Muslim Brotherhood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/4-10-2006-93214.asp|title=The root of terrorism is Wahabism[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ataturksociety.org/letters/tarhan.html|title=The root of terrorism[/tpl]
According to anthropologist Scott Atran, the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood even in Egypt has been overstated by Western commentators. He estimates that it can count on only 100,000 militants (out of some 600,000 dues paying members) in a population of more than 80 million, and that such support as it does have among Egyptians—an often cited figure is 20 percent to 30 percent—is less a matter of true attachment than an accident of circumstance: secular opposition groups that might have countered it were suppressed for many decades, but in driving the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, a more youthful constellation of secular movements has emerged to threaten the Muslim Brotherhood's dominance of the political opposition.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/opinion/03atran.html|title=Egypt's Bumbling Brotherhood | work=The New York Times | first=Scott|last=Atran|date=2 February 2011[/tpl] This has not yet been the case, however, as evidenced by the Brotherhood's strong showing in national elections. Polls also indicate that majority of Egyptians and other Arab nations endorse laws based on "Sharia".

==Foreign relations==

On 29 June 2011, as the Brotherhood's political power became more apparent and solidified following the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the United States announced that it would reopen formal diplomatic channels with the group, with whom it had suspended communication as a result of suspected terrorist activity. The next day, the Brotherhood's leadership announced that they welcomed the diplomatic overture.
