Interstate 496 (I-496) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also a component of the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway is a loop that connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway 127 (US 127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.
Construction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregations practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.

==Route description==

I-496 starts at an interchange with I-96/I-69 at that freeway's exit 95 in Delta Township in Eaton County. The freeway runs eastward through suburban areas of the township adjacent to some residential subdivisions. Continuing eastward, there is an interchange for Creyts Road before I-496 angles to the northeast. At the interchange with Waverly Road, I-496 crosses into Ingham County. The freeway then runs parallel to the Grand River. Near a partial interchange with Lansing Road (old US 27), the freeway gains a pair of service drives: St. Joseph Street runs one-way westbound on the north side, and Malcolm X Street runs eastbound to the south. The next interchange is for the connection to the Capitol Loop and M-99, both of which run along Martin Luther King Boulevard. The Capitol Loop, also internally numbered Connector 496,[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Appendix_C_Connector_19295_7.pdf |format= PDF |title= Appendix C: State Trunkline Connector Routes |date= May 1, 2008 |accessdate= October 15, 2008 |work= Michigan Geographic Framework |publisher= Michigan Department of Information Technology |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5va0tTuj2 |archivedate= January 8, 2011 |deadurl= no[/tpl] is a signed connector that provides access to various state government buildings like the Michigan State Capitol. South of this interchange, M-99 connects to the Lansing Car Assembly plant, a former facility for Oldsmobile.[tpl]cite news |last= Wieland |first= Barbara |date= May 1, 2005 |title= Lansing Car Assembly: 1901–2005 |work= Lansing State Journal |page= A1 |issn= 0274-9742 |url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/lansingstatejournal/access/1787056071.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+01%2C+2005&author=Wieland+Barbara&pub=Lansing+State+Journal&desc=Lansing+Car+Assembly+%22+1901-2005 |accessdate= July 12, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl]
Continuing eastward, I-496 passes north of the assembly plant complex and south of the central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_Official_Rail_130897_7.pdf |title= Michigan's Railroad System |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |cartography= MDOT |month= January |year= 2011 |accessdate= February 1, 2011 |format= PDF[/tpl] I-496 runs parallel to the north side of the rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass. The freeway then crosses into East Lansing near the Red Cedar Natural Area.
After crossing the city line, I-496 turns southward and merges with US 127. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross a line of the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along the western edge of the campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US 127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US 127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1 in:3.5 mi / 1 cm:2 km |inset= Lansing |cartography= MDOT  [/tpl][tpl]google maps |url= //maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-496+E&daddr=US-127+S&hl=en&sll=42.676946,-84.499626&sspn=0.030415,0.02914&geocode=FWbPiwId6iH0-g%3BFfQtiwIdLLD2-g&t=h&mra=ls&z=12 |title= Overview Map of I-496 |accessdate= July 12, 2012[/tpl]
Like other state highways in Michigan, I-496 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 61,082 vehicles used the freeway between BL I-96 and the Trowbridge Road interchange south of US 127, the highest traffic count along I-496. West of Creyts Road, 17,600 vehicles did so each day, which was the lowest count along the trunkline.[tpl]cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning |url= http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |year= 2008 |accessdate= June 30, 2012[/tpl] As an Interstate Highway, all of I-496 is listed on the National Highway System,[tpl]cite map |title= National Highway System, Michigan |date= April 23, 2006 |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |cartography= MDOT |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= October 7, 2008[/tpl] a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.[tpl]cite web |first1= Stefan |last1= Natzke |first2= Mike |last2= Neathery |first3= Kevin |last3= Adderly |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title= What is the National Highway System? |work= National Highway System |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |date= June 20, 2012 |accessdate= July 1, 2012 [/tpl]

The section near downtown was to be built through a historically African-American neighborhood. The neighborhood was formed through "unwritten rules of segregation" as real estate agents and mortgage brokers guided black residents to the area when they were looking to buy homes. When the state and federal governments were planning the freeway, the area was chosen for the path of I-496. The neighborhood boasted a community center and several businesses that catered to the black population of Lansing, including the only record store that sold rhythm and blues music. Community leaders did not fight the freeway and instead lobbied for affordable housing and relocation assistance. The construction spurred integration of blacks into the wider community; some were able to move into neighborhoods previously closed to them, purchasing "newer houses near better schools."[tpl]cite news |last= Miller |first= Matthew |date= February 22, 2009 |title= A Complicated Legacy: I-496 Slashed through Key Black Neighborhood in the '60s |work= Lansing State Journal |pages= 1A, 8A |issn= 0274-9742 |url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/lansingstatejournal/access/1689119311.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+22%2C+2009&author=Matthew+Miller&pub=Lansing+State+Journal&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=Looking+back%3A+I-496+construction%3A+A+complicated+legacy |accessdate= July 13, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl] In total, the construction of the freeway required the demolition or removal of nearly 600 homes, 60 businesses, and 15 farms.[tpl]cite news |title= City's East–West Traffic Speeded |first= Norris |last= Ingells |work= Lansing State Journal |date= February 14, 1965 |issn= 0274-9742 |page=[/tpl]

The name applied to the freeway was not without controversy. The Lansing City Council named it in September 1966 after Ralph W. Crego, a former city council member and the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. The Historical Society of Greater Lansing wanted it named the "R.E. Olds Expressway", in part because the new road brought about the demolition of the Olds Mansion, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places,[tpl]cite web |first= Patricia |last= O’Hearn |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/hal_mhc_mhm_carcapital_01-08-2003_92059_7.pdf |title= Michigan Time Traveler |publisher= Lansing Newspapers in Education, Michigan Historical Center |format= PDF |accessdate= July 13, 2012[/tpl] and to "recognize the contributions of R.E. Olds to the industries of the city." The society approached the Michigan Legislature, which introduced House Resolution 48 in February 1970 using the historical society's preferred name. The city council realized that they had been bypassed and conveniently discovered that their original resolution was not "formally adopted". They named a park for Crego instead in October 1970 and adopted a resolution to name I-496 the "Oldsmobile Expressway". The Legislature approved its resolution resulting in two names, one for the founder of the car company, and one for the company itself. The council member who introduced the city's resolution criticized the Legislature for taking action without consultation. The state resolution was intercepted before it could be sent to the Michigan Department of State Highways, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970, with the "Oldsmobile Expressway" name. On August 21, 1972, during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Oldsmobile, Senate Concurrent Resolution 345 renamed I-496 the "R.E. Olds Freeway".

==Related trunkline==

The Capitol Loop is a state trunkline highway running through Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique reassurance markers—the signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector 496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings.[tpl]google maps |url= //maps.google.com/maps?saddr=S+Martin+Luther+King+Jr+Blvd&daddr=42.7326018,-84.55619+to:42.7335723,-84.5492377+to:S+Cedar+St&hl=en&ll=42.733554,-84.557347&spn=0.030387,0.029998&sll=42.726713,-84.555545&sspn=0.030391,0.029998&geocode=FSHziwId4Jr1-g%3BFTkMjAIdYsb1-ikdsaSs18EiiDH0HJhJRWoyyA%3BFQQQjAIdi-H1-inBYoC72MEiiDEtrL8yqDBdGg%3BFT_yiwIdS_L1-g&mra=dpe&mrsp=2&sz=15&via=1,2&t=m&z=15 |title= Overview Map of the Capitol Loop |accessdate= October 14, 2008 |link=no[/tpl][tpl]cite map |first= David M. |last= Brown  |publisher= Universal Map |title= Michigan County Atlas: Back Roads & Forgotten Places |edition= 2nd |year= 2010 |page= 66 |inset= Lansing |isbn= 978-0-7625-6505-4 [/tpl] Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |cartography= MDOT |title= Truck Operators Map |year= 2008 |inset= Lansing |cartography= MDOT |oclc= 261183721[/tpl]
