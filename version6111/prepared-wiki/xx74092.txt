[[Photometric-standard star]]

CATEGORIES: Stars, Star types, Photometric systems

Photometric-standard stars are a series of stars that have had their light output in various passbands of photometric system, measured very carefully.  Other objects can be observed using CCD cameras or photoelectric photometers connected to a telescope, and the flux, or amount of light received, can be compared to a photometric-standard star to determine the exact brightness, or stellar magnitude, of the object.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
