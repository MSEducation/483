The NXL (National XBall League) was a paintball league based in the United States. The league consisted of franchised and non-franchised teams, and was owned by the franchise teams.  NXL competition was held in conjunction with PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions) events. At the start of the 2009 season the PSP decided to no longer use the NXL as their pro bracket.http://www.propaintball.com/2008/12/2009-psp-pro-division-aka-nxl/
