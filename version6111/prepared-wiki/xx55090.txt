==History==

In the 1840s the Cambridge area had a Maori population. In the 1850s missionaries and farmers from Britain settled in the area and guided Maori in modern farming practices, helping them set up two flour mills and importing grinding wheels from England and France.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Wheat was one of the main crops grown in those days. During the 1850s it was a prosperous time with migrants arriving in Auckland and high prices. However merchants in Auckland began purchasing cheaper grain from Australia and the market went into decline.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] 
The European town of Cambridge was established when the 3rd Regiment of the Waikato Militia were settled here in 1864 following the Invasion of the Waikato. The town was named after Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army at the time.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cambridgemuseum.org.nz/Military/3rdwaikmil/3rd%20Waikato.htm |title=Military - Third Waikato Militia |first=Eris |last=Parker |date= |publisher=Cambridge Museum |accessdate=5 April 2014[/tpl]
