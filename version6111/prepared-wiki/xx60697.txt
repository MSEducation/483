Red hair occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population."Red Alert!", Joel Garreau, The Washington Post, March 18, 2002 It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.
Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term redhead (originally redd hede) has been in use since at least 1510.[tpl]cite web|title=redhead, n. and adj.|work=OED Online|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/160309|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-08-07|date=June 2011[/tpl] It is associated with fair skin color, lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light.
Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered.

===Historical===

Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red haired."Men make gods in their own image; those of the Ethiopians are black and snub-nosed, those of the Thracians have blue eyes and red hair." Xenophanes of Colophon: Fragments, Xenophanes, J. H. Lesher, University of Toronto Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8020-8508-3, p. 90. Herodotus described the Budini people as being predominantly red haired. Dio Cassius described Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, of the ancient Britons, to be "tall and terrifying in appearance... a great mass of red hair... over her shoulders."
The Roman historian Tacitus commented on the "red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of Caledonia",The Life of Agricola, Ch. 11 which he connected with some red haired Gaulish tribes of Germanic and Belgic relation.
In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians, who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China. Caucasian Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC.[tpl]Cite episode | title = Mysterious Mummies of China | episodelink = List of NOVA episodes#Season 25: 1997.E2.80.931998 | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2502chinamum.html | series = NOVA | serieslink = Nova (TV series) | airdate = 1998-01-20 | season = 25[/tpl]
Red hair is also found amongst Polynesians, and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture red hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership.http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_31_1922/Volume_31,_No._121/Maori_somatology._Racial_averages,_by_Te_Rangi_Hiroa_%28P._H._Buck%29,_p_37-44/p1http://www.antrocom.net/upload/sub/antrocom/060210/08-Antrocom.pdf

===Modern===

Today, red hair is most commonly found at the northern and western fringes of Europe; it is associated particularly with the people located in Ireland and the British Isles (although Victorian era ethnographers claimed that the Udmurt people of the Volga were "the most red-headed men in the world").[tpl]cite book |author=Fernández-Armesto, Felipe |title=The Times guide to the peoples of Europe |publisher=Times Books |location=London |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-7230-0624-5 [/tpl] Redheads are common among Germanic and Celtic peoples.

==Biochemistry and genetics==

The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.
The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome 16. Red hair is associated with fair skin color because of low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair. This lower melanin-concentration confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a  higher risk of skin cancer.
The MC1R recessive variant gene that gives people red hair and non-tanning skin is also associated with freckles, though it is not uncommon to see a redhead without freckles. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant,[tpl]cite journal |author=Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ |title=Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=328–30 |year=1995 |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v11/n3/abs/ng1195-328.html |pmid=7581459 |doi=10.1038/ng1195-328[/tpl] and the prevalence of these alleles is highest in Scotland and Ireland. The alleles that code for red hair occur close to the alleles that affect skin color, so it seems that the phenotypic expression for lighter skin and red hair are interrelated.
Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.
Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the M1CR gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the M1CR gene necessary, but not always sufficient, for red hair production.[tpl]cite journal |author= Box NF, Wyeth JR, et al |title= Characterization of melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor variant alleles in twins with red hair.|journal= Human Molecular Genetics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1891–1897 | date=October 1997 |pmid= 9302268 |doi=10.1093/hmg/6.11.1891[/tpl]

The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His, and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair.HGNC Symbol Report:HCL2[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1987.tb03339.x | author = H. Eiberg & J.

In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.

===Evolution===

====Origins====

Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of Vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin.Bodmer WF, Cavalli-Sforza LL.Genetics, evolution and man. San Francisco:WH Freeman; 1976. In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair was not the result of positive selection and instead proposed that it occurs because of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun would be harmful to untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads come about through genetic drift.
Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago.Nicole's hair secrets Daily Telegraph 2002-10-02, Accessed 2005-11-02[tpl]cite journal |title=Red hair genes 100,000 years old |journal=Oxford Blueprint |volume=1 |issue=11 |date=2001-05-31 |url=http://web.archive.org/20010709074454/www.ox.ac.uk/blueprint/2000-01/3105/11.shtml [/tpl]

====Extinction hoax[tpl]anchor|Extinction[/tpl]====

A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail, which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed "geneticists", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future.Gingers extinct in 100 years. News.com.au. Retrieved on 2009-06-28. Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the "Oxford Hair Foundation". However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble, and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states "while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away".Redhead extinction. HowStuffWorks. Retrieved on 2009-06-28.
Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive gene, the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future.

==Medical implications of the red hair gene==

===Melanoma===

Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning, but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage. Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability.[tpl]cite journal |author=Flanagan N, Healy E, Ray A, et al. |title=Pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene on human pigmentation |journal=Hum.

Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.[ref]Rees JL (2002a) Molecular phototypes.

The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain relieving endorphins. (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC, and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH.[tpl]cite journal |author=Liem EB, Lin CM, Suleman MI, et al. |title=Anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=279–83 |year=2004 |pmid=15277908|doi=10.1097/00000542-200408000-00006 |pmc=1362956[/tpl] Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin, but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some "cross talk" between the POMC hormones that may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.
There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kumar VV, Kumar NV, Isaacson G |title=Superstition and post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=2031–3 | date=November 2004 |pmid=15510037 |doi=10.1097/01.mlg.0000147942.82626.1c[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1213/01.ANE.0000180769.51576.CD | author = Liem Edwin B. et al. | year = 2006 | title = Women with Red Hair Report a Slightly Increased Rate of Bruising but Have Normal Coagulation Tests | url = http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/1/313 | journal = Anesthesia & Analgesia | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 313–318 | pmid=16368849 | pmc=1351323[/tpl] One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising.

==Red hair of pathological origin==

Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder:

==Culture==

In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.

===Beliefs about temperament===

A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables, a character says of Anne Shirley, the redheaded heroine, that "her temper matches her hair", while in The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield remarks that "People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie dead brother never did, and he had very red hair."
During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament.The Practical Magnetic Healer G. M. Brown 1899 In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda, redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.
Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels, "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms," when he writes that: "It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity." Swift goes on to write that: "...neither was the hair of this brute Yahoo of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe..."Gulliver's Travels on Project Gutenberg Original by Jonathan Swift 1726 Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero. They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of "criminal women" were redheads.Nicole Hahn Rafter (ed), Lombroso & Ferraro, Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman, Duke University Press, 2004, p.123-4.
In the novel and film Red-Headed Woman, the titular protagonist is a sexually aggressive home-wrecker who frequently throws violent temper tantrums.

===Fashion and art===

Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Alyson Hannigan, Marcia Cross, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye.

Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India, Iran, Bangladesh and Pakistan, henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance.Henna – history Plant Cultures: Exploring plants and people. 2004-11-18
Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color "Titian" takes its name from the artist Titian, who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites, Edmund Leighton, Modigliani,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/modigliani/modigliani.redhead-dress.jpg | title = Image Young Redhead in an Evening Dress | accessdate = 2011-05-11 | publisher = WebMuseum[/tpl] and Gustav Klimt.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/klimt/klimt.danae.jpg | title = Danae | accessdate = 2011-05-11 | publisher = WebMuseum[/tpl]
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story The Red-Headed League involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor.

===Prejudice and discrimination against redheads===

====Medieval beliefs====

Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers (Der Eisenhans) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper, in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk.Palo Galloni, Il sacro artefice, Laterza, Bari 1998 (Italian book, chapter 2 about the recipe of Theophilus De auro hyspanico).

This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. The British comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show.

(starring redhead Leigh Francis) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. The pejorative use of the word "ginger" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the "Ginger Kids", "Le Petit Tourette", "It's a Jersey Thing" and "Fatbeard" episodes of South Park.
