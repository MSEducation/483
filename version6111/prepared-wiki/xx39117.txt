CATEGORIES: Types of country subdivisions, Special administrative structures in the United States

Special-purpose districts or special district governments in the United States are independent governmental units that exists separately from, and with substantial administrative and fiscal independence from, general purpose local governments such as county, municipal, and township governments.[tpl]cite book | last = U.S. Census Bureau | first = | authorlink = United States Census Bureau | coauthors = | title = 2002 Census of Governments, Vol 1, Number 1, Government Organization, GC02(1)-1 | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | pages = vii-viii | url = http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/gc021x1.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn = [/tpl]   As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, the term special district governments excludes school districts. In 2007, the U.S. had more than 39,000 special district governments.http://www.census.gov/govs/cog/GovOrgTab03ss.html

==Characteristics==

Special districts serve limited areas and have governing boards that accomplish legislatively assigned functions using public funds.Mitzanry, K, & Manatt, A. (2002, February).What's so special about special districts? A citizen's guide to special districts in California. 3rd. ed. p. 2.

===Areas served===

Special districts provide specialized services to persons living within the designated geographic area and may contract to provide services outside the area.  Special districts often cross the lines of towns, villages, and hamlets but less frequently cross city or county lines. Increasingly, however, regional special districts are being created that may serve a large portion of a state or portions of more than one state.

===Governing body===

Each district is governed by a board of directors, commissioners, board of supervisors, or the like. These boards may be appointed by public officials, appointed by private entities, popularly elected, or elected by benefited citizens (typically property owners). Sometimes, one or more public officials will serve as an ex officio member on the board.  
The board of a special district serves primarily as a managing board and often appoints a chief executive for day-to-day operations and decision making and policy implementation. In the New England states, special districts are often run in the same town meeting fashion as other local governments. Most districts have employees,http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/gc023x2.pdf but some districts exist solely to raise funds by issuing bonds and/or by providing tax increment financing.

===Functions===

Special districts perform many functions including airports, water ports, highways, mass transit, parking facilities, fire protection, libraries, parks, cemeteries, hospitals, irrigation, conservation, sewerage, solid waste, stadiums, water supply, electric power, and gas utility.

Most of these functions can also be provided by private companies. Most special districts provide only a single service.

==Legal basis==

Originated from English custom, special districts are authorized by state law and must have public foundation, civil office, and public accountability.

===English custom===

Special districts in the United States follow the English custom. The earliest known general law in England authorizing special purpose authorities was the Statute of Sewers of 1532.Webb, S.(1922). English local government: Statutory authorities for special purposes. p. 61. Available as e-book. Single purpose authorities created by individual charters also existed at the time. However, the early authorities were temporary and unconnected to local government structure.Webb, S.(1922). English local government: Statutory authorities for special purposes. p. 300. Available as e-book. The first laws authorizing permanent authorities connected to local governments were the Incorporated Guardians of the Poor, which were created by special acts in the 17th century.Webb, S.(1922). English local government: Statutory authorities for special purposes. p. 299. Available as e-book. Turnpike trusts were an early and popular special purpose authority in England.Webb, S.(1922). English local government: Statutory authorities for special purposes. Available as e-book.

===State law===

Special districts in the United States are founded by some level of government in accordance with state law U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. (1993, March). State laws governing local government structure and administration. page 7. (either constitutional amendment, general law, or special acts)Mitzanry, K, & Manatt, A. (2002, February) What's so special about special districts? A citizen's guide to special districts in California. 3rd. ed. p. 4. and exist in all states.  Special districts are legally separate entities with at least some corporate powers.[tpl]cite book | last = U.S. Census Bureau | first = | authorlink = United States Census Bureau | coauthors = | title = 2002 Census of Governments, Vol 1, Number 1, Government Organization, GC02(1)-1 | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | page = ix | url = http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/gc021x1.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn = [/tpl] Districts are created by legislative action, court action, or public referendum.  The procedures for creating a special district may include procedures such as petitions, hearings, voter or landowner approval, or government approval. Tribal governments may create special districts pursuant to state law and may serve on the boards of special districts.

===Public foundation===

Special districts, like all public entities, have public foundation.[ref]15A Am Jur 2d Colleges and Universities ยง 2
[/ref]16B Am Jur 2d Constitutional Law ยง 7234B M.J. CORPORATIONS ยง 26 The landmark case of the U.S. Supreme Court addressing public versus private charters was Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819.Newmyer, R. K. John Marshall and heroic age of the Supreme Court. Louisiana State University Press: Baton Rouge, 2001, pp. 244-253.  Dartmouth established the fundamental differences between public and private organizations. Critically, a government must be founded by all of the people of a governmental area or by their governental representatives.Allen v. McKean, 1 F. Cas. 489 (1833)Louisville v. University of Louisville, 54 Ky. 642 (June 1855)Ohio v. Neff, 52 Ohio St. 375, 40 N.E. 720 (1895)Currie, D. P. (1982, Fall).

AG LEXIS 17Opinion No. 1007, 1994 Minn. AG LEXIS 2

===Civil office===

Special districts possess some form of civil office, that is, the board has received a delegation of sovereign power from the state.Commissioner v. Shamberg's Estate, 144 F.2d 998 (1945) Some boards may be appointed by only landowners.Mitzanry, K, & Manatt, A. (2002, February).What's so special about special districts? A citizen's guide to special districts in California. 3rd. ed. p. 7 (box).Burns, N. The formation of American local governments: Private values in public institutions. Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 12.  Private entities may appoint some or all of the members of a special district;Scholle v. Maryland 90 Md. 729, 46 A. 736 (1900)Marks v. Frantz, 179 Ky. 638 (1956)Palm Beach County Health Care District v. Everglades Memorial Hospital 658 So. 2d 577 (Fla. 1995) however, there must be evidence of civil office. In addition to special districts with privately appointed boards, a special district may have a privately founded board;Sharpless v. Mayor 21 Pa. 147 (1853) however, such a board could not be given the power to set a tax.

===Accountability===

There is a citizen-government fiscal accountability relationship.Mead, D. M. (Winter 2002). The role of GASB 34 in the citizen-government accountability relationship. State and Local Government Review. Vol 34, No. 1 51-63. To maintain accountability for special districts, states must maintain ultimate control (the power to repeal the authorizing law at any time).Hess V. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 115 S. Ct. 394, 130 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1994)Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U.S. 472, 26 L. Ed. 197 (1880)Palm Beach County Health Care District v. Everglades Memorial Hospital, 658 So. 2d 577 (Fla. 1995)Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30,115 S. Ct. 394, 130 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1994)Vogt v. Orleans Levee District, 294 F.3d 684 (5th Cir. 2002)Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 136, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964) Due to of public foundation and, thus, ultimate control, the state can freely delegate sovereign power (such as the power to tax) to special districts and can allow them to act autonomously with little supervision.

==History==

There is little information available on the earliest special districts in the United States. It is known that park districts existed in the 18th century. Toll road and canal corporations existed in the 19th century.Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. (1964, May). The problem special districts in American government. Washington, DC UNT Digital Library The first general statute authorizing irrigation districts was adopted by California in 1887.Bollens, J. C. (1957). Special district government in the United States. University of California Press, pp. 142-144. The U.S. Census Bureau began identifying and collecting data on special districts in 1942.under construction

==Trends==

"Services once supplied by cities are increasingly supplied by special districts."Burns, N. The formation of American local governments: Private values in public institutions. Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 10.  Legislatures increasingly authorize special districts that perform a variety of functions. Regional special districts are increasingly created.
The state of California leads the nation in the number of special districts with Illinois close behind.  State counts of their special districts may differ from the federal count because the states may have different definitions of a special district than the U.S. Census Bureau.

==Examples==

All of the following examples have been found by the U.S. Census Bureau to be special districts.U.S. Census Bureau 2007 Census of Governments Governments Organization  See the Census of Governments Government Organization publications at a depository library or visit http://www.census.gov and select Governments Division.
