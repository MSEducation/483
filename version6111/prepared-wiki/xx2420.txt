[[Chomsky normal form]]

CATEGORIES: Formal languages, Noam Chomsky

In formal language theory, a context-free grammar is said to be in Chomsky normal form (named for Noam Chomsky) if all of its production rules are of the form:

==Alternative definition==

===Chomsky reduced form===

Another way to define the Chomsky normal form (e.g., Hopcroft and Ullman 1978, and Hopcroft et al. 2006) is:
A formal grammar is in Chomsky reduced form if all of its production rules are of the form:

===Floyd normal form===

In a paper where he proposed a term Backus-Naur Form (BNF) , Donald E. Knuth implied a BNF "syntax in which all definitions have such a form may be said to be in "Floyd Normal Form","
because Robert W. Floyd found any BNF syntax can be converted to the above one in 1961.Donald E. Knuth. 1964. Backus Normal Form vs. Backus Naur Form. Communications of the ACM, 7(12):735–736, December. But he withdrew this term, "since doubtless many people have independently used this simple fact in their own work, and the point is only incidental to the main considerations of Floyd's note."

==Converting a grammar to Chomsky Normal Form==

==Application==

Besides its theoretical significance, CNF conversion is used in some algorithms as a preprocessing step, e.g., the CYK algorithm, a bottom-up parsing for context-free grammars, and its variant probabilistic CKY.Jurafsky and Martin, 2008. p. 465.
