The Iberian Romance  or Ibero-Romance languages[tpl]cite book |author=David A. Pharies|title=A Brief History of the Spanish Language|publisher= University of Chicago Press|year=2007 |page=13|isbn= 978-0-226-66683-9[/tpl] are the Romance languages that developed on the Iberian Peninsula, an area consisting primarily of Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar and Andorra, and in southern France.
Originating in Iberia, the most widely spoken Iberian Romance languages are Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Galician.Ethnologue: Statistical Summaries These languages also have their own regional and local dialects.  Based on mutual intelligibility, Dalby counts seven languages: Portuguese, Spanish, Asturian-Leonese, Aragonese, Catalan, Provençal, and Gascon.David Dalby, 1999/2000, The Linguasphere register of the world’s languages and speech communities.

==Origins and development==

Like all Romance languages,[tpl]cite book |author=Sarah Thomason|title=Language Contact|publisher= Georgetown University Press|year=2001 |page=263|isbn= 978-0-87840-854-2[/tpl] the Iberian Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin. Vulgar Latin was the nonstandard (in contrast to Classical Latin) form of the Latin language spoken by soldiers and merchants throughout the Roman Empire. With the expansion of the empire, Vulgar Latin came to be spoken by inhabitants of the various Roman-controlled territories. Latin and its descendants have been spoken in Iberia since the Punic Wars, when the Romans conquered the territory[tpl]cite book |author=Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2008 |page=1020|isbn=978-0-08-087774-7[/tpl] (see Roman conquest of Hispania).

==Family tree==

The Iberian Romance languages are conventional Romance languages, many authors use the term in a geographical sense, although they are not necessarily phylogenetic . Phylogenetically, there is a disagreement about whether what languages should be considered within the Iberian Romance group; for example, some authors consider that the East Iberian, also called Occitano-Romance, could be more closely related to languages of northern Italy. A common conventional geographical grouping is the following:
In what follows we will use the conventional sign † for extinct languages.
