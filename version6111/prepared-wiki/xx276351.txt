[[Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program]]

CATEGORIES: Sustainable energy, Environmental organizations based in the United States

The Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program is an initiative focused on converting public and private fleet vehicles from gasoline to propane autogas in the Southeastern United States. It is the largest Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle conversion deployment program in history. The program is partially funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) through the United States Department of Energy Clean Cities Coalition.[tpl]cite web|title=DOE Offers $300 Million in Recovery Act Funds for Clean Cities Program|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12476|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]

==Overview==

The Program is converting approximately 1,100 vehicles from gasoline to propane autogas and implementing more than twenty propane autogas fueling stations.[tpl]cite web|title=Virgina [tpl]sic|nolink=y[/tpl] Clean Cities Helps Convert 1,000+ Vehicles to Propane Autogas|url=http://www.government-fleet.com/News/Story/2011/05/Virgina-Clean-Cities-Helps-Fleets-Convert-1-000-Vehicles-to-Propane-Autogas.aspx|publisher=Government Fleet|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] The program is administered by Virginia Clean Cities and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and is partially funded by an $8.6 million grant from the ARRA. The Program’s website states that "under this large-scale initiative, public and private fleet vehicles in Washington D.C. and nine southeast states ... will be converted to propane autogas in order to reduce vehicle emissions, displace gasoline consumption and create American jobs."[tpl]cite web|title=About This Program|url=http://www.usepropaneautogas.com/about-this-program/|work=usepropaneautogas.com|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]

==Program goals==

The Program’s stated goals include:
The program has several types of public and private fleet participants, including law enforcement, municipal, and transportation service fleets, that are converting anywhere between 5 and 300 of their fleet vehicles to propane autogas. The vehicles are equipped with the PRINS VSI system and are bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they can switch from propane autogas to gasoline.[tpl]cite web|title=Vehicle Conversion|url=http://www.allianceautogas.com/fleets/vehicle-conversion/|publisher=Alliance AutoGas[/tpl] Some fleets estimate they will save more than $100,000 in fuel costs annually with propane autogas.[tpl]cite news|last=Thomas|first=Amanda|title=Fuel conversion means big savings for sheriff’s office|url=http://www.times-georgian.com/view/full_story/12033255/article-Fauel-conversion-means-big-savings-for-sheriff%E2??s-office?instance=TG_home_story_offset|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Times-Georgian|date=March 2, 2011[/tpl]   Additionally, autogas is a cleaner-burning transportation fuel and up to 90 percent of the U.S. supply is domestically produced.[tpl]cite web|title=Why Autogas|url=http://autogasforamerica.org/why-autogas/made-in-america|publisher=Autogas for America|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
