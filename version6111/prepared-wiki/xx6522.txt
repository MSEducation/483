[[Lie algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Lie algebras

In mathematics, Lie algebras ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː[/tpl], not [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ[/tpl]) are algebraic structures which were introduced to study the concept of infinitesimal transformations. The term "Lie algebra" (after Sophus Lie) was introduced by Hermann Weyl in the 1930s. In older texts, the name "infinitesimal group" is used.
Related mathematical concepts include Lie groups and differentiable manifolds.

A representation is said to be faithful if its kernel is trivial. Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra has a faithful representation on a finite-dimensional vector space (Ado's theorem).[tpl]harvnb|Jacobson|1962|loc=Ch. VI[/tpl]

==Structure theory and classification==

Lie algebras can be classified to some extent. In particular, this has an application to the classification of Lie groups.

===Abelian, nilpotent, and solvable===

Analogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, defined in terms of the derived subgroups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.

becomes zero eventually.
Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra has a unique maximal solvable ideal, called its radical. Under the Lie correspondence, nilpotent (respectively, solvable) connected Lie groups correspond to nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie algebras.

===Simple and semisimple===

A Lie algebra is "simple" if it has no non-trivial ideals and is not abelian.
The concept of semisimplicity for Lie algebras is closely related with the complete reducibility (semisimplicity) of their representations. When the ground field F has characteristic zero, any finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is semisimple (i.e., direct sum of irreducible representations.) In general, a Lie algebra is called reductive if the adjoint representation is semisimple. Thus, a semisimple Lie algebra is reductive.

===Cartan's criterion===

===Classification===

The Levi decomposition expresses an arbitrary Lie algebra as a semidirect sum of its solvable radical and a semisimple Lie algebra, almost in a canonical way. Furthermore, semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field have been completely classified through their root systems. However, the classification of solvable Lie algebras is a 'wild' problem, and cannot[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2009[/tpl] be accomplished in general.

==Relation to Lie groups==

Although Lie algebras are often studied in their own right, historically they arose as a means to study Lie groups.
Lie's fundamental theorems describe a relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras. In particular, any Lie group gives rise to a canonically determined Lie algebra (concretely, the tangent space at the identity); and, conversely, for any Lie algebra there is a corresponding connected Lie group (Lie's third theorem; see the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula). This Lie group is not determined uniquely; however, any two connected Lie groups with the same Lie algebra are locally isomorphic, and in particular, have the same universal cover. For instance, the special orthogonal group SO(3) and the special unitary group SU(2) give rise to the same Lie algebra, which is isomorphic to R3 with the cross-product, while SU(2) is a simply-connected twofold cover of SO(3).
Some examples of Lie algebras corresponding to Lie groups are the following:
Given a set of generators [tpl]math|Ta[/tpl], the structure constants [tpl]math|f abc[/tpl]  express the Lie brackets of pairs of generators as linear combinations of generators from the set, i.e., [tpl]math|Tb [tpl]=[/tpl] f abc Tc[/tpl]. The structure constants determine the Lie brackets of elements of the Lie algebra, and consequently nearly completely determine the group structure of the Lie group.  The structure of the Lie group near the identity element is displayed explicitly by the  Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, an expansion in Lie algebra elements [tpl]math|X, Y[/tpl] and their Lie brackets, all nested together within a single exponent,  [tpl]math|exp(tX) exp(tY) [tpl]=[/tpl] exp(tX+tY+½ t2''X,Y  + O(t3) )[/tpl]. 
The mapping from Lie groups to Lie algebras is functorial, which implies that homomorphisms of Lie groups lift to homomorphisms of Lie algebras, and various properties are satisfied by this lifting: it commutes with composition, it maps Lie subgroups, kernels, quotients and cokernels of Lie groups to subalgebras, kernels, quotients and cokernels of Lie algebras, respectively.
The functor L which takes each Lie group to its Lie algebra and each homomorphism to its differential is  faithful and exact.  It is however not an equivalence of categories: different Lie groups may have isomorphic Lie algebras (for example SO(3) and SU(2) ),  and there are (infinite dimensional) Lie algebras that are not associated to any Lie group.[tpl]harvnb|Beltita|2005|loc=pg. 75[/tpl]
The universal cover group above can be constructed as the image of the Lie algebra under the exponential map.  More generally, we have that the Lie algebra is homeomorphic to a neighborhood of the identity.  But globally, if the Lie group is compact, the exponential will not be injective, and if the Lie group is not connected, simply connected or compact, the exponential map need not be surjective.
If the Lie algebra is infinite-dimensional, the issue is more subtle.  In many instances, the exponential map is not even locally a homeomorphism (for example, in Diff(S1), one may find diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not in the image of exp).  Furthermore, some infinite-dimensional Lie algebras are not the Lie algebra of any group.
The correspondence between Lie algebras and Lie groups is used in several ways, including in the classification of Lie groups and the related matter of the representation theory of Lie groups.  Every representation of a Lie algebra lifts uniquely to a representation of the corresponding connected, simply connected Lie group, and conversely every representation of any Lie group induces a representation of the group's Lie algebra; the representations are in one to one correspondence.  Therefore, knowing the representations of a Lie algebra settles the question of representations of the group.
As for classification, it can be shown that any connected Lie group with a given Lie algebra is isomorphic to the universal cover mod a discrete central subgroup.  So classifying Lie groups becomes simply a matter of counting the discrete subgroups of the center, once the classification of Lie algebras is known (solved by Cartan et al. in the semisimple case).

==Category theoretic definition==

Using the language of category theory, a Lie algebra can be defined as an object A in Veck, the category of vector spaces over a field k of characteristic not 2, together with a morphism .,.: A ⊗ A → A, where ⊗ refers to the monoidal product of Veck, such that
where τ (a ⊗ b) :=  b ⊗ a and σ is the cyclic permutation braiding (id ⊗ τA,A) ° (τA,A ⊗ id). In diagrammatic form:
