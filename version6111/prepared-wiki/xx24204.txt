There was a bid for the 1992 [[Olympic Games]] and another proposal was to turn the Docklands into a technology city known as the [[Multifunction Polis]] (MFP).<ref name=dovey-fluid-city/>

===Third term===

The Cain government was narrowly re-elected to a third term in 1988, but immediately after the election a huge shortfall in the government's workers' compensation scheme, WorkCare, was revealed. 
The collapse of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, a venture-capital fund that tried to pick winners but racked up huge losses. The VEDC and its sister, the Victorian Investment Corporation, were created to back new industries to replace outdated smokestack manufacturers. The VEDC collapsed under poor management and an absence of political accountability after it had provided $450 million of loan and equity assistance to business.[tpl]Citation |last=Elias |first=David |title=VEDC: the ghost that still talks |newspaper=The Age |date=2005-09-08 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/vedc-the-ghost-that-still-talks/2005/09/07/1125772584230.html |accessdate=2011-03-28[/tpl]
This was followed by a budgetary crisis that the government was unable to deal with, partly because of the large spending programmes the government had previously instituted, partly because he was unable to obtain support from within his government for necessary spending reductions and also because the federal Government declined to "bail out" the Victorian government as they believed Cain's overspending was significantly to blame. The deputy premier Robert Fordham took some of the blame and resigned. This led to the elevation of Joan Kirner to deputy premier.
His refusal to back down over banning tobacco advertising forced the Australian motorcycle Grand Prix to relocate from Phillip Island to Eastern Creek in Sydney.
For 33 days from 1 January 1990, 250 trams were parked in Melbourne's CBD streets by tram drivers. The Cain government wanted to save $24 million a year, by the introduction of a  new Met Ticket system - or scratchies as they were colloquially known. Scratch tickets were supposed to save money by cutting 550 ticket conductor jobs and 550 train station staff. The trams did not move because the government shut down the power grid.[tpl]Citation |last=Lucas |first=Clay |title=Back to days when trams stood still |newspaper=The Age |date=2010-01-16 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/back-to-days-when-trams-stood-still-20100115-mckl.html |accessdate=2011-03-28[/tpl]
In February 1990 it was rumoured that Pyramid, a privately owned (but government regulated) building society, was in difficulties. Ministers in Cain's government accepted assurances from Pyramid directors that the society's position was sound, and passed these assurances on to the public. In fact the society was insolvent. When it failed, causing thousands of investors and depositors to lose their money, the government was blamed by investors and the media. This was followed shortly after by the collapse of Tricontinental Bank, which threatened to bankrupt the Victorian Government owned State Bank, Victoria's largest financial institution. The bank eventually had to be sold to the Commonwealth Bank, which was shortly thereafter privatised by the federal government. These disasters permanently ruined Cain's reputation for financial management.
By this time Cain was becoming frustrated at the reluctance of his government's caucus members to approve his plans for tax rises and spending cuts to reduce the growing budget deficit. He issued an ultimatum at the Labor Party Conference to "back me or sack me." When the undermining of his position continued, he resigned on 7 August 1990. During an interview after his resignation, he remarked, "We appointed a few dills but we weren't crook."  Joan Kirner was elected Labor leader in Cain's place and became the first female premier of Victoria.  Cain retired from Parliament at the 1992 Victorian state election, which Labor lost.

==Life after Parliament==

Cain became a Professorial Fellow in politics at the University of Melbourne in 1991, and has since completed three books. In 2004 he surfaced in the media with a damning critique of the University of Melbourne's experimentation with what he says are risky financial ventures and what he argues is its departure from its public mission. Off Course: From Public Place to Marketplace at Melbourne University attracted a range of critical commentary. He is a regular political commentator on local radio. He has remained active in the affairs of the Victorian Labor Party, and has recently  been critical of what he sees as the dominance of factions in the party, particularly the Labor Right. He is one of the ALP's Dispute Tribunal members, a panel of three people from which one is selected randomly to adjudicate internal party disputes. Some members have expressed concern that his public statements on factions means that he has prejudged disputes that could appear before him.
John Cain sits on the board of the MCG Trust. He is also a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria.
