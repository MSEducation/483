[[Layla bint Harmalah]]

CATEGORIES: Non-Muslim interactants with Muslims during Muhammad's era, 6th-century women

Layla bint Harmalah also known as [tpl]transl|sem|Al-Nābiġah[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|النابغة[/tpl]) was the mother of the prominent Sahaba Amr ibn al-A'as.

==Shi'a view==

In the Shia work Nahj al-Balagha or Peak of Eloquence, Ali is quoted as saying:
"Al-Nabighah" is the nickname of the mother of Amr ibn al-A'as according to many Shias. He is called "son of his mother" because of his mother's reputation: once Arwa bint al-Harith went to Muawiyah and during their conversation Amr ibn al-A'as intervened. Arwa said to Amr:

==Sunni view==

Sunnis tend to stay away from blackening the names of Sahabah and their relatives. Furthermore, Sunnis maintain that slandering anyone is an unjust act, pointing to the Quranic verse 4:15
"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way."
And they maintain that because there wasn't four eye-witnesses (let alone one) of Layla having commit adultery as is alleged by Shia apologetics against her, that it is unjust to simply believe in some unsubstantiated rumors. No Sahih Sunni hadiths mention these allegations against Layla, which are found almost entirely in either Shia traditions which were collected after the main Sunni ones or are found in certain da'if and mawdoo hadiths which aren't reliable. However, it is also possible that the five visited her separately and it was not a Nikah Ijtimah.
