==Content==

Aimed at the geek demographic, Planet Nerd offers a variation on the variety show format, with host Dan Walmsley acting as an anchor, sometimes accompanied by one of the other presenters, throwing to various segments which include documentaries, reviews and sketches. Each week the hosting segments are filmed in a different context, often forming a series of linked sketches themselves.

===Documentaries===

Aside from the overt comedic content, Planet Nerd also features original, semi-serious documentary segments which explore and celebrate various facets of geek culture. Subjects have included the roleplaying and wargaming convention Arcanacon, RoboGames, Sony's Wonder Technology Lab and National ICT Australia. A similar semi-regular segment is "Geek of the Week", in which a subject is interviewed by Ben McKenzie about their nerdy hobbies or profession.
Footage of John Carnack's presentation at Apple Computer's 2007 World Wide Developer's Conference was posted by Planet Nerd on YouTube, resulting in over 43,000 views, making the programme the number one watched comedian on YouTube for 12 June 2007.Point and Shoot to Stardom on Dan Walmsley's blog

===Reviews===

Paul Verhoeven reviews recent films in an anarchic sketch-based format, concentrating on genre films like Michael Bay's Transformers. Rob Lloyd's "One Minute DVD Review" awards scores out of "Seven Samurai", and instead of new releases focusses on classics, including box sets of early Doctor Who (The Beginning), The Muppet Show and the films of Harold Lloyd.

==Response==

Planet Nerd has gathered some positive press, most notably in an article in the The Age newspaper's Green Guide about Channel 31 programming, in which Marieke Hardy referred to the show as "magically dorky" and "adorably earnest".[tpl]Cite web| title = 31 Reasons for Hope| publisher = The Age| author = Marieke Hardy| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/06/27/1182623916399.html| date = 28 June 2007| accessdate = 2007-07-11[/tpl]
Australian technology web site Gizmodo reported on a Planet Nerd publicity stunt in which they celebrated the release of the iPhone by selling an obviously fake over-sized cardboard iPhone (a prop from the first episode) on eBay.[tpl]Cite web| title = Idiot: eBayer 'stall4u' pays $29 for cardboard iPhone| publisher = Gizmodo| url = http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2007/07/idiot_ebayer_stall4u_pays_29_f.html| date = 9 July 2007| accessdate = 2007-07-11[/tpl]
