The station was situated at the southern end of Station Road which still exists. The station was later operated by the London Midland and Scottish Railway and was closed by the London Midland Region of British Railways on 3 July 1961.
The main station building was a substantial brick-built structure located on the east (southbound) side of the line. A footbridge led across the twin railway tracks to the northbound platform which was provided with a smaller brick-built shelter. Station staff could use a wooden boarded crossing at the north end of the facility.

The station was served by local trains from Manchester Central to Cheadle Heath and to Stockport Tiviot Dale; also by secondary stopping trains from Derby.
