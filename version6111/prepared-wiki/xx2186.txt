==Practices and worship==

Christadelphians are organised into local congregations, that commonly call themselves ecclesias,[tpl]cite book | last =Hyndman  | first =Rob | title =The Christadelphians (Brothers and Sisters in Christ): Introducing a Bible-based Community | publisher =Bethel Publications | year =1999 | location =Beechworth, VIC | url =http://robjhyndman.com/christadelphians/ | isbn =81-87409-34-7 [/tpl] which is taken from usage in the New Testamente.g. see Greek of Acts 5:11; 7:38 and is Greek for gathering of those summoned.[tpl]cite book |title=Ecclesia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=3 February 2009 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177746/Ecclesia |accessdate= [/tpl] Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of the death and celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the taking part in the "memorial service". Additional meetings are often organised for worship, prayer, preaching and Bible study.
Ecclesias are typically involved in preaching the gospel (evangelism) in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching,Examples of lecture titles on Handsworth Christadelphians website college-style seminars on reading the Bible,For example: Learn to Read the Bible Effectively and Bible Reading Groups. Correspondence coursesFor example: This is Your Bible[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013|bot=WildBot[/tpl] are also used widely, particularly in areas where there is no established Christadelphian presence. Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video,For example: Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society (CALS) videos, Williamsburgh Christadelphian Foundation (WCF) videos, the Christadelphians of Southern California's videos, and Christadelphian YouPreach on YouTube. podcastsFor example: Washwood Heath Christadelphians' podcasts, Bible Study Podcasts and Search for Hope podcasts. and internet forums.For example: Open Bible Forum, Bible Discussion Forum and Bible Truth Discussion Forum There are also a number of Bible Education/Learning Centres around the world.For example, the Bible Learning Centre in the Broadmarsh Shopping Centre, Nottingham (UK); Solihull Bible Learning Centre (UK); Dandenong Bible Education Centre, Melbourne (Aus.); Castle Hill Bible Education Centre, Sydney (Aus.); Liverpool Bible Education Centre, South-western Sydney (Aus.); the Mustard Seed Bible Education Centre, Adelaide (Aus.); Urbana Bible Education Center, Champaign County, Illinois (USA); Durban Bible Education Centre (SA). There are also other BECs in SA, Cambodia and India.
Only baptised (by complete immersion in water) believers are considered members of the ecclesia. Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a "good confession" (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements - "first principles" - of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian Sunday Schools and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings. Many ecclesias organise holidays for young people, the most popular form in the UK being camping holidays and Youth Weekends such as Swanwick and others locally organised by different ecclesias.
Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members.[ref]
</ref> Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, are expected to cover their heads (using hat or scarf, etc.) during formal services, and do not sit on the main ecclesial arranging (organising) committees. They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday Schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.
There are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated preaching, youth and Sunday School work, conscientious objection issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.
Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military (and Police forces) because they are conscientious objectors.[tpl]cite book | last =Norris | first =Alfred | title =The Gospel and Strife | publisher =Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/norris_gospelandstrife.doc[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last =Watkins | first =Peter | title =War and Politics: The Christian's Duty | publisher =Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/watkins_warandpoliticsthechristiansduty.doc [/tpl]
Christadelphians do not vote in political elections, as they take direction from Romans 13:1-4, which they interpret as meaning that God puts into power those leaders He deems worthy.  To vote for a candidate that does not win an election would be considered to vote against God's will.  To avoid the risk of such conflict, Christadelphians abstain from voting.
There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study'They are characterized by holding a firm belief in the inspired status of the Bible and place enormous emphasis upon biblical study', Evans, John S, 'The Prophecies of Daniel 2', page 251, USA:Xulon Press (2008) [tpl]*[/tpl]'Christadelphian devotion centers on daily Bible study and weekly meetings', page 421, Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey W, 'The Encyclopedia of Christianity', USA:Wm.

===Hymnody and music===

Christadelphians are a non-liturgical denomination. Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose. However, in the English-speaking world, there tends to be a great deal of uniformity in order of service and hymnody.
Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the Scottish Psalter and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and John Newton.  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997
The earliest hymn book published was the "Sacred Melodist" which was published by Benjamin Wilson in Geneva, Illinois in 1860.[tpl]cite book |first=Rachel |last=Hocking |title=A Study of Christadelphian Hymnody: singing with the spirit and with the understanding |date=2000, 7 |url= http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |accessdate= [/tpl] The next was the hymn book published for the use of Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God (an early name for Christadelphians)Peter Hemingray, John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith 2003 p. 235 by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.Andrew Wilson, History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination 1997 p. 326 In 1865 Robert Roberts published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called The Golden Harp (which was subtitled "Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'").Peter Hemingray, John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith 2003 p. 195 This was replaced only five years later by the first "Christadelphian Hymn Book" (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew,Ambassador of the Coming Age Vol. 6, P. 148 and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/acatalog/2002HymnBooks.html |title=The CMPA online bookshop |publisher=Thechristadelphian.com |accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013|bot=WildBot[/tpl] which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.
Some ecclesias use the Praise the Lord songbook.Praise the Lord (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000) It was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available.  Another publication, the "Worship" book[tpl]cite web |title=Worship |work=Worship Book Committee, NCC, 2008, 2010 |url=http://www.theworshipbook.com |publisher=Theworshipbook.com |accessdate= [/tpl] is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, etc) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.
In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bandsAn example is the Christadelphian folk rock band Fisher's Tale (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship) and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.
In other countries, hymnbooks have been produced in local languages,e.g. Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus (Holland, circa 1980) sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture.  It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997
