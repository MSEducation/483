Hani Saleh Hasan Hanjour ([tpl]lang-ar|هاني صالح حسن حنجور[/tpl], [tpl]transl|ar|Hānī Ṣāliḥ Ḥasan Ḥanjūr[/tpl]; August 13, 1972[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 11, 2001) was the Saudi Arabian hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, crashing the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks.
Hanjour first came to the United States in 1991, enrolling at the University of Arizona, where he studied English for a few months before returning to Saudi Arabia early the next year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] This was prior to any intentions for a large-scale attack.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] He came back to the United States in 1996, studying English in California before he began taking flying lessons in Arizona.Hanjour arrived back in the United States in December 2000.  He joined up with Nawaf al-Hazmi in San Diego, and they immediately left for Arizona where Hanjour took refresher pilot training.  In April 2001, they relocated to Falls Church, Virginia and then Paterson, New Jersey in late May where Hanjour took additional flight training.
Hanjour returned to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area on September 2, 2001, checking into a motel in Laurel, Maryland. On September 11, 2001, Hanjour boarded American Airlines Flight 77, took control of the aircraft after his team of hijackers helped subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew, and flew the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers on board the aircraft and 125 people in the Pentagon.

==Early life and education==

Hanjour was the fourth of seven children,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] born to a food-supply businessman in Ta’if, Saudi Arabia, near Mecca.  During his youth, Hanjour wanted to drop out of school to become a flight attendant, although his brother Abdulrahman discouraged this route, and tried to help him focus on his studies.[tpl]cite news |title=Hanjour a Study in Paradox, Suspect's Brother: 'We Thought He Liked the USA' |publisher=The Washington Post |date=October 15, 2001 |last=Goldstein |first=Amy |coauthors=Lena H. Sun and George Lardner Jr. |page=A01[/tpl]
According to his eldest brother, Hanjour traveled to Afghanistan in the late 1980s as a teenager to participate in the conflict against the Soviet Union. The Soviets had already withdrawn by the time he arrived in the country and he instead worked for a relief agency.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch7.htm |title=The 9/11 Commission Report |chapter=Chapter 7 – The Attack Looms |publisher=The 9/11 Commission |year=2004 |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early 1990s===

Hanjour first came to the United States in 1991 to study English at the University of Arizona's Center for English as a Second Language. Hanjour's eldest brother Abdulrahman helped him apply to the eight-week program, and found a room in Tucson, Arizona for Hanjour near the Islamic Center of Tucson. Hanjour arrived for the English language program on October 3, 1991, and stayed until early February 1992, when he returned to Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement for the Record - FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III |work=Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry |publisher=Federation of American Scientists (FAS) |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl] Hanjour was the only hijacker to visit the United States prior to any intentions for a large-scale attack and he was not part of the Hamburg cell in Germany.
Over the next five years, Hanjour remained in Saudi Arabia, helping the family manage a lemon and date farm near Ta'if.  His family often reminded Hanjour that he was getting past the age where he ought to get married and start a family, but Hanjour insisted he wanted to settle down more.  While in Saudi Arabia, Hanjour applied for a job with Saudi Arabian Airlines, but was turned down due to poor grades. The airline told Hanjour they would consider him if he obtained a commercial pilot's license in the United States.

===1996===

In April 1996, Hanjour returned to the United States, staying with family friends, Susan and Adnan Khalil, in Miramar, Florida for a month before heading to Oakland, California to study English and attend flight school.[tpl]cite news |title=Man Traveled Across U.S. In His Quest to Be a Pilot|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EFDF153BF93BA2575AC0A9679C8B63 |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 18, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |last=Chen |first=David W.[/tpl]Hanjour obtained a visa in March 1996, and arrived in the United States on April 2, 1996.

The flight school also arranged for Hanjour to stay with a host family, with whom he moved in with on May 20, 1996.FBI Hijackers' Timeline Hanjour completed the English program in August, and in early September 1996, he attended a single day of ground school courses at the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics before withdrawing, citing financial worries about the $35,000 cost.
Hanjour left Oakland in September and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, paying $4,800 for lessons at CRM Flight Cockpit Resource Management in Scottsdale.  Receiving poor marks, Hanjour dropped out of flight school, and returned to Saudi Arabia at the end of November 1996.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf |title=Hijackers' Timeline |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=NEFA Foundation |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |page=12 |format=PDF[/tpl]

===Late 1990s===

Hanjour re-entered the United States on November 16, 1997,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf |title=Hijackers' Timeline |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=NEFA Foundation |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |page=14 |format=PDF[/tpl] taking additional English courses in Florida, then returning to Phoenix where he shared an apartment with Bandar al-Hazmi.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/13/AR2007081300752.html |title=Mysterious Trip to Flight 77 Cockpit; Suicide Pilot's Conversion to Radical Islam Remains Obscure |last=Fainaru |first=Steve |coauthors=Alia Ibrahim |date=September 10, 2002 |work=The Washington Post |pages=A17 |accessdate=September 2, 2010[/tpl] In December, he resumed training at CRM Flight Cockpit Resource Management for a few weeks, before pursuing training at Arizona Aviation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf |title=Hijackers' Timeline |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=NEFA Foundation |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |page=15 |format=PDF[/tpl]
Bandar al-Hazmi and Hanjour stayed in Arizona, continued taking flight lessons at Arizona Aviation throughout 1998 and early 1999.  After moving out of Bandar's place in March, Hanjour lived in several apartments in Tempe, Mesa and Phoenix.FBI Hijackers' Timeline, p. 16—41
In February, financial records showed that Hanjour had taken a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada.FBI Hijackers' Timeline, p. 18  In addition to flight training at Arizona Aviation, Hanjour enrolled in flight simulator classes at the Sawyer School of Aviation where he made only three or four visits. Lotfi Raissi would begin taking lessons at the same school a month after Hanjour quit, part of what piqued the FBI's interest in Raissi.
An FBI informant named Aukai Collins claims he told the FBI about Hanjour's activities during 1998, giving them Hanjour's name and phone number, and warning them that more and more foreign-born Muslims seem to be taking flying lessons. The FBI admits it paid Collins to monitor the Islamic and Arab communities in Phoenix at the time, but denies Collins told them anything about Hanjour.http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/ap052402.htmlhttp://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/foxnews052402.html
Hanjour gained his FAA commercial pilot certificate in April 1999, getting a "satisfactory" rating from the examiner.[tpl]cite news |title=For Agent in Phoenix, the Cause of Many Frustrations Extended to His Own Office |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10711FC3C5B0C7A8DDDAF0894DA404482  |date=June 19, 2002 |work=The New York Times | first1=Jim | last1=Yardley | first2=Jo | last2=Thomas | accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl]  Hanjour's bank records indicate that he travelled to Ontario, Canada in March 1999 for an unknown reason.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
He traveled to Saudi Arabia to get a job working with Saudi Arabian Airlines as a commercial pilot but was rejected by a civil aviation school in Jeddah. His brother, Yasser, relayed that Hanjour, frustrated, "turned his attention toward religious texts and cassette tapes of militant Islamic preachers."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1.shtml | work=The Boston Globe[/tpl] He told his family in late 1999 he was heading to the United Arab Emirates to find work. However, it is likely that he headed to Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan.

===2000===

In May 2000, a third person accompanied Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar to Sorbi's Flying Club where he waited on the ground as they took a flight lesson. It has been theorized this may have been Hanjour.
In September Hanjour again sent his $110 registration to the ELS Language Center which leased space on Holy Names College campus in Oakland, California to continue his English studies.  He also applied for another U.S. Student Visa.  Although he was accepted, after the attacks, it would be reported that his Visa application was 'suspicious'.  Granted a F-1 student visa in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, September 2000,  he failed to reveal that he had previously traveled to the U.S.  He never turned up for classes at the ELS Language Center, and when the school contacted its Saudi representative, he reported that he could not find Hanjour either.
On December 5, Hanjour opened a CitiBank account in Deira, Dubai.  On the 8th Hanjour is recorded flying into the Cincinnati, Ohio/N. Kentucky airport and was thought to be later meeting with Nawaf al-Hazmi in San Diego.

===2001===

Hanjour came back to San Diego in December 2000, frequently visiting Abdussattar Shaikh's house, which was shared with Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid Almihdhar.  During this time Hanjour may have visited the San Diego Zoo in February, as a security guard recalls having to page his name to reclaim a lost briefcase containing cash and Arabic documents and later recognized his photograph. Shortly afterwards, the three hijackers moved out of Shaikh's house to Falls Church, Virginia.
ELS Language Center on Oakland said Hanjour reached a level of proficiency sufficient to “survive very well in the English language”. However, in January 2001, Arizona JetTech flight school managers reported him to the FAA at least five times because his English was inadequate for the commercial pilot’s certificate he had already obtained.  It took him five hours to complete an oral exam meant to last just two hours, said Peggy Chevrette. Hanjour failed UA English classes with a 0.26 GPA and a JetTech manager said “He could not fly at all.”  His FAA certificate had become invalid late in 1999 when he failed to take a mandatory medical examination. In February, Hanjour began advanced simulator training in Mesa, Arizona.
He and Hazmi moved out of Mesa at the end of March, and by April 3, 2001, they were in Virginia and at Falls Church by April 4, 2001. Falls Church was the location of the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. 
Anwar Al-Awlaki was the recently appointed new Imam who Hazmi had met with in San Diego.Imam Anwar Al Awlaki - A Leader in Need; Cageprisoners.com, November 8, 2006, accessed June 7, 2007Sherwell, Philip, and Spillius, Alex, "Fort Hood shooting: Texas army killer linked to September 11 terrorists; Major Nidal Malik Hasan worshipped at a mosque led by a radical imam said to be a "spiritual adviser" to three of the hijackers who attacked America on Sept 11, 2001," Daily Telegraph, November 7, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009
At the mosque, Hanjour and Hazmi soon met Eyad Alrababah, a Jordanian who later pled guilty to document fraud and was deported. They had told him that they were looking for an apartment to rent, and he found a friend who rented them an apartment in Alexandria where they stayed. On April 4, 2001, Hanjour asked to forward his utility deposits to 3159 Row Street Falls Church VA, which was same address as the mosque.http://www.scribd.com/doc/13120414/-FBI-Summary-about-Alleged-Flight-77-Hijacker-Hani-Hanjour FBI Summary
When police raided the Hamburg apartment of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (the "20th hijacker") while investigating the 9/11 attacks, Awlaki's telephone number was found among Binalshibh's personal contact information.Al-Haj, Ahmed, and Abu-Nasr, Donna, "US imam who communicated with Fort Hood suspect wanted in Yemen on terror suspicions," Associated Press, November 11, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009
On May 2, 2001, two new roommates joined them in Virginia: Moqed and Ahmed al-Ghamdi, both of whom had just flown into the United States from the Middle East.
Alrababah later suggested they all go together to look at apartments in Fairfield, Connecticut. On May 8, Alrababah, Hanjour, Hazmi, Moqed and Ghamdi traveled to Fairfield to look for housing. While there, they also called several local flight schools. They then travelled briefly to Paterson to look at that area as well. Rababah has contended that, after this trip, he never saw any of the men again.
Sometime at the end of May 2001, Hanjour rented a one-bedroom apartment in Paterson, New Jersey. He lived there with at least one roommate and was visited by several other hijackers, including Mohamed Atta. During his time in New Jersey, he and Hazmi rented 3 different cars including a sedan in June that Hanjour cosigned with the alias "Hani Saleh Hassan". He later made his last phone call to his family back in Saudi Arabia, during which he claimed to be phoning from a payphone in the United Arab Emirates, where he was supposedly still working.
Hanjour, along with at least five other future hijackers, is thought to have traveled to Las Vegas several times in mid-2001, where they reportedly drank alcohol, gambled, and practiced other forms of vice.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/10/04/MN102970.DTL | title=Agents of terror leave their mark on Sin City / Las Vegas workers recall the men they can't forget | first=Kevin | last=Fagan | date=October 4, 2001 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl]
On August 1, Hanjour and Almihdhar returned to Falls Church to obtain fraudulent documentation at a 7-Eleven convenience store where an illegal side business operated for such a service. There they met Luis Martinez-Flores, himself also an illegal immigrant, who agreed to help them for a $100 fee. They drove together to a DMV office at a mall in nearby Springfield, Virginia, where Martinez-Flores gave them a false address in Falls Church to use, and signed legal forms attesting that they lived there. Hanjour and Almihdhar were then granted state identity cards. (Martinez-Flores was later sentenced to 21 months in prison for aiding them, and giving false testimony to police)."Hijackers' helper faces two years max", Timothy P. Carney, Human Events, December 24, 2001
On that same day, Hanjour was stopped by police for driving a Toyota Corolla 55 mph in a 30 mph zone in Arlington, Virginia, for which he paid the $70 fine.
Employees at Advance Travel Service in Totowa, New Jersey later claimed that Moqed and Hanjour had both purchased tickets there. They claimed that Hanjour spoke very little English, and Moqed did most of the speaking. Hanjour requested a seat in the front row of the airplane. Their credit card failed to authorize, and after being told the agency did not accept personal checks, the pair left to withdraw cash. They returned shortly afterwards and paid the $1,842.25 total in cash.http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm This claim is in contradiction to other claims that Hanjour never had a ticket for the flight at all.
Hanjour began making cross-country flights in August to test security, and tried to rent a plane from Freeway Airport in Maryland; though he was declined after exhibiting difficulty controlling and landing a single-engine Cessna 172.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/ny-usflight232380680sep23.story |title=Tracing Trail Of Hijackers |accessdate=March 27, 2010 |last=Frank |first=Thomas |date=September 23, 2001 |publisher=Newsday |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020405020924/http://www.newsday.com/ny-usflight232380680sep23.story |archivedate=April 5, 2002 [/tpl] He moved out of his New Jersey apartment on September 1, and was photographed four days later using an ATM with fellow hijacker Majed Moqed in Laurel, Maryland, where all five Flight 77 hijackers had purchased a 1-week membership in a local Gold's Gym, there Hanjour claimed that his first name translated as warrior when a gym employee asked if there was an English translation of their Arabic names.  (Hani actually translates as "contented")
On September 10, 2001, Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Hazmi checked into the Marriott Residence Inn in Herndon, Virginia where Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen, a prominent Saudi government official, was staying. No evidence was ever uncovered that they had met, or knew of each other's presence.[tpl]cite news |last= Schmidt |first= Susan |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A31402-2003Oct1|title=Spreading Saudi Fundamentalism in U.S.: Network of Wahhabi Mosques, Schools, Web Sites Probed by FBI|publisher=The Washington Post, Page A01|date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=December 23, 2009[/tpl]

===Family denial===

After the September 11 attacks, Hanjour's family in Saudi Arabia vehemently stated that they could not, and would not, believe he had been involved as one of the hijacker pilots, and also stated that he had phoned them just eight hours prior to the hijackings and his voice did not sound strange or unusual at all.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030616131506/http://arabview.com/article.asp?artID=98|title=Hijacker list raises more questions|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=June 16, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2012[/tpl]
