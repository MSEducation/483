The BPM-97 (Boyevaya Pogranichnaya Mashina - "Battle Vehicle of the Border Guard") or Выстрел (Vystrel) is the Russian military designation for the KAMAZ 43269 Vystrel 4x4 wheeled mine-resistant, ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle. It is still in the prototype phase and only two being produced were fitted with several different turrets like the one of the BTR-80A. The vehicle is based on the KAMAZ-43269 and as the name suggests was designed for the Russian Border Guards. The latest model has bulletproof side windows and no gun turret. It has been ordered by Kazakhstan and by the MVD Internal Troops, Federal Prison Service  and EMERCOM.

==History==

Development began in 1997 at the initiative of the head of the Russian Border Guard Service Andrei Nikolaev. Armored vehicle meant to replace the border guards' main transport the GAZ-66. But after a government funding default in 1998 and the much delayed public funding of the project finally stopped. In order to offset the cost of the development in the absence of government orders, machines were allowed to be sold to civilian companies. The armored vehicle was used for the transportation of explosives, money and valuable goods. After receiving permission in 2005, some cars were sold to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Production of the "Vystrel" is ongoing at the  JSC "Remdizel" plant  in Naberezhnye Chelny.
