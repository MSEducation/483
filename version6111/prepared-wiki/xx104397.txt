The Blaze magazine (titled Fusion before September 2012) is a publication founded and edited by Glenn Beck and published by Beck's Mercury Radio Arts. (The former title Fusion was taken from Beck's talk radio program's motto, The Fusion of Entertainment and Enlightenment.)
The magazine is sixteen pages and is published monthly except for February and August. It features several recurring items, including "Stu's 3rd to Last Page", and "By the Numbers" (a listing of trivial facts related to the issue). Other articles deal with politics, pop culture, and society, and are generally written with humorous intent. Some issues have themes (Halloween, Valentine's Day, etc.) that most of the articles adhere to.
Those who attended the 2005 Glenn Beck: On Ice tour received the premiere issue (July 2005), featuring a puppet-like replication of Beck ice skating with training wheels on the cover.
Beck is credited as the magazine's editor-in-chief, with Kevin Balfe as creative director and Liz Julis as managing editor. Beck himself writes little or none of the material, but is involved in overseeing the process to make sure it matches his "voice."
Contributing editors credited in the magazine (and responsible for most of the written content) include: Balfe, Julis, Pat Balfe, Ted Bell, John Bobey, Rick Bovay, Sam Boykin, Stu Burguiere, Evan Cutler, Steve Helling, Timothy Hogan, Scott Mendenhall, Eric D. Snider, and Jason Wright.
Contributing artists include: Eric Armusik, Neal Aspinall, Marty Elliot, Aaron McKinney, Scott Mendenhall, Paul Nunn, and Kerstin Vodges.
