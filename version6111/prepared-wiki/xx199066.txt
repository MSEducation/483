==Biography==

In 1891 Gómez Carrillo won a scholarship to study in Spain. Before moving there, he went to Paris, where he met several writers, such as Paul Verlaine, Moréas and Leconte de Lisle. He subsequently moved to France in 1892, becoming a journalist for a Spanish newspaper and becoming acquainted with many Parisian literary figures such as James Joyce, Oscar Wilde and Émile Zola. The following year he published his first book, Esquisses, which includes profiles of several writers of the time, and contributed to several publications.
In 1898 he was appointed consul of Guatemala in Paris by the dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Years later, the Argentine president Hipólito Yrigoyen also appoints him as a representative of Argentina. In 1895 he became a member of the Royal Spanish Academy. In France, he was awarded several times for his literary work: in 1906 he won the Montyon of the Académie Française for the French translation of his book The Japanese Soul. In 1916 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and later promoted to Commander in the same order.
Carrillo's second wife was the popular singer and vaudevillian Raquel Meller, whom he divorced in 1922. He then met Consuelo, also in France, and they married in 1926.
Maurice Maeterlinck described Gómez Carrillo as a "true Renaissance man", living his life to the extreme as a relentless dueler syphilitic, traveller and correspondent. He died on November 29, 1927, likely a suicide, and is buried in Paris's Père Lachaise Cemetery alongside his third wife Consuelo. Upon his death she inherited his two homes in Paris and Cimiez, near Nice.

==Literary works==

Gómez Carrillo became the author of nearly eighty books of various genres, and is known primarily for his chronicles (crónicas), characterized by modernist prose.
He contributed to numerous publications in Spain, France and Latin America, and headed El Nuevo Mercurio (1907) and Cosmópolis (1919–1922). Gómez Carrillo lived mainly in Madrid and Paris. It was in Madrid where he decided to change his surname from "Gomez Tible" to "Gómez Carrillo," mortified by the joking of others. A tireless traveler, he wrote numerous chronicles that collected his impressions of the places he visited: the enchanting  París (1902), La Rusia actual (1906), La Grecia eterna (1908), El Japón heroico y galante (1912), La sonrisa de la esfinge (1913), Jerusalén y la Tierra Santa (1914) and Vistas de Europa (1919).
He was also the author of several essays, autobiographies and literary criticisms on Art Sensation (1893) Foreign Literature (1895), Modernism (1905), Exotic literatures (1920), Sappho, and other seductive courtesans (1921), The mystery of life and death of Mata Hari (1923), The hundred masterpieces of world literature (1924) and New French literature (1927).
As for his narrative, immoral novels include Of love, of pain and vice (1898), Bohemia sentimental (1899), Wonderland (1899, 1922) and The Gospel of Love (1922). Erotic themes predominates within the aesthetic decadence of his writings.
