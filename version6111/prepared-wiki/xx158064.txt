Deportivo Petare Fútbol Club (until summer 2010 called Deportivo Italia Fútbol Club) is a Venezuelan football club based in Caracas. Formed in 1948 as "Deportivo Italia F.C.", the club after fifty years merged with "Deportivo Chacao F.C." in 1998, and was called Deportivo Italchacao for eight years. The club has won the Primera División Venezolana five times and the Copa de Venezuela three times.

==History==

Deportivo Petare was founded on August 18, 1948 with the name "Deportivo Italia" by nine Italian immigrants: Carlo Pescifeltri, Lorenzo Tommasi, Bruno Bianchi, Giordano Valentini, Samuel Rovatti, Angelo Bragaglia, Giovanni de Stefano, Giuseppe Pane and Alfredo Sacchi.
The golden years of the team were those of the "D'Ambrosio era", that lasted from 1958 to 1978.

===The D'Ambrosio golden era===

In 1958 Mino D'Ambrosio together with his brother Pompeo D'Ambrosio (who managed the financial side) took control of Deportivo Italia.
Deportivo Italia won the Venezuelan First Division tournament four times (1961, 1963, 1966 and 1972) and the Copa Venezuela three times (1961,1962 and 1970), and was runner up in the first division in 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971 and in the Copa Venezuela in 1976.

====The famous "Little Maracanazo"====

Deportivo Italia was Venezuela's Champion of the 1971 season. They traveled to the Maracana stadium and surprisingly took home a 1:0 victory. The goal was scored by central defender Tenorio.
The Caracas daily El Universal wrote that:
... the night of March 3, 1971 will never be forgotten by the fans of Fluminense, who followed the match against Deportivo Italia by radio and television. More than 26,000 people went to the Maracana. The modest Venezuelan team, thrashed in their own field in the previous match, did what no none could do for over a year, not even the powerful Brazilian teams: defeat Fluminense in their Maracana. That fateful night, Deportivo Italia achieved the most enjoyable victory in the Venezuelan national football history, beating the brazilian champion in the largest stadium in the world..
Santander Laya-Garrido, who wrote the book "Los Italianos forjadores de la nacionalidad y del desarrollo economico en Venezuela", said that since then no other Venezuela football team has obtained a similar international result. Until now the "Little Maracanazo" is the top international victory in the history of football in Venezuela.
