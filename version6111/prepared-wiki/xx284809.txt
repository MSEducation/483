Prior to the establishment of Canal Educativo, there was no designated home for educational programming among Cuba's national television portfolio.

In 2004, a second network, Canal Educativo 2 (currently abbreviated ce2 on air), was launched.

==Programming==

Canal Educativo's programming includes telecourses, documentaries, historical programs, and arts programming including opera, ballet and musical performances.
