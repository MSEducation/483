==History==

This is the second courthouse to serve McCulloch County. The first county building was erected in 1879. The current courthouse was completed in 1900, and the datestone was laid by the Brady Lodge of the Freemasons on September 29, 1899. Martin & Moodie of Comanche are listed as the builders, with no separate name for an architect.[tpl]cite web|title=TE McCullough courthouse|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TOWNS/BradyTexas/Brady-Texas-McCulloch-County-Courthouse.htm|work=Texas Escapes|publisher=Blueprints For Travel, LLC.|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]  When the decision was made in 1899 to erect a new courthouse, Martin & Moodie submitted their proposal and were awarded the contract.[tpl]cite web|title=NRHP McCullouch County Courthouse|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2077001515&site_name=McCulloch+County+Courthouse&class=2001|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] The new three-story sandstone courthouse was in the Richardson Romanesque style, and bears some semblance to the style of architect James Riely Gordon.[tpl]cite book|last=Henry|first=Jay C|title=Architecture in Texas, 1895–1945|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-73072-4|pages=17–19[/tpl] While the clock tower has areas designed for a clock on each of the four sides, no clock is installed. The courthouse underwent a renovation in 2009, part of which gave the structure a red roof.  In both 1936 and 1938, Brady Creek (San Saba River) overflowed its banks and caused flooding in and around the courthouse.[tpl]cite book|last=Burnett|first=Jonathan|title=Flash Floods in Texas|year=2008|publisher=TAMU Press|isbn=978-1-58544-590-5|pages=123[/tpl]
