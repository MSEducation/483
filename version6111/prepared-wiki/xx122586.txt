==Professional career==

Wright was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 1990 NFL Draft, the first wide receiver to be chosen and the first pick of the round.  He was intended to complement Emmitt Smith, chosen in the first round.  He did not perform as well as expected, however, and when later asked about his performance, he admitted "I was never a polished package."Whitt  His chief talent was on special teams as a kick returner, in which capacity he scored both of his touchdowns with the Cowboys.  On December 22, 1991, he set a Cowboys record, still standing, for longest play with a 102-yard kick returnCowboys Records (Archived 2009-10-25), Whitt.  Note, however, that databaseFootball statistics do not show that Wright ever returned a kickoff in the NFL; for example, the 1992 Cowboys statistics listed on databaseFootball omit Wright, while JT-SW.com and Blue Star Boys statistics include him; the cause of this discrepancy is unknown.  Wright was one of the fastest sprinters in the NFL, winning the NFL's "Fastest Man" competition in 1992 and 1993.  In May 1991 he was recorded to have run the 40 yard dash in 4.09 seconds.Whitt.  This time may be inaccurate for several reasons; see criticism of the 40 yard dash.  However, he was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders (now the Oakland Raiders) in 1992 for a fourth-round draft pick when he still had no receptions following the first four games of the season.
His most productive season was in 1993 when he caught 27 passes for 462 yards.  During the final game of the 1993 season and with the Raiders trailing the Denver Broncos 23-30, Wright caught the game tying touchdown pass from Jeff Hostetler.  The Raiders went on to win the game 33-30 and the victory earned the Raiders a spot in the 1993 playoffs.http://www.raiders.com/common/article.aspx?id=1270 Wright played his final two seasons with the St. Louis Rams, then retired in 1996.
