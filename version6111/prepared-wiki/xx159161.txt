He finished the high school in Subotica. In 1953 he passed the school-leaving exam, then studied Yugoslav literature at the University of Belgrade.
He worked for several publishing houses and cultural institutions.

In 2007 he received the Golden Cross of Merit of Hungary.
Babić is also an honorary citizen of Balatonfüred.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
 His first translation was a novel of Tibor Cseres: Hideg napok.
It was an important gesture of reconciliation between Serbs and Hungarians, because Cseres's book describes Hungarian war criminals reminiscencing in judicial custody about their crimes and killings of non-Hungarian population in 1942 raids in southern Bačka.
Babić translated also the works of Sándor Petőfi, István Örkény, Miklós Hubay, Gyula Illyés, Tibor Déry, Gyula Krúdy, István Eörsi, Sándor Weöres, Ádám Bodor, Lajos Szabó, Ottó Tolnai and Péter Esterházy. 
He also translated all books of Béla Hamvas. Some works of Hamvas were published in Serbian language before the Hungarian edition.  Babić recently translated some works of Imre Madách and Sándor Márai, but these translations have not been published yet.
