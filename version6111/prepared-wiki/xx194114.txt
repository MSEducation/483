The Library West is the major library of the University of Florida's George A. Smathers Libraries system. Its collections consist of material on the humanities and social sciences, as well as African studies and Asian studies resources. The Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica special collection on Jewish studies is also part of the collection.
Library West primarily serves the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Warrington College of Business Administration. It is the largest of the seven Smathers Libraries at UF. The other major library is the Marston Science Library, which holds collections on agriculture, engineering, mathematics, and the natural and physical sciences.
The library is located at the north end of the Plaza of the Americas, at the Campus Historic District in the northeastern part of campus. The library is often colloquially referred to as "Club West" by many students.
