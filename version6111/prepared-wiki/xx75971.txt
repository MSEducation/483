The Black Madonna or Virgin Mary Shrine and Grotto is a shrine located in the unincorporated area south of Pacific and Southwest of Eureka in the state of Missouri, United States.  It was constructed in 1938 by Brother Bronislaus, a Polish native, of the Franciscan order.
The shrine is dedicated to The Black Madonna of Częstochowa and is a replica of the shrine in Częstochowa. The image is referred as the Black Madonna because of its dark brown skin tones.
The shrine has been subjected to arson and vandalism many times in its history such as in 1958 when an arsonist set fire to the altar which burned the chapel.
