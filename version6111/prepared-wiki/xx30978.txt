CATEGORIES: Bells

The shang (Tibetan: gchang) is a Tibetan flat bell, a ritual upturned handbell employed by Bönpo and Asian shamans. 

==Description==

Sizes of the shang range from approximately three to 20 inches in diameter.  It is traditionally held to have originated in Zhangzhung and is symbolically similar to the tantric dril-bhu.
Shang are traditionally consecrated and made of sophisticated metallic alloy. 

==Use==

Traditionally it was believed that the Bönpo or shaman may use this instrument as a tool to "cast" or "throw" Tulpa. The shang was also believed to be useful in receiving information from the æther, to induce trance or call spirits.
The shang is often used in rites in conjunction with the phurba and namkha.  The shang consists of three principal parts: the flat bell part proper; the gankyil which is the centre piece that holds the knocker; and the knocker or striker proper, which is often made of animal horn.
