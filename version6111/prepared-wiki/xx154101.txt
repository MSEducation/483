He finished his first full length feature film, Los Cronocrímenes (English title: Timecrimes), in 2007, which he also co-starred in.“Time Crimes” Giveaway 
Vigalondo revealed on his official blog that his next film would be a Spanish-language alien invasion horror entitled Extraterrestre. "Scifi Latino"[tpl]who|date=February 2012[/tpl] translates the plot: "Vigalondo writes that this will not be like a War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise, where a regular person manages to somehow closely witness all major invasion events. He writes that most people will experience a global alien invasion without even knowing it has happened, by listening to rumors, or engaging in pointless activities. Hence Extraterrestre."'Timecrimes' Director Prepping 'Extraterrestrial'
