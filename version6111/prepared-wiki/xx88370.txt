Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species

of leaf succulents that are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, varying from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals.
A number of species, formerly classified as Sedum, are now a separate genus Hylotelephium.
Well known European Sedums are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, Sedum reflexum (also known as Sedum rupestre) and Sedum hispanicum.

==Uses==

===Ornamental===

Many sedums are cultivated as garden plants, due to their interesting and attractive appearance and hardiness. The various species differ in their requirements; some are cold-hardy but do not tolerate heat, some require heat but do not tolerate cold.
Numerous hybrid cultivars have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- 

===As food===

The leaves of all stonecrops are edible.Plants of Coastal British Columbia, including Washington, Oregon, & Alaska, 2004, Jim Pojar and Andy MacKinnon, p. 157
Sedum reflexum, known as "prickmadam", "stone orpine", or "crooked yellow stonecrop", is occasionally used as a salad leaf or herb in Europe, including the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Sedum+rupestre |title=Sedum rupestre - L. Crooked Yellow Stonecrop |publisher=Plants for a Future |accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl] It has a slightly astringent sour taste.
Sedum divergens, known as "spreading stonecrop", was eaten by First Nations people in Northwest British Columbia. The plant is used as a salad herb by the Haida and the Nisga'a people. It is common in the Nass Valley of British Columbia.Plants of Coastal British Columbia, including Washington, Oregon, & Alaska, 2004, Jim Pojar and Andy MacKinnon, p. 156
Biting Stonecrop (Sedum acre) contains high quantities of piperidine alkaloids (namely (+)-sedridine, (−)-sedamine, sedinone and isopelletierine), which give it a sharp, peppery, acrid taste and make it somewhat toxic.

===Traditional===

S. acre was used to treat epilepsy and skin disease, as well as an abortifacient in ancient Greece.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Outright consumption may cause irritations of the mucous membranes, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory paralysis.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===Roofing===

Sedum can be used to provide a roof covering in green roofs,[tpl]cite journal | last = Monterusso | first = M. A. | coauthors = Rowe, D. B., Rugh, C.

==Ecology==

Sedum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Grey Chi.  In particular, Sedum spathulifolium is the host plant of the endangered San Bruno elfin butterfly of San Mateo County, California.

==Taxonomy==

Sedum demonstrates a wide variation in chromosome numbers, and polyploidy is common. Chromosome number is an important taxonomic feature. ('t Hart 1985)

==Species==

Linnaeus originally described 16 species of European Sedum.H. 't Hart and C. E. Jarvis. Typification of Linnaeus's Names for European Species of Sedum subgen. Sedum (Crassulaceae) Taxon Vol. 42, No. 2 (May, 1993), pp. 399-410
There are now thought to be approximately 55 European species.H. 't Hart. Chromosome Numbers in Sedum (Crassulaceae) from Greece. Willdenowia Bd. 15, H. 1 (Jul. 30, 1985), pp. 115-135
