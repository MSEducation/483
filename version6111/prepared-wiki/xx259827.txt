The Morris Museum is in Morristown, New Jersey. By 1927 the museum's collection filled seven rooms. From 1938 through 1956, the museum's contents were on display at the Maple Avenue School. The museum was formally incorporated in 1943.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.morrismuseum.org/about/history.html |title=History |accessdate=2010-12-31 |quote= |publisher=Morris Museum [/tpl]
The museum's permanent displays include rocks, minerals, fossils, animal mounts, a model railroad, and Native American crafts, pottery, carving, basketry and textiles.  One gallery features mechanical musical instruments and automata. Changing exhibitions of art, history and culture are drawn from the museum's collections of costumes and textiles, fine art, decorative art, dolls and toys, natural science, geology and paleontology, and anthropology.
One room is dedicated as a memorial to Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge (1882-1973), a resident and supporter of Madison, New Jersey, and features paintings and sculpture that reflect her life and keen interest in community and animal welfare.http://www.morrismuseum.org/exhibitions/permanent/dodge.html Dodge Room
