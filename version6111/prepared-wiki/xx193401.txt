Gruff Rhys cast doubt over the future of Neon Neon in a 2008 interview for the BBC: "I don't know about making another Neon Neon album because it was quite a specific record about John DeLorean's life story. If we did something in the future it would have to be something different. But it's nice that it did well and we get to play it live."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/neon-neon/40750 |title=Neon Neon to ditch band name | News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]
Neon Neon remixed Oasis's song "To Be Where There's Life" from their Dig Out Your Soul album for inclusion as the B-side of Oasis's single, "I'm Outta Time." However, it was only released on the vinyl copy of the single.
In December 2011, Neon Neon announced the release of a new song from their Stainless Style sessions. The song 'Wheels' is being released as part of the 'Complex' compilation, which celebrates the 10th anniversary of Lex Records. An NME article announcing the release of the song suggested that Neon Neon are to return to the studio in 2012 to record a second album.
