In 1976 he was posted to the ESA HQ in Paris where he worked for a year in the Department of Future Programs and Plans. In 1977 he returned to Canada as Director General of Space Programs and subsequently Director General of Space and Information Technology Programs in the Department of Communications. His responsibilities included space industry support, planning and management of the Canadian mobile satellite program and Canada's participation in European communications satellite programs as well as the concluding phases of the Federal governments Office Communications and Videotex and Teletext programs. From 1986–87 he moved to the Ministry of State for Science and Technology to assist in the drafting of a Cabinet submission for the establishment of a Canadian Space Agency and a long term space plan. The latter resulted in Canada's participation in the US Space Station Program, and approval to proceed with the MSAT and Radarsat programs. From 1987–90 he was a Visiting Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department, the University of Auckland, New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ieee.ca/awards/bios.htm|title=McNaughton Medallist Biographies|accessdate=2009-07-24[/tpl] From 1990–1992 he was Chief Scientist at Spar Aerospace Ltd at Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Quebec.
