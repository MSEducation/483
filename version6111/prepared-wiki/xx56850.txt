Due to its rural location in the East Riding of Yorkshire, Pocklington has not seen any great influx of immigrants since Anglo-Saxon times. The civil parish is therefore not very ethnically diverse, with the 2001 UK census reporting 98.8% of the 7,632 inhabitants being white.
In common with the rest of the East Riding of Yorkshire, Pocklington has a higher than average level of Christian belief and a much lower rate of observance for other faiths and those of no faith.[tpl]cite web|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadDatasetList.do?a=7&b=276822&c=East+Riding&d=13&g=390682&i=1001x1003&m=0&r=1&s=1254585845453&enc=1&domainId=13|title=2001 Census: Census Area Statistics: Key Figures: Area: East Riding of Yorkshire (Local Authority)|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl] This can be attributed both to the aforementioned lack of ethnic diversity in the area, as well as the strong Christian tradition upheld by local bodies such as Pocklington School and All Saints Church; a focal point of the community for hundreds of years.

==Economy==

The high street contains a mix of public houses, shops (overwhelmingly independents, very few national chain stores), banks and restaurants.
A large number of Pocklington residents are commuters to nearby cities York, Hull and Leeds. Of those who work within the local area, of those not employed within the cluster of town centre services, a number work on the Pocklington Industrial Estate (light industrial) and Pocklington Business Park (commercial). Leading employers include Bond International (tyre distributors), Vebra, Ryedale Telecommunications and Phoenix Software. Agriculture is still a large employer, both directly in the form of farming, and also in secondary enterprises such as Yara Phosyn (Agrochemicals).

It is only on-air for certain very limited periods each year due to budgetary constraints. A full-time community station, Vixen FM, based in nearby Market Weighton, broadcasts to the town.

==Transport==

===Car===

Pocklington lies on the A1079 road, the main arterial route between the cities of York and Hull.

===Bus===

Pocklington is served by a number of bus routes provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services.

===Air===

Pocklington Airfield has three concrete and tarmac runways of [tpl]convert|1600|yd[/tpl], sufficient in length to take RAF bombers during the Second World War, but in September 1946 the airfield was closed. Although the site remains in use with gliders - and occasionally hot air balloonists - a lot of the concrete runway surface has gone, and the control tower is not in operation. It is therefore classified as "limited flying". The airfield is now wholly owned by the Wolds Gliding Club. 
The nearest commercial airport is Humberside Airport, another former RAF airfield.

===Rail===

Pocklington was once part of the rail network, with a station dating back to 1847.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/03/22/bev_york_railway_feature.shtml|title=The Beverley to York Railway|last=Arundel|first=Chris|work=Where I Live - Humber|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl] This was closed as a result of the Beeching Report in November 1965.[tpl]Butt-Stations[/tpl] There is a small but vocal pressure group that is trying to get the station and line re-opened. The City of York Local Transport Plan for 2006 notes that: "work has recently been undertaken by East Riding of Yorkshire Council to examine the feasibility of reopening the former direct York – Pocklington - Beverley line that closed in 1965... given the unavailability of funding for such a scheme at present and the extensive time required for any reinstatement of a rail line, the scheme remains a longer-term aspiration."
The Minsters Rail Campaign is campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The re-opened railway would skirt the southern edge of the town as the former alignment has since been developed.http://www.minstersrail.net/pocklington.html As of 2006, the issue of re-opening the line has been raised in Parliament and, although still prohibitively expensive, it is otherwise looked upon favourably.
The old railway building, designed by George Townsend Andrews, was saved from demolition due to its interesting architecture. It now serves both as a bus shelter, and also a sports hall for nearby Pocklington School.

===Boat===

The Pocklington Canal, previously in commercial use in the 19th century by barges, is now navigable as far as Melbourne Basin. Full restoration of the canal is one of the aims of the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society, which was formed in 1969. http://www.pocklingtoncanalsociety.org
