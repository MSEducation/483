==League history==

The BBC was established in 1967 primarily as a basketball conference. The initial members were Edgerton, Edon, Fayette, Hicksville, Hilltop, Montpelier, North Central, Pettisville, and Stryker.
Montpelier was also a member of the NWOAL at the same time and in 1969, joined the Northern Border League as well.  Hilltop joined the football-only Northwest Buckeye League in 1971 so their football program had a league to compete in, and Edon followed suit shortly after.  Montpelier would eventually leave in 1978 to become solely affiliated with the NWOAL.  Edgerton and Hicksville would later join the Green Meadows Conference for all sports in 1975.
In 1995, the 6 remaining BBC schools made an agreement to play cross-over games with the Toledo Area Athletic Conference in the newly dubbed Toledo Buckeye League.  This setup only lasted until June 30, 1998 before being dropped.Oregon Cardinal Stritch High School Athletic Banner titled "Toledo Buckeye League" (accessed 2010-02-20)
In 2005, Edon and Hilltop joined the TAAC as football-only members in order to get out of the primarily-Michigan based Southern Central Athletic Association.  Previous ties with the old Toledo Buckeye League made for an easy transition.
