Kitty Kelley (born April 4, 1942) is an American journalist and author of several best-selling unauthorized biographies of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, the British Royal Family, the Bush family, and Oprah Winfrey.
Although Kelley has been called "the consummate gossip monger, a vehicle for all the rumor and innuendo surrounding her illustrious subjects" she maintains, "I am an unabashed admirer of transparency and believe in the freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/author-q-and-a/qa-with-kitty-kelley/ |title=Q&A with Kitty Kelley |publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books |date= |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl] and, to that end, her writing is about "moving an icon out of the moonlight and into the sunlight".  However as her work endured more scrutiny, many of the facts she reported did not hold up.

==Books==

===Jacqueline Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra biographies===

Kelley's first celebrity biography was Jackie Oh! (1978), a life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, which was written at the request of Lyle Stuart, who launched the book into the New York Times Best Seller List. In the book, Kelley describes John F. Kennedy's womanizing and includes "revelations" about Onassis's love life, her depression and electric shock treatment. Kelley's publisher Lyle Stuart was later quoted saying "at the time I believed her shock-treatment story. Looking back, I feel I was had and the whole thing was a fable. I doubt that it ever happened. And knowing how she makes things up, I believe she was sure she could get away with it because no one would sue."Poison Pen by George Carpozi Jr. pg 140 Journalist Michael Crowley stated Jackie Oh! contained "core truths—including an unflinching look at JFK that showed him to have been 'more of a Romeo than has been previously revealed.'"
This book was followed by Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star (1981).
Kelley's next book, His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra (1986) was declared "an act of bravery." Kelley discussed Sinatra's marriages, affairs and his links to the Mob. Sinatra filed a $2 million lawsuit to prevent it from being published but subsequently dropped it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theamericanscholar.org/unauthorized-but-not-untrue/ |title=Unauthorized, But Not Untrue - Kitty Kelley |publisher=The American Scholar |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]
The book was number one on the New York Times Best Seller List and hit best-seller lists in England, Canada, Australia and France. William Safire of the New York Times said "His Way...turns out to be the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time."William Safire, "The Truth About Frank," New York Times 9/29/86 In the Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley, wrote that "His Way is such an improvement over her two previous books ... that comparisons border on the pointless."

===People magazine story===

In 1990, Kelley wrote a piece for People magazine based on interviews she had conducted with Judith Campbell Exner, a former girlfriend of Frank Sinatra's who claimed to have had an affair with John F. Kennedy."The Dark Side of Camelot," http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20098379,00.html Exner told Kelley that she had arranged ten meetings between Kennedy and Mafia gangster Sam Giancana, and they discussed having the "mob" kill Fidel Castro. It was subsequently revealed that Exner had been paid $50,000 to talk with Kelley and had not mentioned these "revelations" in her own autobiography, published years earlier. A former FBI agent said that Giancana had been under a federal wiretap, so these multiple meetings with Kennedy would have been impossible to cover up.

===Nancy Reagan biography===

In 1991 Kelley published Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography. She was paid $3.5 million to write the book.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/garden/16KITT.html|title=For the Queen of Exposé, Four Walls That Won't Talk|accessdate=2008-08-05|work=The New York Times|date=September 16, 2004|author=Bruni, Frank[/tpl] The book claimed that Reagan had had affairs with Frank Sinatra, that she frequently relied on astrology, that she had lied about her age, and that she had a very poor relationship with her children, even alleging that she hit her daughter, Patti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2106746|title=Kitty Kelley: Colonoscopist to the Stars|author=Crowley, Michael|accessdate=2008-08-05|work=Slate|date=September 15, 2004[/tpl] The reliability and sources were questioned. Slate magazine said that Kelly's book "was no more dishonest than the Reagans' own carefully groomed Norman Rockwell facade." According to Newsweek, "Despite her wretched excesses, Kelley has the core of the story right. Even her staunchest defenders concede that Nancy Reagan is more Marie Antoinette than Mother Teresa.".  However Newsweek also criticized the book's basic factual accuracy, noting that Kelley had reported that Ronald Reagan had allegedly date raped a 19 year old, when the accuser would have actually been 25 at the time.
Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement saying the book "has no basis in fact and serves no decent purpose."[tpl]cite book |last= Goldberg|first= Bernard |authorlink= Bernard Goldberg|title= 100 People Who Are Screwing up America|year= 2005|accessdate= 2007-05-17|edition= paperback|publisher= Harper Collins|location=New York |isbn= 0-06-076129-6|page= 99[/tpl]
