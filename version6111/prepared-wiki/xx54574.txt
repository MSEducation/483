He has also worked as an arranger, pianist, and singer. His work has included songs in the adult contemporary, rock and roll, dance, pop, musical theater, and film score genres.

==Personal life==

Steinman was born in New York, New York. He graduated from George W. Hewlett High School in 1965 and then attended Amherst College. According to longtime manager David Sonenberg, Steinman had serious cardiac health problems around 2004, but has been in good health since.[tpl]cite news|first=Gary|last=Graff|title=Meat Loaf unleashes "Bat" for third flight|date=October 28, 2006|work=Reutuers|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUKN2716092720061030|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl]
Responding to an interviewer's asserting that his songs are tragic, Steinman says that he has "never been stomped on literally. Figuratively, I am stomped on every day ... anyway, that is the way I feel sometimes. I've never had my heart broken the way you are talking about. I've never been dumped... but probably because I don't allow myself to be dumped."[tpl]cite news|first=Maryellen|last=Fillo|title=A Bat Out of Hell Who Whistles|work= Hartford Courant|url=http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-nujavaspilling0928.artsep28,0,6539032.story|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=2007-09-29[/tpl]

==1960s==

As a senior at Amherst College in Massachusetts, Jim wrote the book, music, and lyrics for The Dream Engine (1969), a musical that was used to fulfill the requirements for an independent study course.[tpl]cite web | first= Jacqueline | last=Dillon |work=Dream Pollution |title= Let Me Out |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/dreamengine/deintro.htm| accessdate=2006-09-03[/tpl] He had previously scored two other musicals at Amherst, A Man's a Man (1967) and Baal (1968), as well as co-producing The Beard (1968).[tpl]cite web |first=Robert |last=Nathan |title=There's a Flood Coming |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/dreamengine/deamherst.htm |accessdate=2009-03-16[/tpl]
The story of The Dream Engine, set in the distant future, is about a young boy named Baal who, along with his rebel fellows, doesn't accept the restraints and limits of their society. Baal is the leader of a group of wild boys called The Tribe, whose mortal enemies are Max and Emily, the parents of the Girl, a young woman with whom Baal has fallen in love. Steinman himself played Baal in the original production, which was staged in April 1969. Fellow Amherst College student Barry Keating was director.
Several parts of songs from this show resemble parts of songs Steinman later released. For example, the words "turn around bright eyes" from "Total Eclipse of the Heart" can be heard in the song called "The Formation of the Tribe" in Steinman's manuscript for the show.[tpl]cite web |first= Jim |last=Steinman |work=Dream Pollution |title= The Dream Engine – A Rock Odyssey |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/dreamengine/dream_engine.htm |accessdate=2006-09-03[/tpl]
Steinman said in an interview that Joseph Papp, founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival, saw the play and was so impressed he signed it up during intermission. He wanted to bring it to New York (either Broadway or Central Park), but balked when his Amherst faculty advisor explained to Papp that, contrary to Papp's published claim, Steinman was never threatened with "near-expulsion" from the college.  Nonetheless, Steinman worked under Papp after his years at Amherst College.[tpl]cite news |first=Jon |last=Hotten |title=Bat Out of Hell – The Story Behind the Album |url =http://www.jimsteinman.com/00classicr1.htm |format=Reprint on website |work=Classic Rock magazine |date=September 2000 |accessdate=2006-09-03[/tpl]

==1970s==

In 1971, Steinman provided music for a puppet show called Ubu. The show, put on by puppeteer and filmmaker Demian, was an adaptation of Ubu on the Hill, an 1888 play by Alfred Jarry.[tpl]cite web |title=Sweet Corn Productions – Ubu |url=http://www.buddybuddy.com/s-ubu-s.html |accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl]
In 1973, Steinman's song "Happy Ending" appeared on the album Food of Love, sung by Yvonne Elliman. This was the first commercially released recording of a song written by Steinman.[tpl]cite web |work=allmusic |title= credits for Food of Love |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r36587|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |accessdate=2006-09-03[/tpl]
In 1974, Steinman worked with college friend Barry Keating on a musical called Rhinegold, based on Richard Wagner's opera Das Rheingold, writing the music and co-writing the script.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/rhinegold.htm| title=Rhinegold| accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl]  Steinman wrote music and lyrics for a musical called More Than You Deserve (1973). One of the actors cast in this show was Marvin Lee Aday, who went by the name Meat Loaf, with whom Steinman later collaborated. A song from this show, called "More Than You Deserve" would later be recorded by Meat Loaf for the Dead Ringer album.
In 1975, while working for Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival, Steinman contributed music and lyrics to Thomas Babe's Kid Champion, which starred Christopher Walken.[tpl]cite web |title=Lortel Archives – The Internet Off-Broadway Database |url=http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=3095 |accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl]
In 1976, there was a minor one-month run of a musical called "The Confidence Man." It was based loosely on the novel by the same title by Herman Melville. The book and lyrics were written by Ray Errol Fox, the music by Steinman.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.castalbumdb.com/rec.cfm?RNumber=3901| title=The Confidence Man (Studio Cast)| accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] Ray Fox described the 1976 production as "a capsule version of the show." In 1986, a more elaborate production of the show with added songs was held at Queens College in New York City.[tpl]cite web| url=http://steinman.realmofdreams.com/cm.html| title=The Confidence Man| accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] It was directed by Susan Einhorn and performed by Queen's College students. Orchestrations were by Steven Margoshes, a frequent Steinman collaborator. One song from The Confidence Man, "Milady," was recorded by Barry Manilow, but never released. The melody of that song later appeared in Tanz der Vampire as the melody of "Für Sarah" (for Sarah). Some music from this show later appeared in the hit song "Making Love out of Nothing at All", and in the score of the film A Small Circle of Friends. A cast album of the songs from The Confidence Man, produced by Jeff Olmstead, was released in 2003.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.castalbums.org/recordings/2907| title=The Confidence Man| accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl]
In 1977, a brief workshop was held for a work-in-progress musical called Neverland. It was based loosely on Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie.[tpl]cite web |title=Neverland |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/neverlnd.htm |work=jimsteinman.com |accessdate=2007-08-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=The Power of Rock 'n Roll |work=Gallery magazine |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/gallery1.htm |date=May 1978 |accessdate=2006-11-17[/tpl] While preparing the show, Steinman and Meat Loaf, who were touring with the National Lampoon show, felt that three songs were "exceptional" and Steinman began to develop them as part of a seven-song set they wanted to record as an album.[tpl]cite web |first=Jon |last=Hotten |title=Bat Out of Hell – The Story Behind the Album (page 2) |work=Classic Rock |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/00classicr2.htm |accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl] The three songs were "Bat out of Hell", "Heaven Can Wait" and "The Formation of the Pack", which was retitled "All Revved Up With No Place to Go." The show also contained Steinman's "Bolero" (a.k.a. "Great Bolero's of Fire") which was later used at many live shows featuring Steinman work.
Steinman and Meat Loaf had immense difficulty finding a record company willing to sign them. According to Meat Loaf's autobiography, the band spent most of 1975, and two and a half years, auditioning Bat out of Hell and being rejected.[tpl]cite book |last=Loaf |first=Meat |authorlink=Meat Loaf |coauthors=David Dalton |title=To Hell and Back: An Autobiography |year=2000 |publisher= Virgin Publishing |location= London |isbn=0-7535-0443-X  |pages= 118–9[/tpl] CBS executive Clive Davis even claimed that Steinman knew nothing about writing, or rock music in general.Meat Loaf/Dalton, pg. 117 Recording started in 1976 in Bearsville, near Woodstock.Meat Loaf/Dalton, pg. 118–9 After numerous further rejections, the album was released by Cleveland International Records in October 1977.[tpl]cite web |first=Jon |last=Hotten |title=Bat Out of Hell – The Story Behind The Album (page 3) |work=Classic Rock |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/00classicr3.htm |accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl] The album was an immediate success in Australia and the United Kingdom, and later in the United States. Reports vary as to how many copies of the album have been sold, but in 2007, Cleveland International Records founder Steve Popovich said that it was around 40 million copies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/newsnotes.htm|title=Label Blew Meat Loaf's biggest|date=February 28, 2007|publisher=Jim Steinman|accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl] The highest-charting song from the album was "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad", which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Charts.
In 1979, the Freeway Records label made a 2-L.P. compilation album called "L.A. Radio". It was not commercially released, but promo copies were distributed. It included a spoken word segment called "Shadows on the Freeway", written and recited by Steinman. It later appeared on the 1981 Dead Ringer album with a new title, "Nocturnal Pleasure". Parts of it can also be heard at the beginning of the 1989 music video, directed by Ken Russell, for the first release of the song "It's All Coming Back to Me Now".
Steinman wrote the theme music for the 1979 National Lampoon TV show Delta House. Sean Kelly and Tony Hendra wrote the lyric for this. Michael Simmons sang the lead vocal. The music from this later appeared on the song "Dead Ringer for Love".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.realmofdreams.com/steinman/sounds.html| title=Smeghead's Jim Steinman Page| accessdate=2009-01-19[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==1980s==

In 1980, the film A Small Circle of Friends was released. It had an orchestral score composed by Steinman, and orchestrated by his frequent collaborator Steve Margoshes.[tpl]cite web |title=A Small Circle of Friends (1980) – Full cast and crew |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081528/fullcredits |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] The motifs of this orchestral score match the melodies of numerous songs Steinman later released, including "Total Eclipse of the Heart", "Making Love out of Nothing at All" and "Für Sarah" from Tanz der Vampire.[tpl]cite web |title=Smeghead's Jim Steinman Page |url=http://realmofdreams.com/steinman/ascof.html |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Early in the production of a follow-up album to Bat out of Hell, Meat Loaf developed vocal problems and was unable to continue on the project. Steinman proceeded with the album, released as Bad for Good in 1981.[tpl]cite web |title=Meat Loaf Sings Like Me |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/loafsings.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] Most songs are sung by Steinman himself. Three of the songs are sung by Rory Dodd, who did not receive a clear indication for his work in the album's credits, and Karla DeVito sings a duet part on one song.[tpl]cite web |title=God Hit the World |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/cashbox.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]  Steinman was this time credited as co-producer with Todd Rundgren for all but one track. Steinman was credited as co-producer with Jimmy Iovine for the song "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through".
Meat Loaf again recorded songs by Steinman on the 1981 album Dead Ringer. All of the songs on the album were written by Steinman.[tpl]cite web |title=Dead Ringer |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/blood.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] The highest charting song on this album was "Dead Ringer for Love", a duet with the uncredited Cher, and the album reached No. 1 on the album charts in the United Kingdom.

Some of the music from this song was adapted from the music used for the song "Stark Raving Love" from the album Bad for Good.
In 1984, Steinman was hired by and worked briefly with the rock band Def Leppard on some tracks that were intended for a Def Leppard album.[tpl]cite web |title=The Dark Knight Returns |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/darknite.htm |accessdate=12-06[/tpl] However, Steinman was fired, and the recording work he made with the band was not released.

According to Steinman in an interview, Andrew Lloyd Webber approached him to write lyrics for The Phantom of the Opera because Lloyd Webber felt that his "dark obsessive side" fit in with the project. However, Steinman declined in order to fulfill his commitments to a Bonnie Tyler album.[tpl]cite news |first=Spencer |last=Bright |title=Jim'll Fix It |work=Sunday Times |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lontimes.htm |date=December 8, 1996 |accessdate=2007-07-09[/tpl] In 1986 the album Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire was released.[tpl]cite web |title=Secret Dreams |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/btyler1.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] Bonnie Tyler sang lead vocals, and Steinman produced all the selections on the album.

He also produced, but not authored, two other songs on the album: "River Deep, Mountain High" and "Call the Man".[tpl]cite web |title=Pressing for Greatness |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/dion.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" reached No. 2 on the Billboard charts[tpl]cite web |title=Is Nothing Sacred |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/sacred.htm |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] and won Steinman the award for BMI song of the year.[tpl]cite web |title=Awards – Celine Dion |url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/journey_awards.html |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] That award is given for the song, out of all those represented in the BMI catalog, that receives the most radio airplay in a particular year. This album as a whole won two 1997 Grammy Awards, for Best Pop Album and for Album of the Year. Steinman also produced the track "Us", written by Billy Pace, for Dion's 1997 album Let's Talk About Love.[tpl]cite web |title=Jim Steinman Discography |title=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jim+Steinman [/tpl] Steinman's production team prepared a recording of the Steinman/Black song "Is Nothing Sacred" for that album, but it was removed shortly before the album's release. A recording of Dion singing the song was leaked and has been shared on fan websites.
Steinman produced two tracks for films in the late 1990s. He produced "In The Dark of the Night", written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, for the soundtrack album of the 1997 film Anastasia.[tpl]cite web |title=Everything Louder Than Everything Else |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/biop4.htm |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] He also produced "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You" (music by James Horner, lyric by Will Jennings) for the 1998 film The Mask of Zorro.[tpl]cite web |title=IMDb – Jim Steinman |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0826153/ |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] Lead vocals were a duet between Tina Arena and Marc Anthony, and the track also appeared on Tina Arena's 1997 album In Deep.[tpl]cite web |title=Tina Arena in Deep CD |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1856121/a/In+Deep.htm |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl]
Steinman provided lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Whistle Down the Wind, which opened in Washington, D.C. in December 1996. However, it received poor reviews and the Broadway run, scheduled for the following April, was cancelled.[tpl]cite news |first=Benedict |last=Nightingale |title=Whistle Down the Wind |date=March 29, 2006 |url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article697655.ece |work=The Times |accessdate=2007-05-22 | location=London[/tpl] A reworked and more successful West End production opened at the Aldwych Theatre on July 1, 1998.[tpl]cite news |work=BBC News |title=Whistle sounds better second time around  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/124797.stm |date=July 2, 1998 |accessdate=2007-08-04[/tpl] In addition to a full-length cast album for the London production, an album was released of well-known performers singing pop versions of the songs from the show.[tpl]cite web |title=Songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman's Whistle Down the Wind CD |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000241XU |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] This album was produced by Steinman, as usual with Steven Rinkoff.

Many of the various productions of Tanz der Vampire have had cast recordings released, some of them produced by Steinman, along with other co-producers. Like much of Steinman's work, the show includes adaptation (or, recycling) of material Steinman had released before. This includes the song "Total Eclipse of the Heart", the melody of "Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are", and many other parts of earlier works.
Ten previously released Steinman songs were included on the 1998 2-disc compilation album The Very Best of Meat Loaf.[tpl]cite web |title=Cartoon Wall of Sound |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/cartoon.htm |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] The included recording of the song "Life Is A Lemon And I Want My Money Back" was a new re-mix made by Steinman's production team.[tpl]cite web |title=The Magical Touch |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/consum.htm |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] The compilation also included three new recordings of songs co-written by Steinman, all three of which he produced.[tpl]cite web |title=The Very Best of Meat Loaf |url=http://mljs.evilnickname.org/meatloaf/theverybestof.html |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl] They include the hybrid track "Home By Now/No Matter What" and "A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste" from Whistle Down the Wind. Also included is the song "Is Nothing Sacred", on which Steinman wrote music for Don Black's lyrics.

==2000s==

In 2001, the box set Andrew Lloyd Webber: Now & Forever was released. It included a recording, produced by Steinman and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and also co-produced by Steven Rinkoff and Nigel Wright, of the Steinman/Webber song "A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste", from Whistle Down The Wind. It was credited to The Metal Philharmonic Orchestra, which was an unrealized performance project idea. Kyle Gordon, a.k.a. "Scarpia", a singer on many demo recordings for Steinman, sang the lead vocal.
Around 2001, Steinman was working with singer Karine Hannah. Plans to make an album with her were eventually abandoned. Demo recordings of Hannah singing four songs by Steinman were leaked to fans and have since been available on numerous fan sites. The songs on these demos are "Safe Sex", "Making Love Out of Nothing at All", "Is Nothing Sacred", and "Braver Than We Are".[tpl]cite web |title=SOUNDS |work=realmofdreams.com |url=http://www.realmofdreams.com/steinman/sounds.html |accessdate=2007-08-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928204630/http://www.realmofdreams.com/steinman/sounds.html  |archivedate = September 28, 2007[/tpl] Steinman also recorded her voice on a demo of "Catwoman's Song", which recycled parts of the Steinman/Eldritch song "More". This demo was part of Steinman's preparations for the unrealized Batman: The Musical. He shared it with fans through a website. In 2002 Russell Watson released the album Encore. It included the Steinman/Black song "Is Nothing Sacred". Steinman had originally worked on his production of this song with Watson on lead vocals.
Composed by Michael Reed and Steinman, with a script by Warner Brown, Garbo – the Musical, about the life of the late screen idol Greta Garbo, opened in Sweden to poor reviews in 2002.[tpl]cite news |work=BBC News |title=Garbo musical bores critics |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2270399.stm |date=September 20, 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-04[/tpl] Preparation for a stage musical based on the Batman comic book series began early in the decade, with Steinman working on the music and lyrics.[tpl]cite news |first=Melissa Rose |last=Bernardo |title='Pow!'

According to an unnamed source Burton was attracted to the project because it was as dark as his 1989 film Batman rather than "the goofy, campy turn the franchise took with Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, both of which were directed by Joel Schumacher.".[tpl]cite news |title=Bat-Song |date=August 30, 2002 |work=The New York  Post |url=http://www.freewebs.com/batman_themusical/articles.htm#30aug1 |format=Reprint on unofficial website |accessdate=2007-08-04[/tpl] Steinman said about Burton and the project, "It's more like his first two movies than any of the other movies. It's very dark and gothic, but really wildly funny. It was my dream that he do this."[tpl]cite news |title=Steinman, Ives and Director Tim Burton in Pre-Production on Batman |date=September 19, 2002 |work=Playbill.com |url=http://www.freewebs.com/batman_themusical/articles.htm#19sep |format=Reprint on unofficial website |accessdate=2007-08-05[/tpl]  However, Warner Bros. cancelled its plans to cast and stage the show. Steinman has since shared some of the song demos from the show via the Dream Pollution website. The Dream Engine has, according to its website and MySpace page, also worked on recordings of some of the songs that were in the show.
Steinman was executive producer for the 2003 MTV television film Wuthering Heights. He has cited Brontë's novel, which had inspired "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", as one of his favorites.[tpl]cite web |work=JimSteinman.com |title=Jim Steinman on "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/backtome.htm |accessdate=2006-09-04[/tpl] A limited-release six-track soundtrack CD was sold through MTV, on Steinman and Rinkoff's Ravenous Records label. Jim Steinman is credited as producer for the album and most of its tracks, and Steven Rinkoff is credited with recording, mixing and co-production.[tpl]cite web |work=MTV |title=On Air: Wuthering Heights |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/wuthering_heights/ |accessdate=2006-09-01[/tpl] That album includes a simple recording of the Steinman/Eldritch song "More" with actors Mike Vogel and Erika Christensen performing lead vocals. It also includes the first-ever release of the song "If It Ain't Broke (Break It)", written by Steinman, with lead vocals by Mike Vogel. The album also has a version of "The Future Ain't What It Used To Be" by Jim Steinman with lead vocals from Erika Christensen.
In 2002 the Opera Babes released the album Beyond Imagination. Steinman produced the track "Vittoria!", adapted from the Giuseppe Verdi opera Aida. Steven Rinkoff was credited with co-production, recording and mixing. Like many Steinman productions, it includes work by electronic-music arranger and programmer Jeff Bova. Steinman was also credited as arranger, along with Jeff Bova and Jon Cohen. In 2004 the film Shrek 2 was released, along with a soundtrack album. The album has two dance covers of the Steinman/Pitchford song "Holding Out for a Hero", one with vocals by Jennifer Saunders and the other credited to Frou Frou.
In 2005 The Everly Brothers released a limited edition album called On the Wings of a Nightingale: The Mercury Studio Recordings. This album included the song "A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing To Waste", written and produced by Steinman. The recording on that album was made in 1987, during the recording sessions that ended up being the 1989 album Some Hearts. However the Steinman song was not released until 2005. This song is different from the song with the same title in Whistle Down The Wind. The two songs with this title share only a few words and no music in common, with the Everly Brothers version containing musical motifs recycled from the Steinman song "Out of the Frying Pan (And Into the Fire)".  A demo recording of this song, with Rory Dodd singing lead vocals, has for many years been in circulation among fan websites.
A separate and very different show from Tanz der Vampire, Dance of the Vampires opened on Broadway on October 16, 2002. After the original director left the show, it was directed by John Rando, who joined very shortly before the opening. The book was written by David Ives and was notable for the large number of jokes, many of which had a silly or vulgar quality to them. Whereas Tanz had been a "sung-through" musical with no breaks in the music (like an opera), Dance of the Vampires was a humorous spoken play with songs inserted at some parts.
The reviews tended to be very negative. It closed on January 25, 2003 after 61 preview and 56 regular performances. Financially, it was very unsuccessful, and lost roughly $17 million. Steinman did not attend the opening night to show his disgust with the show."New York Times" article, January 16, 2003 In his blog, Steinman also described the show as "DOTV, which you guys know I hated & was disgusted by, & was FIRED by my manager, acting as producer!" The manager he was referring to was David Sonenberg, who was one of the producers of the show and Steinman's longtime manager.
During the concerts in his Hair of the Dog tour, Meat Loaf told the audience that he and Steinman would be releasing a new album. Later, Meat Loaf said that "lawyers worked for over a year putting together a contract for Steinman to do Bat out of Hell III. It was one of the best producer's contracts in the history of the record business." According to Meat Loaf, the composer had suffered some health setbacks, including a heart attack. Ultimately, according to the singer, Steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project. However, Steinman's manager refuted this version, saying that Steinman's "health is excellent"  and although he had some "meaningful health problems about four years ago...he's been totally healthy the last couple of years... that's not the reason he didn't participate in III''".
Produced by Desmond Child, Bat out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose was released in October 2006. It has fourteen songs, seven of which were written by Steinman; five of these were covers of songs already released on other albums. The other two were adapted from Steinman's demos of songs that were intended for musical theater projects. Steinman's demo of "In The Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King", with Rob Evan singing lead vocal, was part of the preparations for the unrealized Batman: The Musical project. Steinman's demo of "Cry to Heaven", with Kyle Gordon singing lead vocal, was intended for the possibility that Steinman would provide songs for a musical based on the film Cry-Baby. Cry-Baby has since been staged, but without any work from Steinman.
In 2006, the album's title became the subject of a legal battle between Steinman and Meat Loaf. Steinman had registered a trademark on the title "Bat out of Hell" in 1995, and sought to prevent Meat Loaf from using the title.[tpl]cite web |first=Susan|last=Butler| work= Billboard |title= Meat Loaf Sues Over 'Bat Out of Hell' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58228/meat-loaf-sues-over-bat-out-of-hell |date=June 5, 2006 |accessdate=2006-09-25[/tpl] reprinted at Naked Wire: Jim Steinman News Service Meat Loaf sought to cancel Steinman's trademark and use the title.

This project is still in development, and an opening date has not yet been announced.
In 2006, Westlife released The Love Album. It contained a cover of "Total Eclipse of the Heart", produced by Steve Mac. A remix with an added intro, presumably done by Steinman, Rinkoff, and Bova, has leaked and been in circulation among fan sites.
First publicly presented in early 2006, Steinman and Steven Rinkoff created a music performance group called The Dream Engine. The group has worked on studio recordings and held live shows in New York City. It also performed at an award show in Atlanta, Georgia. The people in this project were the first ever to publicly perform the songs "What Part of My Body Hurts the Most", "We're Still The Children We Once Were", "Speaking in Tongues", "Not Allowed to Love", and "(It Hurts) Only When I Feel". The last of those songs is partly adapted from "If It Ain't Broke (Break It)". This project was also the first to perform a revised and politicized lyric to "Braver Than We Are". With the new lyric, the song has alternatively been called "An American Elegy" and "God's Gone A.W.O.L.". According to Steinman's blog, this project was "guided" by Steven Rinkoff. This project has not performed or been active in public since 2006.
