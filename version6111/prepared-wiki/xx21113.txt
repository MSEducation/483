Go Fly (styled and trading as Go) was the name of a British low-cost airline, founded by British Airways (BA) in 1998. It operated flights between London Stansted Airport and destinations in Europe. The airline was purchased from BA in a management buy-out backed by the private equity firm 3i in 2001. In 2002 it was bought by its rival EasyJet, and was merged into the airline's operations.[tpl]cite news | first=Alan | last=Cowell | title= World Business Briefing / Europe: Britain: Discount Airlines Merge | date=2002-05-17 | publisher= | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E1DB1F39F934A25756C0A9649C8B63 | work =New York Times | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl] Its head office was in the Enterprise House in London Stansted Airport in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex."World Airline Directory."

==History==

Bob Ayling, CEO of British Airways, approached EasyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, to ask whether he could visit claiming that he was fascinated by how the Greek entrepreneur had made the budget airline formula work. Haji-Ioannou not only agreed, but allegedly showed Ayling his business plan.[tpl]cite news | first=James | last=Curtis | title=Behind enemy lines | work=Marketing | date=24 May 2001[/tpl]
In November 1997 BA announced that, under the project name of Operation Blue Sky, it would launch its own low cost airline in order to meet the changing demand for air travel in Europe.[tpl]cite news |first=Paul | last=Burnham Finney | coauthors= | title= Business Travel; Hong Kong's Huge New Airport, Chek Lap Kok, is Set to Open in April, Tourist Slump and all | date=1997-12-31 | publisher= | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DD1331F932A05751C1A961958260 |work =New York Times | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl]  According to Ayling, the new airline would, "quickly become a favourite with the budget traveller" via its pricing scheme and available flights.[tpl]cite news |title=New BA Low-Cost Airline Meets Legal Threat | date=17 November 1997 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/31921.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl] The new airline would be run separately from British Airways as a wholly owned subsidiary and would compete in the European low-cost carrier market, dominated by Ryanair, EasyJet and Debonair.
Barbara Cassani, who had been British Airways' General Manager in New York and had been credited with turning around the airline's flagging fortunes on the transatlantic market in the early 1990s, was chosen by Ayling to set up the new venture.  The airline was named Go Fly Limited in February 1998 following a lengthy debate over how to choose a name that would best suit the positioning of this new airline, which was already facing challenges from EasyJet[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.easyjet.com/EN/news/19980120_01.html |title=the EasyJet case against Operation Blue Sky |accessdate=16 January 2008[/tpl] and Virgin Atlantic,[tpl]cite news | first=Andrew Ross | last=Sorkin | coauthors= | title= Nurturing a No-Frills Airline | date=19 September 1999 | publisher= | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E2D6123CF93AA2575AC0A96F958260 | work =New York Times | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl] among others.
The fleet consisted of Boeing 737s. The first two, 737-300s G-IGOC and G-IGOE,Go: An airline adventure, Barbara Cassani with Kenny Kemp, ISBN 0-7515-3560-5 were initially acquired via lease from Philippine Airlines.[tpl]cite news | first=Max | last=Kingsley-Jones | title=Blue Sky Prepares for Launch as PAL 737-300s are Secured | date=28 January 1998 | publisher= | url =http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1998/01/28/32046/blue-sky-prepares-for-launch-as-pal-737-300s-are-secured.html | work =Flight | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl] A fourth plane, a 737-3Q8 G-IGOF was leased in May 1998.
On Friday 22 May 1998, Go flew for the first time from its base at London Stansted Airport to Rome Ciampino. The following afternoon saw the airline's inaugural flight to Milan Malpensa Airport. The Italian start-up and launch of Go's operation was managed by former American Airlines executive Luca Berti.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] As part of their campaign against Go, Stelios Haji-Ioannou and nine other EasyJet staff booked tickets for the flight, arriving in orange boiler suits.Stop Stansted Expansion Campaign - SSE News Archive - April to June 2006 Other early routes were to Copenhagen, Bologna and Lisbon. In July flights to Glasgow were started, then to Munich in November and Venice in December 1998, followed by Málaga, Faro, Bilbao in April 1999 and Madrid.
After leasing three further planes, including one former Air Liberté plane and another ex-British Midland jet, between November 1998 and November 1999 six additional planes were delivered direct from Boeing, leased from GE Commercial Aviation Services bringing the total to 13. Although this was four more than had originally been envisaged, the additional routes helped to spread the overheads. In a successful attempt to stem mounting losses, on June 7, 1999 a significant change in strategy was announced, cutting back on the existing schedules in favour of new routes tapping into the summer holiday market to Alicante, Ibiza and Palma. This was followed by winter schedules targeting skiers travelling to Lyon and Zurich, together with a new route to Prague.
In March 2001, Go expanded its UK operations and opened a second base at Bristol Airport, bringing low cost travel to South West England for the first time.[tpl]cite news |title=Go to Bring Low Airfares to the South West | date=9 March 2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.bristolairport.co.uk/press/press_releases/article.aspx?newsid=%7B7610396F-EB03-41C5-9CEB-D7D34141F0C4%7D | work =Bristol International | accessdate = 16 January 2008[/tpl]
Go was very much the brain child of Bob Ayling and when he left British Airways, Go's future was rendered shaky.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Outlook: Eddington Axes Ayling's Legacy.

Go was sold in June 2001 in a management buyout led by Cassani with the cooperation of private equity firm 3i for £100 million.[tpl]cite news |title=BA sells Go for £100m | date=14 June 2001 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1388980.stm |accessdate= 16 July 2013[/tpl] The airline's management team remained in place.[tpl]cite news | first=Alan | last=Levy | title=All Signals Go: Airline Sold | date=20 June 2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.praguepost.cz/busi062001f.html | work =The Prague Post | accessdate = 16 January 2008 | language = [/tpl]
