Badi'al-Zaman Abū al-'Izz ibn Ismā'īl ibn al-Razāz al-Jazarī (1136–1206) ([tpl]lang-ar |  بديع الزمان أَبُو اَلْعِزِ بْنُ إسْماعِيلِ بْنُ الرِّزاز الجزري[/tpl]) was a Muslim polymath: a scholar, inventor, mechanical engineer, craftsman, artist, and mathematician from Jazirat ibn Umar (current Cizre, Turkey), who lived during the Islamic Golden Age (Middle Ages). He is best known for writing the al-Jāmiʿ bain al-ʿilm wa al-ʿamal al-nāfiʿ fī ṣināʿat al-ḥiyal (The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices) in 1206, where he described 100 mechanical devices, some 80 of which are trick vessels of various kinds, along with instructions on how to construct them.[tpl]cite book|last=Beckwith|first=Guy|title=Readings in Technology and Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Custom Publishing|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-536-25754-X|pages=290[/tpl]Readings in Technology and Civilization Volume I; 4th Edition

==Biography==

Little is known about al-Jazari, and most of that comes from the introduction to his Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices. He was named after the area in which he was born (the city of Jazirat ibn Umar). Like his father before him, he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqid dynasty which ruled across eastern Anatolia as vassals of the Zangid rulers of Mosul and later Ayyubid general Saladin.Donald Routledge Hill, "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) He was born in the city of Tor,Bavê zanistiya robot û sîbernîteyê El Cizîrî now located in the district of Cizre in south-Eastern Turkey.
al-Jazari was part of a tradition of craftsmen and was thus more of a practical engineer than an inventorDonald R. Hill, in Dictionary of scientific biography, 15, suppl. I, p. 254. who appears to have been "more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them" and his machines were usually "assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation."[tpl]citation|first=G. R.|last=Tibbetts|title=Review: Donald R. Hill, The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (Kitab fi ma'rifat al-hiyal alhandasiyya), by Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=University of London|volume=38|issue=1|year=1975|pages=151–153 152|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00047182[/tpl] His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only describes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book's style resembles that of a modern "do-it-yourself" book.pp. 32–33, The Origins of Feedback Control, Otto Mayr, MIT Press, 1970, ISBN 0-262-13067-X.
Some of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his monumental water clocks, which was based on that of a Pseudo-Archimedes.Ahmad Y Hassan, al-Jazari And the History of the Water Clock He also cites the influence of the Banu Musa brothers for his fountains, al-Asturlabi for the design of a candle clock, and Hibat Allah ibn al-Husayn (d. 1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices, techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors.[tpl]citation|title=The book of ingenious devices (Kitāb al-ḥiyal)|author=Banu Musa, Donald Routledge Hill|publisher=Springer|year=1979|isbn=90-277-0833-9|pages=21–2[/tpl]

==Mechanisms and methods==

While many of al-Jazari's inventions may now appear to be trivial, the most significant aspect of al-Jazari's machines are the mechanisms, components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ.

===Camshaft===

The camshaft, a shaft to which cams are attached, was first introduced in 1206 by al-Jazari, who employed them in his automata,Georges Ifrah (2001). The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer, p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (See http://www.banffcentre.ca/bnmi/programs/archives/2005/refresh/docs/conferences/Gunalan_Nadarajan.pdf) water clocks (such as the candle clock) and water-raising machines. The cam and camshaft later appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century.A. Lehr (1981), De Geschiedenis van het Astronomisch Kunstuurwerk, p. 227, Den Haag. (See http://odur.let.rug.nl/~koster/musicbox/musicbox2.htm)

===Crankshaft and crank-slider mechanism===

The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary handmill in 5th century BC Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank.Tullia Ritti, Klaus Grewe, Paul Kessener: "A Relief of a Water-powered Stone Saw Mill on a Sarcophagus at Hierapolis and its Implications“, Journal of Roman Archaeology, Vol. 20 (2007), pp. 138–163 (159) The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire. The crank also appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices.[tpl]citation|title=The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature|last=A. F. L. Beeston, M. J. L. Young|first=J. D. Latham, Robert Bertram Serjeant|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-32763-6|page=266[/tpl]
In 1206, al-Jazari invented an early crankshaft, which he incorporated with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder pump. Like the modern crankshaft, Al-Jazari's mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crank pins into motion, with the wheel's motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line.[tpl]citation|title=Islam and Science, Medicine, and Technology|last=Sally Ganchy|first=Sarah Gancher|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=1-4358-5066-1|page=41[/tpl] The crankshaft described by al-Jazari transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion, and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls.Paul Vallely, How Islamic Inventors Changed the World, The Independent, 11 March 2006.Donald Routledge Hill (1998). Studies in Medieval Islamic Technology II, p. 231-232.
He used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his water-raising machines: the crank-driven saqiya chain pump and the double-action reciprocating piston suction pump.Ahmad Y Hassan, The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine[tpl]citation|title=The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature|last=A. F. L. Beeston, M. J. L. Young|first=J. D. Latham, Robert Bertram Serjeant|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-32763-6|pages=270–1[/tpl] His water pump also employed the first known crank-slider mechanism.[tpl]citation|title=al-Jazari (1136–1206)|author=Lotfi Romdhane & Saïd Zeghloul|journal=History of Mechanism and Machine Science|volume=7|publisher=Springer|issn=1875-3442|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2346-9|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-2346-9|pages=1–21[/tpl]

===Design and construction methods===

English technology historian Donald Routledge Hill writes:

===Escapement mechanism in a rotating wheel===

Al-Jazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism.Donald Routledge Hill, "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 751-795 792. Routledge, London and New York.

===Mechanical controls===

According to Donald Routledge Hill, al-Jazari described several early mechanical controls, including "a large metal door, a combination lock and a lock with four bolts."

===Segmental gear===

A segmental gear is "a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear, or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face."Segment gear, TheFreeDictionary.com Professor Lynn Townsend White, Jr. wrote:
[tpl]bquote|Segmental gears first clearly appear in al-Jazari, in the West they emerge in Giovanni de Dondi's astronomical clock finished in 1364, and only with the great Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio (1501) did they enter the general vocabulary of European machine design.The Automata of Al-Jazari. The Topkapı Palace Museum, Istanbul.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl][/tpl]

==Water-raising machines==

Al-Jazari invented five machines for raising water,al-Jazari, The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices: Kitáb fí ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya, translated by P. Hill (1973), Springer Science+Business Media. as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata, in the 12th and 13th centuries, and described them in 1206. It was in these water-raising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components.

===Saqiya chain pumps===

The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari's saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour, though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times,Ahmad Y Hassan, al-Jazari and the History of the Water Clock and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.Donald Routledge Hill, "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 751-795 776. Routledge, London and New York.

===Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion===

Citing the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration,A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times: Irrigation and water supply; Dams; Bridges; Roads; Building construction; Surveying Part two, Mechanical engineering: Water-raising machines; Power from water and wind Part three, Fine technology: Instruments; Automata; Clocks ... By Donald Routledge Hill Published by Routledge, 1996 ISBN 0-415-15291-7, ISBN 978-0-415-15291-4 pg 150 al-Jazari went on to describe the first suction pipes, suction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons:[tpl]Cite web|author=Ahmad Y Hassan|title=The Origin of the Suction Pump: al-Jazari 1206 A.D.|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm|accessdate=16 July 2008[/tpl]Donald Routledge Hill (1996), A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times, Routledge, pp. 143 & 150-2
al-Jazari's suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water,[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Water can only be sucked 10 meters at atmospheric pressure, equal to 760 mm Hg.|date=November 2010[/tpl] with the help of delivery pipes. This was more advanced than the suction pumps that appeared in 15th-century Europe, which lacked delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more efficient than a noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.

===Water supply system===

al-Jazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower, which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a scoop-wheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 81, University of Texas Press, ISBN 0-292-78149-0

==Automata==

Al-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.al-Jazari (Islamic artist), Encyclopædia Britannica. He also invented the earliest known automatic gates, which were driven by hydropower. He also created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks, He also invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.[tpl]Cite web|title=al-Jazari|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year= 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301961/al-Jazari|accessdate=4 October 2009[/tpl]
Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Arab engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows:
[tpl]bquote|The Arabs, on the other hand, displayed an interest in creating human-like machines for practical purposes but lacked, like other preindustrial societies, any real impetus to pursue their robotic science.[tpl]citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|page=36[/tpl][/tpl]

===Drink-serving waitress===

One of al-Jazari's humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.[tpl]citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2HcjanNWFM|accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl]

===Hand-washing automaton with flush mechanism===

al-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. It features a female humanoid automaton standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin.[tpl]citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|pages=9–10[/tpl]

===Peacock fountain with automated servants===

al-Jazari's "peacock fountain" was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows:[tpl]citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|page=9[/tpl]

===Musical robot band===

al-Jazari's work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly intervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switching.
al-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.Professor Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot, University of Sheffield.

==Clocks==

al-Jazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks. These included a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976Donald Routledge Hill (1996), A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times, Routledge, p. 224Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari (ed. 1974) The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, Translated and annotated by Donald Routledge Hill, Dordrecht / D. Reidel, part II. Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars.

===Candle clocks===

According to Donald Routledge Hill, al-Jazari described the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:
al-Jazari's candle clock also included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in modern times.[tpl]citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008[/tpl]

===Elephant clock===

The elephant clock was described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations. It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year.[tpl]Citation | last=Ahmad Y Hassan | last2=Donald Routledge Hill | year=1986 | title=Islamic Technology: An Illustrated History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-26333-6 | pages=57–59[/tpl]

===Castle clock===

al-Jazari's largest astronomical clock was the "castle clock", which was a complex device that was about [tpl]convert|11|ft|m[/tpl] high, and had multiple functions besides timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184. University of Texas Press, ISBN 0-292-78149-0. Another innovative feature was the ability to re-program the length of day and night in order to account for their changes throughout the year. Another feature of the device was five automaton musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel.[tpl]citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pGXL5OKGqs|accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl] Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a float chamber and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases.[tpl]Cite web|author=Salim Al-Hassani|title=How it Works: Mechanism of the Castle Clock|url=http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=901|publisher=FSTC|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl]

===Weight-driven water clocks===

al-Jazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights. These included geared clocks and a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his pen was synonymous to the hour hand of a modern clock. al-Jazari's famous water-powered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976.

==Miniature paintings==

Alongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also an accomplished artist. In The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, he gave instructions of his inventions and illustrated them using miniature paintings, a medieval style of Islamic art.
