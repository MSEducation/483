Ferris State University (FSU, Ferris) is an American public university with its main campus in Big Rapids, Michigan. Founded in 1884 as the Big Rapids Industrial School by Woodbridge Nathan Ferris, an educator from Tioga County, New York, who later served as governor of the State of Michigan and finally in the US Senate where he remained until his death in 1928. The school was noteworthy at its time for accepting female students beginning with its first graduating class. It is also the only public university in Michigan to be founded by an individual.
Today Ferris is the ninth-largest university in the state[tpl]cite web |title= Enrollment Report Fall 2010  |publisher= Presidents Council, State Universities of Michigan  |url= http://www.pcsum.org/Portals/0/docs/PCSUM%202010%20Enrollment%20Report.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= January 21, 2011[/tpl] with 14,560 students  studying on its main campus, at one of the 19 off-campus locations across the state, or online. Two- and four-year degrees are offered through eight academic colleges and graduate degrees from six. Ferris grants professional doctorate degrees via its optometry and pharmacy colleges and a multidisciplinary doctorate of education in community college leadership through the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education and Human Services.  The school is known for its high rate of employment amongst graduates, its faculty-student ratio of 1:16, and that classes are taught by professional instructors, not graduate assistants.

==History==

===The founder===

Woodbridge Nathan Ferris was born January 6, 1853 in a log cabin near Spencer, Tioga County, New York, the son of John Ferris, Jr. and Stella Reed Ferris.[tpl]cite web | title = Ferris State University Historical Timeline  | publisher = Ferris State University Alumni Office  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/alumni/historical/timeline/woodbridge.htm |accessdate = January 21, 2011[/tpl]
As a child, Woodbridge attended a rural public school, which he claimed, was the horror of his life.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris,Country School Days  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/13countr.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl] He did learn to read fairly well there, however, and by the age of 10 was reading the Civil War news to his father. His father was slightly deaf, and Ferris had to learn to speak clearly in order for his father to hear, because his father objected to the practice of merely reading loudly. The practice of clear enunciation, learned at an early age, was a great help to Ferris in his later life as a speechmaker.
When he was 14 years old, Ferris entered the academy at Spencer, NY, where he spent nine months.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris,Academy School Days  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/14academ.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl] At the age of 16, Ferris attended his first teaching institute at Waverly, NY, and shortly afterwards began his first teaching job.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, Early Teaching Experiences  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/15Earlyt.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl] Later, in early spring of 1871, Ferris entered the Oswego Normal and Training School at Oswego, NY. At Oswego (now the State University of New York at Oswego) Ferris came under the tutelage of Hermann Krusi, instructor of drawing and geometry. Krusi was the son of the chief assistant to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi at Pestalozzi's school in Switzerland.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, Owego Academy  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/16Owego.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl]
Oswego Normal during its formative years was pushing the Pestalozzian theory of learning by doing rather than through theory, and Ferris was considerably influenced by it. At Oswego, Ferris met Helen Gillespie, who later became his wife.
In early 1874, Ferris became the principal of Spencer Free Academy. He married Helen Gillespie who also served as a teacher at Spencer. At the end of the second year at Spencer, the Ferrises decided not to continue in public school work but rather to follow his dream of founding a private school.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, Teaching Experience at Spencer, New York  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/19Spence.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl] That dream led Mr. Ferris through several ventures involving private education. In 1879, Ferris once again entered public education as superintendent of schools in Pittsfield, IL. He held this position for five years, leaving it vowing never again to be involved in public education.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, Freeport, Dixon and Pittsfield, Illinois | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/20freepo.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl] In May 1884, he moved his family to Big Rapids, MI with the intention of opening a private school. The Big Rapids Industrial School, forerunner of Ferris State University, opened on September 1, 1884.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, Founding Ferris Industrial School at Big Rapids | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/21foundi.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl]
In addition to his role as an educator, Ferris ran for and was elected to the office of Governor of the State of Michigan in 1912. His overwhelming popularity also got him elected to the office of US Senator in 1922.[tpl]cite web | title = The Autobiography of Woodbridge N. Ferris, My Political Experience  | publisher = Ferris State University  | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/ferrisfaq/woodbridge/29polexp.htm |accessdate = April 16, 2009[/tpl]Woodbridge Ferris died on March 23, 1928, eleven years to the day of Helen Ferris' death. A thousand Ferris students and townspeople gathered at the train station standing in the drizzling rain in silent tribute as the funeral train pulled in. All businesses and schools, including the Institute, were closed the day of the funeral. Many state elected officials attended the funeral, including Governor Fred W. Green. Six military companies and the 126th infantry band marched in the funeral cortege to Highland View Cemetery in Big Rapids, where Mr. and Mrs. Ferris are both interred.

===The school===

Big Rapids Industrial School, as it was originally named, opened on September 1, 1884 in temporary quarters in the Vandersluis Block (present location of J.C. Penney Co.) in Big Rapids. The goal of the school was to provide students with marketable skills for a changing society. By the beginning of the next semester in January 1885 the school changed its name to Ferris Industrial School. In January 1894, the School moved into and dedicated its new building, Old Main, on the corner of Oak and Ives Streets. At this same time, the school was incorporated with capital stock of $50,000.
In 1898 the institution was again renamed to Ferris Institute. In 1900, W. N. Ferris sold capital stock in Ferris Institute to the public, keeping a controlling interest in his own hands. It remained privately owned until August 25, 1931 when the Board of Incorporators, a group of 39 businessmen, purchased Ferris Institute from the old stockholders and selected a board of trustees from their number to govern the school.

===The college===

In February 1943, alumnus Colin Smith introduced a bill in the legislature for the state to purchase Ferris Institute. It passed both houses but was vetoed by Governor Harry Kelly. Six years later on May 17, 1949, Governor G. Mennen Williams signed the bill accepting Ferris Institute as a gift to the State of Michigan, which took over its governance on July 1, 1950. But before the state took control, fire destroyed the Old Main and the Old Pharmacy Buildings on February 21, 1950. Only the Alumni Building and some minor buildings were left standing. Immediate rebuilding of the Institute began and on July 1, 1963 it was again renamed, this time as Ferris State College.

===The university===

In November 1987 the institution became Ferris State University. When Ferris became a state college in the fall of 1950, it had consisted entirely of one permanent structure, the Alumni Building, and some surplus Army barracks. At that time, fewer than 1,000 students were enrolled; there were fewer than 50 faculty members, and the campus itself covered less than [tpl]convert|20|acre[/tpl]. By contrast, current enrollment is more than 14,000, and the [tpl]convert|880|acre|adj=on[/tpl] campus contains 115 buildings, including educational, administrative, maintenance, student activity and residence hall facilities.

==Campus==

Ferris State University joined the state’s Higher Education System in 1950. The campus was all but destroyed by fire the same year. The only building to survive was the Alumni Building, built in 1929, at the north edge of campus. Since the fire, more than 117 buildings have been built on the main campus.

===Main campus===

Located on the southern edge of the City of Big Rapids, straddling the border between Big Rapids Township and the city, the university has over [tpl]convert|880|acre|km2[/tpl] for its main campus. The campus begins about four blocks south of the historic central business district. It is bordered on the north by single-family homes built in the early to middle of the twentieth century. North of Perry Street, the university is bordered by strip commercial development. The university is bordered to the south and west by Big Rapids Township. The township is mostly undeveloped and rural.[tpl]cite web | title = 2009 Master Plan  | publisher = Ferris State University |format = PDF | url = http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/administration/president/pdf/BRmasterplan09.pdf |accessdate = April 17, 2009[/tpl]
The campus is within easy walking distance of downtown Big Rapids with its restaurants, shops, movie theater, art gallery and municipal park. Bicyclists, hikers and in-line skaters have easy access to the White Pine Trail, Michigan's longest "rails to trails" project.[tpl]cite web | title = WMTGC  Fall 2009 Newsletter | publisher = West Michigan Trails & Greenways Coalition | url = http://www.wmtrails.org/uploads/files/FALL2009.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = January 21, 2011[/tpl]
The campus has undergone major changes since 1990. Several new and renovated buildings, reworked roads and parking areas, pedestrian walkways, and greenspace areas have contributed to the changes on campus.
The University has [tpl]convert|3483298|sqft[/tpl] of building space on the Big Rapids campus, with [tpl]convert|1764658|sqft[/tpl] in academic use.
