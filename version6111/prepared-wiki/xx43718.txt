Machine vision (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection,  process control, and robot guidance in industry.[tpl]cite book | author= Steger, Carsten, Markus Ulrich, and Christian Wiedemann |title= Machine Vision Algorithms and Applications | publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim | year=2008 |isbn=978-3-527-40734-7 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bvSgjky9lBYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2010-11-05|page=1[/tpl] The scope of MV is broad.[tpl]cite book|author=Graves, Mark & Bruce G. Batchelor | title=Machine Vision for the Inspection of Natural Products | page=5 |year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-85233-525-0 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PXwz4MDCkYsC&lpg=PA5&pg=PA5#v=onepage&f=false |accessdate=2010-11-02[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Image Acquisition and Processing with LabVIEW |volume=1 | author= Relf, Christopher G. | year=2004 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8493-1480-3 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w38eAPw8FBcC&lpg=PA241&pg=PA241#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate=2010-11-02[/tpl]  MV is related to, though distinct from, computer vision.

==Applications==

The primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot guidance. Common machine vision applications include quality assurance, sorting, material handling, robot guidance, and optical gauging.

==Methods==

Machine vision methods are defined as both the process of defining and creating an MV solution,[tpl]cite journal|author= Dechow, David | title=Integration: Making it Work | journal=Vision & Sensors |date=January 2009 | pages=16–20 | url=http://www.visionsensorsmag.com/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000496708 | accessdate=2012-05-12[/tpl] and as the technical process that occurs during the operation of the solution. Here the latter is addressed. As of 2006, there was little standardization in the interfacing and configurations used in MV.  This includes user interfaces, interfaces for the integration of multi-component systems and automated data interchange.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Machine Vision | author=Hornberg, Alexander |page=709| year= 2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40584-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_1IauK-M2cC&lpg=PA709&pg=PA709#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2010-11-05[/tpl] Nonetheless, the first step in the MV sequence of operation is acquisition of an image, typically using cameras, lenses, and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Machine Vision | author=Hornberg, Alexander |page=427| year= 2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40584-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_1IauK-M2cC&lpg=PA427&pg=PA427#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2010-11-05[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Demant C., Streicher-Abel B. and Waszkewitz P.| title=Industrial Image Processing: Visual Quality Control in Manufacturing| publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1999 | isbn=3-540-66410-6[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] MV software packages then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information, and often make decisions (such as pass/fail) based on the extracted information.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Machine Vision | author=Hornberg, Alexander |page=429| year= 2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40584-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_1IauK-M2cC&lpg=PA429&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2010-11-05[/tpl]

===Imaging===

While conventional (2D visible light) imaging is most commonly used in MV, alternatives include imaging various infrared bands,[tpl]cite journal  |author=Wilson, Andrew | title=The Infrared Choice | journal= Vision Systems Design |date= April 2011 |pages=20–23 | url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-16/issue-4/features/the-infrared-choice.html |volume=16 |issue=4|accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl]  line scan imaging, 3D imaging of surfaces and X-ray imaging.[tpl]cite journal|journal= NASA Tech Briefs |volume= 35 |issue= 6 |date= June 2011 |title=Machine Vision Fundamentals, How to Make Robots See|author=Turek, Fred D. |pages=60–62 |url= http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 | accessdate=2011-11-29[/tpl]  Key divisions within MV 2D visible light imaging are monochromatic vs. color, resolution, and whether or not the imaging process is simultaneous over the entire image, making it suitable for moving processes.West, Perry High Speed, Real-Time Machine Vision  CyberOptics, pages 1-38  The most commonly used method for 3D imaging is scanning based triangulation which utilizes motion of the product or image during the imaging process. Other 3D methods used for machine vision are time of flight, grid based and stereoscopic.
The imaging device (e.g. camera) can either be separate from the main image processing unit or combined with it in which case the combination is generally called a smart camera or smart sensor.[tpl]cite book | title = Smart Cameras | editor = Belbachir, Ahmed Nabil| publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4419-0952-7[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-2/departments/leading-edge-views/explore-the-fundamentals-of-machine-vision-part-i.html  | title=Explore the Fundamentals of Machine Vision: Part 1| volume=18 | issue=2 | date=February 2013 |author=Dechow, David |journal=Vision Systems Design |pages=14–15| accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl]     When separated, the connection may be made to specialized intermediate hardware, a frame grabber using either a standardized (Camera Link, CoaXPress) or custom interface.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/2011/05/coaxpress-standard-camera-frame-grabber-support.html  | title=CoaXPress standard gets camera, frame grabber support | date= May 31, 2011 |author=Wilson, Andrew  |journal=Vision Systems Design |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/2012/11/cameras-certified-as-compliant-with-coaxpress-standard.html | title=Cameras certified as compliant with CoaXPress standard | author=Wilson, Dave |journal=Vision Systems Design | date= November 12, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Dinev, Petko | title=Digital or Analog?

Though the vast majority of machine vision applications are solved using two-dimensional imaging, machine vision applications utilizing 3D imaging are growing niche within the industry.[tpl]cite journal|title=3D Machine Vison Comes into Focus | author= Murray, Charles J| journal= Design News |date=February 2012 | url=http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=237971 | accessdate=2012-05-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book|pages=410–411|author=Davies, E.R. | edition=4th | year=2012 | title=Computer and Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities | publisher=Academic Press| isbn=9780123869081 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AhVjXf2yKtkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA410#v=onepage | accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl] One method is grid array based systems using pseudorandom structured light system as employed by the Microsoft Kinect system circa 2012.http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/fengwu/depth-icip-12.pdf  HYBRID STRUCTURED LIGHT FOR SCALABLE DEPTH SENSING Yueyi Zhang, Zhiwei Xiong, Feng Wu University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, ChinaR.Morano,C.Ozturk,R.Conn,S.Dubin,S.Zietz,J.Nissano, "Structured light using pseudorandom codes",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 20 (3)(1998)322–327  Another method of generating a 3D image is to use laser triangulation, where a laser is projected onto the surfaces of an object and the deviation of the line is used to calculate the shape.  In machine vision this is accomplished with a scanning motion, either by moving the workpiece, or by moving the camera & laser imaging system. Stereoscopic vision is used in special cases involving unique features present in both views of a pair of cameras.  3-D Imaging: A practical Overview for Machine Vision By Fred Turek & Kim Jackson   Quality Magazine, March 2014 issue, Volume 53/Number 3  Pages 6-8

===Image processing===

After an image is acquired, it is processed.[tpl]cite book| author= Davies, E.R. | title=Machine Vision - Theory Algorithms Practicalities | edition=2nd |publisher= Harcourt & Company | isbn=978-0-12-206092-2 | year=1996[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]. Machine vision image processing methods include[tpl]Elucidate|reason=Are these "typical", always done, most common? What is the criteria for making this list? Or is this OR?|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Outputs===

A common output from machine vision systems is pass/fail decisions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] These decisions may in turn trigger mechanisms that reject failed items or sound an alarm. Other common outputs include object position and orientation information from robot guidance systems.  Additionally, output types include numerical measurement data, data read from codes and characters, displays of the process or results, stored images, alarms from automated space monitoring MV systems, and process control signals.West, Perry  A Roadmap For Building A Machine Vision System  Pages 1-35

==Market==

As recently as 2006, one industry consultant reported that MV represented a $1.5 billion market in North America.[tpl]cite journal|journal=CIO|page=46|title=Factories of the Future|author=Hapgood, Fred|volume=20|issue=6|date=December 15, 2006 – January 1, 2007|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nAkAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA46&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false|issn=0894-9301|accessdate=2010-10-28[/tpl] However, the editor-in-chief of an MV trade magazine asserted that "machine vision is not an industry per se" but rather "the integration of technologies and products that provide services or applications that benefit true industries such as automotive or consumer goods manufacturing, agriculture, and defense."[tpl]cite journal |last=Holton|first=W. Conard | title= By Any Other Name |url= http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-15/issue-10/Departments/Inside_Vision/by-any-other-name.html |accessdate=2013-03-05|journal = Vision Systems Design |date=October 2010|issue=10|volume=15|issn=1089-3709[/tpl]
As of 2006, experts estimated that MV had been employed in less than 20% of the applications for which it is potentially useful.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Machine Vision | author=Hornberg, Alexander |page=694| year= 2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40584-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_1IauK-M2cC&lpg=PA694&pg=PA694#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2010-11-05[/tpl]
