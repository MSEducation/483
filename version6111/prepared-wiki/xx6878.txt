===Biology===

Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, the current understanding is descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of organisms that exhibit all or most of the following traits:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North Alabama [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php | title = Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? | accessdate = 2013-06-06 | work = Phoenix Mars Mission | publisher = The University of Arizona[/tpl]
These complex processes, called physiological functions, have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as signaling and control mechanisms that are essential to maintaining life.

====Alternatives====

To reflect the minimum phenomena required, other biological definitions of life have been proposed,[tpl]cite book |last=Popa |first=Radu |title=Between Necessity and Probability: Searching for the Definition and Origin of Life (Advances in Astrobiology and Biogeophysics) |url=http://www.amazon.com/Between-Necessity-Probability-Astrobiology-Biogeophysics/dp/3540204903|publisher=Springer |date=March 2004 |isbn=3-540-20490-3[/tpl] many of these are based upon chemical systems. Biophysicists have commented that living things function on negative entropy.[tpl]Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1944 |isbn=0-521-42708-8[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |coauthor=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-520-22021-8[/tpl] In other words, living processes can be viewed as a delay of the spontaneous diffusion or dispersion of the internal energy of biological molecules towards more potential microstates.[tpl]cite web | first1=Nasif Sabag | last1=Nahle | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date=September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet Organization [/tpl] In more detail, according to physicists such as John Bernal, Erwin Schrödinger, Eugene Wigner, and John Avery, life is a member of the class of phenomena that are open or continuous systems able to decrease their internal entropy at the expense of substances or free energy taken in from the environment and subsequently rejected in a degraded form.[tpl]Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-19-286218-9[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=981-238-399-9 |year=2003[/tpl][ref]
