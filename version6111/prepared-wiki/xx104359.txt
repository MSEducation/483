==DVD==

The rights to the Shazam! portion of the program rest with Warner Bros. (due to the ownership of the Marvel Family cast of characters through DC Comics), who have no plans at this time to release those cartoons. However, Hero High â€” The Complete Series has seen a DVD release containing all twenty-six episodes (which includes guest appearances from Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, as well as Filmation creation Isis). However, "Shazam!" is listed by Entertainment Rights on its website as having the "Worldwide Free TV" rights to the series, which means the company can license the series for broadcast on television. However, it is unclear whether it refers to the animated segments from this series or the live action series made by Filmation in the mid-1970s.
It has been a long standing misconception that there are 13 animated episodes of SHAZAM. There are in fact only 12. "Girl of My Dreams" is not and has never been a missing SHAZAM episode. This can be confirmed in the book "Animation By Filmation." Hero High has an episode entitled "Girl Of His Dreams", which is probably where the misconception came from.
In Brazil, the complete series of 12 SHAZAM cartoons was released by Focus Filmes in 2011.
