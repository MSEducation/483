A temporary school was opened in 1911, with 200 students, staffed by seven Sisters of Charity nuns. Opposite the church, a convent for the Sisters of Charity was opened in January 1913 at a cost of $8,000 (which in 1914 still had a debt of $5,500). In 1914, the parish numbered around 1,000, and the property was valued at $100,000, with a debt of $59,500. The chapel and high school building were erected during the pastorship of Msgr. George McWeeney (1947-1965). During the 1980s, up to 22 masses were celebrated in the parish each week. The rectory, parish center and high school chapel were renovated during the pastorate of Msgr.
