Power Cost Equalization (PCE) is a subsidy from the State of Alaska (USA) to residential utility customers in rural Alaska.  The point of PCE was originally to help "equalize" power costs between rural and urban areas of the state following massive investment in urban power-producing infrastructure without a commensurate investment in rural power generation.
