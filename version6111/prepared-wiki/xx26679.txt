The New Historians ([tpl]lang-he|ההיסטוריונים החדשים[/tpl], HaHistoryonim HaHadashim) are a loosely-defined group of Israeli historians who have challenged traditional versions of Israeli history, including Israel's role in the Palestinian Exodus in 1948 and Arab willingness to discuss peace. The term was coined in 1988 by Benny Morris, one of the leading New Historians. According to Ethan Bronner of The New York Times, the New Historians have sought to advance the peace process in the region.Bronner, Ethan. "The New New Historians", The New York Times, 9 November 2003.
Much of the primary source material used by the group comes from Israeli government papers that were newly available as a result of being declassified thirty years after the founding of Israel.[tpl]cite book |last=Gelvin |first=James L. |authorlink=James L.

Many of their conclusions have been incorporated into the political ideology of  post-Zionists. The political views of the individual historians vary, as do the periods of Israeli history in which they specialize.

==Main arguments==

Avi Shlaim described the New Historians' differences from what he termed the "official history" in the following terms. According to Shlaim:
 
 Pappé suggests that the Zionist leaders intended to displace most Palestinian Arabs; Morris believes the displacement happened in the heat of war. According to the New Historians, Israel and Arab countries each have their share of responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian plight.

==Influence on traditional Israeli historical narrative and public opinion==

Michal Ben-Josef Hirsch argues that, prior to the advent of the New Historians, "Israelis held to a one-sided historical narrative of the circumstances leading to the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem, and that any other counter-narratives were taboo." According to Ben-Josef Hirsch, the conclusions of the New Historians, and the wide-ranging debate that they provoked, ended that taboo and changed the way in which the Palestinian refugee problem and its causes were viewed in Israel. Ben-Josef Hirsch says that the traditional Israeli narrative, that Arabs were responsible for the exodus of the Palestinians, held from 1948 to the late 1990s. She says that the arguments of the New Historians significantly challenged that narrative, leading to a broad debate both in academia and in the wider public discourse, including journalists and columnists, politicians, public figures, and the general public.
Ben-Josef Hirsch believes that a significant change has occurred in how the Palestinian Refugee issue is viewed in Israeli society since the late 1990s, with a more complex narrative being more accepted; it recognizes there were instances where Israeli forces expelled Palestinians with the knowledge and authorization of the Israeli leadership. Ben-Josef Hirsch attributes that change to the work of the New Historians and the resulting debate.[tpl]cite journal|last=ben-Josef Hirsch|first=Michel|title=From Taboo to the Negotiable: The Israeli New Historians and the Changing Representation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=241–258|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1020864[/tpl]
Critics of the New Historians have acknowledged this shift. Avi Beker, writing in the Jerusalem Post, states that the effect of the New Historians work on the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict "cannot be exaggerated". He says the work of the New Historians is now the mainstream in academia, and that their influence was not confined to intellectual circles. To illustrate his point he cites examples from changes to Israeli school text books to the actions of Israeli political leaders and developments in the Peace Process.[tpl]cite news|last=Beker|first=Avi|title=When history is flexible|url=http://www.jpost.com/ChristianInIsrael/Features/Article.aspx?id=179581|accessdate=2012-10-20|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|date=2010-06-26[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The writings of the New Historians have come under repeated criticism, both from traditional Israeli historians who accuse them of fabricating Zionist misdeeds, and from Arab or pro-Arab writers who accuse them of whitewashing the truth about Zionist misbehaviour. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Effraim Karsh has accused them of ignoring questions which he says are critical: Who started the war? What were their intentions? Who was forced to mount a defence? What were Israel's casualties?[tpl]cite book |title=Fabricating Israel's History: The New Historians |author=Karsh, Efraim |isbn=0-7146-5011-0 |year=1997 |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London[/tpl]
Early in 2002, the most famous of the new historians, Benny Morris, publicly reversed some of his personal political positions,Morris, 2002 though he has not withdrawn any of his historical writings. Morris says he did not use much of the newly available archival material when he wrote his book: "When writing The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947–1949 in the mid-1980s, I had no access to the materials in the IDFA IDF Archive] or the Haganah Archive and precious little to first-hand military materials deposited elsewhere."[tpl]cite book |title=The War for Palestine: Rewriting the History of 1948 |pages=37 |author=Morris, Benny (from ""Revisiting the Palestinian Exodus of 1948,") |year=2001 |publisher=Rogan.

Anita Shapira offers the following criticism:
Israeli historian Yoav Gelber criticized New Historians in an interview, saying that aside from Benny Morris, they did not contribute to the research of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in any way. He did however note that they contributed to the public discourse about the war.[tpl]cite book|title=A War – Sixty Years After|editor=Shiran, Osnat|isbn=978-965-05-1457-0|publisher=Ministry of Defence Publishing|year=2008|page=42[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]

===Post-Zionism===

Some commentators have argued that the historiography of the New Historians has both drawn inspiration from, and lent impetus to, a movement known as post-Zionism. Generally the term "post-Zionist" is self-identified by Jewish Israelis who are critical of the Zionist enterprise and are seen by Zionists as undermining the Israeli national ethos.Shlomo Sharan (Editor) (2003) Israel and the Post-Zionists: A Nation at Risk Sussex Academic Press ISBN 1-903900-52-2 p. 10 (Yoav Gelber, "Redefining the Israeli Ethos") Post-Zionists differ from Zionists on many important details, such as the status of the law of return and other sensitive issues. Post-Zionists view the Palestinian dispossession as central to the creation of the state of Israel. [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Baruch Kimmerling criticised the focus on "post-zionism", arguing that debates around the term were "nonsense and semi-professional and
mainly political". According to Kimmerling the term has been arbitrarily applied to any research on Israeli history, society or politics that was critical or perceived to be critical. Kimmerling saw this discussion as damaging to research in these areas because it took the focus away from the quality and merit of scholarship and onto whether the work should be characterized as Zionist or post-Zionist. Further, Kimmerling asserted that academics were diverted away from serious research onto polemical issues and that the environment this fostered inhibited the research of younger academics who were fearful of being labeled as belonging to one of the two camps.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kimmerling|first=Baruch|title=Benny Morris ‘s Shocking Interview|journal=http://www.logosjournal.com/kimmerling.pdf|year=2004|volume=Winter|issue=3.1|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/kimmerling.pdf|accessdate=2013-01-30[/tpl]
