It is also the seventh-most populous sub-national entity in the world, with over 91 million inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gadm&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-104&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&va=x|title=India: Administrative Divisions (population and area)|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=17 April 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/FFLe|archivedate=17 December 2012[/tpl] Spread over [tpl]convert|34267|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl], it is bordered by the countries of Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata. Together with the neighboring nation of Bangladesh and the state of Tripura, it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal.
Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Vedic kingdoms. Bengal region was part of large Indian empires such as the Maurya empire (second century BC) and Gupta Empire (fourth century AD); and part of the regional Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century) and Sena dynasty (11th–12th century). From the 13th century onward, the region was ruled by several sultans, Hindu kings and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, until the beginning of British rule in the 18th century. The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in expansion of Western education, culminating in development in science, institutional education, and social reforms of the region, including what became known as the Bengal Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20th century, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal—a state of India—and East Bengal—a part of the newly created Pakistani Dominion—later becoming an independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971.
A major agricultural producer, West Bengal is the sixth-largest contributor to India's net domestic product. Noted for its political activism, the state was ruled by democratically elected communist government for 34 years, starting from 1977. West Bengal is noted for its cultural activities and presence of cultural and educational institutions; the state capital Kolkata is known as the "cultural capital of India". The state's cultural heritage, besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. West Bengal is also distinct from most other Indian states in its appreciation and practice of playing Football besides the national favourite sport cricket.[tpl]cite book|title=Soccer in South Asia: empire, nation, diaspora |year=2001 |publisher= Frank Cass Publishers|location=London |isbn=978-0-7146-8170-2 |page=71 |last=Dineo |first= Paul |last2=Mills |first2= James[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The magic of Indian cricket: cricket and society in India|year=2006 |publisher= Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-35691-6 |page=240 |last=Bose|first= Mihir[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last= Das Sharma|first=Amitabha |year=2002 |title=Football and the big fight in Kolkata |journal=Football Studies |volume= 5|issue=2 |page=57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/2002/FS0502g.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name of the region Bengal (বাংলা Bangla and বঙ্গ Bongo in Bengali language) is of unknown origins. One theory suggests that the word derives from "Bang", a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC.[tpl]cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+bd0014%29|title= Bangladesh: early history, 1000 B.C.–A.D. 1202 |date=September 1988 |work= Bangladesh: A country study|publisher=Library of Congress |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2 March 2012|quote=Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang. Their homeland bore various titles that reflected earlier tribal names, such as Vanga, Banga, Bangala, Bangal, and Bengal.[/tpl] The word might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga (or Banga). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name, the region's early history is obscure.
At times of British Rule over the Indian subcontinent, the Bengal region was partitioned in 1947 along religious lines into east and west. The east came to be known as East Bengal (which later succeeded as an independent nation of Bangladesh) and the west came to known as West Bengal which remained as an Indian state. In 2011, the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name for the state to Poschimbongo ([tpl]lang-bn|পশ্চিমবঙ্গ[/tpl] Pôshchimbônggô)http://promotebangla.blogspot.in/2011/09/paschim-banga-is-new-name-why-not.html#.UffNdtJM-So[tpl]cite news |title=West Bengal may be renamed PaschimBanga |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2373155.ece |newspaper= The Hindu|location=Chennai, India|date= 19 August 2011|accessdate=7 February 2012[/tpl] which reflects the native name of the state, literally meaning western Bengal in the native Bengali language.
