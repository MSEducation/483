Hobo is a sans serif typeface.  It is unique in having virtually no straight lines and no descenders. It was created by Morris Fuller Benton and issued by American Type Founders in 1910.  A light version, Light Hobo, was released in 1915.  Matrices were offered for mechanical composition by Intertype.  Hobo possesses uniquely organic and art nouveau-style features.
Its name came from a story stating that it was sketched in the early 1900s, sent to the foundry nameless, and progressed so little for so long, that it was called "that old hobo".  Hobo, originally called Adface, was finally patented in 1915 along with Light Hobo.[tpl]cite book|last=McGrew|first=Mac|title=American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century|year=1993|publisher=Oak Knoll Books|isbn=0-938768-39-5|pages=181[/tpl]
