The SPLC's litigating strategy involves filing civil suits for damages on behalf of the victims of hate group harassment, threats, and violence with the goal of financially depleting the responsible groups and individuals. While it originally focused on damages done by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, throughout the years the SPLC has become involved in other civil rights causes, among them, cases concerned with institutional racial segregation and discrimination, the mistreatment of aliens, and the separation of church and state. Along with civil rights organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, the SPLC has provided information about hate groups to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[tpl]cite book|title=Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance |page=32 |first=George |last=Michael |publisher=Vanderbilt University Press |year=2012 |isbn=0826518559[/tpl]

==History==

The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in 1971 as a law firm to handle anti-discrimination cases in the United States.  SPLC's first president was Julian Bond, who served as president until 1979 and remains on its board of directors. In 1979, the Center brought the first of its many cases against various Ku Klux Klan type organizations. In 1981, the Center began its Klanwatch project to monitor the activities of the KKK. That project, now called Hatewatch, has been expanded to include seven other types of hate organizations.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp | title=Active U.S. Hate Groups in 2006 | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2007 | first=  | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18[/tpl]

In May 1998, three white supremacists were arrested for allegedly planning a nationwide campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting "Morris Dees, an undisclosed federal judge in Illinois, a black radio-show host in Missouri, Dees's Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, and the Anti-Defamation League in New York.""Group is accused of plotting assassinations, bombings.

In 1999[tpl]cite news|title=Law Center Begins Project|newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser|date=February 16, 1999[/tpl]  the SPLC broke ground on their new headquarters building.   It was completed in 2001.[tpl]cite news|title=Southern Poverty Law Center's New Home|newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser|date=March 29, 2001[/tpl]
The SPLC has been criticized for using hyperbole and overstating the prevalence of hate groups to raise large amounts of money. In a 2000 Harper's Magazine article, Ken Silverstein said that Dees has kept the SPLC focused on fighting anti-minority groups like the KKK, whose membership has declined to just 2,000, instead of on issues like homelessness, mostly because the former issue makes for more lucrative fundraising. The article also claimed that the SPLC "spends twice as much on fund-raising--$5.76 million last year--as it does on legal services for victims of civil rights abuses."The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance, Ken Silverstein, Harper's Magazine, November 2000 Harper's also pointed out that more than 95% of hate crimes are committed by lone wolves without any connection to militia groups the SPLC speaks of.
In July 2007, the SPLC filed suit against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA) in Meade County, where in July 2006 five Klansmen allegedly beat Jordan Gruver, a 16-year-old boy of Panamanian descent, at a Kentucky county fair. After filing the suit, the SPLC received nearly a dozen threats. During the November 2008 civil trial, a former member of the IKA said that the Klan head told him to kill Dees.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-13-972492389_x.htm | title=Former member: Ky.

==Litigation==

The Southern Poverty Law Center has won multiple civil cases resulting in monetary awards for the plaintiffs. The SPLC has said it does not accept any portion of monetary judgments. Dees and the SPLC "have been credited with devising innovative legal ways to cripple hate groups, including seizing their assets."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0616FC395D0C718DDDAC0894DE494D81 | title=Conversations/Morris Dees; A Son of Alabama Takes On Americans Who Live to Hate | work=The New York Times |date= May 12, 1996 | first=Kevin  | last=Sack | accessdate = 2007-09-18[/tpl]

===Young Men's Christian Association===

In 1969, prior to founding the SPLC, Dees sued the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Montgomery, Alabama at the request of civil rights activist Mary Louise Smith, whose son Vincent and nephew EdwardDees and Fiffer (1991) p.108 the YMCA had refused to allow to attend its summer camp.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Heinrich|title=Montgomery: The Civil Rights Movement and Its Legacies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oPPVMt9ravIC&pg=PA260|series=Ph.D. dissertation|year=2008|publisher=Brandeis University|isbn=978-0-549-69927-9|page=260[/tpl]  The YMCA was, of course, a private organization and therefore presumptively not bound by the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,YMCA desegregation ruling turns 40 The Louisiana Weekly, July 26, 2010.

This fact led the trial court to rule that the YMCA had a "municipal charter" and was therefore bound by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to desegregate its facilities.[tpl]cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UVgKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT4836|date=10 October 2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-94704-0|page=4836[/tpl] According to historian Timothy Minchin, Dees was "emboldened by this victory" when he founded the SPLC in 1971.

===White Patriot Party===

In 1982 armed members of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan terrorized Bobby Person, a black prison guard and members of his family. They harassed and threatened others, including a white woman who had befriended blacks. In 1984 Person became the lead plaintiff in Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  a lawsuit brought by the SPLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The harassment and threats continued during litigation and the court issued an order prohibiting any person from interfering with other persons inside the courthouse."Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan". Southern Poverty Law Center. Retrieved November 21, 2011.
In January 1985, the court issued a consent order that prohibited the group's "Grand Dragon," Glenn Miller, and his followers from operating a paramilitary organization, parading in black neighborhoods, and from harassing, threatening or harming any black person or white persons who associated with black persons. Subsequently, the court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for damages.
Within a year the court found Miller and his followers, now calling themselves the White Patriot Party, in criminal contempt for violating the consent order. Miller was sentenced to six months in prison followed by a three-year probationary period, during which he was banned from associating with members of any racist group such as the White Patriot Party. Miller refused to obey the terms of his probation. He made underground "declarations of war" against Jews and the federal government before being arrested again. Found guilty of weapons violations, he went to federal prison for three years.“Fighting hate in the courtroom.” SPLC Report. Special Issue, vol. 38, no.4.

===Aryan Nations===

In September 2000, the SPLC won a $6.3 million judgment against the Aryan Nations from an Idaho jury who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards. The lawsuit stemmed from the July 1998 attack when security guards at the Aryan Nations compound near Hayden Lake, in northern Idaho, shot at Victoria Keenan and her son.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.splcenter.org/legal/docket/files.jsp?cdrID=30&sortID=0 | title=Keenan v.

===Ten Commandments monument===

In 2002, the SPLC and the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore for authorizing a two-ton display of the Ten Commandments on public property.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/13/moore.tencommandments/ | title=Ten Commandments judge removed from office | publisher=CNN |date=November 14, 2003  | first=  | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18[/tpl] Moore, who had final authority over what decorations were to be placed in the Alabama State Judicial Building's Rotunda, had installed a 5,280 pound (2400 kg) granite block, three feet wide by three feet deep by four feet tall, of the Ten Commandments late at night without the knowledge of any other court justice.Glassroth v. Moore (PDF) (M.D. Ala. 2002). After defying several court rulings, Moore was eventually removed from the court, and the monument was removed as well.

===Ranch rescue===

On March 18, 2003, two illegal aliens from El Salvador, Edwin Alfredo Mancía Gonzáles and Fátima del Socorro Leiva Medina, were trespassing through a Texas ranch owned by Joseph Sutton.  They were accosted by vigilantes known as Ranch Rescue who were recruited by Sutton to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border region nearby.
According to the SPLC, Gonzáles and Medina were held at gunpoint, and Gonzáles was struck on the back of the head with a handgun, and a rottweiler was allowed to attack him. The SPLC said Gonzáles and Medina were threatened with death and otherwise terrorized before being released. The El Salvadorans stated that the ranchers gave them water, cookies and a blanket before letting them go after about an hour. Ranch Rescuer Casey James Nethercott denied hitting either of the trespassers with a gun, and none of the vigilantes were convicted of pistol-whipping.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/19/national/19ranch.html?pagewanted=print |date=2005-08-19 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-01-01 |first=Andrew |last=Pollack |title=2 Illegal Immigrants Win Arizona Ranch in Court[/tpl]
In 2003, SPLC, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and local attorneys filed a civil suit, Leiva v. Ranch Rescue, in Jim Hogg County, Texas, against Ranch Rescue and several of its associates, seeking damages for assault and illegal detention. In April 2005, SPLC obtained judgments totaling $1 million against Nethercott and Torre John Foote, Ranch Rescue's leader. Those awards came six months after a $350,000 judgment in the same case and coincided with a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with Sutton. Nethercott’s [tpl]convert|70|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] Arizona property, which was Ranch Rescue's headquarters, was seized to pay the judgment. Nethercott, previously convicted of assault in California, was sentenced to five years in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm.

===Imperial Klans of America===

In November 2008, the SPLC's case against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA), the nation's second largest Klan organization, began in Meade County, Kentucky.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27665247/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/no-klan-group-trial-ky-teens-beating/ | publisher=Associated Press via MSNBC |date= November 11, 2008| first= | last=  | accessdate =2012-09-12|title=No. 2 Klan group on trial in Ky. teen's beating - Southern Poverty Law Center hopes case will bankrupt hate group[/tpl] The SPLC filed suit in July 2007 on behalf of Jordan Gruver and his mother against the IKA in Kentucky where in July 2006, five Klansmen savagely beat Gruver at a Kentucky county fair.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.splcenter.org/legal/docket/files.jsp?cdrID=69&sortID=2 | title=Jordan Gruver and Cynthia Gruver vs. Imperial Klans of America | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=July 25, 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18[/tpl] According to the lawsuit, five Klan members went to the Meade County Fairgrounds in Brandenburg, Kentucky, "to hand out business cards and flyers advertising a 'white-only' IKA function." Two members of the Klan started calling the 16-year-old boy of Panamanian descent a "spic". Subsequently the boy, ([tpl]convert|5|ft|3|in|m[/tpl] and weighing [tpl]convert|150|lb|kg[/tpl]) was beaten and kicked by the Klansmen (one of whom was [tpl]convert|6|ft|5|in|m[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|300|lb|kg[/tpl]). As a result, the victim received "two cracked ribs, a broken left forearm, multiple cuts and bruises and jaw injuries requiring extensive dental repair."
In a related criminal case in February 2007, Jarred Hensley and Andrew Watkins had been sentenced to three years in prison for beating Gruver. On November 14, 2008, an all-white jury of seven men and seven women awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff against Ron Edwards, Imperial Wizard of the group, and Jarred Hensley, who participated in the attack.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/11/14/klan.sued.verdict/index.html | title=Jury awards $2.5 million to teen beaten by Klan members | publisher=CNN |date=November 14, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-11-18[/tpl] The two other defendants, Andrew Watkins and Joshua Cowles, previously agreed to confidential settlements and were dropped from the suit.Kenning, Chris. 2008. “$2.5 million awarded in Klan beating,” The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky), November 15, 2008, p. 1.

==Advocacy==

===Opposition to Arizona illegal immigration measure===

The SPLC has spoken against Arizona SB 1070, the anti-illegal immigration measure passed by the state of Arizona in 2010, calling it "brazenly unconstitutional" and "a civil rights disaster". In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case, Arizona v. United States, upholding the provision requiring immigration status checks during law enforcement stops but striking down three other provisions as violations of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

==Education==

===Tolerance.org===

The SPLC's initiatives include the website Tolerance.org, past winner of the international Webby Award.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.tolerance.org/about/index.html | title=Tolerance.org: About us | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2005 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17[/tpl] The site provides daily news on tolerance issues, educational games for children, guidebooks for activists, and resources for parents and teachers.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.tolerance.org/teach/index.jsp | title= Teaching Tolerance | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2005 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.tolerance.org/teach/about/index.jsp | title=About Teaching Tolerance | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2005 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
The site's Teaching Tolerance initiative is aimed at two different age groups of students with separate materials for teachers and parents. One portion of the project targets elementary school children, providing material on the history of the civil rights movement.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.tolerance.org/pt/index.html | title=Planet Tolerance | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2005 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] The center's material for elementary school children includes a publication entitled "A fresh look at multicultural 'American English'" which explores the cultural history of common words. A project website includes an interactive program addressing such topics as Native American school mascots, displays of the Confederate flag, and the themes of popular music and entertainment, encouraging pupils to consider racial, gender, and sexual orientation sensitivities.
A similar program aimed at middle and high school pupils includes a "Mix it Up" project urging readers to participate in school activities involving interaction between different social groups.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.tolerance.org/teens/about.jsp | title=Mix it up:Our Story | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |year= 2005 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17[/tpl] Other features of this project includes political activism tips and reports highlighting student activism. The SPLC puts out a monthly publication typically focusing on a minority, feminist, or LGBT youth organization. Publications such as "Ways to fight hate on campus" suggest ideas for community activism and diversity education.
Teaching Tolerance also provides advice to parents, encouraging multiculturalism in the upbringing of their children. A guide urges parents to "examine the 'diversity profile' of your children's friends," to move to "integrated and economically diverse neighborhoods," and to discourage children from playing with toys or adopting heroes that "promote violence." The publication also advises parents to use culturally sensitive language (such as the gender-neutral phrasing "Someone Special Day" instead of the traditional Mothers Day and Fathers Day) and to make sure that "cultural diversity (is) reflected in your home's artwork, music and literature."

===Documentaries===

The SPLC also produces documentary films. Two have won Academy Awards for documentary short subject: Mighty Times: The Children's March, in 2005, and A Time for Justice in 1995.[ref]"Mighty Times: The Children’s March"[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl], 77th Academy Awards

==Tracking of hate groups and extremists==

===Hate group listings===

The SPLC maintains a list of hate groups defined as groups that "...have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics."  It says that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting, and criminal acts such as violence. It says not all groups so listed by the SPLC engage in criminal activity. The FBI has partnered with the SPLC and many other local and national organizations "to establish rapport, share information, address concerns, and cooperate in solving problems".[tpl]cite web|title=Hate Crime—Overview|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes/overview|publisher=FBI|accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl]

===Anti-government patriot groups===

The SPLC's Intelligence Project states that it "identified 1,360 anti-government 'Patriot' groups that were active in 2012" The SPLC describes these groups as parts of an extremist Patriot Movement characterized by anti-government doctrines, conspiracy theories or opposition to the New World Order. The SPLC states that its listing of groups does not imply that such groups "engage in violence or other criminal activities, or are racist"."Active 'Patriot' Groups in the United States in 2012".

===Controversy=== 
The SPLC's listing of hate groups has been a source of some controversy. The designation of "hate groups" has inspired criticism from conservative elected officials and non-profits. In 2010 it was reported that "22 Republican lawmakers, among them Speaker Boehner and Representative Bachmann, three governors, and a number of conservative organizations took out full-page ads in two Washington papers castigating the SPLC for 'character assassination' by listing the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group."Jonsson, Patrik (February 23, 2011).

===Year in Hate and Extremism===

Since 2001, the SPLC has released an annual issue of the Intelligence Project called Year in Hate later renamed Year in Hate and Extremism, in which they present statistics on the numbers of hate groups in America. The current format of the report covers racial hate groups, nativist hate groups, and other right-wing extremist groups such as groups within the Patriot Movement.

===Academic assessment===

In their study of the white separatist movement in the United States, sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile referred to the SPLC's Klanwatch Intelligence Reports in saying "we relied on the SPLC and ADL for general information, but we have noted differences between the way events have been reported and what we saw at rallies. For instance, events were sometimes portrayed in Klanwatch Intelligence Reports as more militant and dangerous with higher turnouts than we observed."Betty A. Dobratz, Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile, The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!", The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000, 1-3.
Rory McVeigh, the chair of the University of Notre Dame Sociology Department, wrote that "its outstanding reputation is well established, and the SPLC has been an excellent source of information for social scientists who study racist organizations."

==Finances==

The SPLC's activities including litigation are supported by fundraising efforts, and it does not accept any fees or share in legal judgments awarded to clients it represents in court.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=41 | title=Endowment Supports Center's Future Work | publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date= June 2003  | first=  | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930170924/http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=41  |archivedate = 2007-09-30[/tpl]
Starting in 1974, the SPLC set aside money for its endowment because it was "convinced that the day (would) come when nonprofit groups (would) no longer be able to rely on support through mail because of posting and printing costs." The SPLC has received criticism for perceived disproportionate endowment reserves and misleading fundraising practices. In 1994 the Montgomery Advertiser ran a series reporting that the SPLC was financially mismanaged and employed misleading fundraising practices."Attacking a Home-Town Icon" Jim Tharpe, Nieman Watchdog 1995.Morse, Dan (February 14, 1994), "A complex man: Opportunist or crusader?", Montgomery Advertiser In response co-founder Joe Levin stated: "The Advertiser's lack of interest in the center's programs and its obsessive interest in the center's financial affairs and Mr. Dees' personal life makes it obvious to me that the Advertiser simply wants to smear the center and Mr. Dees."Morse, Dan & Jaffe, Greg (February 14, 1994), "Critics question $52 million reserve, tactics of wealthiest civil rights group", Montgomery Advertiser  The series was a finalist for but did not win a 1995 Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/1995 | title=1995 Finalists: Explanatory Journalism  | publisher=Pulitzer Prize |year= 1995  | first=  | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18[/tpl] In 1996 USA Today called the SPLC "the nation's richest civil rights organization", with $68 million in assets at the time.Andrea Stone, "Morris Dees: At the Center of the Racial Storm," USA Today, August 3, 1996, A-7 Commentators Alexander Cockburn writing in The Nation and Ken Silverstein writing in Harper's Magazine have been sharply critical of the SPLC's fundraising appeals and finances.Cockburn, Alexander (November 9, 1998), "The Conscience Industry", The Nation,  "Morris Dees has raised an endowment of close to $100 million, with which he's done little, by frightening elderly liberals that the heirs of Adolf Hitler are about to march down Main Street, lynching blacks and putting Jews into ovens. The fund raising of Dees and the richly rewarded efforts of terror mongers like Leonard Zeskind offer a dreadfully distorted view of American political realities."Silverstein, Ken (November 1, 2000), "The Church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance", Harper's Magazine, p. 54Silverstein, Ken (March 2, 2007), "This Week in Babylon: Southern Poverty: richer than Tonga"[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl], Harper's Magazine
