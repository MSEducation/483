Zakojca is a settlement in the Municipality of Cerkno in the traditional Littoral region of Slovenia. It consists of three hamlets: Dolnja Vas, Srednja Vas, and Gornja Vas ([tpl]lang-sl|Dolnja vas, Srednja vas, Gornja vas[/tpl]).

==Name==

The name of the settlement is derived from Mount Kojca. It is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost case inflection (za + Kojca, literally 'behind Mount Kojca') and refers to the settlement's location on the opposite (north) side of Mount Kojca in relation to other nearby villages on the south side of the mountain.Snoj, Marko. 2009.
