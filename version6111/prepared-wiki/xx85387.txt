CATEGORIES: 1462 births, 1506 deaths, Counts of Nevers

Engelbert of Cleves, Count of Nevers (* 26 September 1462 – † 21 November 1506) was the younger son of John I, Duke of Cleves and Elizabeth of Nevers, only surviving child of John II, Count of Nevers.
In 1481, he was sent with a large army to the Bishopric of Utrecht by his brother John II, Duke of Cleves instead of David of Burgundy. But after the Siege of Utrecht (1483) he had to flee, and Utrecht remained under control of Burgundy.
He married Charlotte of Bourbon-Vendôme, daughter of John VIII, Count of Vendôme, circa 1489. Their son, Charles II, Count of Nevers, married Marie of Albret, Countess of Rethel. He became Count of Nevers and Eu in 1491 upon the death of his maternal grandfather John II, Count of Nevers. His eldest brother John (1458–1521) inherited Cleves.
