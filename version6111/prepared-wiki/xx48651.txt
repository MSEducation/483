[[St. Hanshaugen]]

CATEGORIES: Boroughs of Oslo

St. Hanshaugen (Norwegian for St. John's Hill) is a district of the city of Oslo, Norway.

==Area==

It has a triangular shape, with its northern border just north of the buildings of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and Ullevål University Hospital, and south of the University of Oslo campus at Blindern. In the east, the boundary runs just west of the river Akerselva, then down Storgata before it turns north, up Grensen, Pilestredet and Suhms gate.
The district has its name from St. Hanshaugen Park that lies centrally within it, where the citizens used to celebrate summer solstice (St. Hans in Norwegian). The park was planted by the city in the years 1876-86; it has a pavilion, and a reflecting pool covering a reservoir.
To the southeast of the park is Oslo’s oldest building – Aker Kirke, built around 1100, but restored from ruins around 1860, and then again in the 1950s in a more authentic style. Next to the church is the cemetery Vår Frelsers gravlund, created in 1808 as a result of the great famine and cholera epidemic of the Napoleonic Wars. The nearby area around Damstredet and Telthusbakken is interesting since it retains the small town character of Oslo in the first part of the 19th century.
To the southwest of the park is Bislett stadion, founded in 1907. Finished in 1940, this was the main venue of the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The stadium was demolished in 2004, and a new stadion was built in its place.
The borough also contains the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, the cemeteries Nordre Gravlund and Vestre Aker, and Youngstorget – home of the Norwegian labour movement.

==Park==

St. Hanshaugen is one of Oslo's largest parks, just north of the city centre. This popular recreational area is great for walks, and from the top of the hill you have a nice view of Oslo.
St. Hanshaugen was originally a bare rock hill. In the 1840s the name St. Hanshaugen ("midsummer hill") came into use, as the hill was a popular place for midsummer celebrations. In 1855 it was decided that parts of the hill was to be planted, and a big part of the hill was turned into a park in the next 30 years. The park also got a park keeper house, an artificial creek and a pavilion on the square Festplassen, and the park was expanded. Through the years, a number of statues were also placed in the park. In 1936, the park got an open-air café on Festplassen - the square on top of the hill - which is still a popular summer café today.
