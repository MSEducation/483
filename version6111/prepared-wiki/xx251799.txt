The Ishbel Group is a stratigraphical unit of Permian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 
It was first defined by A. McGugan in 1963.McGugan, A., 1963. A Permian brachiopod and fusulinid fauna from Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. Journal of Paleontology, v. 37, p. 621-627. It is named for Mount Ishbel of the Sawback Range, and parts of the group were first described in the vicinity of the mountain (Ranger Canyon, Johnston Canyon).

==Lithology==

The Ishbel Group is composed of carbonate, sandstone, chert and siltstone.

==Paleontology==

The Ishbel Group was laid down under Phosphoria depositional conditions;[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/5/1123|title=Biostratigraphy and faunas of the Permian Ishbel Group, Canadian Rocky Mountains |author=Journal of Paleontology|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] among the fossils that can be found are productid, chonetid and spiriferid brachiopods, omphalotrochid gastropod and edestid elasmobranch fish.

==Distribution==

The Ishbel Group reaches a maximum thickness of [tpl]convert|427|m|ft|-1[/tpl]. It occurs in the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies as far north as the Peace River.

==Subdivisions==

==Relationship to other units==

The Ishbel Group is disnconformably overlain by the Spray River Group and unconformably overlays the Tunnel Mountain Formation and the Kananaskis Formation in Kananaskis Country.
It is equivalent to the Phosphoria Formation in Montana and Idaho.
