James Clement Dooge (30 July 1922 – 20 August 2010) was an Irish politician, engineer, climatologist, hydrologist and academic. Dooge had a profound effect on the debate on climate change, in the world of hydrology and in politics in the formation of the European Union.
Dooge lived a multifaceted existence with his roles including a period as Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Acting President of Ireland (Presidential Commission), chairman of the report which led to the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht, Chairman of the Irish Senate, Professor of Engineering in University College Cork and University College Dublin, President of the International Council for Science, President of the Royal Irish Academy and Chairman of the Irish Film Board.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2010/0828/1224277773460.html |title=Eminent senator, statesman and man of science|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=7 September 2010 |date=8 August 2010[/tpl]
Dooge was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and the Fellowship of Engineering. He worked as an expert consultant to a wide range of specialised United Nations agencies including UNESCO, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). He also acted in an expert consultancy role to DGXII (Research) at the European Commission.
He is best known in Ireland as only the second Senator to be appointed to the cabinet. In the world of academia and hydrology he is known for his numerous publications in the field with unit hydrograph theory developed by Dooge in 1959J.C.I. Dooge, Parameterization of hydrologic processes, JSC Study Conference on Land Surface Processes in Atmospheric General Circulation Models, 243–284 (1959) and is generally regarded as a pioneer in the field.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/home/jim-dooge-one-of-the-pioneers-of-hydrology-passed-away.html |title= Jim Dooge, One of the Pioneers of Hydrology passed away |work=The European Geosciences Union |accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unesco-ihe.org/About/News/UNESCO-IHE-Honorary-Fellow-Professor-James-C.-I.-Dooge-passed-away-at-the-age-of-88-on-20-August-2010 |title=UNESCO-IHE Honorary Fellow Professor James C.

Upon his death in 2010, UNESCO-IHE described him as a "towering figure and pioneer in hydrology" whilst the Chancellor of the NUI, Dr. Maurice Manning, described him as "that rare phenomenon in Irish life, a public intellectual whose life was devoted, without posture, to the public service."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0824/1224277445132.html |title=Renaissance man devoted to public service|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=13 September 2010 |date=8 August 2010[/tpl] Professor John Sweeney who was one of the scientists as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 described him as "perhaps one of the most important, prolific and distinguished scientists of the past generation."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sciencespin.com/magazine/archive/2009/09/what-is-irelands-climate-future/ |title=What is Ireland's climate future?|work=Science Pin |accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl]

==Early life, career and academia==

James Dooge was born in Birkenhead, England in 1922.  He was educated in Liverpool before moving to Dún Laoghaire and was educated by the Christian Brothers there. Dooge's father was an engineer and so were other relatives and at school Dooge convinced the authorities to bring in an Applied Mathematics teacher in to tutor him on the subject.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?Index=327 |title=Profile of Professor James Dooge FREng |work=Ingenia |date=September 2005 [/tpl]
He went on to University College Dublin (here he was awarded the Pierce Malone Scholarship in Theory of Structures and Strength of Materials) and qualified as an engineer. In 1942 he obtained a job with the Office of Public Works and in 1946 he began working with the Electricity Supply Board. Between 1954 and 1956 he was research associate at the Department of Civil engineering at University of Iowa and obtained a masters. Back working for the ESB in Ireland in 1956, he worked on a number of projects on the River Shannon. In 1958 Dooge became Professor of Civil engineering at University College Cork. In 1970 he became a Professor at University College Dublin. Between 1984 and 1987 Dooge worked at the Department of Engineering Hydrology at University College Galway. From 1988 he worked at University College Dublin at the Centre for Water Resources Research.
From 1987 to 1990 he was also President of the Royal Irish Academy.

==Contributions to Science and Hydrology==

===Hydrology===

With numerous publications on the subject, he is credited with turning hydrology an empirical technology into the science it is today.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unesco-ihe.org/About/News/UNESCO-IHE-Honorary-Fellow-Professor-James-C.-I.-Dooge-passed-away-at-the-age-of-88-on-20-August-2010 |title=UNESCO-IHE Honorary Fellow Professor James C. I. Dooge died at the age of 88 on 20 August 2010|work=UNESCO-IHE |accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] Alongside fellow Irishman Professor Eamon Nash, he was the founder of what today is called systems hydrology in the early sixties.
In the sixties, Professor Dooge was active in developing an international network of hydrology scientists and engineers that stretched from the USA to the then USSR. "These contacts were very beneficial, enabling research taking place from all over the world to link up in meaningful ways and, in a sense, helping establish an international hydrological community. Initially, we were an informal group of six. This grew to the point where we had a committee of 12".  Eventually this led to the establishment of the International Commission on Water Resource Systems within the International Association for Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). He served as its President for several years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/news/obituary_dooge_en.html |title=Obituary James Dooge|work=World Meteorological Organisation |accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl]

===Climate Change===

Professor Dooge was involved in some of the earliest work done to identify the causes of climate change. He was heavily involved in the discussions within WMO in 1978 that eventually led to the first World Climate Conference being held in Geneva in 1979. At the discussions a group of four were given two questions; Is there such a thing as a climate problem? And, if there is, is it serious enough to call a world conference of scientists to discuss it?
He served as chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the World Climate Impact Advisory Committee and, on behalf of the UN secretary general, on the International Decade of Natural Disasters Advisory Board.
He witnessed first-hand the phenomenal growth in climate change awareness: "At that first conference the attendance was almost exclusively made up of scientists and engineers whereas, when the second World Climate Conference took place in 1990, the scientists and engineers were joined by a strong contingent of politicians, a sign that interest in the issues had broadened considerably."
In 1990, WMO launched the idea of an International Conference on Water and Climate that would be held as a preparatory meeting for the Rio Summit on the environment and development.  Dooge arranged for the Conference to be held in Dublin in January 1992.  References are still being made at international gatherings to the "Dublin Conference" as the most influential international conference in the field of water.  As chairman the conference adopted the "Dublin Principles" that have been influential in shaping water management policy over the last 20 years.

==Political career==

As well as having a distinguished career as an academic, Dooge led a very active political life. His great grandfather was the first chairman of first Kingstown County Borough Council. He was a member of Dublin City Council from 1948, gaining notice from the Taoiseach of the time, John A. Costello.
From 1961 to 1977 Dooge was a Senator in Seanad Éireann, serving as its Cathaoirleach (chairperson) from 1973 to 1977.[ref]
[tpl]cite |url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&HouseNum=17&MemberID=1272&ConstID=203 |title=Mr. James C.I. Dooge |work=Oireachtas Members Database |accessdate=21 August 2010[/tpl][/ref] Dooge worked closely with his colleague Garret FitzGerald during the late 1970s in re-organising the Fine Gael party, establishing the so-called Just Society wing of the party. As Cathaoirleach, Dooge was one of the three vice-Presidents of Ireland (Presidential Commission) and along with the Chief Justice and Cathaoirleach of the Dáil would be called upon to serve the powers of the President should he or she resign or die. This happened twice during Dooge's reign. The first (only the second time in the history of the creation of the office in 1937) followed the death of Erskine Hamilton Childers. The second in 1976 followed the resignation of Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh in 1976. In 1977 he retired from politics, choosing to "devote more time to academic concerns and international cooperation in science and engineering".
In 1981 he made a return to politics and was appointed by the then Taoiseach FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the short-lived Fine Gael led government. The appointment was suggested by FitzGerald's wife who believed only Dooge could stop him frequently interfering in this area. When a new coalition Government was formed in 1982 (which would last until 1987) Dooge declined re-appointment to the post owing to the decline of his sight. Between 1981 and 1987 Dooge returned to Seanad Éireann. He rejected the offer of becoming an European Commissioner offered by FitzGerald.
Dooge was a delegate of Fine Gael at the New Ireland Forum in 1985.

==European Integration-Dooge Report==

He had a primary role in the intergovernmental building of a report into improving co-operation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1984 during Ireland's Presidency. His appointment was not without controversy with FitzGerald who proposed the appointment of Dooge insisting with him despite German pressure for their former President, Karl Carstens, to be given the role.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0828/1224277778154.html |title=One of Ireland's foremost scientists and a statesman of great distinction |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=13 September 2010 |date=8 August 2010[/tpl] This work (The Dooge Report) is credited as helping form the basis of the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht with much of the language used the same.Chief Justice Honoured at conferring at UCD, The Irish Times, 9 June 2001[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/Treaties/Treaty_SingleEA_Prep.htm |title=The Single European Act Preparation |work=The European Union Constitution |accessdate=20 August 2010[/tpl]

==Awards==

Dooge received awards for his work in the field of engineering and international affairs.
In 1986 he was awarded with the William Bowie Medal from by the American Geophysical Union for "outstanding contribution to fundamental geophysics and for unselfish cooperation in research". In 2000 he was made an International Fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering as an "outstanding" figure in the science of hydrology. He has also been awarded the Prince Philip Medal by the Duke of Edinburgh. In 2005, the Royal Irish Academy awarded him their gold medal, presented by President Mary McAleese. He was hailed as one of the founding fathers of modern hydrology. The World Meteorological Organization awarded him their highest prize in 2001, the IMO Prize.
