==Life==

Vasil Tkachuk was born in a very poor rural family to Ivan and Olena Tkachuk. He had two siblings, brother Oleksiy (born in 1904) and sister Maria (born in 1912). The size of poverty in which Tkachuk grew up can be picture by living conditions: one chamber hut (about 16 m²) occupied by two families, ten people altogether.
After death of Tkachuk’s father and grandmother in 1921 the responsibility to provide for the family went to his mother, Olena.В. Ткачук, "Зимова мелодія", Львів (Lviv), 1936
In 1922 Tkachuk started his education in a local primary school, which he finished in 1930.  During this period he wrote his first poems.
Tkachuk led a very active life, both socially and politically. He was interested in ethnography; was a member of local choreographic group "Prosvita" (ukr.: Просвіта) and a member of "Sel-Rob Ednist" (ukr.: Сель-Pоб Єдність) political group. At the age of 15 Tkachuk was arrested for drawing a caricature of Józef Piłsudski, later realised due to young age. Arrested again in 1922 for propaganda against Polish nobility (Polish: Szlachta).ЦДІА у Львові Фонд 205 оп. 1 справа 704
