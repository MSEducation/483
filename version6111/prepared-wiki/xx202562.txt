[[Minimum resolvable contrast]]

CATEGORIES: Image processing, Optics

Minimum resolvable contrast (MRC) is a subjective measure of a visible spectrum sensorâ€™s or camera's sensitivity and ability to resolve data.  A snapshot image of a series of three bar targets of selected spatial frequencies and various contrast coatings captured by the UUT (Unit Under Test) are used to determine the MRC of the UUT, i.e. the visible spectrum camera or sensor. A trained observer selects the smallest target resolvable at each contrast level. Typically, specialized computer software collects the inputed data of the observer and provides a graph of contrast v.s. spatial frequency at a given luminance level. A first order polynomial is fitted to the data and an MRC curve of spatial frequency versus contrast is generated.Electro Optical Industries, Inc. (2005) EO TestLab Methodology.
