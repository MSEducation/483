Tiny Computers Ltd. was a British computer company based in Redhill Business Park in Salfords, Redhill in Surrey, England.
The company used the advertising slogan 'Think big about your PC - think Tiny'. During the late 1990s they were a highly successful firm having units throughout the major retail stores of the UK as well as launching in the USA and the Far East, but their profits eventually began to fall and in 2002 they went into administration and were subsequently purchased by rival TIME.
The company released at the end of 2001 a Takami system and was the worlds first home entertainment pc which came in the shape of a DVD player and ran Windows Media Centre. The device received a lot of criticism due to its noisy fan and the boot up time to use the device.
