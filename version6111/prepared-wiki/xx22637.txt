[[Albuminuria]]

CATEGORIES: Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings for urine

Albuminuria is a pathological condition wherein albumin is present in the urine. It is a type of proteinuria.

==Symptoms==

Heavy whitish foam in urine.

==Measurement==

The amount of protein being lost in the urine can be quantified by collecting the urine for 24 hours, measuring a sample of the pooled urine, and extrapolating to the volume collected.
Also a urine dipstick test for proteinuria can give a rough estimate of albuminuria. This is because Albumin is by far the dominant plasma protein, and bromphenol blue the agent used in the dipstick is specific to albumin.

==Causes==

The kidneys normally do not filter large molecules into the urine, so albuminuria can be an indicator of damage to the kidneys or excessive salt intake. It can also occur in patients with long-standing diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes.
Causes of albuminuria can be discriminated between by the amount of protein excreted.

==Treatment==

There is some evidence that dietary interventions (to lower red meat intake) can be helpful in lowering albuminuria levels.de Mello, V. D. F. et al. "Withdrawal of red meat from the usual diet reduces albuminuria and improves serum fatty acid profile in type 2 diabetes patients with macroalbuminuria."
