==History==

The first batch of six were built by Clyde Engineering, Granville in 1966 with the same mechanicals as the S class but with a hood type of body. A second order of eight locomotives was built in 1970 fitted with a more powerful engine. A third batch was built in 1975/76 and differed by having an angled no.1 end and different cab and were the first locomotives built at Rosewater.[tpl]cite book|author=Railmac Publications|title=Australian Fleetbooks: V/Line locomotives|publisher=Kitchner Press|year=1992|isbn=0-949817-76-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850's - 1980's|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0-730100-05-7|pages=257[/tpl] Although mainly used on the broad gauge most at some stage operated on the North East standard gauge line to Albury.
