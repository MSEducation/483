[[Transport in Norway]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Norway

Transport in Norway is highly influenced by Norway's low population density, narrow shape and long coastline. Norway has old water transport traditions, but road, rail and air transport have increased in importance during the 20th century. Due to the low population density, public transport is somewhat less built out in rural areas of Norway, however public transport in, and around cities is well developed.
The main governing body is the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, which performs operations through numerous subsidiaries.Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communication, 2003: 3 Tasks related to public transport and some roads have been delegated to the counties and municipalities. Most infrastructure is publicly owned, while most operations are performed by private companies; public transport is subsidized.
In average each Norwegian transported themselves for 70 minutes each day. 8% of passenger transport was made by public transport; road transport is the dominant mode of transport.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/10/12/transport_en/ |title=Transport |author=Statistics Norway |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Statistics Norway [/tpl] The transport sector was responsible for 4.1% of the gross national product and 6.6% of employment in 2006. According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013,World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 Norway placed 83 out of 140 countries regarding quality of roads, 47 out of 122 regarding quality of railroad infrastructure, 25 out of 140 regarding quality of port infrastructure and 54 out of 140 regarding ground transport networks.

==Civil aviation==

Aviation has become an important passenger transport mode since the 1960s. Aircraft are a common used mode of transport on longer distances, and the routes between Oslo and Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger are all among the largest in Europe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?id=24013 |title="Bergensflyet" nummer sju i Europa |author=Boarding |date=2006-11-11 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] On long distances, such as Oslo-Bodø and longer, air travel is the by far leading travel method. In Western and Northern Norway, with difficult terrain, obstacling fjords and lack of rail transport, regional airline travel provides quick travel within the region or to the capital.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/sd/tema/luftfart/regionale-flyruter.html?id=440464 |title=Regionale flyruter |author=Ministry of Transport |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl]
Major airlines based in Norway are Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Widerøe.

===Airports===

Of the 98 airports in Norway, 51 are public,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avinor.no/tridionimages/2007%20Passasjerer_tcm181-51564.xls |title=2007 Passasjerer |author=Avinor |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] and 46 are operated by the state-owned Avinor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avinor.no/en/avinor/aboutavinor |title=About Avinor |author=Avinor |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Avinor[/tpl] Seven airports have more than one million passengers annually. 41,089,675 passengers passed through Norwegian airports in 2007, of which 13,397,458 were international.
The main gateway by air to Norway is Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, located about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi[/tpl] north of Oslo with departures to most European countries and some intercontinental destinations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osl.no/index.asp?startID=&topExpand=1000314&subExpand=1000318&menuid=1001352&menuid_1=1001348&pid_1=1001332&l=3&languagecode=9&strUrl=//templates/applications/internet/showobject.asp?infoobjectid=1006072 |title=Car |author=Oslo Lufthavn |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Oslo Airport, Gardermoen[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osl.no/index.asp?startID=&strUrl=//templates/applications/internet/showobject.asp?infoobjectid=1010847&showad=1&menuid=1001345&menuid_1=1001345&topExpand=1000314&subExpand=1000317&pid_1=1001332&l=2&languagecode=9 |title=International scheduled routes from Oslo |author=Oslo Lufthavn |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Oslo Airport, Gardermoen[/tpl] It is hub for the two major Norwegian airlines Scandinavian Airlines System[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sas.no/no/Misc/Service_Links_Container/Rutekart/ |title=Rutekart |author=Scandinavian Airlines System |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Scandinavian Airlines[/tpl] and Norwegian Air Shuttle,[tpl]cite web |url=http://ip.norwegian.no/ip/RouteMapAction.aspx?app_language=en-GB |title=Route Map |author=Norwegian Air Shuttle |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Norwegian Air Shuttle[/tpl] and for regional aircraft from Western Norway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wideroe.no/modules/module_123/proxy.asp?D=2&C=642&I=4274&language=NO |title=Våre destinasjoner |author=Widerøe |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Widerøe[/tpl]
Heliports are common at hospitals and oil platforms. The Norwegian Air Ambulance service operates twelve helicopters and nine airplanes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.luftambulanse.no/historie.aspx |author=Norwegian Air Ambulance |title=Om oss |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Norwegian Air Ambulance[/tpl]

===Regional aviation===

The regional airport service was introduced in the 1960s, with 30 airports being served by short take-off and landing aircraft. These are located mainly in Sogn og Fjordane and Northern Norway, in areas with long distances to large cities and with too little traffic to support commercial flights. The airports, which typically have a [tpl]convert|800|m|ft[/tpl] runway, are run by Avinor, while the airplanes are operated based on subsidized public service obligation contracts with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communication, 2003: 5 The by far largest contractor is Widerøe with their fleet of de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wideroe.no/modules/module_123/proxy.asp?D=2&C=416&I=3161 |title=Aircraft |author=Widerøe |accessdate=2008-07-15[/tpl] but also Danish Air Transport, Lufttransport and Kato Airline have won bids.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?id=18737 |title=Tildeling av einerett for drift av 16 ruteområde |author=Boarding |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] The flights operate from one or more regional airports to larger hubs; in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Tromsø and Kirkenes. One service, to Værøy Heliport, is served by helicopter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lufttransport.no/Lufttransport.nsf/unid/A78EFB93796E70CEC1256D91004270C5?opendocument |title=Ruteflyvning Bodø – Værøy v.v. |author=Lufttransport |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Lufttransport[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] 1,214,508 passengers passed through the regional airports in 2012.

==Rail transport==

The main railway network consists of [tpl]convert|4114|km|mi[/tpl] of standard gauge lines, of which [tpl]convert|242|km|mi[/tpl] is double track and [tpl]convert|64|km|mi[/tpl] high-speed rail (210 km/h) while 62% is electrified at [tpl]15 kV AC[/tpl]. The railways transported 56,827,000 passengers 2,956 million passenger kilometers and 24,783,000 tonnes of cargo 3,414 million tonne kilometers.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008: 4
The main long-haul network consists of lines from Oslo and westwards along the South Coast to Stavanger and over the mountains to Bergen; and north to Åndalsnes and via Trondheim to Bodø. Four lines connect to Sweden, allowing access to the European network.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2007: 7 The only high-speed line is Gardermobanen, connecting Oslo to The Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, but plans exist to build more high-speed lines in Eastern Norway,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/prosjekter/pagaende/vestfoldbanen/article.jhtml?articleID=1692646 |title=Modernisering av Vestfoldbanen |author=Norwegian National Rail Administration |date=2008-01-07 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and possibly to other parts of Norway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/sd/tema/Jernbane_og_jernbanetransport/Utredning-av-hoyfartsbaner.html?id=449057 |title=Utredning av høyfartsbaner |author=Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] The entire network is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/english/about/ |title=About |author=Norwegian National Rail Administration |accessdate=2008-07-15[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] while all domestic passenger trains except the Airport Express Train are operated by Norges Statsbaner (NSB).Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008: 13 Several companies operate freight trains.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008: 16

===Rail transit===

Tramways operate in Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. The only rapid transit system is the Oslo T-bane, while the only funicular is in Bergen. The rail transits are operated by the counties, and the ticket system is integrated into the bus transport. In Oslo the two systems make the backbone of the Ruter public transport system, giving Oslo by far the highest public transport share of 20%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sporveien.no/Pressesenter/169/1383/ |title=Sterk kollektivvekst og kollektivandel |author=Oslo Sporveier |date=2006-08-30 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Oslo Sporveier[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Local trains on the railway is operated by NSB, but monthly passes are integrated into the local transit ticket system.
In 2007, 101 million passengers were transported 490 million passenger kilometers by rail transit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/10/12/kolltrans/tab-2008-01-03-04.html |title=Bane, ekslusive NSB |author=Statistics Norway |date=2008-01-03 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2007: 12–13

==Road transport==

Norway has a road network of [tpl]convert|92946|km|mi[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|72033|km|mi[/tpl] are paved and [tpl]convert|664|km|mi[/tpl] are motorway.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html |title=Norway |author=Central Intelligence Agency |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] There are four tiers of road routes; national, county, municipal and private, with national and primary county roads numbered en route. The most important national routes are part of the European route scheme, and the two most prominent are the E6 going north-south through the entire country, while E39 follows the West Coast. National and county roads are managed by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, 2003: 15
Motorways exist around the largest cities; many of the larger cities have introduced toll schemes to help finance roads.[tpl]cite web |url=http://design.open.ac.uk/potter/documents/NorwayTP.pdf |format=PDF|title=Norway's urban toll rings: evolving towards congestion charging? |author=Ieromanachou, Potter and Warren |accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] In 2008, 130 ferry routes remained in service, operated by private companies on contract with the Public Roads Administration.Norwegian Public Roads Administration, 2008: 7 Since the 1970s the heaviest rural investments have been mainland connections to replace the many car ferries that are needed to cross fjords and connect to islands. There are not enough funding through tax money, so these tunnels and bridges are normally financed mainly through toll fees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.norvegfinans.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects.exe/norveg.woa/wa/selectDASub1page?sub1pageID=70&langID=1 |title=Bompengeanlegg |author=Norvegfinans |accessdate=2008-07-16 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Some mountain passes have severe snowstorm problems in the winter, so often they have to be closed, or cars have to drive after a snowplow in a column.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vegvesen.no/cs/Satellite?cid=1157615706672&pagename=vegvesen/SVVartikkel/SVVartikkelMedRelatert&c=SVVartikkel |title=Kolonnekjøring |author=Norwegian Public Road Administration |accessdate=2008-07-16 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502190440/http://www.vegvesen.no/cs/Satellite?cid=1157615706672&pagename=vegvesen/SVVartikkel/SVVartikkelMedRelatert&c=SVVartikkel  |archivedate = 2008-05-02[/tpl] The most exposed mountain passes are closed the entire winter.
In 2007 there were 2.6 million automobiles in Norway, or 444 per 1000 residents, an increase of 27% the last ten years—average age was 10.2 years. Road accidents killed 242 people and road transport caused 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Trucks transported 264 million tonnes 15 billion tonne kilometers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/lbunasj/tab-2008-07-02-01.html |title=Lastebilundersøkelsen |author=Statistics Norway |accessdate=2008-07-16 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Bus transport===

Each county is responsible for the public bus and boat transport in their area,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/sd/tema/kollektivtransport/Lokal-kollektivtransport.html?id=426187 |title=Lokal kollektivtransport |author=Norwegian Ministry of Transport |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] (railways, regional airlines and the Coastal Express boat, are financed by the state).

Bus, bus and water bus services are normally operated by private companies on contract with the county or their public transport authority (such as Ruter or Vestviken Kollektivtrafikk). Tickets and tickets prices are organised by these authorities. Some of them have special brand names and connected painting of the buses, especially in bigger cities. Other counties, especially smaller, don't use brand names and let the operators decide bus paint.
Long-haul coach services are operated by various companies, most of whom cooperate through NOR-WAY Bussekspress.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=d0e5ccde8f8843e7778e7f8c97e78f&func=publish.show&table=PUBLISH&func_id=1116&asubmenu=1116 |title=Selskapene |author=NOR-WAY Bussekspress |accessdate=2008-07-15 |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Norway Bussekspress[/tpl]

===Ferries===

Car ferries are vital links across fjords and to islands, where are no fixed connection. There are more than one hundred car ferry connections inside Norway. Fast passenger ferries operate many places where fjords and islands make it quicker to follow the waterways than the roads; some small islands are served by water buses. Public transport by ship transported eight million passengers 273 million passenger kilometers in 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/kolltrans/tab-2008-01-03-03.html |title=Båt |author=Statistics Norway |date=2008-01-03 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Coastal Express (known as Hurtigruten) operates daily cruiseferries from Bergen to Kirkenes, calling at 35 ports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hurtigruten.com/en/default.aspx?side_id=421 |title=Hurtigruten - The World's Most Beautiful Voyage |author=Hurtigruten Group |accessdate=2008-07-16 |authorlink=Hurtigruten Group[/tpl] International car carrying cruiseferries operate from Southern Norway to Denmark, Germany and Sweden.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.colorline.no/ |title=Color Line |author=Color Line (ferry operator) |accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl]

===Pipelines===

The petroleum and natural gas production on the Norwegian continental shelf uses pipelines to transport produce to processing plants on mainland Norway and other European countries; total length is [tpl]convert|9481|km|mi[/tpl]. The government-owned Gassco operates all natural gas pipelines; in 2006, 88 billion cubic meters were transported, or 15% of European consumption[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gassco.no/sw3046.asp |title=About Gassco |author=Gassco |accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080226071113/http://www.gassco.no/sw3046.asp  |archivedate = 2008-02-26 |authorlink= Gassco[/tpl]
