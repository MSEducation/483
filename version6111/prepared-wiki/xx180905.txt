====Head coach====

After firing Cam Cameron following a franchise-worst 1–15 season, the Miami Dolphins and new executive vice president of football operations Parcells hired Sparano to a four-year contract worth $2,500,000 per year on January 16, 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3199065|title=Dolphins hire Sparano as head coach, replacing Cameron|publisher=www.espn.com|date=2008-01-16|accessdate=2009-02-16[/tpl]
In his first season, Sparano led the Dolphins to an 11–5 record and the AFC East division title, securing the franchise's first playoff berth in seven seasons before losing to the Baltimore Ravens in a wild-card game. The 10-win turnaround tied an NFL record[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2008/12/18/miami-on-pace-to-tie-best-turnaround-in-nfl-history/|publisher=www.nfl.com|title=Miami on pace to tie best turnaround in NFL history|accessdate=2009-02-16[/tpl] and Sparano finished one vote behind Atlanta Falcons first-year head coach Mike Smith in balloting for the AP Coach of the Year award.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80ddedeb/article/smith-edges-sparano-for-ap-coach-of-year|title=Smith edges Sparano for AP Coach of Year|publisher=www.nfl.com|date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2011-01-11[/tpl]
In 2009 and 2010 each, Sparano led the Dolphins to a 7-9 record and third place in the AFC East. Sparano's Dolphins went 1-7 at home in 2010.  The Dolphins were the subject of much gossip at the end of the 2010 season when team owner Stephen Ross flew across the country with General Manager Jeff Ireland to interview then Stanford University coach Jim Harbaugh.  At the time of the interview with Harbaugh, Sparano was still the team's head coach.  It was also reported by numerous media sources that Ross also spoke with former NFL coaches Jon Gruden and Bill Cowher about the not yet open position. According to reports Bill Cowher told Ross he would not talk to him while he had a head coach in place.
On January 8, 2011, the Dolphins gave Sparano a two-year extension worth $4,500,000 dollars, with Ross saying he was the perfect man for the job. However, on December 12, 2011, hours after a week 14 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Sparano was fired; secondary coach Todd Bowles finished out the season.  The Dolphins bought out his contract for $9 million.
