[[List of the most subscribed channels on YouTube]]

CATEGORIES: YouTube channels, 21st century-related lists

The most subscribed channel on YouTube is a position that only one channel on the website can hold at a time. Over time, ten channels have been documented reaching the position. As of April 19, 2014, the most subscribed channel is PewDiePie, with 26 million subscribers. YouTube is currently the 2nd most subscribed channel, with 22 million subscribers.
nigahiga is documented to have the longest consecutive run as the most subscribed channel, with 677 days (701 in total). Smosh holds the record for the highest accumulative amount of days as #1, with 758. Smosh has reached the #1 position on three separate occasions, which is also a record. The total number of days since May 17, 2006 (When the YouTube Subscriber Charts were first released) is [tpl]age in days|2006|5|17[/tpl]. Smosh has been number 1 for approximately [tpl]#expr: 100 * 758 / [tpl]age in days|2006|5|17[/tpl] round 1[/tpl]% with 758 days.
The ability to "subscribe" to a user's videos was added to YouTube by late October 2005[tpl]cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2005/10/its-been-awhile-since-our-last-update.html|title=It's been awhile since our last update|publisher=Blogspot|work=Official YouTube Blog|date=October 25, 2005|accessdate=November 5, 2013[/tpl] so the numbers of subscribers needed to be most subscribed were relatively small at first.  The "most subscribed" list on YouTube began being listed by a chart on the site by May 2006, at which time Smosh was #1 with fewer than 3,000 subscribers. Smosh at that time was more than 1,500 subscribers more than second placed FilthyWhore at 1469.
Note: Though the earliest archived all time list is from May 17 2006, the earliest archived past month list was from May 3, two weeks earlier.
