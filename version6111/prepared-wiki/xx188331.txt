The Apophthegmata Patrum (lit. Sayings of the Fathers)From the Greek: apo, from; phtheggomai, to cry out; pater, father. ([tpl]lang-la|Apophthegmata Patrum Aegyptiorum[/tpl] [tpl]lang-el|ἀποφθέγματα τῶν ἁγίων γερόντων, ἀποφθέγματα τῶν πατέρων, τὸ γεροντικόν[/tpl])Orthodox Encyclopedia, in Russian, Vol. 3, pp. 140-142. is the name given to various collections popularly known as of Sayings of the Desert Fathers, consisting of stories and sayings attributed to the Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers from approximately the 5th century AD.[tpl]cite book|last=Gould|first=Graham|title=Papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies held in Oxford 1999|series=Studia Patristica|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0922-9[/tpl]W.

The collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an oral tradition in the Coptic language, they were only later written down as Greek text. The stories were extremely popular among early Christian monks, and appeared in various forms and collections.[tpl]cite book |author=Burton-Christie, Douglas |title=The Word in the desert: scripture and the quest for holiness in early Christian monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=1993|pages=76–84 |isbn=0-19-508333-4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SIa0mNas_5MC[/tpl]
The original sayings were passed down from monk to monk, though in their current version most simply describe the stories in the form of "Abba X said...." The early Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers also received many visitors seeking counseling, typically by asking "Give me a word, abba" or "Speak a word, amma, how can I be saved?" Some of the sayings are responses to those seeking guidance.[tpl]cite book |author=Chryssavgis, John; Ware, Kallistos; Ward, Benedicta |title=In the Heart of the Desert: Revised Edition: The Spirituality of the Desert Fathers and Mothers (Treasures of the World's Religions) |publisher=World Wisdom |page=4|location=Bloomington, Ind. |year=2008|isbn=1-933316-56-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=goeFHFiL2h0C[/tpl]
Many notable Desert Fathers are mentioned in the collections, including Anthony the Great, Abba Arsenius, Abba Poemen, Abba Macarius of Egypt, and Abba Moses the Black."Chryssavgis, pp. 19-29. The sayings also include those of three different ammas, or Desert Mothers, most notably Syncletica of Alexandria. Sayings of the Desert Fathers influenced many notable theologians, including Saint Jerome and Saint Augustine.[tpl]cite book |author=Flood, Gavin D. |title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-521-60401-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r3s8zRmr-e8C&pg=PA148[/tpl]

==History of the text==

The Desert Fathers spoke Coptic, a language related to ancient Egyptian. The sayings were originally passed on orally in that language. The earliest written record of the sayings appears to be from the end of the 4th century CE. Two versions from the 5th century, the Collectio Monastica, written in Ethiopic, and the Asceticon of Abba Isaiah, written in Greek, show how the oral tradition became the written collections.
Pelagius and John the Deacon made the first translations of the Sayings into Latin. Martin of Braga also translated some of the sayings into Latin, followed by a more extensive translation by Paschasius of Dumium in approximately 555 CE.[tpl]cite book |author=Barlow, Claude |title=Fathers of the Church: Iberian Fathers: Martin of Braga/Paschasius of Dumium/Leander of Seville |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1969 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-8132-0062-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HaChb7wjNDkC&pg=PA113[/tpl] 
That work may contain only one-fifth of the original Greek text.Barlow, p. 5-6. In the 17th century, the Dutch Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde compiled and translated all the available sources on the Desert Fathers and published them in Latin as the Vitae patrum.
Helen Waddell translated a selection of elements from the Vitae Patrum into English in the early 20th century.Helen Waddell, The desert fathers (translations from the Vitae Patrum), London: Constable & co., 1936. The first complete translation of the "apothegmata" into English is that of Benedicta Ward (1975).Benedicta Ward, The sayings of the Desert Fathers : the alphabetical collection, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1975 (revised edition, 1985).
