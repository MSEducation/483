==Personality and appearance==

The New York Times, upon Martinelli's arrival in America as the new apostolic delegate in 1896, published a thorough assessment of the bishop's personal appearance and personality. The newspaper described him thus: 
 Martinelli speaks excellent English, with only a slight accent.[tpl]#tag:ref|The same article mentions that Martinelli had learned to speak English while a teacher of the Irish Augustinians, in the house of Santa Maria in Posterula in Rome.[tpl]sfn|New York Times|1896|p=4[/tpl]|group=note[/tpl] His voice is soft and musical, and he is very graceful, with an attractive manner. He is a small man, not over 5 feet 5 inches in height, of good build, and he has a typical Italian face. He is very dark, his hair is black and his eyes brilliantly black. The eyes are of the kind that seem to look clear through one. They are the most pronounced feature of their possessor. He has a very square jaw, and when he smiles there is a slight curl of the under lip [tpl]sic[/tpl]. Altogether the face is one that strikes an observer as that of a more than ordinarily intelligent man.[tpl]sfn|New York Times|1896|p=4[/tpl]
