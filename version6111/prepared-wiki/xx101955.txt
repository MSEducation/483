==History==

Copenhagen Zoo was founded by the ornithologist Niels Kjærbølling in 1859. He was given the summer garden of "Prinsess Vilhelmines Have" (The garden of Princess Vilhelmine) by the chief directorate of Copenhagen. The animals that the visitors could contemplate at the opening were eagles, chickens, ducks, owls, rabbits, a fox, a seal in a bathtub and a turtle in a bucket. In the early years the zoo focused on showing as many different types of animals as possible, but as animal welfare later became an issue, the number of different species has dropped in favour of more space to each animal. In 1901 the zoo displayed 25 Indians- men, women and children- in an exhibition where the "brown exotic" people went about their daily lives in palm tree leaf huts constructed in the middle of the zoo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rac.sagepub.com/content/45/2/21.extract |title=The `Exotic' as Mass Entertainment: Denmark 1878—1909 |publisher=Rac.sagepub.com |date=1 October 2003 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
One of the most notable animals kept there was a male slow worm that lived there from 1892 to 1946 (for 54 years, which is a record among lizards).[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o105-slowworm.php | title = Slow Worm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/animal_magnetism/notasnake.html | title = Slow Worm[/tpl]
Starting in the early 1980s, Copenhagen Zoo has been undergoing a renovations aimed at replacing cages with enclosures which recreate animals' natural environments, giving a better lifestyle to the animals, and a more realistic experience to visitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoo.dk/BesogZoo/OmZoo/Bygninger.aspx|title=Bygninger|publisher=Københavns Zoo|accessdate=23 January 2009[/tpl] The Elephant House and [tpl]Convert|1.5|ha|sing=on[/tpl] Savanna are results of these efforts. The Savanna includes a Hippopotamus House where the hippos can be watched underwater.
The zoo has preserved many of its historical buildings. The oldest building still in use, a stable for yaks, was erected in 1872, and now houses the bactrian camels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoo.dk/BesogZoo/OmZoo/Bygninger.aspx|title=Bygninger|publisher=Københavns Zoo|accessdate=11 April 2009[/tpl] A Herbivore House built in 1875 still houses herbivores, namely tapirs. An owl tower from 1885 is today left as a memorial commemorating how zoo animals were once kept.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jun/10/architecture.animalwelfare|title=Bygninger|publisher=Københavns Zoo|accessdate=11 April 2009 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=10 June 2008[/tpl]

==Copenhagen Zoo Tower==

A notable and highly visible feature of the zoo is the wooden observation tower. [tpl]Convert|43.5|m|ft|1[/tpl] high, it offers views of the surrounding parklands and city. The tower was built in 1905 and is one of the tallest observation towers built of wood in the world.[tpl]structurae|id=s0027286|title=Zoo Tower[/tpl] Its base is similar to that of Eiffel Tower.

==Exhibits==

Animals which are exhibited at the zoo but not in any of the main areas are for example bactrian camel, American flamingo, scarlet ibis, roseate spoonbill, Dalmatian pelican, turkey vulture, Humboldt penguin, California sea lion, black-capped squirrel monkey, chimpanzee and lion.

===The Nordics and the Arctic Ring===

In the part of the zoo called "The Nordics" ([tpl]lang-da|Norden[/tpl]) visitors can see species such as harbour seal, reindeer, muskox, Eurasian eagle-owl, brown bear and grey wolf. The "Artic Ring" ([tpl]lang-da|Den Arktiske Ring[/tpl]), which opened in 2013, has an exhibit for polar bears (including a tunnel allowing underwater views) and an aviary for North Atlantic seabirds (alcids).A.P.Moller Fonden (February 2013).

===Asia===

In the "Asia" ([tpl]lang-da|Asien[/tpl]) section visitors can see red panda, Asian tapir, Oriental small-clawed otter, leopard, tiger, Asian elephant, and other animals.
The new Elephant House, which opened in June 2008, is designed by Norman Foster in cooperation with the Danish landscape architect Stig L. Andersson. It houses Asian elephants and contains two glass-domed enclosures. One is for six cows and calves and measures [tpl]Convert|45|by|23|m[/tpl]. The other is [tpl]Convert|30|by|15|m[/tpl] and is for two bulls, kept in separate pens during the mating season for fear of fights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoo.dk/BesogZoo/OmZoo/Bygninger.aspx|title=Wait till you see our swimming pool!|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2009[/tpl] The building also contain an exhibit space and a small lecture hall. The enclosures open out through mighty rusted steel doors into am almost 1 hectare big landscaped paddock with a pool [tpl]Convert|3|m[/tpl] deep and [tpl]Convert|60|m[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jun/10/architecture.animalwelfare|title=Wait till you see our swimming pool!|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2009 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=10 June 2008[/tpl]
The paddock's border with Frederiksberg Park, once a [tpl]Convert|3|m|sing=on[/tpl] high wall, has been opened up so that people in the park can now watch the elephants. This has been done because the zoo, with its central location is very much a city zoo, wants to integrate with the urban landscape. At the same time it affords the elephants distant views of open parkland and ancient trees.

== Giraffe culling controversy == 
A healthy young male giraffe, Marius, was killed on 9 February 2014 on the recommendation of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/healthy-giraffe-put-down-at-copenhagen-zoo-to-prevent-inbreeding-1.1677809 |title=Healthy giraffe killed at Copenhagen Zoo to prevent inbreeding |publisher=CTV news.ca |date=February 9, 2014 |accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl] His meat was fed to the zoo lions, while other parts were transferred to a scientific institution. Bengt Holst defended the culling, saying that the giraffes at the zoo bred very well, and where this was the case, giraffes had to be killed to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year.  The death occurred despite offers from other animal institutions (EAZA member Yorkshire Wildlife Park (YWP) in the United Kingdom and Hoenderdael Park in The Netherlands) to take the giraffe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26098935 |title=BBC News - 'Surplus' giraffe put down at Copenhagen Zoo |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl]
YWP released a statement that it had the capacity to accept a further giraffe into its bachelor herd in its state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012, and that contact had been made with Copenhagen Zoo but no reply had been received. YWP has previously received a male giraffe of the same age as Marius from Copenhagen Zoo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/yorkshirewildlifepark/posts/635099609861147 |title=Yorkshire Wildlife Park is saddened to... - Yorkshire Wildlife Park |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl] The Scientific Director at Copenhagen Zoo, Bengt Holst, stated that the capacity at YWP would be better utilised by a giraffe whose genes were less represented amongst EAZA zoos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26118748 |title=Why did Copenhagen Zoo kill its giraffe? |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl]
The action has been criticized by Stine Jensen from Denmark's Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, who repudiated the action as unethical. She said, "This situation should not have occurred at all. It just shows that the zoo is in fact not the ethical institution that it wants to portray itself as being, because here you have a waste product - that being Marius. Here we have a zoo which thinks that putting this giraffe down instead of thinking of alternatives is the best option".
Images of the carcass being cut up in front of children and then fed to the zoo's lion population have been circulated by the Associated Press. The zoo spokesperson, Tobias Stenbaek Bro, has been quoted as saying that visitors, including children, were invited to watch as the giraffe was skinned and parts fed to the lions. "I'm actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo," Stenbaek Bro said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press.[tpl]cite web|author=Steed R. and Rising, M. |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/danish-zoo-kills-young-giraffe-stop-inbreeding |title=Danish zoo kills giraffe to prevent inbreeding |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/world/europe/denmark-zoo-giraffe/ |title=Danish zoo kills healthy giraffe, feeds body to lions |publisher=CNN.com |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
On 25 March 2014, despite the backlash from the giraffe cull, the Zoo euthanized four lions (two adults and two ten-month old cubs). The Zoo stated that they are introducing a male lion and did not want to disrupt the pride's natural structure and behaviour. The lions were not culled or dissected in public. http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/giraffe-uproar-copenhagen-zoo-kills-lions-23052636http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/03/25/lions-copenhagen-zoo-marius-giraffe/6873763/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/10722496/Danish-zoo-that-killed-giraffe-puts-down-four-lions.html
