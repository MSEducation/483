CATEGORIES: Houston Astros, Major League Baseball first-round draft picks

The Houston Astros, originally called the "Colt .45s", are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Houston, Texas. They play in the American League West division. Since the institution of Major League Baseball's Rule 4 Draft, the Astros have selected 56 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player Draft", the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, and the team that had the worst record receives the first pick.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/draftday/rules.jsp|title=First-Year Player Draft Rules|work=MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081126&content_id=3694740&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil&partnerId=rss_mil|title=Brewers offer three arbitration|last=McCalvy|first=Adam|work=Brewers.MLB.com|publisher=Milwaukee Brewers|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1961 expansion draft in which the Astros initially filled their roster.
Of the 56 players picked in the first round by Houston, 24 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 21 of these were right-handed, while 3 were left-handed. Nine catchers were selected, while nine outfielders, nine shortstops, two first basemen, and two third basemen were taken as well. The team also selected one player at second base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/?query_type=franch_round&team_ID=HOU&draft_round=1&draft_type=junreg|title=Baseball Draft: Houston Astros 1st Round Picks in the June Draft|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] Thirteen of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, while Texas and Tennessee follow with five and three players, respectively. They have also drafted two players from outside the United States: Carlos Correa (2012) from Puerto Rico and Ram√≥n Castro (1994) from Puerto Rico.
No Astros first-round pick has won a Rookie of the Year award, Most Valuable Player award, or Cy Young Award with the team.
