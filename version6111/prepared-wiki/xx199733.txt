==Schoolmaster==

Howson's first position after leaving Oxford was as an assistant master at Newton College, in south Devon, from 1883 to 1886. He then moved to Uppingham School, where he remained for fourteen years, from 1886 until 1900, when he was appointed Headmaster of Gresham's School, Holt, continuing in post until his death in 1919.Lidell, Charles Lawrence Scruton, and A.B. Douglas, The History and Register of Gresham's School, 1555-1954 (Ipswich, 1955)
When Howson arrived at Gresham's, a rather dusty ancient grammar school founded by Sir John Gresham, he found it in numbers much as it had been when established in 1555. In 1900, the school still occupied its original Holt town centre site and contained only forty Holt Scholars, plus seven boarders.Benson, S. G. G., and Martin Crossley Evans, I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School (James & James, London, 2002) ISBN 0-907383-92-0
During his headmastership, Howson achieved a completely new set of school buildings on a new edge-of-town site, transforming the school and quadrupling its population. The first such new buildings, designed by the architect Sir John Simpson, were opened by Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood on 30 September 1903. These consisted of School House (renamed Howson's in 1919, after Howson's death) and the main classrooms building, including Big School. More boarding houses were acquired or built between 1905 and 1911. A new School Chapel was completed in 1916, during the Great War, during which one hundred Old Greshamians were killed.When Heroes Die by Sue Smart (Breedon Books, 2001) ISBN 1-85983-256-3
The poet W. H. Auden wrote favourably of the new school's private studies for boys, its warm classrooms, magnificent library and excellent laboratories.Auden: The lost poems in The Independent dated 5 September 2007 online at independent.co.uk (accessed 22 May 2008)

In Who's Who, Howson stated his recreations as riding, fives, and trout-fishing.
He died suddenly on 7 January 1919. His Executors were Charles James Howson and James Ronald Eccles.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=31391 |date=6 June 1919 |startpage=7355 [/tpl] The Times said of him "Under him the school made rapid progress, especially in science teaching",Mr G. W. S. Howson in The Times, Thursday, 9 January 1919 (Issue 41993), p. 9, col. C and "He has been called away, as he would have wished, while in the faithful discharge of his duty. His death has left a gap which it will be well-nigh impossible to fill."A Notable Headmaster. Tribute To The Late Mr. Howson in The Times, Friday, 10 Jan 1919 (Issue 41994) pg. 11, col B
J. H. Simpson later wrote of Howson's achievements at Gresham's: [tpl]quote|He went there in 1900, when it was a little-known grammar school in a remote corner of Norfolk, and in the remaining nineteen years of his life he made it known throughout England for its bold and original methods.J.

A new school library was built in memory of Howson and opened by Field Marshal Lord Milne in June 1931.The Times, Friday, 26 June 1931; pg. 8; Issue 45859; col F On 31 January 1932, a bronze bust of Howson by Kathleen Scott was unveiled in the library by Howson's successor J.
