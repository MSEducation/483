Comic book historians estimate that he wrote over 4,000 comics stories.

==Early life and career==

Gardner F. Fox was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised Roman Catholic. Fox recalled being inspired at an early age by the great fantasy fiction writers. On or about his eleventh birthday, he "had gotten The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, books which "opened up a complete new world for me." In a time before comics existed, he "read all of Burroughs, Harold Lamb, Talbot Mundy," maintaining copies "at home in my library" some 50 years later.
Fox received a law degree from St. John's College and was admitted to the New York bar in 1935. He practiced for about two years, but as the Great Depression dragged on he began writing for DC Comics editor Vin Sullivan. Debuting as a writer in the pages of Detective Comics, Fox "intermittently contributed tales to nearly every book in the DC lineup during the Golden Age." He was also a frequent contributor of prose stories to the pulp science fiction magazines of the 1930s and 1940s.
A polymath, Fox sprinkled his strips with numerous real-world historical, scientific, and mythological references, once saying, "Knowledge is kind of a hobby with me." For instance, in the span of a year's worth of Atom stories, Fox tackled the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the space race, 18th-century England, miniature card painting, Norse mythology, and numismatics. He revealed in letters to fan Jerry Bails that he kept large troves of reference material, mentioning in 1971, "I maintain two file cabinets chock full of stuff. And the attic is crammed with books and magazines....Everything about science, nature, or unusual facts, I can go to my files or the at least 2,000 books that I have."

==Books==

During his career writing for DC Comics, Fox also wrote novels and short stories under a variety of male and female pseudonyms for a number of publishers, including Ace, Gold Medal, Tower, Belmont, Dodd Mead, Hillman, Pocket Library, Pyramid Books and Signet Books.
During the mid-to-late 1940s, and into the 1950s, Fox wrote a number of short stories and text pieces for Weird Tales and Planet Stories, and was also published in Amazing Stories and Marvel Science Stories. He wrote for a diverse range of pulp magazines, including Baseball Stories, Big Book Football Western, Fighting Western, Football Stories, Lariat Stories, Ace Sports, SuperScience, Northwest Romances, Thrilling Western, and Ranch Romances for a number of publishing companies.
Between 1944 and 1982, he wrote at least one novel a year (except 1950, 1951, and 1971), typically producing three per year – and published twelve in 1974 alone.

==Comics==

===Golden Age===

Fox's earliest stories for DC Comics featured Speed Saunders with art by Creig Flessel and later Fred Guardineer beginning at least with Detective Comics #4 (June 1937).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=story&id=48|title= Detective Comics #4 'The Mystery of San Jose Island'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]gcdb|type=credit|search=Gardner+Fox|title=Gardner Fox[/tpl] Speed Saunders was initially credited to "E.C.

During World War II, Fox took over a variety of characters and books of several of his colleagues who had been drafted. He worked for numerous companies including Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics; Vin Sullivan's Magazine Enterprises, where he created Skyman; and at EC, where he served a brief stint as head writer. With the waning popularity of superheroes, Fox contributed western, science fiction, humor, romance, and funny animal stories.

====Batman====

In July 1939, just two issues after the character's debut by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Fox wrote the first of his several tales of the Batman,[tpl]cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1930s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2010|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 24|quote = Writer Gardner Fox took over from Finger for a few subsequent installments of the feature and introduced such gadgets as the Batarang and the Batgyro.[/tpl] introducing an early villain in "The Batman Meets Doctor Death".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=story&id=3601|title= Detective Comics #29 'The Batman Meets Doctor Death'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl] Alongside Kane and Finger, Fox contributed to the evolution of the character, including the character's first use of his utility belt, which "contained choking gas capsules," as well as writing the first usages of both the Batarang and the Batgyro, an autogyro precursor to the Batcopter, two issues later.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=story&id=3771|title= Detective Comics #31 'Batman Vs. the Vampire'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl]
Fox returned to the Batman in 1964. (See below)

====Sandman====

In 1939, Fox and artist Bert Christman co-created the character of the Sandman, a gasmask-wearing costumed crime-fighter whose first appearance in Adventure Comics #40 (July 1939)Wallace "1930s" in Dolan, p. 25: "Writer Gardner Fox and artist Bert Christman established the gas-masked and trench-coated Sandman in Adventure Comics #40 in July 1940." was pre-empted by an appearance in New York World's Fair Comics.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=story&id=3282|title= New York World's Fair Comics #1 "Sandman at the World's Fair'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/sandman1.htm|title= The Sandman|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2011|publisher= Don Markstein's Toonopedia|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/63iQRKR33|archivedate= December 5, 2011|deadurl= no|accessdate= |quote= Adventure Comics #40 wasn't quite the character's first appearance, though. The 1939 issue of New York World's Fair Comics, an extra-big anthology DC put out to capitalize on the eponymous event, contained a Sandman story, and probably hit the stands a week or two before his first Adventure story (though the one in Adventure is believed to have been written and drawn earlier).[/tpl]

====The Flash====

Fox is credited with writing the first three of six stories in the inaugural issue of Flash Comics (Jan. 1940), including the debut of the titular character, the Golden Age Flash.Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 30: "DC shattered the sound barrier with the debut of the Flash, a blindingly fast mystery man written by Gardner Fox and drawn by Harry Lampert." With a hero described as a "modern-day Mercury", the title feature saw college student Jay Garrick imbued with superhuman speed after inhaling hard water vapors.[tpl]Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Gardner Fox DC's Universe Expands | title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 16[/tpl] The character went on to appear in a host of forties comics, including All Star, Comic Cavalcade, The Big All-American Comic Book, and his own titles, Flash Comics and All-Flash.

====Hawkman====

Describing the origins of Hawkman, Fox recalled, "I was faced with the problem of filling a new book that publisher Max Gaines was starting... As I sat by the window I noticed a bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig a crook!'"
Debuting as the third story in Flash Comics #1 (Jan. 1940) — "Fox's imagination transformed that bird into the soaring, mysterious Hawkman." With art by Dennis Neville,Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 30: "In the same issue #1 Gardner Fox wrote the first story featuring Hawkman...in a story drawn by Dennis Neville." the origin of the 'Winged Wonder' saw archaeologist and collector Carter Hall reliving his past life as Prince Khufu in ancient Egypt, creating a costume (powered by Nth metal), confronting the reincarnation of Hath-Set, his former nemesis, and meeting his reincarnated love, Shiera Saunders.

====The Justice Society of America====

Regularly writing more than six stories in five titles per month, every month throughout the early 1940s, Fox continued to create new features.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=creator&type=story&id=23|title= Gardner F. Fox|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl]
At the time, DC Comics consisted of two discrete sub-companies, Max Gaines' All-American Publications and Harry Donenfeld & Jack Liebowitz's National Periodical Publications. Though he continued to script for National/Detective Comics, Inc., Fox became the head writer for All-American. While Fox's Dr. Fate (and other titles) was published by National; Sandman, Hawkman and the Flash were released by All-American. In Winter 1940, the third issue of All-American's All Star Comics debuted the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team in comics. Fox had worked on the Hawkman, Flash and Sandman features in All-Star for its first two issues (Summer and Autumn 1940), but from issue #3 (Winter), he assumed full writing duties for the issue, with all features by different artists working within the framing device wherein the characters were described as part of a "Justice Society".
In the pages of All-Star Comics #3, under the direction of editor Sheldon Mayer and with artists including E. E. Hibbard, Fox created the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America.Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 33: "DC took the 'greatest hits' premise of the comic to its logical conclusion in All Star Comics #3 by teaming the Flash, the Atom, Doctor Fate, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Hourman, Sandman, and the Spectre under the banner of the Justice Society of America for an ongoing series."[tpl]cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Golden Age 1938–1956|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America|year=2010|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 56  |quote= Mayer and Fox cooked up one of the biggest ideas in superhero history: What if the varied stars of All-Star Comics actually met and worked together? [/tpl] Each character – Dr. Fate, the Sandman, the Flash, and Hawkman were joined by Doctor Mid-Nite, Hour-Man, the Spectre, the Atom and Green Lantern – was introduced individually (by Johnny Thunder), and related a solo adventure, before being charged at the title's end with remaining a loose team by the Director of the FBI. In April 1941, Fox created the character of Starman with artist Jack Burnley in the pages of Adventure Comics #61 (April 1941),Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 36: "Gardner Fox and artist Jack Burnley presented the new costumed hero Starman in this issue." and the character would later join the JSA. Fox wrote the Justice Society's adventures from All Star Comics #3 until leaving the feature as of issue #34 (April–May 1947) with a story that introduced a new super-villain, the Wizard.Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 55: "Gardner Fox penned his last story about the Justice Society of America in this issue.  The writer...introduced an ill-tempered illusionist called the Wizard."[tpl]cite book|last= Thomas|first= Roy| authorlink = Roy Thomas|chapter= "The Men (and One Woman) Behind the JSA: Its Creation and Creative Personnel|title = All-Star Companion Volume 1|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2000|isbn= 1-893905-055|pages= 23–24[/tpl]

====Non-DC work====

Between 1940 and 1941, Fox wrote for the Columbia Comic Corporation, penning stories featuring characters including "Face," "Marvelo," "Rocky Ryan," "Spyman," and "Spymaster." For approximately three years (1947–50), Fox wrote for EC Comics, including scripts and text pieces which appeared in the famous The Crypt of Terror, The Vault of Horror and Weird Fantasy titles, as well as in the lesser-known Gunfighter, Happy Houlihans, Moon Girl, Saddle Justice and the new trend title Valor, among others.
Towards the end of the decade, and the start of the 1950s, he worked for Magazine Enterprises on features including "The Durango Kid," the first Ghost Rider, "Red Hawk," "Straight Arrow" and "Tim Holt," in whose comic the Ghost Rider appeared. Fox also wrote some of the required text pieces for Magazine Enterprises, which were required by the Post Office to qualify magazines and comics for cheaper postal rates.
Throughout the 1950s, Fox also wrote stories for Avon Comics, most notably tales of "Crom the Barbarian", and of "Kenton of the Star Patrol."

===Silver Age===

In the early 1950s, Fox wrote Vigilante in Action Comics, as well as Western stories in the pages of Western Comics and science-fiction stories for DC's Mystery in Space and Strange Adventures.Irvine, Alex "1950s" in Dolan, p. 64:  "DC picked up on renewed public interest in science fiction by launching its first comic in the genre, the anthology series, Strange Adventures. The series kicked off its 244-issue run with an adaptation of the first color science fiction movie, Destination Moon (released that same month), written by Gardner Fox and drawn by Curt Swan." In 1953, he entered into correspondence with fan Jerry Bails, which initially focused on Bails' fondness for the Justice Society and All-Star Comics, but ultimately became a friendship that not only informed and influenced the dawning of comics' Silver Age, but also comics fandom, in which Bails played a key role.
In the mid-1950s, in the wake of the crackdown on comics which followed Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent and the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings on the dangers of comic books, the content of comics faced radical overhauls and the imposition of the censoring Comics Code Authority body. In partial response to this shift, DC editor Julius Schwartz began a widespread reinvention/revival of many Golden Age heroes, and "Fox was one of the first writers... Schwartz called in to help." The Silver Age of heroes began in the pages of Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956) with a radically overhauled Flash character by writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome with penciler Carmine Infantino.
Fox scripted most of the Silver Age adventures of science-fiction hero Adam Strange, who debuted in Showcase #17 (Nov. 1958) with art by Mike Sekowsky.Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 91: "Adam Strange debuted in a three-issue trial starting with Showcase #17, which was written by Gardner Fox and featured art by Mike Sekowsky." The Adam Strange stories were co-plotted by Fox and the character's creator, Julius Schwartz.[tpl]cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|authorlink = Jim Amash|chapter= Foreward|title = The Adam Strange Archives: Volume 1|publisher = DC Comics|year = 2004|pages = 5–8|isbn = 978-1401201487[/tpl] Under the "creative guidance" of Fox and Schwartz, "Hawkman and the Atom were given new costumes, new identities," and drew an audience of fans old and new. Fox penned the reinvention of the new Hawkman in The Brave and the Bold #34 (March 1961)McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 102: "DC's...renaissance soared to new heights with the return of Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert...ushered in a pair of Winged Wonders that, costumes aside, were radically different from their Golden Age predecessors." and the Atom, who debuted in Showcase #34 (Sep–Oct. 1961) with art by Gil Kane.McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 103: "The Atom was the next Golden Age hero to receive a Silver Age makeover from writer Gardner Fox and artist Gil Kane."[tpl]cite book|last = Pasko|first = Martin|authorlink = Martin Pasko|title = The DC Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the DC Universe|publisher = Running Press|year = 2008|isbn = 0762432578|page= 101|quote =  Old All-American heroes like Hawkman and the Atom were revived – both by writer Gardner Fox – and given the fiction makeover with as many new twists as possible.[/tpl]

====The Justice League of America====

Another of Fox's key Silver Age achievements saw him revive and revitalise the concept of the Justice Society as the Justice League of America, debuting in The Brave and the Bold #28 (Feb.-Mar. 1960).McAvennie, "1960s" in Dolan, p. 99: "Editor Julius Schwartz had repopulated the superhero subculture by revitalizing Golden Age icons like Green Lantern and the Flash..He recruited writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky, and together they came up with the Justice League of America, a modern version of the legendary Justice Society of America from the 1940s." Swiftly spun off into their own title in Oct.-Nov. 1960, the Justice League would become the backbone of the DC Universe.[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter= The Justice League of America A Team of Good Sports|publisher = Bulfinch|year = 1995|page = 127|isbn = 0821220764|quote= Justice League was a hit. It solidified once and for all the importance of super hero groups, and in the process provided a playground where DC's characters could attract new fans while entertaining established admirers.[/tpl] The supervillain Doctor Light first battled the team in issue #12 (June 1962).McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 105: "In a tale written by Gardner Fox, with art by Mike Sekowsky, Dr. Light's first adventure was almost the JLA's last." Justice League of America #21 and #22 (August–September 1963) saw the first team-up of the Justice League and the Justice Society of America as well as the first use of the term "Crisis" in reference to a crossover between characters.McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 109: "The two-part 'Crisis on Earth-One!' and 'Crisis on Earth-Two!' saga represented the first use of the term 'Crisis' in crossovers, as well as the designations 'Earth-1' and 'Earth-2'. In it editor Julius Schwartz, Gardner Fox, and artist Mike Sekowsky devised a menace worthy of the World's Greatest Heroes." The following year's team-up with the Justice Society introduced the threat of the Crime Syndicate of America of Earth-Three.McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 112: "Writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky crafted a tale in which the Crime Syndicate...ambushed the JLA on Earth-1." The character Zatanna, introduced by Fox and artist Murphy Anderson in Hawkman #4 (Nov. 1964), was the center of a plotline which ran through several DC titles and was resolved in Justice League of America #51 (Feb. 1967).McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 112 Fox and Sekowsky were the creative team for the title's first eight years. Sekowsky's last issue was #63 (June 1968) and Fox departed with #65 (September 1968).[tpl]cite book|last = Eury|first = Michael|authorlink = Michael Eury|chapter= The Writers and Artists of Justice League of America|title = The Justice League Companion|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|year = 2005|pages = 96–97|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QxJPl_R0FtwC&pg=RA2-PA1908&dq=Gardner+Fox+Justice+League+Companion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GTNjUv-bCqjSyAH--oHgBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Gardner%20Fox%20Justice%20League%20Companion&f=false|isbn = 978-1893905481[/tpl]

====Multiverse====

Fox's script for "Flash of Two Worlds!", from The Flash #123 (Sept. 1961), introduced the concept that the Golden Age heroes existed on a parallel Earth named Earth-Two. This event heralded more generally the concept of the DC Comics Multiverse,McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 103: "This classic Silver Age story resurrected the Golden Age Flash and provided a foundation for the Multiverse from which he and the Silver Age Flash would hail." a decades-long recurring theme of the DC Comics universe, allowing old and new heroes to co-exist and crossover. Gardner Fox is referenced in the story, it is claimed by Barry Allen that the reason there were comics about the old Flash in his world was due to a psychic link between worlds.

====Silver Age Batman====

In 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles[tpl]cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Greenberger|last2 = Manning|first2 = Matthew K.|title = The Batman Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the Batcave|publisher = Running Press|year = 2009|isbn = 0762436638|page= 19|quote = DC shifted its editorial staff around, placing legendary editor Julius 'Julie' Schwartz in charge of the denizens of Gotham City...Schwartz brought two of his Flash cohorts, writers Gardner Fox and John Broome, on to his team.[/tpl] and Fox returned to writing Batman stories. Following the Silver Age trends, he reintroduced characters including the Riddler and the Scarecrow. Fox's "Remarkable Ruse of the Riddler" with art by Sheldon Moldoff in Batman #171 (May 1965).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=comic&id=3701|title= Batman #171 'Remarkable Ruse of the Riddler'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl]McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 114: "Nearly eighteen years had passed since the Riddler last tried to stump Batman and Robin. Therefore, when writer Gardner Fox and artist Sheldon Moldoff released Edward Nigma, the villain insisted that he had reformed." Eighteen issues later, Fox and Moldoff similarly resuscitated and relocated Professor Jonathan Crane, launching the Earth-1 Scarecrow in "Fright of the Scarecrow", Batman #189 (Feb 1967).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=comic&id=3719|title= Batman #189 'Fright of the Scarecrow'|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl] Fox and artist Carmine Infantino created Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in a story titled "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!" in Detective Comics #359 (January 1967).McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan p. 122 "Nine months before making her debut on Batman, a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of Detective Comics...Yet the idea for the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics.  Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on 'The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!'" Fox's final Batman story, "Whatever Will Happen to Heiress Heloise?", was published in Detective Comics #384 (Feb. 1969).

===Leaving DC===

Fox stopped receiving work from DC in 1968, when the comics company refused to give health insurance and other benefits to its older creators. Fox, who had written a number of historical adventure, mystery and science fiction novels in the 1940s and the 1950s, began to produce novels full time, both under his own name and several pseudonyms. He produced a small number of comics during this period, but predominantly focused on novels, writing over 100 in genres such as science fiction, sword and sorcery, espionage, crime, fantasy, romance, western, and historical fiction.
Among his output was the modern novelisation of the Irwin Allen production of Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon, two books in the "Llarn" series; five books about the barbarian swordsman Kothar, starting in 1969 with the anthology Kothar—Barbarian Swordsman,[tpl]cite book|last = Fox|first = Gardner F.|title = Kothar—Barbarian Swordsman|date=April 1969|publisher = Belmont Books[/tpl] and four books about the adventures of "Kyrik," starting with Warlock Warrior (1975).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/f/gardner-f-fox/|title= Gardner F.

===Later comics work===

In the early 1970s, Fox briefly worked for DC's rival publisher, Marvel Comics, writing scripts for The Tomb of Dracula, Red Wolf,[tpl]cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2008|page = 150|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Writer Gardner Fox and artist Syd Shores created the Red Wolf of the nineteenth-century American West in this new series.[/tpl] and the "Doctor Strange" feature in Marvel Premiere. In 1971, Skywald Publications reprinted some of his earlier work on titles such as Demona, Nightmare, Red Mask and Zanagar, and Fox also found work for Warren Publications on Creepy and Eerie during the same period.

During the course of his career, Fox can be definitely credited with around 1500 stories for DC Comics, making him the second most prolific DC creator (after Robert Kanigher) by a considerable margin over his nearest rival.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?site=dc&pagetype=report&report=topcreators|title= Top Creators by Category|first= Mike|last= Voiles|year= 2013|publisher= Mike's Amazing World of Comics|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2013[/tpl] In July 1971, Fox estimated he had written "fifty million words" over the course of his career to date.Seuling, Phil (ed.)

He was a member of a number of literary and genre organisations, including the Academy of Comic Book Arts and both the Authors Guild, the Authors League of America and the Science Fiction Writers of America. As a lawyer, he was also a member of the prestigious legal fraternity Phi Delta Phi.
A sports fan, he liked both "the Mets and the Jets," and (in 1971) had "season tickets to the St. John's games." A voracious reader, he stated, "I have two writers that I reread and reread. One that I'm sure nobody's every [tpl]sic[/tpl] heard of is Jeffery Pond [tpl]sic[/tpl]. I have every book he ever wrote. The other is the mystery writer John Dickson Carr, whose style I admire tremendously... and of course the old standbys – Merritt I always particularly liked – and Burroughs."
