==History==

===Early days===

The region's first airport opened in 1929 as Raleigh's Municipal Airport, just south of what is now downtown. It was quickly outgrown, and in 1939 the North Carolina General Assembly chartered the Raleigh–Durham Aeronautical Authority to build and operate a replacement airport convenient to both Raleigh and Durham. This was also promoted by Eastern Air Lines, led by then chairman Eddie Rickenbacker who sought to make Raleigh–Durham a stop on the airline's New York-Miami route.
The new Raleigh–Durham Airport opened on May 1, 1943 with flights by Eastern Airlines. The passenger terminal was built from materials remaining after the construction of four barracks for the Army Air Forces Air Technical Service Command airfield.[tpl]cite web |title=Stuck at the Airport: Raleigh–Durham – Haven for Bibliophiles at RDU|first=Harriet|last=Baskas|url=http://www.expedia.com/daily/airports/Raleigh-Durham.asp|publisher=Expedia.com|date=October 11, 2004|accessdate=September 22, 2008[/tpl] The three runways the airport had in 1951 are still visible on the southeast side of the airport: 4500-ft runway 5, 4500-ft runway 18 and 4490-ft runway 14.
After World War II Capital Airlines joined Eastern at RDU; Piedmont Airlines arrived in 1948. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 36 departures a day: twenty Eastern, eight Capital and eight Piedmont. Nonstop flights did not reach beyond Washington, Atlanta, or the Appalachians (but Eastern started a Super Constellation nonstop to Newark in 1958).[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The next airline (aside from United's takeover of Capital in 1961) was Delta Air Lines in 1970.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] In April 1969 nonstops didn't reach beyond New York or Atlanta, and Chicago was the only nonstop west of the Appalachians.
In the 1970s, the last decade before airline deregulation, Piedmont connected RDU to Charlotte, Greensboro, New Bern, Norfolk, Richmond, Rocky Mount, Washington, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.1978 timetable United flew to Asheville, Charlotte, Huntsville and Newark,1976 timetable while Eastern flew to Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Washington,1972 timetable and Delta flew to Chicago and Greensboro.1974 timetable
After deregulation Allegheny Airlines arrived in 1979 and by 1985 Trans World Airlines, American Airlines, Ozark, People Express, New York Air, and Pan Am had all put in appearances.

===Hub years===

American Airlines built a terminal at RDU between 1985 and 1987 to house a new hub operation, and offered service to 38 cities at the hub's outset in June 1987.[tpl]cite news|last=Belden|first=Tom|title=American Begins Service To New Hub|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-04/business/26170409_1_new-nonstop-jet-service-durham-hub-american-eagle|accessdate=9 December 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=4 August 1987[/tpl]  The RDU hub operated at a loss even during its heyday in the early 1990s, along with the north-south hubs AA then had at Nashville and San Jose.[tpl]cite news |title=Future of American's N. C. Hub Is Uncertain|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19911118&id=Q6YsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mxQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613,1109567|newspaper=Star-News|location=Wilmington, NC|date=November 18, 1991|accessdate=July 25, 2013|pages=2B[/tpl]
The hub's traffic peaked in 1991. Although the Raleigh/Durham area had growing local traffic, the connecting hub faced intense competition from Delta and Eastern in Atlanta and from USAir in Charlotte, as well as the short-lived Continental Airlines hub in Greensboro which opened in 1993. American began to consider closing the hub in late 1993; operations were gradually downsized through June 1995, when American formally closed the hub, retaining flights to only three other hubs and London.[tpl]cite news|last=Deak|first=Leslie|title=American Airlines to eliminate RDU hub|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/1995/01/26/american-airlines-eliminate-rdu-hub|accessdate=9 December 2013|newspaper=Duke Chronicle|date=26 January 1995[/tpl]
Midway Airlines replaced AA as the airport's hub carrier from 1995 until 2003.[tpl]cite web |title=Raleigh-Durham, San Jose and Portland Airports: Colourful Pasts and Hope for the Future|url=http://www.centreforaviation.com/news/2010/03/16/raleigh-durham-san-jose-and-portland-airports-colourful-pasts-and-hope-for-the-future/page1|work=Centre for Aviation|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2013[/tpl] In 1995, Midway had flights to Boston, Hartford, Long Island, Newark, Newburgh, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington in the Northeast, and to Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach in Florida.1995 timetable American subleased its gates at RDU to Midway in order to repay $113 million in American-guaranteed bonds which had been used to construct the hub facilities.[tpl]cite news|last=Fins|first=Antonio|title=A Tale Of 2 Cities ...

AA retained the daily nonstop flight to London, originally launched to Gatwick Airport in May 1994 with a Boeing 767-200ER. The route continues to operate, partly due to the needs of the region's corporate travelers, particularly those of GlaxoSmithKline which has major bases of operation in west London near Heathrow Airport and in the Research Triangle Park near RDU. On March 29, 2008 American Airlines moved its London flight to Heathrow Airport. The RDU-London flight used three-class Boeing 777-200s for several years and is now operated by two-class Boeing 767-300ERs.

===Post-hub years===

RDU's post-hub years have brought the addition of several new carriers (notably Southwest Airlines and new destinations). Due to high fuel prices AMR ended the flights to  Jacksonville, Kansas City, Newark and Louisville. Mainline flights to Austin, Columbus, New York (LaGuardia) and St. Louis were also dropped.  Other cities saw reduced service or downgrade of service. Other airlines cut flights and destinations also, including United's service to Denver, US Airways' services to Las Vegas and Phoenix. ExpressJet ended its independent flights to Kansas City and New Orleans (ExpressJet now only operates as United Express and Delta Connection). In 2008 RDU lost over 30 flights compared to March 2008 schedule.
In 2010 RDU's traffic began to recover. In the first few months of the year passenger numbers stabilized at RDU, ending the decrease in 2008/2009. In the first four months of 2010, 2.7 million passengers traveled through RDU.http://rdu.com/news/2010/release_052010.htm Growth was flat, compared to the same period a year ago, but these signs were positive, indicating that the decline was over. Also, after cutting service, carriers at RDU began to add (or re-add) new service to the schedule. In April 2010 Midwest Airlines resumed service from RDU, adding service to Milwaukee.http://rdu.com/news/2010/release_040110.htm This route ended when Midwest was acquired by Frontier Airlines. Southwest Airlines, which began service to RDU in June 1999,http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/1998-to-2000 had also aggressively expanded at RDU, adding service to St. Louis in May, and replacing American Airlines as the largest carrier at RDU.http://rdu.com/news/2010/release_051010.htmhttp://www.rdu.com/Landing/annualreport/2009/rdu-09yir.pdf JetBlue Airways also increased service to Boston in May 2010.http://rdu.com/news/2010/release_050310.htm
Delta Air Lines has increased operations since 2010, with resumed nonstop service to Los Angeles in June 2010,http://rdu.com/news/2010/release_061010.htm followed by new nonstop service to Columbus, Fort Myers, Hartford, Miami, Orlando, St. Louis and Tampa, and additional frequencies to Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul and New York (JFK), in November 2010, and new services to Albany (NY) and Providence in April 2011.
In February 2011 Continental Airlines commenced its first international flight from RDU, to Cancún. Delta added three daily flights to Baltimore in September 2011. In November Vision Airlines began operations at RDU, and added a twice weekly flight to Freeport.http://www.rduaa.com/feeds/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=306:07-14-11-vision-airlines-announces-nonstop-service-between-rdu-and-grand-bahama-island&catid=13:2011&Itemid=1 This service was taken over by Bahamasair in May 2012. United Airlines started the airport's first non-stop flight to San Francisco in August 2012. In December 2012 American Airlines announced the airport's first daily non-stop flight to Los Angeles, beginning in April 2013.

==Airport facilities==

The airport has implemented the most ambitious expansion in its history, begun in 2006 and completed in January 2011. The airport has two terminals: Terminal 1, opened after extensive renovation in 2014; and Terminal 2, opened in 2008. The two terminals do not have an airside connection. Passengers moving between the terminals may ride a shuttle bus or take the moving walkway through the covered parking decks between the terminals.

===Terminal 1===

The first terminal at RDU opened in 1955. Expanded in 1972 and again in 1976,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rdu.com/airportdev/T1history.html|title=RDU Terminal 1 History[/tpl] the building was named Terminal B in 1982 when the then-new Terminal A opened. The two terminals were connected by a landside interior walkway. Terminal B was closed in 1989. In 1994, Terminal B lost its identity when it was renovated into an extension of Terminal A; an airside walkway was added to link all gates. In 2001 the south end of Terminal A was extended to include five temporary gates; these gates were closed in 2009, as the airlines using them moved to other gates.
Terminal A was renamed Terminal 1 on October 26, 2008 to bring RDU in line with terminal naming conventions and to end years of confusion.
After years of proposals,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4001150/|title=Weak economy could delay projects at RDU|date=November 20, 2008|work=WRAL[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4435772/|title=RDU could shutter terminal|date=January 30, 2009|work=WRAL[/tpl] the 1981 part of Terminal 1 was closed in 2012 for a complete reconstruction. The building reopened on April 13, 2014 with nine gates; initially, Southwest and AirTran occupied the rebuilt terminal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rdu.com/airportdev/t1modern.html|title=Terminal 1 Modernization Project[/tpl] The pre-1981 parts of Terminal 1 and the 2001 south-end extension are scheduled for demolition.[tpl]cite news |title=Airlines to Be in Transit at RDU|first=Bruce|last=Siceloff|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/11/19/811963/airlines-to-be-in-transit-at-rdu.html|newspaper=The News & Observer|location=Raleigh|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010[/tpl]

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 occupies the site of the former Terminal C, built between 1985 and 1987 for the American Airlines hub. In planning the terminal, American assumed that only around 20% of passengers would originate or terminate their trips in Raleigh–Durham; rather, Terminal C was optimized for the exchange of passengers between connecting flights, with a relatively small check-in and baggage claim area. In reality, connecting passengers only accounted for around two-thirds of the terminal's passengers. After the American and Midway hubs closed, the airport faced a decision about the future of Terminal C and how to eliminate the inconveniences it imposed on local passengers.[tpl]cite web |title=The RDU Experience: Phase 2 Expansion Culminates a Decade of Defining the Needs, the Costs|first=John F.|last=Infanger|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/print/Airport-Business-Magazine/The-RDU-Experience/1$36407|work=Airport Business|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2013[/tpl]
In December 2003, the Airport Authority announced plans to expand and renovate the originally 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m²) building, transforming it into a new 900,000 ft² (84,000 m²) facility. In January 2006, however, the airport decided instead to replace the building entirely.
Terminal 2 was designed by Fentress Architects under a philosophy of contextual regionalism, related to Critical regionalism. The terminal, invoking the flowing hills and culture of North Carolina's Piedmont region,http://rdu.com/terminal2/aboutproject/architecture.htm consisted of two phases of construction. The first, larger Phase 1 opened on October 26, 2008 while Phase 2 opened on January 23, 2011 in time for the 2011 NHL All Star Game. Terminal 2 has 36 gates; three configured for international flights. All gates feature adjustable jetbridges that can accommodate aircraft from regional jets to Boeing 747s. The federal inspection area has 16 stations.

===Runways===

RDU has three runways. Two parallel runways are designated 5L/23R and 5R/23L, and a cross-wind runway designated 14/32. Both parallel runways have been equipped with LED lights.
Prior to September 11, 2001, The RDU Airport Authority and Federal Aviation Administration planned a fourth runway at the airport, but with the demise of the Midway Airlines hub and the airline industry downturn following 9/11 terrorist attacks, this plan was placed on hold.  During the period between May 27, 2008 and June 24, 2008, and between May 19, 2010 and June 17, 2010, runway 5R/23L was closed for renovation.[tpl]cite press release |title=RDU Continues Runway Rehabilitation Project|url=http://www.rdu.com/news/2008/release_070108b.htm|publisher=Raleigh/Durham Airport Authority|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=July 1, 2008[/tpl]
