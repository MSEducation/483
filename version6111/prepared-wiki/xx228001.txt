Altwood is a historic plantation house located near Faunsdale, Alabama.   It was built in 1836 by Richard H. Adams[tpl]cite book |title=The People's City: The glory and grief of an Alabama town, 1850-1874 |last=Smith |first=Winston |year=2003 |publisher=Marengo County Historical Society |location=Demopolis, Alabama |isbn= |pages=22 [/tpl] and began as a log dogtrot house.  It was then expanded until it came to superficially resemble a Tidewater-type cottage.  Brought to the early Alabama frontier by settlers from the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of Virginia, this vernacular house-type is usually a story-and-a-half in height, displays strict symmetry, and is characterized by prominent end chimneys flanking a steeply pitched longitudinal gable roof that is often pierced by dormer windows.[tpl]cite book |title=Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930 |last=Gamble |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=The University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-1134-3 |pages=33â€“35 [/tpl] 
The house was moved to Cedar Crest Farms in 1988 and restored by members of the Rankin family. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on February 19, 1988 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1993 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission.
