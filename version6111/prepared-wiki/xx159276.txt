James Paul Casciano is an American college basketball coach and the former head men's basketball coach at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He stepped down after going 0–29 with the Highlanders in 2007–08 although he was not physically there for a 12-game leave of absence (coached by assistant coach Wendell Alexis during his medical leaves), which is the worst winless season in unofficial NCAA Division I basketball history (record does not officially count because NJIT was transiting from Division II to Division I during that period).
