[[Fiat Compact platform]]

CATEGORIES: Fiat platforms, Alfa Romeo platforms

The Compact platform (also known as C-Evo) was developed by engineers of the Fiat group for construction of small family cars (compact car) and large family cars (mid-size car) with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The first application of this platform was the Alfa Romeo Giulietta which was unveiled in 2010.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100215/ANE/100219943/1193|title=New Fiat platform will underpin 1M models a year|accessdate=28 September 2011|work=autonews.com[/tpl] Fiat has invested 100 million euros into the construction of the Compact Platform.

==Specification==

Developed in Turin, Italy, the Compact platform was designed to adapt to future cars of both the Fiat and Chrysler group vehicles. Fiat engineers used the C-platform (used by Fiat Stilo, Bravo and Lancia Delta) as a starting point and developed a new high-performance platform that uses only a central part of the floor from the old C-platform. The frame is made of 84% high-strength steel (as opposed to the old C-platform, which was made of 65% high-strength steel), and 4% aluminum. The front suspension uses MacPherson aluminum Evo struts and is [tpl]convert|4|kg[/tpl] lighter than  the previous steel struts (used in Fiat Bravo). The rear suspension uses an independent multilink suspension and each of them consists of two lateral links with an aluminum longitudinal arm that mounts the hub and spring.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/tutte-le-soluzioni-tecniche-alfa-romeo-giulietta |title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta TUTTE LE SOLUZIONI TECNICHE |language=[tpl]it icon[/tpl] |publisher=Quattroruote.it |date= |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl] Being lighter than steel, aluminum usage in suspension bits resulted in a total combined weight-savings of 14 kilograms.  The framework for the rear seats and the magnesium alloy cross member reduced weight by 35% in comparison to earlier cars.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://under-the-skin.org.uk/news_alfacompact.html|title=Overview: Fiat Group’s ‘Compact’ platform|accessdate=28 September 2011|work=under-the-skin.org.uk[/tpl]
The platform offers a compact transverse engine at the front with either front-wheel or four-wheel drive. The total platform weight of the standard version (on the compact models) is [tpl]convert|174|kg[/tpl].

The interchangeable modules make the basic platform suitable for vehicles of differing lengths up to [tpl]convert|4.92|m[/tpl]. It was designed with additional features for a compact platform that could adapt to sports cars like Alfa Romeo.
The engine range, combined with the platform, consists of the compact four-cylinder petrol 1.4 Fire, 1.4 Multiair, 1,750 TBi turbocharged and the 2.0 or 2.4 Chrysler GEMA engine and the diesel 1.6 Multijet and 2.0 Multijet. In the future, the Pentastar V6 petrol will be offered as well. Fiat and Chrysler plan to build about 1 million vehicles a year by 2014 based on this platform. Eight upcoming Chrysler Group vehicles are planned to be built on Fiat's Compact Wide platform, including the replacement for the Jeep Liberty.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111207/OEM/111209911/1251|title=Chrysler CEO: Dart certification will yield final 5% stock award|accessdate=8 December 2011|work=autonews.com[/tpl]
