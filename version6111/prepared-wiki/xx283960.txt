CATEGORIES: Saudi Arabia–Syria relations, Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia, Foreign relations of Syria

Saudi Arabia–Syria relations refer to diplomatic and economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria. Diplomatic ties between these two countries of the Middle East have soured markedly by the major events in the region. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria further deterriated due to the Syrian Civil War and relations between the two countries became completely severed following Saudi Arabia closing its embassy in Damascus as well as expelling Syrian ambassador. 

==Factors affecting relations==

Sonoko Sunayama, a Middle East expert, argues that although economic concerns and balance of power are important, concerns about identity and ideology play the most significant role in the two countries' relations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kalmbach|first=Hilary|title=Book Review|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|year=2009|volume=41|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sant1959/Files/review-sunayama-syriaandsaudiarabia-kalmbach.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Ian Black of the Guardian, on the other hand, states that Saudi foreign policy in general mostly focuses on business involving financial incentives and low-profile initiatives, which continued towards Syria until King Abdullah's high-profile condemnation of the Assad regime in 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|title=Saudi Arabia's rare criticism of Syria reveals their underlying antipathy|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/08/saudi-arabia-criticism-syria-analysis|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 August 2011[/tpl]
Both countries share Arab nationalist and Islamic identities. However, a significant element of their identity and regime, namely secular versus conservative pattern, is completely different in that Syria has a secular regime and life-style, while Saudi Arabia a conservative regime and world view.

==History==

The relations between two countries have been turbulent since their establishment as modern states.[tpl]cite news|last=Al Saadi|first=Yazan|title=Saudi-Syrian Relations: A Historic Divide|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/3906|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=Al Akhbar|date=4 February 2012[/tpl]

===1940s through 1960s===

A Syrian mission was opened in Saudi Arabia in 1941.[tpl]cite web|last=Al Kahtani|first=Mohammad Zaid|title=The Foreign Policy of King Abdulaziz|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/529/1/uk_bl_ethos_412035.pdf|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=21 July 2013|date=December 2004[/tpl] King Abdulaziz reportedly advocated the independence of Syria and Lebanon from both the Hashemite dynasty and the French mandate. The King met Shukri Al Quwatli, the first president of independent Syria, on 17 February 1945 in Al Fayyum, Egypt. Both countries were the founding members of the Arab League which was established in 1945.[tpl]cite web|title=Arab League|url=http://www.questia.com/read/1E1-ArabLeag/arab-league|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 December 2013|year=2013[/tpl][tpl]Subscription required|via=Questia[/tpl] 
Saudi Arabia supported the coup in Syria by Adib Shishakli in December 1950. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in rival camps in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of the policies of Egypt's leader Gamal Nasser and of the Cold War. Syria advocated Nasser's policies and was the major Arab ally of the USSR.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cold War and the Middle East|year=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.questia.com/read/22765142/the-cold-war-and-the-middle-east|author=Patrick Seale|editor=Yezid Sayigh; Avi Shlaim|accessdate=11 September 2013|chapter=3 Syria[/tpl] [tpl]Subscription required|via=Questia[/tpl] However, Saudi Arabia was among the opponents of Nasser's policies and was close to the United States. Following the Baath party's rule in Syria in 1963, their diplomatic ties again became tense. A left-wing faction of the Baath Party, called the Neo-Baath, led by Salah Jadid took over the government on 23 February 1966, further damaging the relations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mann|first=Joseph|title=The Syrian Neo-Baath regime and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 1966–70|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=2006|volume=42|issue=5|pages=761–776|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00263200600828014|accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] Because new Syrian government declared war against monarchist nations, including Saudi Arabia.

===1970s and 1980s===

At the end of November 1970, the neo-Baath leaders were toppled and removed, and Hafez Assad became the ruler of Syria. Diplomatic negotiations between two countries were opened and renewed. With the death of Nasser in 1972 the relations began to further improve.
Three months before the joint attacks of Egyptian and Syrian forces on Israeli forces in the Sinai and the Golan Heights Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian President Hafez Assad visited King Faisal in Riyadh in August 1973.[tpl]cite web|title=The October War and U.S. Policy|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB98/|work=The National Security Archive|accessdate=11 August 2013|date=7 October 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Joseph A.

==Economic ties==

One of the early economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria was in 1950 when a trade agreement was signed and Saudi Arabia provided the Syria with financial support. It followed other trade agreements, but all of them were cancelled by King Faisal on 3 May 1966 due to hostile attitude of the neo-Baath government in Syria towards Saudi Arabia.
