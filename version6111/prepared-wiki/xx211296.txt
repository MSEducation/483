==Details==

First of the two bombs which was a sonic bomb was placed in a telephone cabin and second bomb was placed in a waste container 50 meters apart, near a crowded street. The first bomb caused crowds to gather for help and curiosity, and around 10 minutes later, the second and more powerful bomb exploded, causing many of the casualties. The police believe that the bombs were activated remotely. Political analyst Damla Aras said that, "there is a possibility they might be A4, C-4 explosives, which were brought from northern Iraq by the PKK and have been used several times in Turkey."[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2008/07/2008727193036298109.html|title=Deadly bombings hit Istanbul|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-07-28[/tpl]
Early on, news sources thought the first explosion was caused by a gas leak.

==Investigation==

Nobody has claimed responsibility for the bombing as yet, although Kurdish separatist militants are suspected.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/world/europe/28turkey.html?hp|title=Bombs Kill 15 in a Crowded Istanbul Neighborhood|last=Arsu|first=Sebnem|date=2008-07-28|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] The Istanbul Police indicate that the incident bears the hallmarks of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), possibly in revenge for a series of major operations by the Turkish military on its bases days prior to the incident. However a senior member of the PKK, Zubeyir Aydar, denied the implication: "The Kurdish liberation movement is not involved in this attack."
Based on a tip from residents, three teenagers were taken into custody in connection to the bombings.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080059139&ch=7/28/2008%206:39:00%20PM|title=3 teenagers detained for Istanbul attack|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-07-28[/tpl]
