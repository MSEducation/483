According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children (five children starting with the season-seven finale). It originally ran on ABC from October 1, 2001 to June 2, 2009.

==Synopsis==

Jim is a lovable suburban father. Much like his real-life counterpart, Jim's character is noted as a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of twins Jonathan and Gordon.
Jim often finds himself in messy situations because his laziness inclines him to search for alternative ways of doing things with least effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy may be Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women, especially if Cheryl or Dana find out. He doesn't like people interrupting him when he talks, so he speaks over them to shut them up. Jim often makes an example of Andy, who doesn't have a girlfriend. Dana and Jim bicker constantly, but Dana flirts with Jim when she's drunk.

==History==

The show first aired following the surprise hit comedy My Wife and Kids and quickly developed an audience of its own. For its second season ABC placed it on its revitalized Tuesday line-up, which also included John Ritter's 8 Simple Rules, Bonnie Hunt's Life with Bonnie and Sara Rue's Less Than Perfect. Week by week, the show attracted more and more viewers, becoming ABC's second most watched sitcom. The show performed so well that the network made a risky move: putting Jim opposite the NBC juggernaut Frasier. Although Jim did not beat the competition, it performed well enough to secure itself that spot on the 2003 fall schedule.
On May 15, 2007, it was announced that According to Jim would not be renewed for another season. ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson said, "We are talking to the studio to see if there's something financially, a deal that would make sense for us".2007 Cancelled Shows: ABC Cuts Some Beloved Series[tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl], TV Series Finale, May 15, 2007  But on June 27, 2007, ABC renewed the show for a seventh season with 18 episodes.ABC Renews "According to Jim", TV Week, June 27, 2007ABC renews "According to Jim"[tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl], Yahoo!, June 28, 2007
