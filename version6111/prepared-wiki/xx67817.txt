</ref> In addition to diamond prospects, [[Bio-fuels]] are also playing a significant role to the area. The Prince Albert region is one of the richest areas in the province for agriculture, and with the current emphasis on bio-fuel technology from the provincial and federal governments, it is expected that this economic sector will grow. [[Uranium]] is also expected to play a bigger role in the future development of Prince Albert. There is speculation that, due to the proximity the uranium mining in northern Saskatchewan, the area could be ideal for a [[value-added]] type of business.
Prince Albert is still heavily reliant on its government service sector, which accounts for about 11% of the workforce. There are three prisons, the Prince Albert Correctional Centre, Pine Grove Correctional Centre and the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary.
Chief Joseph Custer, Kistapinanihk 231, Northern Lights 220, Muskoday 99 and Wahpeton 94B Indian Reserves are within [tpl]convert|20|km|mi[/tpl] of the city.
The forestry industry is also a major contributor to the economy of Prince Albert. Prince Albert currently hosts the Provincial Forestry Centre, a building that hosts significant wood and forestry related types of businesses and associations.

===Pulp Mill===

Prince Albert Pulp Company was the area's largest employer.[ref]
.</ref>
The mill was closed down in 2006 by its then owner, Weyerhaeuser.http://www.paherald.sk.ca/News/Local/2013-09-03/article-3373540/Rail-traffic-faces-boost-with-pulp-mill-re-opening/1 The mill was subsequently sold. Paper Excellence purchased the long-closed down Prince Albert Pulp Inc. from Domtar in April 2011. This mill will be in a refurbishing and construction phase for the next 18 months. When complete, Prince Albert will operate a dissolving pulp mill producing 1000 tonnes per day employing about 250 people.http://www.paperexcellence.com/prince-albert-pulp/

==Chamber of Commerce==

The formation of the original board of Trade in 1887 was an important event in the history and evolution of the Prince Albert & District Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce objective is to promote, support and encourage business and community.
From the beginning, probably the overriding singular concern of the local chamber was to assist Prince Albert to obtain rail transportation.  Delegations were sent by the Chamber to present the case for a Prince Albert route to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.  These delegations may not have been able to identify concrete results, but they were certainly a major and influential factor in obtaining rail service sooner than what may have otherwise been possible.
Today the Chamber of Commerce still exists to be the voice of business for Prince Albert & District which advocates for a positive and progressive business climate.

==Geography==

Prince Albert is located on the White Fox Plain of the Saskatchewan River lowlands. These lowlands are located in the physiographic region of the Saskatchewan Plains Region of the Central Lowlands Province.[tpl]Rp|40, 41[/tpl] The natural vegetation of the area consists of aspen parkland to the south and southern boreal forest to the north of the North Saskatchewan River. These two ecoregions have differing soil types: the northern forested soils are brunisolic and sandy, whereas south of the river are black chernozemic soils.[tpl]Rp|131, 131[/tpl] The North Saskatchewan River runs through the centre of Prince Albert. The main soils of the city of Prince Albert are those of the valley complex consisting mainly of regosolic soils which produce natural vegetation which are not forest nor grassland but a complex of the two.[tpl]Rp|70, 71[/tpl] It is here that the treeline of Saskatchewan begins, and to the north of the city begins the forested growth of Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana), as well as other boreal forest growth in the Prince Albert National Park, and Nisbet forest.[tpl]Rp|92, 93[/tpl] The agricultural soils around Prince Albert have some limitations and about 25% of the land is covered with sloughs or potholes.[tpl]Rp|106, 107[/tpl] The land use is divided into the southern woodland area north of Prince Albert and cropland to the south.[tpl]Rp|110, 111[/tpl]
The Quaternary glacial geology precludes the region to have been covered by a large glacial lake. The bedrock geology is a part of the phanerozoic basin and belongs to the Lea Park and Milk River Formation.[tpl]Rp|76, 77[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

The first hospital was constructed in 1899, followed by a maternity home built in 1945 which lasted approximately twelve years.[tpl]Rp|63[/tpl]

===Bridges===

At present, only a single road bridge, the Diefenbaker Bridge, connects the north and south shore in Prince Albert; this bridge is also the only river crossing connecting southern and northern Saskatchewan in the immediate vicinity (one needs to drive many miles to the east or west to find another).
This has long been a subject of concern in the region, especially in light of a partial closure of the bridge in August 2011 that occurred when cracks were found during an inspection. Grassroots efforts are under way to lobby for the construction of a second bridge over the North Saskatchewan River within Prince Albert.[tpl]Cite web| title = Build a Second Bridge.com | url = http://www.buildasecondbridge.com/ | accessdate =2013-01-20[/tpl]

===Historic trails===

In 1866, Prince Albert was established as a mission post, and a trail to Fort Carlton arose. This trail connected the growing community to the Carlton Trail, the main land transportation route in Western Canada of the 19th century. The trail followed along the current Lily Plain grid road in Saskatchewan to the ferry service at Lilly Plain post office.
The Qu'Appelle (Troy) – Prince Albert Trail was in use from 1883 transporting mail and freight goods from the rail depot at Qu'Appelle across the ferry at St. Louis to Prince Albert.[ref]
.</ref>
Besides these two trails, Prince Albert was also served by the Montreal Lake–PA, Green Lake–PA, and Fort à la Corne–PA trails.[tpl]Rp|11[/tpl]

===Railways===

====Canadian Northern & Grand Trunk Pacific====

Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railroad and Steamboat Company (QLSRSC) arrived in Prince Albert in October 1890 as a means to link the three major cities of Saskatchewan through one railroad. For the next few years the line was seldom used, and in order to raise capital, QLSRSC leased the line out to the Canadian Pacific Railway.[tpl]Cite web| title = QLSRSC | url = http://railways-atlas.tapor.ualberta.ca/cocoon/atlas/Chapters-7-3/ | accessdate =2009-05-25[/tpl] Canadian Pacific soon realized the economic uncertainty of the line, and the lease was cancelled after only a few years of service.
By 1906, less than twenty years after the line was completed, it was sold to the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). Canadian Northern also crossed the North Saskatchewan River, heading west towards Shellbrook. Prince Albert was slated to become a northern hub for rail service into the north, however with little economic activity in the area, no branch lines were ever extended into the north except for the Paddockwood spur, which was subsequently abandoned during the 1990s as a grain-dependent branch line.
Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) also serviced Prince Albert through a branch line that headed north from Young, through St. Louis and North into Prince Albert. Later both the CNoR and GTP were nationalized, eventually becoming the Canadian National Railway (CN).[tpl]Cite web| title = Grand Trunk Pacific | url = http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/grand_trunk_pacific_railway.html | accessdate =2008-12-26[/tpl]

====Canadian National and Canadian Pacific====

For years the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway dominated the city of Prince Albert, operating on both sides of 15th Street. The Canadian Pacific Railway branched off at Lanigan moving north up to Hagen, then under trackage rights with CN, and curved towards the northeast end of Prince Albert. This was CPR's principal northern site, with many of the branch lines feeding back to Prince Albert. These branch lines almost entirely served lumber mills and grain elevators as principal commodities.
In 1991 CPR decided to shut down rail line operations in Prince Albert and the surrounding area. CPR sold the Meadow Lake line to CN, and abandoned the Meath Park branch up to Choiceland. Many small CN branch lines extended past Prince Albert hauling primarily grain, but proved ineffective due to larger and more accessible grain elevators. As a result, many were abandoned through the 1990s. Lines that have been abandoned include the Paddockwood Spur (CN), CPR to Meath Park, CPR to Lanigan, CN to Shellbrook, and CN to St. Louis. As grain storage and sorting technology improved over the years, a state of the art Inland elevator was built, located north of Prince Albert. This facility was owned by Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, later succeeded by Viterra. The smaller elevator located in the CN yards — owned by United Grain Growers, later acquired by Agricore United which was also succeeded by Viterra — operated in Prince Albert until Viterra announced its cease of operations on April 1, 2008. Today, only the Inland terminal owned by Viterra, located in White Star, continues to operate.
In December 1997, CN announced the branch line was up for sale due to lack of productivity. The engines primarily used by CN at the time were GMD1s for short haul and yard shunting, and EMD SD40-2W/EMD SD40-2s for long-haul trips. CP utilized switchers due in part to the light rail on many of their branch lines. These switchers were manufactured by Montreal Locomotive Works (Bombardier) and were designated as RS-23.

====Carlton Trail Railway====

OmniTRAX, an American shortline railway company, bought the former CN line and named it Carlton Trail Railway (CTRW or CTR). Currently, Carlton Trail Railway resides in the old CN yard, storing tank cars for CN, transporting grain, and refurbishing diesel engines for other OmniTRAX lines. Carlton Trail has recently discussed abandoning several parts of the shortline due to increasing costs and poor track condition.[tpl]Cite web| title = Carlton Trail Abandonment| url = http://www.citypa.ca/Portals/0/PDF2/News_Releases/2008/2008%2011%2005%20-%20Carlton%20Trail%20Railway%20Meeting.pdf.| accessdate =2008-12-27[/tpl] In 2001 CTRW announced the abandonment of the Birch Hills branch line, but the City of Prince Albert intervened, citing the possibility of an ethanol plant. In 2008 Carlton Trail announced the Meadow Lake line would be abandoned by April 1, 2009.[tpl]Cite web| title = Meadow Lake Track Abandonment| url = http://www.meadowlakeprogress.com/PrintArticle.aspx?e=1264806| accessdate =2008-12-27[/tpl] Carlton Trail primarily operates EMD GP10s for switching and long-haul transport.

===Highway===

Prince Albert is located on SK 2, SK 3, SK 11, SK 55, and SK 302. Prince Albert demarks the change of name for SK 2. The stretch of Highway 2 from Moose Jaw to Prince Albert was designated in 2005 as Veterans Memorial Highway. The renaming coincided with Veterans Week 2005.[ref]
