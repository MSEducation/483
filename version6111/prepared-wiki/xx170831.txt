[[National Lacrosse League dispersal draft]]

CATEGORIES: National Lacrosse League, Drafts (sports)

The National Lacrosse League dispersal draft is a meeting where the general managers of National Lacrosse League teams choose players from teams that are ceasing operations. The NLL has seen a lot of team changes over the years (the 1993 season was the last time the league had no team changes over the previous season[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nllblog.com/2010/12/stability-in-nll.html|work=The NLL Blog|last=Perrow|first=Graeme|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=2011-09-09|title=Stability in the NLL[/tpl]), so dispersal drafts have been commonplace. Recent dispersal drafts have occurred in 2011 (Boston Blazers), 2010 (Orlando Titans), 2009 (Portland LumberJax), 2008 (Arizona Sting, Chicago Shamrox), 2007 (Arizona Sting, Boston Blazers), 2005 (Anaheim Storm), 2004 (Vancouver Ravens), 2003 (Ottawa Rebel), and 2002 (Montr√©al Express).
