Porto Alegre (local [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈpoɾtʊ aˈlɛɡɾɪ|-|Br-PortoAlegre.ogg[/tpl];In other Brazilian dialects, such as that of Rio de Janeiro, it is pronounced [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈpoʁtu aˈlɛɡɾi|[/tpl], and also colloquially [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈpoʁtwɐˈlɛɡɾi|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈpoʁtaˈlɛɡɾi|[/tpl]. The European Portuguese pronunciation is [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈpoɾtu ɐˈlɛɣɾ(ɨ)|[/tpl]. Happy Harbour) is the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Founded in 1769 by Manuel Sepúlveda, its population of 1,509,939 inhabitants (2010) makes it the tenth most populous city in the country and the centre of Brazil's fourth largest metropolitan area, with 4,405,760 inhabitants (2010). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Introduction |title=Location of Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Porto Alegre is one of the top cultural, political and economic centers of Brazil.
Porto Alegre was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo (fictitious name), to hide their identity; but the official date is 1772 with the act signed by immigrants from the Azores, Portugal. In the late 19th century the city received many immigrants from other parts of the world, particularly from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The vast majority of the population is of European descent.
The city lies on the eastern bank of the Rio Guaiba (Guaiba Lake), where five rivers converge to form the Lagoa dos Patos (Lagoon of the Ducks), a giant freshwater lagoon navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port as well as a chief industrial and commercial center of Brazil.
The port of Porto Alegre is important for transporting local produce. The "capital gaúcha" has a broad-based economy that lays particular emphasis on agriculture and industry. Agricultural production includes produce such as plums, peaches, rice and cassava grown on rural smallholdings. The shoe and leather industries are also important, especially in Novo Hamburgo, in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre.
In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the World Social Forum, an initiative of several non-government organizations. The city became famous for being the first city that implemented participatory budgeting.[tpl]cite web |title=More generous than you might think |author=Eva-Maria Verfürth |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/participatory-budgeting-about-every-voice-being-heard[/tpl] The 9th Assembly of the World Council of Churches was held in Porto Alegre in 2006. Since 2000, Porto Alegre also hosts one of the world's largest free software events, called FISL.
The city will be one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, Porto Alegre hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup.

==History==

The official date of the foundation of the city of Porto Alegre is 26 March 1772 by Manuel Sepúlveda, when Freguesia de São Francisco do Porto dos Casais was created and changed a year later to Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus de Porto Alegre. However, the village started in 1752, when 60 Azorean couples were brought over by the Treaty of Madrid in order to set up Missions at the Northeast Region of Rio Grande do Sul that was handed over to the Portuguese Crown in exchange for the Sacramento Colony located on the margin of the Plata River. Land demarcation took a long time and the Azoreans settled permanently at Porto de Viamão, which was the first name by which Porto Alegre went by.History of Porto Alegre [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre became the capital city of the province, when the administration of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo (fictitious name), to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants from all over the world started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese. This mosaic of diversity in appearance, ethnic origin, religions and languages is what makes Porto Alegre, nowadays with nearly 1.5 inhabitants, a cosmopolitan and multicultural city. The city is an example of diversity and plurality.
The history of Porto Alegre was written with hard work and bravery. The capital city of  Rio Grande do Sul is also the capital city of the Pampas region, the name given to the region of fauna and flora typical of the vast plains that dominate the landscape of the South of Brazil, part of Argentina and Uruguay. This is where the Gaúcho comes from, the historical figure of a brave warrior that fought legendary battles and wars in the quest to conquer the borders of the Kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the 16th century.
There were many wars, but it was the nineteenth century that marked its people, after they fought a long for their independence from the Portuguese Empire. The Farrapos War started with the confrontation in Porto Alegre, near the Azenha bridge on 20 September 1835. Albeit terminated, this conflict etched in the pages of history the myth of the gaucho that is until our days praised in songs and celebrated in annual pageants and honored as names of streets and parks.
When the Farrapos War ended, the city continued to develop and underwent strong urban restructuring during the last decades of the 18th century, driven by the accelerated growth of port-related activities and shipyards. Its development continued in time and the city maintained kept abreast with cultural, political and social events that were taking place in Brazil, and is the birthplace of great writers, intellectuals, artists, politicians and episodes that marked the history of the country.
The city became known worldwide in 1963 through hosting the World University Games. In 1985, the people of Porto Alegre joined the movement for free elections and one of the largest demonstrations took place in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=History of Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]

==The city==

The city is located on a delta resulting from the junction of five rivers, officially called Guaíba Lake (popularly mentioned as a river too). Although its origins date from the mid-18th century, when immigrants from the Azores settled in the area, the city was officially established in 1742.[tpl]cite web|url=http://recantodasletras.uol.com.br/mensagensdeaniversario/421892 |title=History of Porto Alegre |publisher=Recantodasletras.uol.com.br |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Porto Alegre is also one of the wealthiest cities in Latin America,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/infocidade/default.php?p_secao=30 |title=Porto Alegre's Rank |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] and one of the most diverse. It has welcomed immigrants from all over the world, the largest numbers coming from Portugal, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland. There are also significant Arab and Jewish contingents among its population.About Porto Alegre City [tpl]en icon[/tpl] The Afro-Brazilian population of the state is concentrate in the city.
Before this, Porto Alegre was the port of Viamão on the shore of Guaíba Lake. Its previous name was Porto dos Casais (Port of the Couples), and it was initially settled by Azorians. Many families of settlers also came from the city of Rio Grande in the littoral Lagunar region, to the south, a military fortress at that time. Today Rio Grande is the most important port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The city is also known as "Porto do Sol" (Port of the Sun) and "Cidade Sorriso" (Smile City).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Porto Alegre City – Names |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] More than 70 neighborhoods (see below) are part of the city and two-thirds of the population are concentrated in the Zona Norte (Northern Zone), where most of the economic activity, including the city center, takes place.
Porto Alegre was the seat of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in southern Brazil, it is also an important industrial center in this geographical area. It is also a center for gaúcho (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its churrasco (barbecue) and chimarrão (a strong and hot tea prepared from erva mate). Important Brazilian universities, such as UFRGS, UFCSPA and PUCRS are located there. In 2000, the literacy rate was 97%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/infocidade/default.php?p_secao=30 |title=Literacy rate of Porto Alegre |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] The high quality of life is one of the city's main features.

==Geography==

The city of Porto Alegre is located at the northern end of the large coastal lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos in southeastern Brazil. The city lies on the east bank of the mouth of the Rio Guaiba, the estuary of which forms the enormous freshwater lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos. It additionally serves as the state capital of Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul.
Porto Alegre has a long coastline on the Guaíba Lake, and its topography is punctuated by 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, a maze of islands facing the city creates an archipelago where a unique ecosystem gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the native flora of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-84782001000500020&lng=&nrm=iso&tlng= |title=Vegetation in the city |doi=10.1590/S0103-84782001000500020 |publisher=Scielo.br |date=1990-01-06 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Among these, there are many trees which are the vestiges of the Atlantic Forest. Fauna are also diversified, specially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and wooded streets.

===Climate===

Porto Alegre is located in the subtropical zone and thus features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in Köppen climate classification). Average precipitation is high and regular throughout the year. Summer temperatures often rise above [tpl]convert|32|°C|°F[/tpl] and high levels of humidity make the season very muggy. Subtropical climate is a climate zone characterized by hot, humid summers and mild winters. Significant amounts of precipitation occur in all seasons in most areas. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and an occasional tropical storm. [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The city experiences the most prominent difference among seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One reason for that is the highest latitude, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] There is a major concern involving the South of Brazil and its proximity to Antarctica. The population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high UV radiation.
The winter is mild, windy, and quite changeable, which is also a feature of this time of the year. Usual winter temperatures range from [tpl]convert|4|°C|°F[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|16|°C|°F[/tpl]. In the coldest days of the year the temperature may fall slightly below zero, like in 2012, when it recorded [tpl]convert|-3|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.accuweather.com/pt/br/porto-alegre/45561/month/45561?monyr=6/01/2012 Snow is very rare, sometimes confused with sleet. [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The only snowfall events in Porto Alegre were in 1879, 1910, 1984, 1994, 2000 and 2006, albeit few of them with accumulation. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Fall tends to be as changeable as winter, but is typically warmer. Spring, stabler akin to summer, is slightly drier than all the other seasons. Occurrence of radiation fog is common, causing several delays in early flights. Unlike other large Brazilian cities much farther north, notably Brasília, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro who observe a pronounced summer maximum in precipitation amounts, the city of Porto Alegre experiences a prominent winter maximum in precipitation values and cloud cover, for the summer season is primarily hot and dry; though evidently high humidity levels often give a distinct mugginess to the air and negatively impacts air quality. Annually Porto Alegre receives an average-total precipitation amount of [tpl]convert|1,348|mm|in[/tpl]. This average makes the city slightly wetter than Rio at [tpl]convert|1,172|mm|in[/tpl] yet, to a considerable extent, drier than both São Paulo at [tpl]convert|1,457|mm|in[/tpl] and Brasilia at [tpl]convert|1,557|mm|in[/tpl].

===Vegetation===

Porto Alegre lies in a transitional area between the subtropical forest and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established here to protect native trees. Many of the city's avenues have been planted with different tree species. One striking example of this is Teresópolis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found here. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: "Delta do Jacuí" (Jacuí Delta) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reservas.net/alojamiento_hoteles/portoalegre_brazil.htm |title=Vegetation in Porto Alegre |publisher=Reservas.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
The urban area has many parks and plazas, making Porto Alegre one of the greenest provincial capitals in Brazil. The first city squares date from the second half of the 18th century and were originally large public spaces used as food markets. The city has [tpl]convert|39|km2|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] of green space, occupying 31 percent of the city's area. This is an average of 17.6 m² per person. More than one million trees line the public streets and SMAM plants an average of 30,000 seedlings each year. The four main parks are: Parque Farroupilha, a [tpl]convert|37|ha|acre|adj=on[/tpl] park; Jardim Botânico (The Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre), with some 725 species of vegetation on about [tpl]convert|43|ha|acre[/tpl] of land; and Parque Marinha do Brasil (The Brazilian Navy's Park), a vast park of more than [tpl]convert|70|ha|acre[/tpl] which offers a wide variety of sports fields and tracks. The city's cycleway is called the Caminho dos Parques, which at over [tpl]convert|5|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] long links the Moinhos do Vento, Farroupilha and Guaíba shore parks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Green areas in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]

===Water===

Sewer service is available to 84 percent of the city, and with 99.5 percent of the population serviced by treated water. [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Water system in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approves US$ 83.2 million to support the Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre. The program will be carried out by the Municipal Department of Management and Strategic Support and will focus on: Improving water quality in Guaíba Lake and the Cavalhada River; Developing urban infrastructure to reduce flood risk along the Cavalhada River; Improving the environmental management in the Municipality of Porto Alegre; and Promoting efficient municipal water, sanitation and storm drainage services. This program will improve the quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Guaíba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Water+Resources/articles/22/Improving+Environmental+Quality+Porto+Alegre |title=Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre |publisher=Zimbio.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]

===Air quality===

Motor vehicles are responsible for up to 80 percent of the main atmospheric pollutant emissions. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] In the last 40 years, the population of the city has doubled and the number of cars has multiplied 22 times, about one vehicle for every two inhabitants. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time. SMAM (the Municipal Council of the Environment) has encouraged the use of the cleanest fuels and has played a role in monitoring pollution levels.
A partnership between SMAM, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, the State Environmental Protection Foundation (FEPAM) and Petrobrás has created a network of five air monitoring stations in Porto Alegre. By utilizing a Petrobrás product called city diesel, sulphur levels in the air have dropped from 1.2 percent in 1989 to 0.5 percent. Hybrid buses which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of natural gas, the city's taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Air quality in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]

Porto Alegre is mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. Its colonization started in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. From 1748 to 1756, 2,300 Azoreans were sent to the region by the King of Portugal to protect Southern Brazil from neighboring invaders.[tpl]cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao3.htm |title=Portuguese and Azorian Portuguese in Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] These colonists, mostly composed of married couples, established the city of Porto dos Casais (literally translated "harbor of the couples"), nowadays Porto Alegre. In 1775, 55% of Rio Grande do Sul's population was of Azorean Portuguese origin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atlasesportebrasil.org.br/textos/229.pdf |title=Azorean Portuguese origin in Porto Alegre |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Porto Alegre was composed mainly of Azoreans and their African slaves until the first half of the 19th century.
The first non-Portuguese people to settle Rio Grande do Sul were German immigrants. In 1824, the first immigrants from Germany arrived in Porto Alegre, but they were sent to what is now the city of São Leopoldo ([tpl]convert|28|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] away). From 1824 to 1914, 50 thousand Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul.[tpl]cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao4c.htm |title=German colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Most of these colonists had rural communities in the countryside of the State as their first destination. The large rural exodus in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many German-descendants to Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose a large percentage of the population.Germans from the interior of the state in Porto Alegre[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the Italians. They started immigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian Veneto region.[tpl]cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao5b.htm |title=Italian colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] As the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the Serra Gaúcha region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre.  Minority communities of immigrants, such as Central Europeans from PolandPolish Brazilian in Porto Alegre and Eastern Europeans from Ukraine; Arabs from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria; Asians from Japan and Jews also made Porto Alegre their home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/default.php?p_secao=16 |title=Japanese Brazilian in Porto Alegre |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/judeusul.html |title=Jew Brazilian in Porto Alegre |publisher=Terrabrasileira.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, the ancestral composition of the population of Porto Alegre is: 77,70% European, 12,70% African and 9,60% Native American.http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017063

The third edition attracted 20,763 delegates from 130 countries, with a total audience of 100,000 people from all parts of the world According to Oded Grajew, one of the mentors of the Forum, the initiative sought to denounce the risks of the neoliberal model. The events inspired the creation of similar movements in different countries, and many patrons of the WSF since its inception are now presidents of their countries and occupy important positions in government. The 10th edition of the WSF was also held in Porto Alegre, focusing their discussions on the reflection on the results achieved so far. The conclusions, however, been controversial. In the opposite direction, another important event is the Freedom Forum, held annually since 1988 and has the goal of finding alternative viable objective and solve problems for Brazilians, the defending liberal or neoliberal line.

The first full participatory budgeting process was developed in the city starting in 1989. Participatory budgeting in its most meaningful form took place in the city from 1991 to 2004.Baiocchi, Gianpaolo and Ernesto Ganuza. "Participatory budgeting as if emancipation mattered". In Politics and Society, Vol. 42, No 1, 2014. pp. 29-50 Participatory budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city's residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools).Worldbank.org
Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre occurred annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement. Porto Alegre spent about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, this money is subject to participatory budgeting. Annual spending on fixed expenses such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre took part at the peak of the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants having grown year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.[tpl]cite web|last=Lewit |first=David |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title=Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People by David Lewit |publisher=Yesmagazine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]Baiocchi, in http://www.versobooks.com/books/169-deepening-democracy Although participatory budgeting appears to continue in the city today, two prominent scholars on the process have stated that "after the defeat of the Workers' Party in late 2004, a politically conservative coalition maintained the surface features of PB while returning the actual functioning of the administration to more traditional modes of favor-trading and the favoring of local elites."
The participatory budgeting cycle started in January and ran along the year in many assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts, dealing with many areas of interest to urban life. The meetings elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following month's delegates meet to review technical project criteria and district needs.
City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget. The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).
A World Bank paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, sewer and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986. According to Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy for the establishment of an active citizenship in Brazil. The distribution of investment resources planning that follows a part of the statement of priorities for regional or thematic meetings, culminating with the approval of an investment plan that works and activities program broken down by investment sector, by region and around the city. Also according to Fedozzi, this favors:Fedozzi, Luciano. "Esfera pública e cidadania: a experiência do Orçamento Participativo de Porto Alegre". In: Ensaios FEE. Porto Alegre, Vol. 19, No 2, 1998. pp. 237; 256Costa, Giseli Paim. "Um Estudo sobre Cidadania e Políticas Públicas em Porto Alegre". In: Revista Brasileira de Gestão e Desenvolvimento Regional. Vol. 3, n. 4 (número especial), nov/2007. p. 78
The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).

===Energy===

In Brazil, there are also a few coal-fired plants, fuel-oil fired plants and one nuclear facility. Increased utilization of natural gas and other sources is planned in order to reduce Brazil's overdependence on hydroelectric power. In 1999, a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil was completed, with its terminus in Porto Alegre.

===Recycling===

Porto Alegre was one of the first cities in Brazil to develop a recycling program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the country.Recucling - Porto Alegre [tpl]en icon[/tpl] Since 1990, household waste already separated by residents has been collected in all neighbourhoods on a weekly basis. The city produces about 900 tonnes of household waste per day. Waste is sorted in recycling units, which are large sheds containing crates for the unsorted waste and benches for manual sorting. Once sorted, the waste is compressed and baled up to be sold as raw material to recycling factories. The units are managed by autonomous cooperatives with directors elected every two years. Organic waste is used to generate thermal energy and to make compost. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Recycling program in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]

There are two federal highways in the city, BR-290 and BR-116, both running close to its northern and northwestern border. The small number is due to the inexistence of many destinations southeast or south of Porto Alegre (considering the landmass east of Lagoa dos Patos),Villaça, Flávio. Espaço intra-urbano no Brasil. Studio Nobel, 1998, pp. 103-105 if not for the cities of Pelotas (the third-biggest in population in the State) and Rio Grande (which hosts the State biggest port). Nonetheless, when coming from west, both highways bond in the neighbor municipality of Eldorado do Sul, running mostly jointly within the borders of Porto Alegre, only coming to separate at the very interchange to Canoas. This way, BR-116 has virtually no sole run within Porto Alegre.
BR-290 highway runs east-west across the state, linking the northeast coast of the state to the Uruguay–Argentina–Brazil border. It runs close to the northern border of the municipality. Coming from west, as it reaches the urban area of Porto Alegre, BR-290 highway becomes a high-standard [tpl]convert|100|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long freeway that connects to the coast and to the BR-101 highway. The latter is an important way to get to Porto Alegre from the north of the country, by the city Osório. BR-101 connects to Curitiba, Florianópolis and northern Santa Catarina state, and has been recently upgraded to highway standards, with multiple lanes. By entering the BR-290 freeway/BR-101 system, and the other highways it connects to, it is possible to drive from Porto Alegre to as far as Rio de Janeiro or Belo Horizonte almost entirely through 4-lane (or more) highways.
The other road, BR-116, is a longitudinal highway, running northeast-south across the state, linking Porto Alegre to several satellite cities and other Brazilian capitals to the north, and Pelotas and Uruguay to the south. Within the municipality, it only touches the northwest side of the city, close to the end of Rio Gravataí (Gravataí River), sharing its entire run with BR-290, only separating when heading north onto Canoas.
A third road, BR-448, is currently under construction.http://www.br448rodoviadoparque.com.br BR-448 is planned to connect the northeast of Porto Alegre to Sapucaia do Sul, as an alternative to BR-116, notably jam-packed on its Canoas-Novo Hamburgo stretch during traffic rush hours.
The connection between downtown Porto Alegre and the highways is made by Avenida Presidente Castelo Branco (President Castelo Branco Avenue), which is a short - [tpl]convert|4|km|mi[/tpl] - avenue also bordering the northwest side of the city, Avenida dos Estados (States' Avenue), which is the access way to the Salgado Filho International Airport, and Avenida Assis Brasil (Assis Brasil Avenue), the main Avenue in the northern Porto Alegre.

===Bus===

The city has a functioning transportation system, especially the autobuses. Porto Alegre has also mini-buses from and to all the main neighborhoods in the city, with sitting-only transport and possibility to hop on and off at any point, but higher fares. Linha Turística (Tourist Line) is a bus that leaves from Usina do Gasômetro tourist terminal around six times per day. During 90 minutes, it traverses the various districts of Porto Alegre, for a modest price.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Brazil/Estado_do_Rio_Grande_do_Sul/Porto_Alegre-1506259/Transportation-Porto_Alegre-BR-1.html |title=Bus in Porto Alegre |publisher=Virtualtourist.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Exclusive bus lanes in the median of seven radial corridors that converge on the city center are used by both urban and regional lines. The bus fleet totals 1,600, with 150 minibuses. About 325 million people use the system annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Bus System in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
Those lines have no prefix. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but, considering there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal to hop on the next bus. Transversal lines prefix "T" (T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different neighborhood without going through the downtown area, effectively eliminating the need of changing buses for the most common trips. Circular lines prefix "C" (C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Buses |title=Bus destines of the city |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
Mayor José Fogaça renewed his agreement with EMBARQ and the Center for Sustainable Transport Brazil (CTS-Brasil) to improve accessibility and mobility in downtown Porto Alegre. The agreement, signed on March 11, includes a new partnership with the Andean Development Corporation, a Latin American multilateral financial institution that is expected to provide $1 million in non-reimbursable technical assistance this year to help Porto Alegre complete the preparation phase of the "Portais da Cidade" bus rapid transit project, a groundbreaking transport system designed to reduce pollution and congestion downtown. The system will include a southern extension to accommodate activities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. CAF's technical assistance will be administered through CTS-Brasil, which has been working to expand sustainable transport in Porto Alegre since 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.embarq.org/en/news/09/03/11/porto-alegre-revitalize-downtown-through-sustainable-transport |title=Bus Transport Project – Porto Alegre |publisher=Embarq.org |date=2009-03-11 |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
Porto Alegre Bus station is located downtown, and is served by several national and international lines. It is also connected to a Trensurb station (Porto Alegre Metro) and several municipal bus lines. Northbound passengers can rely on good bus connections throughout Brazil. However, an express bus might be recommended if traveling to Uruguay or Argentina in order to avoid several stops while en route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Bus Station – Porto Alegre – Facts |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
