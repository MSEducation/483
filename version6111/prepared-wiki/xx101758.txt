[[Industrial award]]

CATEGORIES: Australian labour law, Industrial agreements

An award is a ruling handed down by either Fair Work New Zealand or by a state industrial relations commission which grants all wage earners in one industry or occupation the same minimum conditions of employment and wages.  
Federal awards in Australia have been stripped back in recent years in what they are allowed to contain in order to promote the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement system.  Awards in Australia are part of the system of compulsory arbitration in industrial relations.
A similar system was also used in New Zealand prior to the 1987 Labour Relations Act. New Zealand no longer uses the award system, and the only form of collective bargaining is Collective Employment Agreements, which only apply to the particular unions and employers that negotiate them.
