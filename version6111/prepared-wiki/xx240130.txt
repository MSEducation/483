Bajraku (plural Bajrakut) was a military unit and later an administrative land division created in some provinces of historical Albania which also included what is today Kosovo. It was a patriarchal organization, similar to a commune or small district today.
The Bajrakut of Oštrozub was one of the largest of Kosovo and Albania.
