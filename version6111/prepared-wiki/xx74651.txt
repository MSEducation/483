The Triumph TR6 (1969–76) is a British six-cylinder sports car and the best-seller of the TR range built by Triumph when production ended in July 1976. This record was then surpassed by the TR7. Of the 94,619 TR6s produced, 86,249 were exported; only 8,370 were sold in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vtr.org/TR6/TR6-history.shtml|title=A History of the TR6 |accessdate=2010-10-11|author=vtr.org[/tpl]
The bodywork closely resembled that of the previous model, the Triumph TR5, but the front and back ends were squared off, reportedly based on a consultancy contract involving Karmann. This is referred to as a Kamm tail, which was very common during 1970s era of cars and a feature on most Triumphs. The body shape was similar to the TR4/TR5 except for the rear and front.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = |title = Autotest: Triumph TR6 PI | series = 130| journal = Autocar | volume =(nbr3818) | pages =pages 2–6 "... so Karmann Ghia were consulted for a quick rejuvenating process, and the result is a kind of smoothed out TR with fashionable and effective use of matte black for the radiator grill and undercut tail panel".| date = 17 April 1969[/tpl]
All TR6 sports cars featured inline six-cylinder engines. For the US market the engine was carburetted, as had been the US-only TR250 engine. Like the TR5, the TR6 was fuel-injected for other world markets including the United Kingdom, hence the TR6PI (petrol-injection) designation. The Lucas mechanical fuel injection system helped the home-market TR6 produce [tpl]convert|150|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] (145 hp DIN) at model introduction. Later the non-US TR6 variant was detuned to [tpl]convert|125|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] in order for it to be easier to drive,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] while the US variant continued to be carburetted with a mere (but more reliable[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]) [tpl]convert|104|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The TR6 featured a four-speed manual transmission. An optional overdrive unit was a desirable feature because it gave drivers close gearing for aggressive driving with an electrically switched overdrive which could operate on 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears on early models and 3rd and 4th on later models because of constant gearbox failures in 2nd at high revs. Both provided "long legs" for open motorways. TR6 also featured semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, [tpl]convert|15|in|adj=on[/tpl] wheels and tires, pile carpet on floors and trunk/boot, bucket seats, and a full complement of instrumentation. Braking was accomplished by disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear.  A factory steel hardtop was optional, requiring two people to fit it. TR6 construction was fundamentally old-fashioned: the body was bolted onto a frame instead of the two being integrated into a unibody structure; the TR6 dashboard was wooden (plywood w/ veneer). Other factory options included a rear anti-roll bar and a limited slip differential.
The UK version TR6PI could accelerate from zero to [tpl]convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 8.2 seconds and had a top speed of [tpl]convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] according to Autocar magazine.Autocar, full road test 1969
As of Q1 2011 there were approximately 2723 licensed and 1320 SORN TR6s registered with the DVLA in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/vehicle/triumph_tr6 |title=How Many Left web site |publisher=www.howmanyleft.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/licensing/ |title=Vehicle licensing statistics |publisher=Department of Transport |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl]
Some say that the car is one of Leyland's best achievements, but there were and remain a number of issues because of poor design. These issues include a low level radiator top-up bottle and a poor hand-brake. As is the case with other cars of the era, the TR6 can suffer from rust issues, although surviving examples tend to be well-cared for.  The TR6 can be prone to overheating. Many owners fit an aftermarket electric radiator fan to supplement or replace the original engine-driven fan. There is also the Leyland factory option of an oil cooler. Parts and services to support ownership of a TR6 are readily available and there are a number of classic car owners' clubs that cater for the model.
