The Bridge in West Earl Township, as it is designated on the National Register of Historic Places, is also known by its historic name, Big Conestoga Creek Bridge No. 12. It carries Farmersville Road (unsigned SR 1010) across the Conestoga River at Brownstown, West Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The bridge is notable for its form, a three-span, continuous, arched concrete girder that does not touch the abutments. Designer Frank H. Shaw was a consulting engineer to Lancaster County when the bridge was constructed in 1917, but appointed county engineer that same year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/pa/pa3600/pa3671/data/pa3671data.pdf |title=Big Conestoga Creek Bridge No. 12 |last=Spivey |first=Justin M. |date=August 1998 |website=Historic American Engineering Record |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |page=2 |accessdate=February 1, 2014[/tpl]
