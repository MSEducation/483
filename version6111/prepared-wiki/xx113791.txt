Everything Bad & Beautiful is the name of a live stage show and album performed/recorded by singer/comedian/actress Sandra Bernhard. The show ran in 2006 in New York City at the Daryl Roth Theater.http://www.sandrabernhard.com/ In the performance Bernhard does what she is best known for: she rips apart celebrity culture while commenting on events of the time. Among the topics she addresses: Britney Spears, Laura Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Bob Dylan, Mariah Carey, golf and the war on terror.
The album, released in 2006, is a live recording of her one-woman show by the same name; it combines comedic monologues and musical performances. It was released by Breaking Records and was originally sold through the website and in the lobby of the live show. Unlike the majority of her other CD releases, it was a professionally manufactured CD and not a home-made CD-R. 
In 2007 the label acquired a distribution deal for the album and a re-released version with an alternate track listing was released. It has slightly alternate artwork (only "one Sandra" appears on the cover instead of 3) and features bonus digital video content.
Most of the songs on the CD are covers of other people's songs. They include Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott, Lita Ford, Vanity 6, Sheila E., Bob Dylan, Pink and Prince.
