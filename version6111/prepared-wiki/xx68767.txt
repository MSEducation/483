The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is the government department responsible for environmental protection, food production and standards, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in the United Kingdom. Concordats set out agreed frameworks for co-operation between it and the Scottish Government,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/concord.htm|title=Concordat between MAFF and the Scottish Executive[/tpl] Welsh Government[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/walesconc.htm|title=Concordat between MAFF and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales[/tpl] and  Northern Ireland Executive,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/devolve/fishconc.htm|title=Devolution: Subject specific Concordat between MAFF and the Scottish Executive on fisheries[/tpl] which have devolved responsibilities for these matters in their respective nations. Defra also leads for Britain at the EU on agricultural, fisheries and environment matters and in other international negotiations on sustainable development and climate change, although a new Department of Energy and Climate Change was created on 3 October 2008 to take over the last responsibility.
DEFRA has recently been involved in controversial trial badger culls in two areas of England in North Somerset and Gloucestershire.
As of the reshuffle of 7 October 2013, the department has not had a Minister of State  following the return of David Heath to the backbenches, his replacement Dan Rogerson only having the rank of Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.[tpl]cite web|url=http://farmersguardian.com/home/latest-news/heath-sacked-as-two-cornish-mps-appointed-as-defra-ministers/59219.article|title=Heath shuffled aside to make way for more Lib Dems[/tpl]

==Creation==

It was formed in June 2001 under the leadership of Margaret Beckett, when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was merged with part of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) and with a small part of the Home Office. The department was created after the perceived failure of MAFF to deal adequately with an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease. The Department had about 9 000 core personnel, [tpl]As of|2008|alt=as of January 2008[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/2007/chapter11.pdf|title=Defra departmental report[/tpl] The Department's main building is Nobel House on Smith Square, SW1.
In October 2008, the climate team at Defra was merged with the energy team from the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) to create the Department of Energy and Climate Change, then headed by Ed Miliband.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7651795.stm|title= Marrying energy demand and supply|last=Harrabin  |first=Roger |date=3 October 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl]
