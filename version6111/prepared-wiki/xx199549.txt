Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) is the first Aladura Pentecostal church present in Nigeria and other countries. It has come into existence in the first half of the
20th century, in the then-British empire. It was formally established in 1941 after a split from the Apostolic Church which the original Aladura organization (Faith Tabernacle) had invited to Nigeria. Its growth was led by Joseph Ayo Babalola, a road construction driver who became its founder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatrevivals.com |title=Great Revivalist |publisher=Great Revivals |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl]
The revival led by Babalola resulted in thousands burning their traditional fetishes. This disturbed the colonial authorities, and allegations included witch-hunting and opposition to hospitals and medicine. Babalola was arrested and jailed.
It operates secondary schools in Nigeria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/nigeria/babalola1_joseph.html |title=Babalola, Joseph Ayo, Nigeria/Ghana, Christ Apostolic Church (Aladura) |publisher=Dacb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl] The countries with presence of the Christ Apostolic Church include the
