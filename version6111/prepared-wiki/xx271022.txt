The Castro of Cidadelhe ([tpl]lang-pt|Castro de Cidadelhe[/tpl]) is a Portuguese castro in civil parish of Cidadelhe, in the municipality of Mesão Frio. 

==History==

Cidadelhe was a fortified settlement of a proto-historic nature, later occupied by Roman and Medieval residents.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3670 |title=Castro de Cidadelhe (IPA.00003670/PT011704020006) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico|editor=SIPA|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese |first=Isabel |last=Sereno |first2=Ricardo |last2=Teixeira 1993 |accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl] 
The settlement belonged to a medieval administrative territory conforming to a Suevic parish, with a royal congregation under the order of Ordoño II of León and part of the territory of Portucale (during the second year of his reign, in 911).

==Architecture==

The castro is located in an isolated rural environment on a hilltop.
Two lines of walls encircle the castle and roadways/paths, composed of schist rock. In the interior of the ruins are several remains of residences, of a circular design, excavated by recent archaeologists. 
Archaeological excavations under the direction of A. Coelho, F. da Silva, A. Baptista Lopes and Manuel Tuna, were attempted into two sectors: one elevated zone, defined by the first series of walls; and the second, lower, new the second series walls.
