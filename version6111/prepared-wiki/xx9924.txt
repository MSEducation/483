The People's Republic of China has been a strong vocal and avid supporter of Pakistan's nuclear power generation programme from early on. In 2005, both Pakistan government and the Chinese government adopted an Energy Security Plan, calling for a huge increase in generating capacity to more than 160,000 MWe by 2030. Pakistan Government plans for lifting nuclear capacity to 8800 MWe, 900 MWe of it by 2015 and a further 1500 MWe by 2020.[ref]

In June 2008, the Pakistani Government announced plans to build commercial nuclear power plants III and IV commercial nuclear power plants at Chashma, Punjab Province, each with 320–340 MWe and costing PKR 129 billion, 80 billion of this from international sources, principally China.  A further agreement for China's help with the project was signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the US–India agreement shortly preceding it. Cost quoted then was US$ 1.7 billion, with a foreign loan component of $1.07 billion.

After Islam, Hinduism and Christianity are the largest religions in Pakistan, with 2,800,000 (1.6%) adherents each in 2005. They are followed by the Bahá'í Faith, which has a following of 30,000, then Sikhism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism, each claiming 20,000 adherents, and a very small community of Jains. The majority of the Pakistani Christian communities is constituted by converts from the low caste Hindus from Punjab region, from the British colonial era. The community is geographically spread throughout the Punjab province, whilst its presence in the rest of the provinces is mostly confined to the urban centers. There is a Roman Catholic community in Karachi which was established by Goan and Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure was being developed by the British during colonial administration between World War I and II.

Pakistani fashion has flourished well in the changing environment of fashion world. Since Pakistan came into being its fashion has been historically evolved from different phases and made its unique identity apart from Indian fashion and culture. At this time, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dresses and it has become the cultural identification of Pakistan. Despite of all modern trends, the regional and traditional dresses have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition. This regional fashion is not static but evolving into more modern and pure forms.

After having been liberalised in 2002, the television sector experienced a media boom. In the fierce competitive environment that followed commercial interests became paramount and quality journalism gave way to sensationalism. Although the radio sector has not seen similar growth, independent radio channels are numerous and considered very important sources of information – especially in the rural areas. More than 89 television channels beam soaps, satire, music programmes, films, religious speech, political talk shows, and news of the hour. Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing corruption. Christine Fair, a senior political analyst and specialist in South Asian political and military affairs at the Rand Corporation praised the Pakistani Media as a role model and an example for other Muslim countries to follow by stating "The only hope for Pakistanis is that the media will continue to mobilise people. The media have done a great job, even if they are at times very unprofessional, and have to come to term with the limits between journalism and political engagement.""[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.i-m-s.dk/files/publications/1491%20Pakistan.final.web.pdf |format=PDF |title=[tpl]as written|Between radicalisation and democratisation in an unfolding conflict: Media in Pakistan[/tpl] |publisher=International Media Support |date=July 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl]

===Urbanisation===

Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city. In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.
Immigration, both from within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors that has contributed to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 Pakistan Census highlighted the significance of the Partition of India in the 1940s in the context of understanding urban change in Pakistan.[tpl]cite book|last=Clark|first=David|title=The Elgar Companion to Development Studies|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1843764755|page=668[/tpl] During the independence period, Muslim Muhajirs from India migrated in large numbers and shifted their domicile to Pakistan, especially to the port city of Karachi, which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan.
Migration from other countries, mainly those in the neighbourhood, has further catalysed the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Of particular interest is migration that occurred in the aftermath of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, in the form of stranded Biharis who were relocated to Pakistan. Smaller numbers of Bengalis and Burmese immigrants followed suit much later. The Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern regions. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also brought new political and socio-economic complexities. In addition to immigration, economic events such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important causes of urbanisation.

===Diaspora===

The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognized by the Government of Pakistan. The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis was established in 2008 to exclusively deal with all the matters and affairs of the overseas Pakistanis such as attending to their needs and problems, intending schemes and projects for their welfare and working for resolution of their problems and issues. Overseas Pakistani workers are the second largest source of Foreign Exchange Remittances to Pakistan after exports and over the last several years, the foreign exchange remittances have maintained a steady rising trend, with a recorded increase of 21.8% from $6.4 million in 2007–08 to $7.8 million during 2008–09.
In 2009–10, Pakistanis sent home US$9.4 billion, the eleventh-largest total remittance in the world. By 2012, Pakistan increased its ranking to tenth in the world for remittances with a total sum of US$13 billion. The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the Ministry of Labour and Manpower, and has since recognized the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy. Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is improving the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad.

Pakistan has literature in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pushto, Baluchi, Persian, English and many other languages.[tpl]cite book|author=Alamgir Hashmi|editor=Radhika Mohanram|others=Gita Rajan|title=English postcoloniality: literatures from around the world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H_uwA78YZDoC&pg=PA107|accessdate=2 January 2012|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28854-8|pages=107–112[/tpl] Before the 19th century it consisted mainly of lyric and religious poetry, mystical and folkloric works. During the colonial age, native literary figures influenced by western literary realism took up increasingly varied topics and narrative forms. Prose fiction is now very popular.[tpl]cite web|author=Gilani Kamran|title=Pakistani Literature – Evolution & trends|url=http://www.the-south-asian.com/Jan2002/Pakistani-Literature3-the-Novel.htm|publisher=the-south-asian magzine|date=January 2002|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Huma Imtiaz|title=Granta: The global reach of Pakistani literature|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/53272/granta-the-global-reach-of-pakistani-literature/|work=The Express Tribune|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl]

===Architecture===

Pakistani architecture has four recognised periods: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial and post-colonial. With the beginning of the Indus civilisation around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE,[tpl]cite web|author=Vidja Dehejia|title=South Asian Art and Culture|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sasa/hd_sasa.htm|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 February 2008[/tpl] an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day.[tpl]cite web|title=The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization|url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm|work=History World International|accessdate=6 February 2008[/tpl] Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions. The rise of Buddhism and the Persian and Greek influence led to the development of the Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was reached at the peak of the Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[tpl]cite web|title=UNESCO Advisory Body Evaluation of Takht Bhai|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/140.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites|date=29 December 1979|pages=1–2|accessdate=25 July 2010 [/tpl]
The arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture. The most important Persian-style building still standing is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the Badshahi mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, Persian-style Wazir Khan Mosque, the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore and the Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta. In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the Faisal Mosque, the Minar-e-Pakistan and the Mazar-e-Quaid.[tpl]cite book|author=Kamil Khan Mumtaz|title=Architecture in Pakistan|year=1985|publisher=Concept Media Pte Ltd|isbn=9971-84-141-X|pages=32,51,160[/tpl]

===Food and drink===

Although being part of South Asia, Pakistani cuisine has some similarities with different regions of the Indian subcontinent, originating from the royal kitchens of sixteenth-century Mughal emperors. Pakistan has a greater variety of meat dishes compared to the rest of the sub-continent and most of those dishes have their roots in Central Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine.  Pakistani cooking uses large quantities of spices, herbs and seasoning. Garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chilli and garam masala are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry. Chapati, a thin flat bread made from wheat, is a staple food, served with curry, meat, vegetables and lentils. Rice is also common; it is served plain or fried with spices and is also used in sweet dishes.[tpl]cite book|author=Yasmeen Niaz Mohiuddin|title=Pakistan: a global studies handbook|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO [tpl]![/tpl]|isbn=1-85109-801-1|pages=3, 317, 323–324[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Kathleen W.

Pakistan were runners-up in the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa and won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England.
