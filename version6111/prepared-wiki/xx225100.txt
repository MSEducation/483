Nonabine (BRL-4664) is a drug which is a cannabinoid derivative, which was developed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.Staquet M, Bron D, Rozencweig M, Kenis Y. Clinical studies with a THC analog (BRL-4664) in the prevention of cisplatin-induced vomiting. Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. 1981 Aug-Sep;21(8-9 Suppl):60S-63S. PMID 7197692 It has strong antiemetic effects equivalent to those of chlorpromazine, and also produces some mild sedative effects, along with dry mouth and EEG changes typical of cannabinoid agonists, but with minimal changes in mood or perception, suggesting the abuse potential is likely to be low.Archer CB, Amlot PL, Trounce JR.
