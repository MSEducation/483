Quidenham Hall is a country house at Quidenham in Norfolk.

==History==

A manor house is known to have existed on the site as far back as the year 1000; it passed to the Bedingfeld family around 1400.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quidenhamcarmel.org.uk/quidenham_history.php|title=Quidenham in History|publisher=Carmelite Monastery, Quidenham|accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] In 1572 the manor was bought by John Holland, a local Member of Parliament. The present house dates to around 1600 when John's son, Thomas, started building it. The East Wing and West portico were added later by John Bristow. The house remained in the Holland family until around 1800 when it was bought by George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle: it then passed down the Keppel family. It was regularly visited by Edward VII in the early years of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quidenham.org/history.htm|title=The History of Quidenham Parish |publisher=Quidenham Parish Council|accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] In 1948 the house was acquired from the Keppel family by the Carmelites of Rushmere who have re-established it as a Carmelite nunnery and hospice for sick children.
