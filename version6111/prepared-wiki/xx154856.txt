==About==

The Keirle House was built by the founder and owner of the Keirle Ice Company, which cut its ice from the Florence Water Works and shipped them across the Midwest for top price. Its four bedrooms occupy a small estate in the middle of Florence.
The Florence Historical Foundation restored this house in 1996 after the death of Maude Keirle, the last member of the only family that ever lived there. Built with a variety of styles, the Keirle House is a Midwest "classic box" with Queen Anne and classical revival details. It was built to face the town square of Winter Quarters, which the Mormons originally laid out in 1846.
Until February 2011, the House previously served as offices for the Uta Halee Girls Village executive offices.[tpl]cite news|title=Old House May Lose Landmark Tag|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20111107/NEWS01/711079885|accessdate=10 November 2011|newspaper=Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, NE, USA|date=November 7, 2011[/tpl]
On November 9, 2011, Omaha's Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission voted to delay a vote indefinitely on removing the House's historic landmark designation.[tpl]cite news|title=Florence Home Still A Landmark, For Now|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, NE, USA|date=November 10, 2011[/tpl]  The owners of the home had requested the designation be removed to ease the property's sale.
On March 9, 2012, the Keirle House was purchased by Robert and Kristina Mitchell for the purchase price of $110,000.  Robert and Kristina will use the house as their primary residence.  The House remains on Omaha's Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission registry.
