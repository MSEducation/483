The first book revolves around Billy, a young skeleton boy who lives in a secrets-closet with his parents, Lars and Decette Bones. It is the job of these secrets keepers to archive the Biglum family’s lies, fibs, and secrets. Not an easy task, as each family whopper is more despicable than the last. Struggling against unearthly creatures and an unfriendly Afterlife government, Billy and an orphaned girl named Millicent must sort out a number of mysteries—the biggest being their own. Billy discovers that not all Biglums are horrible, because he happens to be one himself and Millicent is his real life niece. The two supernatural sleuths also discover that Mr. and Mrs. Bones have some dark secrets of their own. The two kindly skeletons broke Afterlife rules by adopting Billy. Billy’s skeleton uncle, the Grim Reaper, tries to straighten things out but only makes matters worse by un-murdering the boy, thereby breaking even more of the many Afterlife rules. In an explosive conclusion, Billy and Millicent save the day by exposing the Biglum secrets to the Light of Truth, and then capture a particularly nasty Afterlife official, who wrongfully imprisoned Billy’s skeleton parents.
