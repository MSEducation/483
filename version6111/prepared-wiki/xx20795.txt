Sound spectrum is one of the determinants of the timbre or quality of a sound or note. It is the relative strength of pitches called harmonics and partials (collectively overtones) at various frequencies usually above the fundamental frequency, which is the actual note named (e.g. an A).
The spectrum analyzer is an instrument which can be used to convert the sound wave of the musical note into a visual display of the constituent frequencies.  This visual display is referred to as an acoustic spectrogram. Software based audio spectrum analyzers are available at low cost, providing easy access not only to industry professionals, but also to academics, students and the hobbyist.  The acoustic spectrogram generated by the spectrum analyzer provides an acoustic signature of the musical note.  In addition to revealing the fundamental frequency and its overtones, the spectrogram is also useful for analysis of the temporal attack, decay, sustain, and release of the musical note.

==Radio==

In radio and telecommunications, the frequency spectrum can be shared among many different broadcasters.  Each broadcast radio and TV station transmits a wave on an assigned frequency range, called a channel.  When many broadcasters are present, the radio spectrum consists of the sum of all the individual channels, each carrying separate information, spread across a wide frequency spectrum.  Any particular radio receiver will detect a single function of amplitude (voltage) vs. time.  The radio then uses a tuned circuit or tuner to select a single channel or frequency band and demodulate or decode the information from that broadcaster.  If we made a graph of the strength of each channel vs. the frequency of the tuner, it would be the frequency spectrum of the antenna signal.

==Spectrum analysis==

Spectrum analysis, also referred to as frequency domain analysis or spectral density estimation, is the technical process of decomposing a complex signal into simpler parts. As described above, many physical processes are best described as a sum of many individual frequency components.  Any process that quantifies the various amounts (e.g. amplitudes, powers, intensities, or phases), versus frequency can be called spectrum analysis.
The Fourier transform of a function produces a frequency spectrum which contains all of the information about the original signal, but in a different form.  This means that the original function can be completely reconstructed (synthesized) by an inverse Fourier transform.  For perfect reconstruction, the spectrum analyzer must preserve both the amplitude and phase of each frequency component.  These two pieces of information can be represented as a 2-dimensional vector, as a complex number, or as magnitude (amplitude) and phase in polar coordinates.  A common technique in signal processing is to consider the squared amplitude, or power; in this case the resulting plot is referred to as a power spectrum.
In practice, nearly all software and electronic devices that generate frequency spectra apply a fast Fourier transform (FFT), which is a specific mathematical approximation to the full integral solution.  Formally stated, the FFT is a method for computing the discrete Fourier transform of a sampled signal.
Because of reversibility, the Fourier transform is called a representation of the function, in terms of frequency instead of time; thus, it is a frequency domain representation.  Linear operations that could be performed in the time domain have counterparts that can often be performed more easily in the frequency domain.  Frequency analysis also simplifies the understanding and interpretation of the effects of various time-domain operations, both linear and non-linear.  For instance, only non-linear or time-variant operations can create new frequencies in the frequency spectrum.
The Fourier transform of a stochastic (random) waveform (noise) is also random.  Some kind of averaging is required in order to create a clear picture of the underlying frequency content (frequency distribution).  Typically, the data is divided into time-segments of a chosen duration, and transforms are performed on each one.  Then the magnitude or (usually) squared-magnitude components of the transforms are summed into an average transform.  This is a very common operation performed on digitally sampled time-domain data, using the discrete Fourier transform.  This type of processing is called Welch's method.  When the result is flat, it is commonly referred to as white noise.  However, such processing techniques often reveal spectral content even among data which appears noisy in the time domain.
