The Chillicothe Paints are a collegiate summer baseball team based in Chillicothe, Ohio, in the United States. The team is a member of the summer collegiate Prospect League.

==Team history==

The Paints played in the independent Frontier League from the 1993 season until the end of the 2008 season. They were one of the original teams in the league. The Paints play their home games at V.A. Memorial Stadium.
The Paints were the longest tenured franchise in the Frontier League to date. They reached the Frontier League Championship Series on six occasions (1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2006). However, they never were able to claim a Frontier League championship win. 
In 2005, the Paints set a team record by drawing over 8,500 fans. 
V.A. Memorial Stadium had grass from 1993-2005. The ballpark installed FieldTurf in 2006.
Following the 2008 season, the ownership announced that they would leave the Frontier League,  becoming an amateur collegiate summer baseball team. Since 2009, they have competed in the Prospect League, an amateur collegiate summer league.
In 2010, the Paints won their first Prospect League championship against the Danville Dans on an 11th inning walk off home run by Ian Nelson.
Two years later they made another playoff appearance, and lost in the first round to the West Virginia Miners, 6-2.

==Managers==

Longtime Paints' Bench Coach Marty Dunn served as Interim Manager in 2000 following Hanners's heart attack late in the season. Dunn has served as an interim coach for a few games since Hanners's retirement. During the Wilson era, Pitching coaches Jim Frisbee (2005) and Johnny Ruffin (2006) have filled in during an absence, although Dunn has been on staff. During a road trip to Traverse City, MI in 2006, former Cy Young winner Doug Drabek served as manager while Wilson was tending to things at his Texas home.
In late 2006, Wilson saw his contract not renewed, due to many reasons. That same day, the Paints organization named longtime Washington Wild Things assistant Mark Mason their new manager. Mason also managed the Ohio Valley Redcoats in 2005, winning the Roger Hanners Manager of the Year award.
After 2008, Mark Mason was named the fourth manager of the Washington Wildthings replacing Greg Jelks. Mason will not be returning to the Paints in the Prospect league.
