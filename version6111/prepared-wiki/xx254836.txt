Post continued at First Presbyterian Church until June 24, 1836 when he was called to serve the Circular Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  His inaugural sermon at the Circular Church was from Acts 10:29.Annual Obituary Notices of Eminent Persons Who Have Died in the United States, 1859, page 268.

==Personal life==

Reuben Post married Harriet Moffitt, a granddaughter of Richard Henry Lee, on January 7, 1823.  Their children were: William, Harriet Lee (Mrs. Henry L. Pinckney), Emily, Frances, and Richard Henry Lee Post.

==Later years==

Post served as pastor of the Circular Church for 23 years.  He was also president of the board of supervisors of the high school in Charleston.  In 1858, Post took a vacation to his native Vermont; while there a yellow fever epidemic broke out in Charleston.  Post returned at once to care for members of his congregation, and soon fell victim himself and died in the 23rd year of his pastorate there.  A memorial tablet was placed in the church and his gravestone is in the church courtyard, along with those of his wife and daughter—they are in the shapes of chess pieces: a king, a queen and a rook.The Circular Church: Three Centuries of Charleston History, by Joanne Calhoun, page 73.
