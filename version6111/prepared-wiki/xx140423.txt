Remission & Bites  is a compilation by Skinny Puppy released on Play It Again Sam in 1987.[tpl]cite book |title=Skinny Puppy:  The Illustrated Discography (Second Edition) |last=Kern |first=Jay |year=2010 |publisher=Mythos Press  |page=14[/tpl]  The release of this compilation coincides with that of Bites and Remission and contains many of the same songs, albeit in a different context.  This release is, to date, the only CD pressing of Skinny Puppy's first two albums in their original form.  Indeed, while the audio is free of any song-splicing or bonus tracks, the inserts unfortunately contain a number of shortcomings (see the "Notes" section below for more info).
