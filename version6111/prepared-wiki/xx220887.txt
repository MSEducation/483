Tagore International School, India, was founded by Dr. Mrs. H. Sen in 1972. Named after Rabindranath Tagore, it envisions an education "deeply rooted in oneâ€™s immediate surroundings but connected to the cultures of the wider world, predicated upon pleasurable learning and  individualized to the personality of the child". The first branch was in Lajpat Nagar, and thereafter in Vasant Vihar, East of Kailash and DLF. 
The schools are run by the Tagore Education Society, a society founded by Dr. Mrs. Hari Sen and Mr. Jitender Sen in 1964.

==School emblem==

The Tagorean emblem represents three letters T I S. The central I is the leaping flame of the candle, signifying everlasting knowledge, enclosed by T which forms the arms and legs of the child who is never tired in his quest for this 'Vidya' or knowledge. Like the light of the candle, the child is continuously striving to reach for the stars.

==Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar==

It was established in 1972 by Dr. Mrs. H. Sen, as an English medium Senior Secondary School.
The school philosophy is illustrated in Rabindranath Tagore's words "I was brought up in an atmosphere of aspiration, aspiration for the expansion of the human spirit. We in our home sought freedom of power in our language, freedom of imagination in our literature freedom of soul in our religious creeds, and that of mind in our social environment. Such an opportunity has given me confidence in the power of education which is one with life and only which can give us real freedom, the highest that is claimed for man, his freedom of moral communion in the human world".
