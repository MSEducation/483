==Activism==

Davis regularly addresses the annual National Animal Rights conferences, and was inducted in July 2002 into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame "for outstanding contributions to animal liberation."[tpl]cite web |url=http://arconference.org/ARHOF.htm |title=U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame |publisher=arconference.org |accessdate=2010-12-02 [/tpl] Since 1999, she and United Poultry Concerns have hosted six conferences on farmed animal advocacy issues. She launched a campaign against National Public Radio's "This American Life" for its annual "Poultry Slam" show, arguing that host Ira Glass was contributing to the poor treatment and slaughter of chickens and turkeys. Eventually, Glass visited Davis's sanctuary and announced on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2008 that he had become a vegetarian thanks to Davis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP02yahsoCw#t=04m08s |title=Ira Glass on David Letterman |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-12-02 [/tpl]
