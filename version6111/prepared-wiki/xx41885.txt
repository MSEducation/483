Up Front is a World War II card-based wargame. It was designed by Courtney F. Allen and published by Avalon Hill in 1983.  Hasbro now owns the franchise, and at one time licensed it to Multi-Man Publishing, a license that has since expired without republication of the game.   Allen is currently preparing a reprint to be released by Radiant Games, with artwork by Ron Volstad.  The game is currently being funded through Kickstarter.

==Description==

Subtitled The Squad Leader Card Game, Up Front was intended as a card version of their successful Squad Leader series of games, but it represented a radical change in approach.  Traditional wargames are based on maps representing terrain and game pieces representing units, which attack on their players' turns.  Up Front has terrain, attack opportunities, and other factors determined by cards dealt to the players.
Fans of the game claim this type of play gives the player a more realistic feel for man-to-man combat where most terrain will be unfamiliar.  With traditional map-based wargames, players have an overhead view of the entire battlefield.  In Up Front, locations are revealed as the game is played, emulating how real soldiers might encounter and explore terrain.
The game contains two different kinds of cards, Personality and Action.  A Personality card depicts a single soldier and several statistics about him including his name, rank, and the weapon he is carrying.  These are assigned by the scenario selected (scenarios lettered A-L were included in the base game) and arranged in groups by the players. The Action Deck contains different types of cards including terrain, movement, heroes, and many other game factors. These are shuffled and dealt to the players.
The original game included German, U.S., and Russian units along with their equipment.  Expansions added to the nationalities available for play. Each nationality was given different capabilities including variations in hand size and discard ability which imposes different tactics for the players by limiting the options available to them.
