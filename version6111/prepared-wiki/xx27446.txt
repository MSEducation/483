Tottenham Hotspur Football Club [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|t|ᵊ|n|əm[/tpl],[tpl]OED|Tottenham[/tpl]How to pronounce place names with "ham" in them commonly referred to as Spurs, is an English football club located in Tottenham, London, that plays in the Premier League. The club's home stadium is White Hart Lane. Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield.
Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3757030.stm|title=Tottenham legend Nicholson dies|publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2004|accessdate=17 August 2010[/tpl] In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades – an achievement only matched by Manchester United.
The club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: "To Dare Is to Do"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with near neighbours Arsenal, which is known as the North London derby.

==History==

The club was formed in 1882, as Hotspur F.C., and played in the Southern League until 1908, when it was elected into the Football League Second Division. Before this promotion Tottenham had won the FA Cup in 1901, making it the only non-League club to (or likely to) do so since the formation of the Football League.
Since then, Tottenham have won the FA Cup a further seven times, the Football League twice, the Football League Cup four times, the UEFA Cup twice and also the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The Cup Winners' Cup victory in 1963 made Tottenham the first English team to win a UEFA competition. In 1960–61 it became the first team to complete The Double in the 20th century.

==Stadium==

===Tottenham Marshes===

Tottenham played their first matches at Tottenham Marshes on the available public pitches and remained there for six years. It was at this ground that Spurs first played arch rivals Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match got called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.topspurs.com/thfc-november.htm |publisher=topspurs.com |title=A Month in the Illustrious History of Spurs: November |first=Logan |last=Holmes |accessdate=17 February 2012 [/tpl] There were occasions on which fights would break out on the marshes in dispute of the teams that were allowed to use the best pitches. Crowd sizes were regularly increasing and a new site was becoming needed to accommodate these supporters.

===Northumberland Park===

In 1898 the club moved from the marshes to Northumberland Park and charged an admission fee of 3d £0.0125. They only remained at this ground for a year as in April 1899, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. The ground was no longer able to cope with the larger crowds and the Spurs were forced to move to a new larger site 100 yards down the road, to the current ground.

===White Hart Lane===

The White Hart Lane ground was originally a disused nursery owned by the brewery Charringtons and located behind a public house on Tottenham High Road (the actual White Hart Lane road lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The landlord spotted the increased income he could enjoy if Tottenham played their matches behind his pub and the club moved in. They brought with them the stand they used at Northumberland Park which gave shelter to 2,500 fans. Notts County were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and provided in £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1. QPR became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham.
In 1905 Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land and became permanent owners of the ground. As the club grew new stands were added. A new main stand was added in 1909, the East stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the ground's capacity to around 58,000 with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) stand was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators but cost £60,000.
The pitch was thoroughly renovated in 1952. This uncovered a number of items from the old nursery on the site and one year later the first floodlights were introduced. The floodlights were upgraded in 1957 which required the cockerel to be moved from the West Stand to the East and then in 1961 floodlight pylons were installed.
The West Stand was replaced by an expensive (and way behind schedule) new structure. Various developments and upgrades were implemented over the years. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the north stand becoming all-seater the following season. The south stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. With this, the capacity of the stadium increased to just over 33,000. In 1997/98 season the Paxton Road stand had a new upper tier added which included the second Jumbotron screen and increased capacity to 36,240 and was funded by a rights issue in 1996.Stadium History Tottenham Hotspur
Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006 bringing the current capacity of the stadium to 36,310.

===Stadium plans===

====Northumberland Development Project====

In 2007 the club stated it was considering options to increase stadium capacity by redevelopment of the current site or a move to a new site. Tottenham Hotspur advised in its 2007/8 Interim Financial Statement that the preferred option would be announced in the first half of 2008, but delayed this decision until the autumn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/stadiumupdate060508.html|title=Stadium Update|publisher=Tottenhamhotspur.com|date=6 May 2008|accessdate=25 May 2008[/tpl]
In October 2008, the club announced that, if approved, it was planning to build a new stadium just to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch located on the northwest corner of the Lane. The unique design of the build would allow the new stadium to be built adjacent to White Hart Lane as the old facility continued to be used. The plan was that during the summer close season when two thirds of the new stadium was complete, the northern and western stands would be demolished and a new pitch laid. The rest of the stadium would be built in the years to follow.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7699135.stm|title=Tottenham reveal new ground plan|publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2008|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl]
The club submitted a planning application in October 2009. But in May 2010, following adverse reaction, this was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application. Haringey Council were requested in September 2010 to grant permission for a larger stadium and other associated developments (subject to negotiation of 'section 106' developer contributions). The Mayor of London gave his approval to the plans to redevelop the stadium on 25 November 2010. On 20 September 2011, planning permission was granted. In April 2014 the club announced that it anticipated the new stadium opening date to be Summer 2017.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/financial-results-shareholder-and-stadium-update-020414/|title=Financial Results|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl]

====Olympic Stadium====

As an initial consideration Spurs were reported to have considered the possibility of the post-games use of the 2012 London Olympic Stadium. But as this proposal would involve a move out of the immediate Tottenham area and because ongoing users were reportedly required to retain the stadium's running track, in October 2006 the plan Spurs were dropped.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/6056714.stm|title=Spurs rule out 2012 stadium move|date=16 October 2006|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 December 2008[/tpl]
But, on 1 October 2010 Tottenham Hotspur's Chairman Daniel Levy advised that the club had registered an interest in bidding for the stadium in conjunction with AEG (Europe) to keep its options open while there remained uncertainties about the success of the Northumberland Development Project.Stadium Plans THFC Official website Accessed 2 October 2010

==Crest==

Since the 1921 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur (from whom the club is said to have taken its name) wore riding spurs and his fighting cocks were fitted with spurs which can be seen in the crests. In 1909 a former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football to be placed on top of the West Stand and since then the cockerel and ball have been the major part of the club's identity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/aug/31/theknowledge.sport |title=The most unlikely football bet to come off |author=James Dart |publisher=The Guardian |work=guardian.co.uk |date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl]
Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The lions flanking the shield came from the Northumberland family (of which Harry Hotspur was a member). The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto Audere Est Facere (to dare is to do).
In 1983, to overcome unauthorised "pirate" merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions and the motto scroll. This device appeared on most Spurs' playing kits for the next 23 years.
In 2006 to rebrand and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were dumped for a professionally designed logo/emblem.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4628886.stm |title=Tottenham unveil new club badge |publisher=BBC Sport |work=bbc.co.uk |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] This revamp showed a leaner, fitter cockerel on an old-time football. The club claims that the rebranding kept much of the original meaning of the name, but emphasised its originality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs/News/Archive/news_2006_1_2686.page |title=Unveiled new club badge |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2013 |publisher=Totteham Hotspur |work=tottenhamhotspur.com [/tpl]
In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because their logo is too similar to their own cockerel crest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insideworldsoccer.com/2013/11/tottenham-hotspur-legal-action-fleet-spurs-cockerel-logo.html |title=Tottenham force non-league club Fleet Spurs to redesign badge |work=inside World Soccer |date=16 November 2013[/tpl]

==Kit==

The first Tottenham kit was navy blue shirt and shorts, but after the first season the club did not have one specific design for many years. In 1884 the club changed to a "quartered" kit similar in style to that of Blackburn Rovers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Tottenham_Hotspur/Tottenham_Hotspur.htm |title=Historical Kits – Tottenham Hotspur |publisher=Historic Football Kits |work=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] Shortly after moving to Northumberland Road, the kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts. Five years later, after becoming a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.
At the end of the 19th century the club switched colours yet again, to the white shirts and blue shorts which they are now well known for wearing, hence the nickname "Lilywhites". This colour choice is thought to be in homage to Preston North End who had recently done The Double.  White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since. Soon after the First World War, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs, and in 1983 Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on the shirt. The club were the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time where football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Tottenham_Hotspur/Tottenham_Hotspur.htm |title=Tottenham Hotspur- Historical Football Kits |date=11 March 2010 |publisher=historicalkits.co.uk|quote=After surviving a financial crisis, Spurs won their seventh FA Cup in 1991 and once again marked the occasion by introducing another innovative strip, featuring long, generously cut shorts[/tpl]
When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1925316.stm |title=Spurs fans see red over logo |publisher=BBC Sport |work=bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] In 2006, Tottenham then succeeded in securing a record £34m sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jol-to-benefit-from-16334m-shirt-deal-478418.html |title=Jol to benefit from £34m shirt deal |date=16 May 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Adrian |last=Curtis [/tpl]
