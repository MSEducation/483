Tomislav Nikolić ([tpl]lang-sr-cyr|Томислав Николић[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|tǒmislaʋ nǐkolitɕ|sr[/tpl]; born 15 February 1952) has been the President of Serbia since 31 May 2012. He is also the founder of the Serbian Progressive Party, and he led the party until his election as President. In the 2012 presidential election, he was elected to a five-year term as President in a second round of voting.
Born in Kragujevac. Nikolić was previously a long-time member and MP of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS). He served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia from 1998 to 1999 and Deputy Prime Minister of FR Yugoslavia in the coalition government from 1999 to 2000. Nikolić was the Radical Party's deputy leader from 2003, and he briefly served as the President of the National Assembly of Serbia in 2007. In 2008 he resigned following a disagreement with party leader Vojislav Šešelj regarding Serbia's relations with the European Union, as Nikolić became in favor of Serbia's accession to the EU, a move that was staunchly opposed by Šešelj and his faction.[tpl]cite news|title=Serb opposition leader resigns|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7602499.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 July 2008|date=7 September 2008[/tpl] Nikolić then formed the Serbian Progressive Party, which several SRS members joined.
Nikolić ran for the President of Yugoslavia in the 2000 elections and placed third. He also ran four times for the President of Serbia (in 2003, 2004, 2008 elections, and 2012 elections). In 2003 he garnered the most votes, but the election was cancelled due to low turnout, while in 2004 and 2008 he placed second behind Boris Tadić. In 2012, he won the runoff against Tadić to become President of Serbia.

==Political career==

===Radical Party===

Nikolić began his political career as vice-president of the People's Radical Party. Under his initiative, the People's Radical Party merged with Vojislav Šešelj's Serbian National Renewal to form the Serbian Radical Party. Šešelj was elected president of the new party and Nikolić as vice-president.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.b92.net/info/izbori2012/kandidati.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=20&nav_id=602360|title=Tomislav Nikolić – kandidat SNS-a|publisher=B92|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl] He has been a deputy in the National Assembly of Serbia since 1991, the only one to be elected continuously since that year.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] During the rule of Slobodan Milošević and the Socialist Party of Serbia, he and Šešelj were sentenced to three months in prison which he served in Gnjilane. However, in March 1998 the Serbian Radical Party formed a coalition with the Socialist Party and he then became the vice-president of the Government of Serbia and, by the end of 1999, the vice-president of the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In 2000, he began the first of several runs for the presidency of Serbia. In the FR Yugoslavia presidential election of 2000, he finished in third place behind Vojislav Koštunica and Slobodan Milošević. He then ran in the 2003 Serbian presidential election, in which garnered the most votes in the first round (46.23%), ahead of Dragoljub Mićunović, but the results were invalidated due to a low turnout of only 38.8%. Nikolić made yet another bid for presidency in the 2004 presidential election.Gergana Noutcheva European foreign policy and the challenges of Balkan accession 2012 Page 175 "...

[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
On 23 February 2003 he became the deputy leader of the party, after Vojislav Šešelj went voluntarily to the ICTY. During his leadership of the party, Nikolić favoured pushing the party towards focusing on more economic and social issues such as poverty and unemployment, rather than militant nationalism.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Nikolić was elected Speaker of Parliament on 8 May 2007, defeating Milena Milošević of the Democratic Party by 142 to 99 votes out of 244 members of Parliament. The Democratic Party of Serbia endorsed him. Hajredin Kuci of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, Ylli Hoxha of the Reformist Party ORA, and the Prime Minister of Kosovo Agim Çeku condemned the election of Nikolić as "counterproductive and dangerous for Kosovo".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birn.eu.com/en/82/15/2826|title=Kosovo Condemns Nikolić  Appointment|accessdate=9 May 2007|publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|date=9 May 2007[/tpl] On 9 May, Nikolić met with Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Alekseyev and gave a speech to Parliament in which he advocated making Serbia part of a Belarus-Russia superstate, saying that together they would "stand up against the hegemony of America and the European Union".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/5/D272D5D8-F93D-4337-A490-C1A723B00483.html|title=Serbian Parliament Speaker Calls For Closer Russia Ties|accessdate=9 May 2007|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=9 May 2007[/tpl]

According to an official Serbian police report there were around 55,000 people present. On 16 April 2011 Nikolić organized a larger protest with the same request. He also started a thirst and hunger strike that morning and later moved to the national parliament. He stated that his goal was to force the then-Serbian government (led by Boris Tadić) to hold early parliamentary elections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=04&dd=16&nav_id=73833|title=B92 16 April|publisher=B92.net|accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl] On 17 April Tadić came to visit Nikolić in the latter's parliamentary chambers.

Nikolić led the party in the 2012 parliamentary election, and he ran for president in the 2012 presidential election. His slogan was Let's Get Serbia Moving ([tpl]lang-sr|Покренимо Србију, Pokrenimo Srbiju[/tpl]). During the campaign, the issue of his education was raised, as the opposition claimed that Nikolić obtained his master's degree under dubious circumstances in a private school. Nikolić responded by suing the daily newspapers Blic and Kurir, demanding 4 million euros as compensation.NUNS zabrinut zbog tužbi Nikolića – Kurir. Kurir-info.rs (11 May 2012).

Nikolić was inaugurated as the President of Serbia on 11 June 2012. Stefan Fuelle, the EU's enlargement commissioner, was the highest-ranking official to attend and many ambassadors from other countries were also present.

===Apology===

In April 2013 in Bosnian-Herzegovinian TV, Tomislav Nikolic apologized for the Serb war crime in Srebrenica during the 1990s war against Bosnian Muslims. The act was received with considerable positive reaction and publicity from the western media in the following days.

==Controversies==

===Greater Serbia===

During the 1990s and until 2008, Nikolić repeatedly called for the creation of a Greater Serbia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/world/europe/newly-elected-serb-affirms-course-on-european-union.html |title=Newly Elected, Serb Affirms Commitment to Joining European Union| publisher=The New York Times |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/20/serbia-president-eu?newsfeed=true |title=Former extreme nationalist becomes Serbian president |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl] Nikolić told a Zagreb paper in 2004 that the boundaries of Greater Serbia along the Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line were not part of any imperialistic politics, but would always remain a "dream" for him and other Radical leaders.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:158897-Ne-odustajemo-od-Velike-Srbije |title=Ne odustajemo od Velike Srbije |publisher=Novosti.rs |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] He also said that he would not have diplomatic relations with Croatia because they are "occupying Serbian land".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/10840/grobar-politickih-reformi-u-srbiji|title=Grobar političkih reformi u Srbiji|publisher=Nacional (weekly)|date=6 January 2004|accessdate=24 May 2012|language=Croatian|trans_title=Gravedigger for political reforms in Serbia|author=Davor Pašalić|archivedate=1 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68pYcs7Rc[/tpl] In 2007, Nikolić stated that the basis of political action in the Serbian Radical Party was the unification of Republika Srpska, Montenegro, and the Republic of Serbian Krajina with Serbia in a single Balkan state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/15888/Nikoli%C4%87%3A+SRS+je+za+ujedinjenje+RS+i+Srbije.html|title=Nikolić: SRS je za ujedinjenje RS i Srbije|publisher=Press Online|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] But a few days before the 2012 elections, Nikolić told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview that the territorial integrity of neighbouring countries can not be questioned and that his former opinions were no longer valid.[tpl]cite web |url=http://doznajemo.com/2012/05/24/tomislav-nikolic-ne-stidim-se-sto-sam-bio-cetnik/|title=TOMISLAV NIKOLIĆ: Ne stidim se što sam bio četnik!|publisher=Doznajemo online magazin|date=24 May 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] When asked about this change of position, he quoted a French philosopher that said "only a fool does not change his opinion."Tomislav Nikolić: Ne stidim se što sam kao četnik bio u ratu.

===Đinđić and Ćuruvija===

In a remark about Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić's injured leg, Nikolić said on 28 February 2003: "If anyone of you, in the following month or two, sees Zoran Đinđić somewhere, tell him that Tito also had a problem with a leg before his death".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&mm=05&dd=08&nav_category=418&nav_id=245466|title=Vesti – Biografija Tomislava Nikolića|publisher=B92|date=8 May 2007|accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl] Less than two weeks later Đinđić was assassinated in Belgrade.

===Education===

In 2012 Nikolić was accused of buying a Masters Degree from Fakultet za Menadzment Novi Sad (Faculty of Management) without attending a single class or exam. The main evidence for this allegation was that his diploma has no stamp and that no other students recall having seen him attend classes or exams.http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/250851/Nikolic-ipak-na-sudu-zbog-diplome "Nikolić ipak na sudu zbog diplome"], Vesti online, accessed 31 August 2012.http://www.kurir-info.rs/istina-o-diplomi-tome-nikolica-clanak-220818 "Istina o diplomi Tome Nikolića!"],  Kurir, accessed 11 May 2012.

===Vukovar statements===

In a May 2012 interview, Nikolić was quoted by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to have said that ″Vukovar was a Serb city and Croats have nothing to go back to there″.Novi srbijanski predsjednik Tomislav Nikolić: Vukovar je bio srpski grad i Hrvati se nemaju zašto vraćati u njega.

===Comments about Srebrenica massacre===

On 2 June 2012, Nikolić stated on Montenegrin television that "there was no genocide in Srebrenica. In Srebrenica, grave war crimes were committed by some Serbs who should be found, prosecuted and punished. ... It is very difficult to indict someone and prove before a court that an event qualifies as genocide." Nikolić also stated that he wouldn't attend the annual commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre: "Don't always ask the Serbian president if he is going to Srebrenica, my predecessor was there and paid tribute. Why should every president do the same?"[tpl]cite news|title=Serbian president denies Srebrenica genocide|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Serbia_12_06_02_Serbian_president_denies_Srebrenica_genocide.pdf|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2012[/tpl]
Bakir Izetbegović, a member of Bosnia and Herzegovina's presidency, said Nikolic's comments insulted the survivors. He elaborated "the denial of genocide in Srebrenica will not pave the way for co-operation and reconciliation in the region, but on the contrary may cause fresh misunderstandings and tensions. " Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, condemned his comments and stated that "the EU strongly rejects any intention to rewrite history."[tpl]cite news|title=Serbia’s new president revives Balkan tensions by denying Srebrenica massacre was genocide|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/serbias-new-president-revives-balkan-tensions-by-denying-srebrenica-massacre-was-genocide/2012/06/04/gJQAtstIDV_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] The United States State Department deplored Nikolić's statement and considered them unfounded and counterproductive.[tpl]cite news|last=Toner|first=Mark C.|title=Serbian President Nikolic Denies Srebrenica Genocide|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/06/191831.htm?goMobile=0|newspaper=U.S. State Department|date=5 June 2012[/tpl]
On 25 April 2013, Nikolić apologised for the crimes committed by any individual in the name of Serbia and the Serbian people. He also asked for forgiveness for Serbia for the crime committed in Srebrenica.Serbian president apologises for Srebrenica 'crime', BBC News, 25 April 2013.Serbia president 'apologises' for massacre, Al Jazeera, 25 April 2013.Serbian president apologises for Srebrenica massacre, ABC News, 26 April 2013. The apology came after Nikolić was criticised during the presidential election in 2012 for denying that 'there was no genocide in Srebrenica', although the act has been accepted as a genocide by his predecessor Boris Tadić. However, the news was not fully accepted in the media in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Nikolić was said to have not still recognised the massacre of Srebrenica as genocide.

In late September 2013, the Belgrade gay pride parade was banned by the Serbian police for the third consecutive year following violent threats issued by right-wing groups and requests by the Serbian Orthodox Church.[tpl]cite web| publisher=The Guardian| url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/serbia-bans-gay-pride-march| title=Serbia bans gay pride march| date=3 October 2013| accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl] Prior to the parade, Dačić released a statement in which he said that homosexual behaviour was "abnormal" and that homosexuals in Serbia needed to "respect the wishes of the majority of the population" if the "majority's wish was for the parade to not take place."[tpl]cite web| publisher=Tanjug| url=http://www.tanjug.rs/videodet.aspx?galID=105042&videoID=606461| title=Dačić:S približavanjem parade bezbedonosne procene različite| date=24 September 2013| accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl] Nikolić subsequently issued a statement calling for "work on the organisation of next year's parade to begin immediately."[tpl]cite web| publisher=Politika| url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/politika/aktuelno.289.html:456483-Nikolic-Vec-danas-poceti-pripreme-za--Paradu-ponosa-dogodine| title=Nikolić: Već danas početi pripreme za Paradu ponosa dogodine| date=30 September 2013| accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]
