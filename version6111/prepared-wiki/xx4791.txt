[[Great Famine (Ireland)]]

CATEGORIES: Great Famine (Ireland)

In Ireland, the Great Famine ([tpl]lang-ga|an Gorta Mór[/tpl]) was a period of mass starvation, disease and emigration between 1845 and 1852.[tpl]sfn|Kinealy|1995|pp = xvi–ii[/tpl] It is sometimes referred to, mostly outside Ireland, as the Irish Potato Famine because one-third of the population was then solely reliant on this cheap crop for a number of historical reasons.[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 19[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kinealy|1994|pp = xvi–ii, 2–3[/tpl][tpl]sfn|O'Neill|2009|p = 1[/tpl] During the famine approximately 1 million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland,[tpl]sfn|Ross|2002|p = 226[/tpl] causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%.[tpl]sfn|Kinealy|1994|p = 357[/tpl] The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease commonly known as potato blight.[tpl]sfn|Ó Gráda|2002|p = 7[/tpl]
Although the potato crop failed, the country was still producing and exporting more than enough grain crops to feed the population. Records show during the period Ireland was exporting approximately thirty to fifty shiploads per day of food produce. As a consequence of these exports and a number of other factors such as land acquisition, absentee landlords and the effect of the 1690 penal laws, the Great Famine today is viewed by a number of historical academics as a form of either direct or indirect genocide.A Death-Dealing Famine: The Great Hunger in Ireland by Christine Kinealy 1997; Famine Ghost: Genocide of the Irish By Jack O'Keefe; Confronting Genocide edited by René Provost, Payam Akhavan; Baltimore Iconoclast By William C.

The famine was a watershed in the history of Ireland.[tpl]sfn|Kinealy|1995|p = xvii[/tpl] Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory[tpl]#tag:ref|The Famine that affected Ireland from 1845 to 1852 has become an integral part of folk legend.[tpl]sfn|Kinealy|1995|p=342[/tpl]|group = fn[/tpl] and became a rallying point for various Home rule and United Ireland movements, as the whole island was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
The massive famine soured the already strained relations between many of the Irish people and the British Crown, heightening Irish republicanism, which eventually led to Irish independence in the next century.  Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as "pre-Famine".

==Causes and contributing factors==

Starting in 1801, Ireland had been directly governed, under the Act of Union, as part of the United Kingdom. Executive power lay in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Chief Secretary for Ireland, both of whom were appointed by the British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and Irish representative peers elected 28 of their own number to sit for life in the House of Lords. Between 1832 and 1859, 70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners.[tpl]sfn|Póirtéir|1995|p = [/tpl]
In the 40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as Benjamin Disraeli put it in 1844, "a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church, and in addition the weakest executive in the world."[tpl]sfn|Blake|1969|p = 179[/tpl] One historian calculated that between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland and that "without exception their findings prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low."[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 31[/tpl]

===Laws that restricted the rights of Irish Catholics===

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish Catholics had been prohibited by the penal laws from owning land, from leasing land; from voting, from holding political office; from living in a corporate town or within [tpl]convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of a corporate town, from obtaining education, from entering a profession, and from doing many other things necessary for a person to succeed and prosper in Irish society at the time. The laws had largely been reformed by 1793, and in 1829, Irish Catholics could again sit in parliament following the Act of Emancipation.[tpl]sfn|MacManus|1979|pp = 458–459[/tpl]

===Landlords and tenants===

During the 18th century, a new system for managing the landlord's property was introduced in the form of the "middleman system". Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or middlemen. This assured the (usually Protestant) landlord of a regular income, and relieved them of any responsibility; the tenants however were then subject to exploitation through these middlemen.
Catholics made up 80% of the population, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of poverty and insecurity despite Catholic emancipation in 1829. At the top of the "social pyramid" was the "ascendancy class", the English and Anglo-Irish families who owned most of the land, and who had more or less limitless power over their tenants. Some of their estates were vast: the Earl of Lucan owned over [tpl]convert|60000|acre|km2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Many of these landlords lived in England and were called "absentee landlords". The rent revenue was sent to England,[tpl]sfn|Litton|1994|p = [/tpl] collected from "impoverished tenants" paid minimal wages to raise crops and livestock for export.[tpl]sfn|Laxton|1997|p = [/tpl]
In 1843, the British Government considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection in the country. They set up a Royal Commission, chaired by the Earl of Devon, to enquire into the laws with regard to the occupation of land in Ireland. Daniel O'Connell described this commission as perfectly one-sided, being made up of landlords and no tenants.[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|pp = 20–1[/tpl] Devon in February 1845 reported that "It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they labourer and his family habitually and silently endure . . . in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water . . . their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury . . . and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property." The Commissioners concluded that they could not "forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to sustain."[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24[/tpl]
The Commission stated that the principal cause was the bad relations between the landlord and tenant. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie or paternalism as existed in England. Ireland was a conquered country, with the Earl of Clare speaking of the landlords saying "confiscation is their common title."[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21[/tpl] According to the historian Cecil Woodham-Smith, the landlords regarded the land as a source of income from which to extract as much money as possible. With the Irish "brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation" according to the Earl of Clare, Ireland was seen as a hostile place in which to live, and as a consequence absentee landlords were common, with some visiting their property once or twice in a lifetime, or never.[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21[/tpl] The rents from Ireland were then spent elsewhere; an estimated £6,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21[/tpl]
According to Woodham-Smith, the ability of the middlemen was measured by the amount of money they could contrive to extract.[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 21[/tpl] Described by the Commission as "the most oppressive species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country", they were invariably described as "land sharks" and "bloodsuckers".[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22[/tpl]
The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they then sublet as they saw fit. They split the holding into smaller and smaller parcels to increase the amounts of rents they could then obtain, a system called conacre. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were very high), or if the landlord decided to raise sheep instead of grain crops. The cottier paid his rent by working for the landlord.[tpl]sfn|Litton|2006|pp = 9–10[/tpl]
Any improvements made on the holdings by the tenants became the property of the landlords when the lease expired or was terminated, which acted as a disincentive to improvements. The tenants had no security of tenure on the land; being tenants "at will" they could be turned out whenever the landlord chose. This class of tenant made up the majority of tenant farmers in Ireland, the exception being in Ulster where there existed a practice known as "tenant right", under which tenants were compensated for any improvements made to their holdings. The commission according to Woodham-Smith stated that "the superior prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were due to tenant right."[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 22[/tpl]
Landlords in Ireland used their powers without remorse, and the people lived in dread of them. In these circumstances, Woodham-Smith writes "industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which was one of the most destitute in Europe."[tpl]sfn|Woodham-Smith|1991|p = 24[/tpl]

===Tenants, subdivisions, and bankruptcy===

In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2 hectares (1–5 acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6 hectares (5–15 acres). Holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would suffice to feed a family, nor could ranching be a possibility due to the limited land. The British government reported, shortly before the famine, that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families, after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland.[tpl]sfn|Kee|1993|p = 15[/tpl] Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.[tpl]sfn|Uris|Uris|2003|p = 15[/tpl]
The 1841 census showed a population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century.[tpl]sfn|Laxton|1997|p = [/tpl]

===Potato dependency===

The potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food because the main diet still revolved around butter, milk, and grain products. Over the course of one day, men could eat 60 potatoes, women 40, and children 25 due to their exhausting work. In the first two decades of the 18th century, however, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter.[tpl]sfn|Póirtéir|1995|p = 19–20[/tpl] Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper.[ref]
