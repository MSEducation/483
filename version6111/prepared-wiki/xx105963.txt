==Plot==

At Middlebury College in 1969, four young friends, Elise Elliot (Dina Waters), Brenda Morelli (Michele Brilliant), Annie MacDuggan (Adria Tennor), and Cynthia Swann (Juliehera DeStefano), are graduating. As graduation gifts, valedictorian Cynthia presents the girls with matching Bulgari pearl necklaces. As the graduates take a commemorative picture of the four of them (presumably for the last time), Cynthia makes Annie, Brenda and Elise promise that they will always be there for each other throughout the remainder of their lives.
In the present time, the four friends eventually lose touch with one another, as evident when Cynthia (Stockard Channing) is tearfully gazing at the picture of the four of them on that graduation day. Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own Bulgari pearl necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them. She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commit suicide by jumping from perilous heights after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.
Her former friends aren't doing much better: Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise (Goldie Hawn), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Annie (Diane Keaton), meanwhile, is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited for the first time since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after assuming that spending a night together would reconcile them; Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letter that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After all three read their letter from Cynthia and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.
Brenda finds out through her uncle Carmine (Philip Bosco) who has Mafia connections that Morty is guilty of income tax fraud, while Annie makes a plan to revive her advertising career and buy out Aaron's partners. However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart when they find out that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.
Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands, they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the establishment of a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia. The film ends with a celebration at the new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women. Annie narrates that Elise started a relationship with a cast member in her new, successful play, that Brenda and Morty reconciled their differences and got back together, and that when Aaron tried to get back together with her, Annie told him to "drop dead." While outside the center Bill meets Shelly and the two start to flirt. The film concludes with the three women joyfully singing "You Don't Own Me."

===Writing===

The film project originally belonged to Sherry Lansing, who bought the unpublished manuscript of the novel in 1991, after many publishers had rejected it, and handed it over to producer Scott Rudin when she became CEO of Paramount Pictures in 1992.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/24/movies/appeal-of-a-woman-s-revenge.html | work=The New York Times | title=Appeal of a Woman's Revenge | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=September 24, 1996 | accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl] "It was one of the single best ideas for a movie I've ever heard," she said in a 1996 interview with The New York Times. "The situation of a woman getting left for a younger version of herself was far too common. But we didn't want a movie about women as victims. We wanted a movie about empowerment." Rudin consulted Robert Harling to write the screenplay, whose script was reworked by Paul Rudnick when Harling left to direct 1996's The Evening Star, the sequel to the 1983 drama Terms of Endearment. Rudnick, however, felt the final script was "incomprehensible":ZA@PLAY - FILM: Men behaving coyly 19/02/98 "To figure out the structure of that movie would require an undiscovered Rosetta Stone," he told The New York Times.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/11/garden/at-home-with-paul-rudnick-you-want-gay-role-models-how-about-a-joke-first.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=AT HOME WITH: Paul Rudnick; You Want Gay Role Models?

Diane Keaton was the first reported to have landed one of the starring roles, having previously worked with Rudin on the films Mrs. Soffel and Marvin's Room, followed by Bette Midler who had originally auditioned for the "more glamorous role" of Elise.[tpl]cite news|first=Pauline|last=McLeod|title=My First For Renvenge; Berre Midler Knows Exactly Hoe To Get|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=FindArticles|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19961103/ai_n14456412/|date=1996-11-03|accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl] Although Rudin originally intended to cast Jessica Lange in the latter role, the team decided to rewrite the character of the book in favour of a "glitzier" version which eventually went to eleventh-hour addition Goldie Hawn.

"I played her boyfriend and apparently they felt that that was not inherently part of the storyline and so she broke up with me before the movie started," he joked on Larry King Live in 2006.Jon Stewart - Oscars Host Stewart Axed From First Wives Club

Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called that the film a "terrific comedy" and "a glamorous revenge romp, a 9 to 5 mixed with Auntie Mame", giving "each star the opportunity to do her best work in a long, long time." He added that "what's surprising isn't that each of them is so delightfully good but that they work together so well."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Wives-Get-Even-and-Even-More-2965784.php#ixzz2Iba85Wy0|first=Edward|last=Guthmann|title=Wives' Get Even and Even More|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1996-09-20|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl] In his review for Variety, Leonard Klady found that director "Hugh Wilson wisely gets out of the way of his performers, providing a simple glossy look enhanced by cameraman Donald Thorin, designer Peter Larkin and the costumes of Theoni V. Aldredge". He noted that "with its combination of comic zingers and star turns, the pic shapes up as one of the more commercial fall 1996 entries", that "at its core, is a celebration of its star trio as consummate performers. In that respect, First Wives Club is a highly enjoyable movie romp."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911107/?categoryid=31&cs=1|first=Leonard|last=lady |title=The First Wives Club|work=Variety|date=1996-09-15|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]
Janet Maslin from New York Times remarked that the film "freely overhauls the amusing beach book by Olivia Goldsmith, eliminating the sex, adding more slapstick and tailoring the leading roles to suit three divas in starring roles." While she felt that "Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn make a spirited, surprisingly harmonious trio," reeling off "one-liners with accomplished flair, even when the film turns silly and begins to, pardon the expression, sag", she found that the film fared "better with sight gags and quick retorts than with plot development".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/first_wives_club.html|first=Janet|last=Maslin|title=The First Wives Club|work=New York Times|date=1996-09-20|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl] Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times gave The First Wives Club two out of four stars.

He gave the film a C+ rating.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294272,00.html|first=Roger |last=Ebert|title=The First Wives Club (1996)|publisher=EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1996-09-27|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]

But I think we should all do it for the same amount of money.' Now, if there were three men that came back to do a sequel, they would have paid them three times their salary at least."
