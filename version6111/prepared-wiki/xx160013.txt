[[Cowgate, Newcastle upon Tyne]]

CATEGORIES: Districts of Newcastle upon Tyne

Cowgate is a locality in the north-west of Newcastle upon Tyne, England.  It lies mainly between the Kenton ward, and the Blakelaw ward. The name is believed to come from the gate the local farmers would use from the Nuns Moor area to herd their livestock to the Newcastle cattle market.
Carricks Bakery, which was later acquired by Greggs was located in the area.  The bakery was closed in 2005 and the work carried out there was transferred to other facilities in Newcastle.  A Greggs spokesman said the closure of the Carricks Bakery was necessary to make efficiency savings. He said it was not possible to update or expand the building in a residential area.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jobs+to+go+as+Greggs+shuts+bakery.-a0121923080
