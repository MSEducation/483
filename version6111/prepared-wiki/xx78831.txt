The Yokosuka MXY9 ''Shuka'' (秋火, "Autumn fire") was a projected development of the MXY8 training glider, adding a small thermojet-style jet engine, the Tsu-11. It was intended to provide further training for pilots who were to fly the Mitsubishi J8M and Mitsubishi Ki-200 rocket-powered interceptor aircraft.[tpl]cite book|last=Dyer|first=Edwin M.|title=Japanese Secret Projects|year=2009|publisher=Midland Publishing|location=Hinkley|isbn=978 1857803 174|pages=77[/tpl]
