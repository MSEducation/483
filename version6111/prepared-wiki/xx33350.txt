[[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories]]

CATEGORIES: Conspiracy theories by subject, Biological warfare, AIDS origin hypotheses

Various alternative theories have arisen speculating about the hidden origins of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), ranging from suggestions that they were the inadvertent result of experiments in the development of vaccines to claims that they were intentionally developed by scientists working for the U.S. government. (Alternative theories regarding the hidden origin — accidential or intentional — of HIV/AIDS must be distinguished from AIDS denialism, which is the view of those who deny that HIV is the cause of AIDS. AIDS denialists, however, overlap with the alternative origin theorists in sharing the conspiratorial view that government officials and the biomedical establishment have been complicit in suppressing the truth about HIV/AIDS.) Speculations notwithstanding, the current scientific consensus is that HIV originated naturally in West Central Africa in the mid-1930s from the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).[tpl]cite doi |10.1098/rstb.2001.0863[/tpl]

[/ref] in The Times suggested this, quoting an unnamed "adviser to WHO" with "I believe the smallpox vaccine theory is the explanation to the explosion of Aids".  It is now thought that the smallpox vaccine causes serious complications for people who already have impaired immune systems, and the Times article described the case of a military recruit with "dormant HIV" who died within months of receiving it.  But no citation was provided regarding people who did not previously have HIV. (HIV is now considered to be a contraindication for the smallpox vaccine - both for an infected person and their sexual partners and household members.)  Some conspiracy theorists propose an expanded hypothesis in which the smallpox vaccine was deliberately 'laced' with HIV.
