Leonard Aloysius Scott Stokes (1858 – 25 December 1925) was an English architect.
Leonard Stokes was born in Southport (then in Lancashire) in 1858.  He trained in London and travelled in Germany and Italy.  Most of his designs were for Roman Catholic buildings, including churches, convents and schools.  His first outstanding work was the Church of St Clare, Liverpool.  He also designed country houses and around 20 telephone exchanges.  In 1919 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, having served as their president from 1910 to 1912. Sir Albert Edward Richardson, who later became President of the Royal Society, trained in his offices. 
He died in 1925 in Chelsea.[tpl]Citation | last = Howell| first = Peter| chapter = Stokes, Leonard Aloysius Scott (1858–1925)| work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press | origyear = 2004| year = 2010| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/61677| accessdate = 18 August 2013 [/tpl] ([tpl]ODNBsub[/tpl])
