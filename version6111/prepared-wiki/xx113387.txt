The Transitional National Government (TNG) was the internationally recognized central government of Somalia from 2000 to 2004.

==Overview==

The Transitional National Government (TNG) was established in Aprilâ€“May 2000 at the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Arta, Djibouti. It was militarily and politically opposed by the Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC), which was formed by faction leaders including Hussein Mohamed Farrah Aidid and Mohamed Dhere.[tpl]cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2014|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|accessdate=April 8, 2014[/tpl]
According to Le Sage, the TNG in 2002 had all of the organs of a national government, including executive and judicial structures as well as a parliament, a police force and standing army. However, its institutions remained very weak on account of a dearth of basic office equipment, lack of territorial control, and inability to raise tax revenue. Due to these limitations, the TNG was unable to provide basic social services. Ministers and legislators also often expressed frustration at being shut out of the real decision-making process, and of often receiving irregular and limited salaries. As such, Le Sage argues that the public officials served more as symbols of the potential for a broad-based, national government.Somalia: Sovereign Disguise for a Mogadishu MafiaAuthor(s): Andre Le SageSource: Review of African Political Economy, Vol. 29, No. 91, (Mar., 2002), pp. 132-138
Besides external threats, the TNG was beset with internal problems. This resulted in the replacement of the Prime Minister four times in three years and the administrative body's reported bankruptcy in December 2003. Its mandate concurrently ended.[tpl]cite web|title=TNG Prime Minister Concludes Formation of Cabinet|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040921233018/http://www.banadir.com/cabinet.shtml|date=2003-12-31|accessdate=2014-04-08[/tpl]
