With a population exceeding 180 million people, it is the sixth most populous country and with an area covering 796,095 km2 ([tpl]nowrap|307,374 sq mi[/tpl]), it is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area. Pakistan has a [tpl]convert|1046|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west and north, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a marine border with Oman.
The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was home to several ancient cultures, including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Subcontinent's struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh.

==Politics==

Pakistan is a democratic parliamentary federal republic with Islam as the state religion. The first Constitution of Pakistan was adopted in 1956 but suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958. The Constitution of 1973—suspended by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 but reinstated in 1985—is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of the current government. The Pakistani military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's political history. Presidents brought in by military coups ruled in 1958–1971, 1977–1988 and 1999–2008.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/472953.stm|title=World: South Asia Pakistan's army and its history of politics|date=10 December 1999|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=BBC[/tpl] Pakistan today is a multi-party system parliamentry state with clear division of power and responsibilities between branches of government. The first successful demonstrative transaction was held in May 2013. As of 2013 elections, the three main political parties in the country are Pakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Movement for Justice led by Imran Khan.

===Foreign relations of Pakistan===

Pakistan is the second largest Muslim country (after Indonesia), and its status as a declared nuclear power, being the only Islamic nation to have that status, plays a part in its international role. Pakistan has a fierce independent foreign policy, especially when it comes to issues such as development of nuclear weapons, construction of nuclear reactors, foreign military purchases and other issues that are vital to its national interests. Pakistan has a strategic geo-political location at the corridor of world major maritime oil supply lines, and has proximity to the resource and oil rich central Asian countries. Pakistan is an important member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), is ranked by the US as a major non-NATO ally in the war against terrorism, and has a highly disciplined military, which is the world's eighth-largest standing military force.
Pakistan's foreign policy focuses on security against threats to national identity and territorial integrity, and on the cultivation of close relations with Muslim countries. A 2004 briefing on foreign policy for Pakistani Parliamentarians says, "Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy."[tpl]cite web|author=Hasan Askari Rizvi|title=Pakistan's Foreign Policy:An Overview 1947–2004|url=http://www.millat.com/democracy/Foreign%20Policy/Briefing_Paper_english_11.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency|pages=10–12, 20|accessdate=20 December 2011[/tpl] The country is an active member of the United Nations.

Pakistan maintains good relations with all Arab and most other Muslim countries. Since the Sino-Indian War of 1962, Pakistan's closest strategic, military and economic ally has been China. The relationship has survived changes of governments and variations in the regional and global situation. Chinese cooperation with Pakistan has reached economic high points, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistan's infrastructural expansion including the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar. Both countries have an ongoing free trade agreement. Pakistan has served as China's main bridge between Muslim countries. Pakistan also played an important role in bridging the communication gap between China and the West by facilitating the 1972 Nixon visit to China.[tpl]cite web|author=Urvashi Aneja|url=http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/136564802IPCS-Special-Report-26.pdf|title=PAKISTAN-CHINA RELATIONS|publisher=Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies|date=June 2006|page=1|accessdate=28 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/24/us-pakistan-china-chro-idUSISL9262520061124|title=CHRONOLOGY-Main events in Chinese-Pakistani relations|publisher=Reuters|work=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=24 November 2006|date=24 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/china-pakistan-relations/p10070|title=China-Pakistan Relations|author=Jamal Afridi|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Pakistan is a federation of four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest, which include the Frontier Regions. The government of Pakistan exercises de facto jurisdiction over the western parts of the disputed Kashmir region, organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas). The Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order of 2009 assigned a province-like status to the latter, giving it self-government.[tpl]Cite journal|url = http://www.pid.gov.pk/Prime%20Minister.doc |publisher=Press Information Department, Pakistan|format = DOC|title = Highlights of Prime Minister's Press Talk on "Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self Governance Order −2009" at PM'S Secretariat on August 29, 2009|year=2009|accessdate=29 December 2011[/tpl]

Law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by federal and provincial police agencies. The four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction limited to the relevant province or territory. At the federal level, there are a number of civilian agencies with nationwide jurisdictions; including the Federal Investigation Agency, the National Highways and Motorway Police, and several paramilitary forces such as the Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps.[tpl]cite book|author=Asad Jamal|title=Police Organisations in Pakistan|year=2010|publisher=CHRI and HRCP|isbn=81-88205-79-6|pages=9–15[/tpl]

Pakistan's penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.[tpl]cite web|author=Faqir Hussain|title=The Judicial System Of Pakistan|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/thejudicialsystemofPakistan.pdf|work=Supreme Court of Pakistan|format=PDF|year = 2009|pages=10–21|accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl]

===Kashmir conflict===

The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region, the most northwesterly region of South Asia. The two countries have fought at least three wars over Kashmir—the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999—and several skirmishes over the Siachen Glacier. India claims the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir and administers approximately 45.1% of the region, including most of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier. India's claim is contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 38.2% of Kashmir, consisting of Azad Kashmir and the northern areas of Gilgit and Baltistan.[tpl]cite book|author=Sean Anderson|title=Historical dictionary of terrorism|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4101-7|pages=347–348[/tpl]
The conflict of Kashmir has its origin in 1947, when British India was separated into the two states of Pakistan and India. As part of the partition process, both countries had agreed that the rulers of princely states would be allowed to opt for membership of either Pakistan or India, or in special cases to remain independent.[tpl]cite web|author=International Court of Justice|title=Advisory Opinion on the Legal Status of Kashmir|url=http://imuna.org/nhsmun/committee/international-court-justice-2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011211119/http://imuna.org/nhsmun/committee/international-court-justice-2012|archivedate=2011-10-11|year=2012|publisher=IMUNA|accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] India claims Kashmir on the basis of the Instrument of Accession, a legal agreement with Kashmir's leaders executed by Maharaja Hari Singh, then ruler of Kashmir, agreeing to accede the area to India.[tpl]cite web|author=Zakat Foundation of America|title=Small Hopes in Conflict Affected Kashmir|url=http://www.zakat.org/crisis_response/entry/small_hopes_in_conflict_affected_kashmir|year=2011|publisher=Zakat Foundation of America|accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Paul Bowers|title=Kashmir (House of Commons Research Paper 04/28)|date=30 March 2004|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2004/rp04-028.pdf|page=46|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=18 April 2012[/tpl] Pakistan claims Kashmir on the basis of a Muslim majority and of geography, the same principles that were applied for the creation of the two independent states.[tpl]cite book|author=Amita Shastri |title=The Post-Colonial States of South Asia: Democracy, Development and Identity|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-23852-0|page=289|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=du7xvBFpbg4C&pg=PA289&dq=Pakistan+claims+Kashmir+on+the+basis+of+a+Muslim+majority+and+geography#v=onepage&q=Pakistan%20claims%20Kashmir%20on%20the%20basis%20of%20a%20Muslim%20majority%20and%20geography&f=false|accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Joseph J.

===Law enforcement===

Law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by several federal and provincial police agencies. The four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction extending only to the relevant province or territory. At the federal level, there are a number of civilian agencies with nationwide jurisdictions including the Federal Investigation Agency and the National Highways and Motorway Police, as well as several paramilitary forces including the Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps. The most senior officers of all the civilian police forces also form part of the Police Service of Pakistan, which is a component of the civil service of Pakistan. The five regional policies are namely Balochistan Police, Capital Territory Police, Frontier Police, Punjab Police and Sindh Police. Pakistan also has a National Highways & Motorway Police which is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on Pakistan's National Highways and Motorway network. Regional police departments also maintain respective Elite Police which is specialized in counter-terrorist operations and VIP security duties. Pakistan Rangers are an internal security force with the prime objective to provide and maintain security in war zones and areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order which includes providing assistance to the police.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.npb.gov.pk/partners/| title=Our Partners| publisher=National Police Bureau, Government of Pakistan| accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl]

Geologically, Pakistan overlaps the Indian tectonic plate in its Sindh and Punjab provinces; Balochistan and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are within the Eurasian plate, mainly on the Iranian plateau. Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes. Ranging from the coastal areas of the south to the glaciated mountains of the north, Pakistan's landscapes vary from plains to deserts, forests, hills and plateaus .[tpl]cite web|year=2010|title=Pakistan|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/pakistan/index.stm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations|accessdate=29 December 2011[/tpl]

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four distinct seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Pakistan-CLIMATE.html|title=Pakistan Climate|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl]

===Flora and fauna===

The diversity of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from coniferous alpine and subalpine trees such as spruce, pine and deodar cedar in the extreme northern mountains, through deciduous trees in most of the country (for example the mulberry-like shisham found in the Sulaiman Mountains), to palms such as coconut and date in southern Punjab, southern Balochistan and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to juniper, tamarisk, coarse grasses and scrub plants. Mangrove forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225000128/http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php|archivedate=2004-12-25|title=Conservation of Mangrove Forests in the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan|work=WWF Pakistan|accessdate=17 March 2009[/tpl]
Coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in most of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the xeric regions of Balochistan, date palm and Ephedra are common. In most of Punjab and Sindh, the Indus plains support tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forestry as well as tropical and xeric shrublands. These forests are mostly of mulberry, acacia, and eucalyptus.[tpl]cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.rrcap.unep.org/lc/cd/html/countryrep/pakistan/introduction.html|work=AIT-UNEP RRC.AP|accessdate=27 December 2011[/tpl] About 2.2% or [tpl]convert|1687000|ha|km2[/tpl] of Pakistan was forested in 2010.[tpl]cite web|author=Rhett Butler|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Pakistan.htm|title=Pakistan Deforestation Rates and Related Forestry Figures|work=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl]
