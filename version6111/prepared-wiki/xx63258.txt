[[ISO/IEC 8859-11]]

CATEGORIES: Thai language, ISO/IEC 8859

ISO/IEC 8859-11:2001, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 11: Latin/Thai alphabet, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 2001. It is informally referred to as Latin/Thai. It is nearly identical to the national Thai standard TIS-620 (1990). The sole difference is that ISO/IEC 8859-11 allocates non-breaking space to code 0xA0, while TIS-620 leaves it undefined. (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)
ISO-8859-11 is not a registered IANA charset name despite following the normal pattern for IANA charsets based on the ISO 8859 series. However, the close equivalent TIS-620 (which lacks the non-breaking space) is registered with IANA, and can without problems be used for ISO/IEC 8859-11, since the no-break space has a code which was unallocated in TIS-620.
As with all varieties of ISO/IEC 8859, the lower 128 codes are equivalent to ASCII. The additional characters, apart from no-break space, are found in Unicode in the same order, only shifted from 0xA1 to U+0E01 and so forth.
The Microsoft Windows code page 874 as well as the code page used in the Thai version of the Apple Macintosh, MacThai, are extensions of TIS-620 — incompatible with each other, however.

Code values D1, D4-DA, E7-EE are for combining characters.

===Code page 874===

Code page 874, which is also known as windows-874, CP874, MS874, x-windows-874, and x-IBM874, used by Microsoft Windows differs from ISO/IEC 8859-11 only nine symbols as shown in the following table:
