RAF Mount Pleasant [tpl]Airport codes|MPN|EGYP[/tpl] (also known as Mount Pleasant Airport, Mount Pleasant Complex or MPA)Falkland Islands Information Portal is a Royal Air Force station in the British Overseas Territory of the Falkland Islands. The airfield goes by the motto of "Defend the right"Photo of an RAF Mount Pleasant plaque (while the motto of the islands is "Desire the right") and is part of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (BFSAI). Home to between 1,000 and 2,000 British military personnel, it is located about [tpl]convert|30|mi[/tpl] southwest of Stanley—the capital of the Falklands—on the island of East Falkland. The world's longest corridor, half a mile (800 m) long, links the barracks, messes and recreational and welfare areas of the station, and was nicknamed the "Death Star Corridor" by personnel.Obituary of Brig. David Nicholls - Daily Telegraph, 22 July 2006
Mount Pleasant was opened by Prince Andrew on 12 May 1985, becoming fully operational the following year. The station was constructed as part of British efforts to strengthen the defence of the Falkland Islands following the 1982 war with Argentine forces. It remains the newest purpose-built RAF station and replaced previous RAF facilities at Port Stanley Airport.

==History==

RAF Mount Pleasant is the newest permanent airfield in the Royal Air Force.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/stations.cfm?selectStation=9E0E8C39-F754-2F05-6BF4D6CE47462066#cgi.script_name# |title=RAF Mount Pleasant |year=2012 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=1 June 2012[/tpl] The RAF previously had a small airfield at Stanley airfield after the end of the hostilities in 1982. During the Falklands War when the islands were occupied by Argentine military forces, British aircraft were sent to disable the runway with RAF Strike Command Vulcan bombers (Operation Black Buck) and Royal Navy Sea Harriers. The raids were moderately successful, and on the first Black Buck mission one [tpl]convert|1000|lb|adj=on[/tpl] bomb hit the runway in the middle, disabling it.  However, temporary repairs by the Argentines did allow C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to bring in supplies and take out casualties until the end of the conflict. At the end of hostilities the runway was fully repaired by British military engineers.
After the surrender of the Argentine ground forces on the islands, the British still faced the problem of potential Argentine air attacks from Argentina, so an aircraft carrier had to remain on station to guard the islands with its squadron of Sea Harriers until the local airfield was prepared for jet aircraft. [tpl]HMS|Hermes|R12|6[/tpl] was the first to take guard duty, whilst [tpl]HMS|Invincible|R05|6[/tpl] went north to change (at sea) a main engine.British Task Force returns to UK – Falklands War 1982 Invincible then returned to relieve Hermes which urgently needed to return to the UK for  boiler cleaning. Invincible returned until she was relieved by the newly built [tpl]HMS|Illustrious|R06|6[/tpl], which was quickly rushed south and commissioned during the journey. Once the Port Stanley runway was available for jets, Illustrious was relieved by four RAF Phantom FGR.2 (named ‘Faith’, ‘Hope’, Charity’ and ‘Desperation’ by the crews – the first three named after the three Gloster Gladiators that according to legend was the name of the three RAF fighters defending Malta in the Second World War).
The British government felt that Stanley airfield was not the best option for a large, permanent station and decided to construct a new RAF station and make it the centrepiece of considerably strengthened air defences for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.  This was intended to deter any future Argentine attempts to take the islands by force. Mount Pleasant, to the west of Stanley, was chosen as the site for the new station.  The construction, which had extraordinary challenges to get materials on site, was undertaken by a Laing-Mowlem-ARC consortium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/OverseasPosting/BFSAI/AboutTheFalklands.htm|title=About the Falklands|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=4 June 2012[/tpl] The airfield was opened by Prince Andrew (who served in the Falklands War) on 12 May 1985,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline198089.cfm |title=RAF Timeline 1980-1989 |year=2012 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=2 February 2012[/tpl] and became fully operational in 1986.Falkland Islands Government
Flights of Phantoms were rotated through the airfield until 1992 when they were replaced with Tornado F3s.  The Tornado was replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon in September 2009.  These have been supported throughout by C130s and, since 1996, VC10s, equipped for aerial refuelling, transport, search and rescue and maritime patrol.
A flight of Westland Sea King helicopters for support and search and rescue has been located at Mount Pleasant since November 2007.

==Airlines and destinations==

Using the IATA airport code MPN, RAF Mount Pleasant also acts as the Falkland Islands' only international airport, along with its military role. Flights open to civilian passengers are operated twice each week. Initially, these were operated directly by the RAF using the Lockheed TriStars of 216 Squadron. Starting in autumn 2008,South Atlantic Remote Territories Media Association these flights were operated on behalf of the Royal Air Force by a civilian airline, Flyglobespan. Since the airline's bankruptcy in 2009, the flights have been operated by Air Tahiti Nui, Titan Airways and Air Seychelles. The current operator is Hi Fly.Airbridge Flights Update They fly to and from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, with a refuelling stop at RAF Ascension Island in the south-central Atlantic Ocean. These flights previously used a Boeing 767 aircraft but the current aircraft is an Airbus A340. Occasionally a RAF Boeing C-17 freight aircraft or the Antonov An-225 are employed to bring in large items of freight.
Additionally, every Saturday LAN Airlines operates a scheduled commercial flight to Presidente Carlos Ibáñez del Campo International Airport  of  the Punta Arenas city in southern Chile, stopping at Río Gallegos, Argentina once a month.
On 2 March 2012, the Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner called for Aerolineas Argentinas flights to Buenos Aires to replace LAN Airlines flights to Chile. The idea of flights to Argentina was not supported in the islands, because this might result in Argentina having a monopoly on commercial flights and controlling all commercial air access.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/02/falklands-argentina-direct-flights | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Uki | last=Goni | title=Argentine president calls for direct flights from Falklands to Buenos Aires | date=2 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/02/uk-argentina-britain-falklands-idUSLNE82100520120302 | work=Reuters | title=Argentina wants its airline to fly to Falklands | date=2 March 2012[/tpl]
