Màrius Torres ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈmaɾius ˈtores[/tpl]) (Lleida, 1910 - Sant Quirze Safaja, 1942) was a Catalan poet, first published by fellow writer Joan Sales in Mexico. He's among the most influential poets in the first 30 years of post-Civil War Catalonia.
The son of physician and politician Humbert Torres, he studied at the Liceu Escolar in Lleida from 1920 to 1926 and earned a degree in Medicine from the University of Barcelona. He used the pen name Gregori Sastre to sign his works during the Spanish Civil War, while he was confined in several anti-tuberculosis hospitals. He died in 1942 and was buried in Sant Quirze Safaja.
Today there is a public high school in his home city which is called Institut Màrius Torres.
