==Service history==

===U.S. Navy===

She was launched on 28 May 1927 as Guam by the Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works in Shanghai, China, and commissioned on 28 December 1927. Her primary mission was to ensure the safety of American missionaries and other foreigners. Later, the ship also functioned as a "radio spy ship," keeping track of Japanese movements.Groom, W. 1942. pp. 111–113 However, by 1939, she was "escorted" by a Japanese warship wherever she went, as China fell more and more under Imperial Japanese control.
In 23 January 1941, she was renamed Wake, as Guam was to be the new name of a large cruiser being built in the U.S. 
On 25 November 1941, Lt. Cdr. Harris was ordered to close the Navy installation at Hankow, and sail to Shanghai. On 28 November 1941, Lt. Cdr. Harris and most of the crew was transferred to gunboats that had been ordered to sail to the Philippines. Columbus Darwin Smith—an old China hand who had been piloting river boats on the Yangtze River—was asked to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy and was appointed captain of Wake with the rank of Lt. Commander.
When Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7 December 1941, Shanghai had been under Japanese occupation since the 1937 Battle of Shanghai. Smith was in command on 8 December 1941 (7 December in Hawaii), with a crew of 14, when the Japanese captured the ship, which was tied up at a pier in Shanghai. Smith had received a telephone call the night before from a Japanese officer he knew. The officer asked where Smith would be the next morning as he wanted to deliver some turkeys for Smith and his crew. The Japanese did the same to other American officers and officials so as to determine where they would be on 8 December. However, Commander Smith received word from his quartermaster about the Pearl Harbor attack and rushed to the ship only to find it under guard by the Japanese. Surrounded by an overwhelming Japanese force, the crew attempted unsuccessfully to scuttle the craft. Wake surrendered, the only U.S. ship to do so in World War II.
Commander Smith and his crew were confined to a prison camp near Shanghai, where the U.S. Marines and sailors captured on Wake Island were also later imprisoned.

===Japanese service===

The Japanese gave Wake to their puppet Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing, where she was renamed [tpl]nihongo|Tatara|多多良[/tpl]. 15 December 1941 refit began at Kiaguan Engineering and Dock Works. Refit finished 26 January 1942. 11 October 1942 runs aground off Nanking. 12 October returns to Kianguan E. & D. W. for repairs. Repairs finished 5 November 1942.

Sails for Kianguan on 24 December. Enters Kianguan E. & D.W. for repairs and an AA upgrade on 1 January 1945. Repairs finished 3 February 1945. 

===Post-war===

In 1945, at the end of the war, she was recaptured by the U.S. The U.S. gave the ship to the Chinese nationalists, who renamed her Tai Yuan (太原). Finally, the ship was captured by Communist Chinese forces in 1949.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/tatara_t.htm|title=Combinedfleet.com/Tatara |publisher=Combinedfllet.com |accessdate=9 December 2012[/tpl]
As of 2010, no other ship of the U.S. Navy has been named Wake, though a Casablanca-class escort carrier launched in 1943 was named [tpl]USS|Wake Island|CVE-65|2[/tpl].
