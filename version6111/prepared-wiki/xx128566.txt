Nivea is the debut album by American R&B singer Nivea. The album was plagued by a low-charting first single and major delays. The first single, "Don't Mess with the Radio" was only a minor hit in the US and performed under expectations, which prompted Jive to order the singer to record new songs and axe old ones. This was when her Grammy-Nominated single "Don't Mess With My Man" was revamped and turned into a smash hit. It was quickly followed with a third single, the hit "Laundromat", featuring R. Kelly.  Despite the many alterations made to the track listing, the album was not very successful, barely debuting in the top 100 of the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. The last single, "25 Reasons" was only released to radio and received minimial airplay. To date the album has been certified GOLD by the RIAA with sales of 523,001 copies in the U.S.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] The lead single was a huge hit in Australia, certifiying Gold and peaking at #14.
