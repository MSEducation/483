In the summer of 2010, controversy arose over Evans' alleged 2008 remark to Debbie Lee, the mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq that “Your son deserved to die in Iraq if he was stupid enough to go over there.” [tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] Republican candidate Meg Whitman repeated this charge in her 2010 California gubernatorial campaign, demanding that Jerry Brown return money from a fundraiser that Evans hosted. Later during the controversy, Lee told the San Francisco Chronicle that she could not identify Evans and was not sure who made the insulting remark.[tpl]cite news|last=Marinucci |first=Carla |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=70960 |title=Code Pink co-founder Jodie Evans disputes "painful" Whitman campaign charges about alleged statements to Gold Star mom (VIDEO) : Politics Blog |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2011-06-21[/tpl]
