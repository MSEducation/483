Judith Barrett (February 2, 1909 â€“ March 10, 2000), also known as Nancy Dover, was an American film actress of the late 1920s and through the 1930s, up until 1940.
Born Lucille Kelley and raised in Venus, Texas, one of three children and the daughter of a cattle rancher, whom she later claimed to be a "dirt" farmer who died of a broken heart.  From these humble beginnings she knew, even from a young age, that she was different from those around her.  She loved to laugh, and to entertain the adults by singing, dancing and playing "drum" on a turned over metal wash tub.  Barrett made several appearances at The Palace Theatre, Dallas while still at school.  She did modeling at a department store for ladies tea/fashion shows.  At sixteen leaving everything behind, she got on a train to Hollywood knowing she had what it took to be a star.  With hard work and dedication her first big chance came to her, when she started in a lavish commercial film in 1928, The Sock Exchange opposite Bobby Vernon.  In 1929 she went to Hollywood, starred in five films, and made a successful transition to "talking films".  From 1928 to 1933 she was billed as "Nancy Dover", and from 1930 to 1933 she appeared in nine films, all credited.  In 1933 she appeared in only one film, Marriage Humor opposite Harry Langdon and Vernon Dent, while doing stage work.  She would not have another role until 1936, when she starred in the crime drama Yellowstone opposite Henry Hunter, and alongside Ralph Morgan and Alan Hale.  It was the first film that she was billed as "Judith Barrett".  She appeared in two films that year, and five in 1937, one of which was her first uncredited role.
From 1938 to 1940 Barrett appeared in ten films, all credited.  Barrett retired from film acting following her appearance in the 1940 film Those Were the Days!, starring William Holden and Bonita Granville.
Noted for her beauty, the October 16, 1939 edition of the Baltimore Sun said of her:  "Judith Barrett, pretty and blonde actress, is the first Telegenic Girl to go on record.  In other words, she is the perfect type of beauty for television. ... She is slated for the first television motion picture."Telegenic | Define Telegenic at Dictionary.com
She eventually settled in Palm Desert, California, where she was residing at the time of her death on March 10, 2000.
