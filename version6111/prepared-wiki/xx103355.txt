==Early years==

He was born Stephen Guarino, the elder of two children, to Italian Roman Catholic parents in Staten Island, New York.
He was educated initially in a public high school nearby and then enrolled in the Brooklyn College, where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics.[tpl]Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=44[/tpl]
In January 1962 he joined the Navy, where he served for two years on board of U.S.S. Saratoga, a super-carrier. In his introduction to With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966-1969 he writes: "A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world." "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada’s temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen."
In July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered ISKCON a month later. Prabhupada soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood "to be yoga".John P Reis, God is Not Dead; He Has Simply Changed Clothes: A Study of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1975, p.145 On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new Gaudiya Vaishnava movement.Letter by A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, 11 November 1967 to  Brahmananda, "I do not want crowd of Kirtananandas but I want a single soul like Brahmananda, Mukunda, Rayarama, and Satsvarupa. The same example is always applicable that one moon is sufficient for the night as not thousands of stars...Without being empowered by Krishna, nobody can preach Krishna Consciousness. It is not academic qualification or financial strength which helps in these matters, but it is sincerity of purpose which helps us always. Therefore, I wish that you will remain in charge of New York, let Satsvarupa be in charge of Boston, Let Mukunda be in charge of San Francisco...Letters quote
After Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's departure from this world he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. Larry Shinn in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami:
In a typical initiation ceremony as a guru of International Society for Krishna Consciousness he would begin with purification using achamana (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the holy names in the life of a new initiate.[tpl]Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=104[/tpl]

==Personal servant of Prabhupada==

In addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of ISKCON, Prabhupada, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Prabhupada his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Prabhupada a massage it was "an intense spiritual experience" for him:
One may understand how the service given to one's guru can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in puja and innumerable other Vaishnava contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.[tpl]Harvnb|Ketola|2008|pp=113–117[/tpl]

==Literary contribution==

As a writer he is following a line of teachers or gurus in his religious tradition. In his review Srivatsa Goswami suggests this view with a reference to the  "path of Six Goswamis":[tpl]Harvnb|Rosen|1992|256[/tpl] Satsvarupa dasa Goswami's writing[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/index.php?main=features&content=contents|title=represents 30 digitally available volumes of transcripts of Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami books forming large portion of the collection|authorlink = |author=vedabase.com|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=Bhaktivedanta Vedabase|year=2003|language=engl[/tpl] represents a contemporary variety from commentaries on scriptures to a free flowing poetry and prose.Goswami,One Hundred Prabhupada Poems. 1995

==Brief history in ISKCON==

===Early days===

Since ISKCON incorporation in July 1966 at 26 Second Avenue Satsvarupa dasa was engaged as A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's personal typist and ISKCON secretary for the first year.Passage from India: The Life and Times of His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Steven Rosen, Satsvarūpa Dāsa Goswāmī, 1992, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, Page 99 He was one of few devotees who were maintaining outside jobs to support the ISKCON temple at the beginning. Later he was managing ISKCON Boston and ISKCON Press, that grew to be later be registered as Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. Upon assuming duties of a GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) in 1970, Satsvarupa was asked by Prabhupada to accept order of sannyasa in 1972. He accepted sannyasa along with other GBC members, all of whom were originally married man, such as Tamal Krishna Goswami and Hridayananda dasa Goswami. At the time A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada awarded him and other followers the title Goswami with the single line instruction: Preach, preach, preach![tpl]cite book |author = Goswami |title =Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta Vol 5| publisher = BBT| date = see: | page = 95[/tpl]  He is sometimes listed among active promoters of ahimsa among other eastern religious teachers.[tpl]citation|author = Nick Kokoshis |title =Remember Eastern Religious Teachers |magazine= Tegetarian Times| publisher = Active Interest Media| date = November 1985 | page = No. 99 ISSN 0164-8497[/tpl]

===Preaching and traveling===

Main preaching activities by the means of traveling sankirtana parties were centered in United States. BBT (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) Library Party headed by him in mid-1970s was active in establishing distribution network mainly to the Universities of the United States, with some members of the team such as Bhakti Tirtha Swami and Suhotra Dasa traveling as far as Eastern Europe.
In 1974, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was requested by Prabhupada to join him as traveling GBC servant, replacing previous servant Srutakirti Dasa and travelled as a menial servant around the globe.

===Managing BTG===

From the early days of ISKCON, the Back to Godheadmagazine Back to Godhead - official magazine of ISKCON[tpl]Verify credibility|date=October 2008[/tpl] was project required a lot of both contribution and supervision.Popular Religious Magazines of the United States - Page 61 by Mark Fackler, Charles H. Lippy, 1995 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was editor in chief and one of the main contributors to this magazine till 1991, when assisted editor Jayadvaita Swami took over as the editor in chief.

===Dealing with early "zonal acarya" days===

In accordance with ISKCON GBC Governing Body Commission resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami along with other eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones after the departure of Prabhupada from the planet.See: Back to Godhead, Notes from the Editor, #1301/02 1978 Initial preaching areas in the United States and Caribbean were expanded with an addition of Ireland in 1982 where he became a zonal acharya.[tpl]citation| author=RTÉ| authorlink=| title=Irish times - Televised debate with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| journal=Irish Times| year=1983| volume=Fri 08| issue=April| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/search/archive.html?rm=listresults&filter=dateasc&keywords=Satsvarupa+dasa&daterange=custom&day1=1&mon1=1&year1| pages=26 | format=[/tpl][tpl]citation | author=RTÉ| authorlink=| title=ILate Late show - announcement - special guest Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| journal=Irish Times| year=1984| volume=Fri 30| issue=April| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/search/archive.html?rm=listresults&filter=dateasc&keywords=Satsvarupa+dasa&daterange=custom&day1=1&mon1=1&year1| pages=30[/tpl] The assumption of equal status to Srila Prabhupada and the title of acharya are still surrounded in a controversy. While following the direction of Governing Body Commission, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the founder-acharya. While imitation of Prabhupada was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Prabhupada’s mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Prabhupada’s gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.[tpl]Harvnb|Ketola|2008|loc=part seven[/tpl]

===Later years===

In years 1978-1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an Acharya while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986-1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the "most vocal in the cause of reform" in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami recorded this period in his book Guru Reform Notebook (1987). Throughout the years that followed, up until the end of the century, new ISKCON guru system was further developed.
In 1999 Governing Body Commission confirmed GBC Emeritus status of his membership of the Governing Body of ISKCON.
His extensive traveling in Europe in 1990s included areas of Scandinavia, Eastern, Central Europe and Italy, but mainly centered in preaching in Ireland and UK.
In following years, his devotional life has included the creation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that capture and express the artist's vision of Krishna consciousness. His latest literary work is centered on his commentary on Bhagavata Purana known as A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam.
In 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment. In consultation with the official governing body of the Krishna consciousness society, he agreed to cease initiating disciples.Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Visitors in About the Author, (2007)  With the GBC consultation, he retained his Goswami title and continued in the sannyasa order and as an ISKCON guru.[tpl]cite book |author=Rochford, E.
