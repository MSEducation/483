The 1980–81 season was Manchester United's 78th season in the Football League, and their 6th consecutive season in the top division of English football.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season1981.html |title=Manchester United Season 1980/81 |accessdate=21 December 2011|publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk [/tpl] It was the last of their four seasons under the management of Dave Sexton, who was sacked after the end of the season after failing to win the club a major trophy. Sexton was succeeded by West Bromwich Albion manager Ron Atkinson.
The club also paid a club record of more than £1 million for Nottingham Forest striker Garry Birtles, but the player was a huge disappointment and ended the season without having scored a single league goal for the club. The club's top scorer was Joe Jordan, who found the back of the net 15 times.
