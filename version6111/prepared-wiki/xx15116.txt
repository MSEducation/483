</ref> See [[Data Encryption Standard#DES's Achilles' heel: key length|DES]] for background.
The project leader was John Gilmore, and the goal of the project was to demonstrate beyond question that DES was insecure. As many cypherpunks saw it, this was necessary because the US government had been telling deliberate lies about the security of DES for some time.

===Expert panels===

Cypherpunks also participated, along with other experts, in several reports on cryptographic matters.
One such paper was Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security. It suggested 75 bits was the minimum key size to allow an existing cipher to be considered secure and kept in service. At the time, the Data Encryption Standard with 56-bit keys was still a US government standard, mandatory for some applications.
Other papers were critical analysis of government schemes. The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption, evaluated escrowed encryption proposals. Comments on the Carnivore System Technical Review. looked at an FBI scheme for monitoring email.
Cypherpunks provided significant input to the 1996 National Research Council report on encryption policy,
Cryptography's Role In Securing the Information Society (CRISIS)[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl][/ref]
This report, commissioned by the U.S. Congress in 1993, was developed via extensive hearings across the nation from all interested stakeholders, by a committee of talented people.  It recommended a gradual relaxation of the existing U.S. government restrictions on encryption.  Like many such study reports, its conclusions were largely ignored by policy-makers.  Later events such as the final rulings in the cypherpunks lawsuits forced a more complete relaxation of the unconstitutional controls on encryption software.

===Lawsuits===

Cypherpunks have filed a number of lawsuits, mostly suits against the US government alleging that some government action is unconstitutional.
Phil Karn sued the State Department in 1994 over cryptography export controls  after they ruled that, while the book Applied Cryptography[ref]
</ref> could legally be exported, a floppy disk containing a verbatim copy of code printed in the book was legally a munition and required an export permit, which they refused to grant. Karn also appeared before both House and Senate committees looking at cryptography issues.
Daniel J. Bernstein, supported by the EFF, also sued over the export restrictions, arguing that preventing publication of cryptographic source code is an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech. He won, effectively overturning the export law. See Bernstein v. United States for details.
Peter Junger also sued on similar grounds, and won.
John Gilmore has sued US Attorneys General Ashcroft and Gonzales, arguing that the requirement to present identification documents before boarding a plane is unconstitutional. These suits have not been successful to date.

===Civil disobedience===

Cypherpunks encouraged civil disobedience, in particular US law on the export of cryptography. Until 1996, cryptographic code was legally a munition, and until 2000 export required a permit.
In 1995 Adam Back wrote a version of the RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography in three lines of Perl and suggested people use it as an email signature file:

 #!/bin/perl -sp0777i<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<j]dsj
 $/=unpack('H*',$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k"SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1
 lK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp"|dc`;s/\W//g;$_=pack('H*',/((..)*)$/)</code>
Vince Cate put up a web page that invited anyone to become an international arms trafficker; every time someone clicked on the form, an export-restricted item — originally PGP, later a copy of Back's program — would be mailed from a US server to one in Anguilla. This gained overwhelming attention.  There were options to add your name to a list of such traffickers and to send email to the President of the United States registering your protest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ieee-security.org/Cipher/PastIssues/1998/issue9810/issue9810.txt|first=Marie Ellen|last=Zurko|title=Crypto policy costs the US a citizen|journal=Electronic CIPHER: Newsletter of the IEEE Computer Society's TC on Security and Privacy|issue=29|date=1998-10-07|accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://tbtf.com/archive/1996-05-05.html#i-a-traf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970116044849/http://www.tbtf.com/archive/05-05-96.html#i-a-traf|first=Keith|last=Dawson|title=Become an international arms trafficker in one click|work=Tasty Bits from the Technology Front|date=1996-05-05|accessdate=2013-10-11|archivedate=1997-01-16[/tpl]

===Cypherpunk fiction===

In Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon many characters are on the "Secret Admirers" mailing list. This is fairly obviously based on the cypherpunks list, and several well-known cypherpunks are mentioned in the acknowledgements. Much of the plot revolves around cypherpunk ideas; the leading characters are building a data haven which will allow anonymous financial transactions, and the book is full of cryptography.
But, according to the author the book's title is — in spite of its similarity — not based on the Cyphernomicon, an online cypherpunk FAQ document.

===Legacy===

Cypherpunk achievements would later also be used on the Canadian E-Wallet, the MintChip, and the creation of Bitcoin.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back e.g. Adam Back: hashcash  It was an inspiration for CryptoParty decades later to such an extent that the Cypherpunk Manifesto is quoted (see below) at the header of its Wiki,index CryptoParty.org and Eric Hughes delivered the keynote address at the Amsterdam, The Netherlands CryptoParty on 27 August 2012.

==Noteworthy cypherpunks==

Cypherpunks list participants included many notable computer industry figures. Most were list regulars, although not all would call themselves "cypherpunks".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/09/55114 | work=Wired | title=Warm Party for a Code Group | date=September 13, 2002[/tpl]
