===Culture===

Northwestern works to integrate "faith and learning" as the main goal of the college education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nwciowa.edu/academics/faithandlearning/|title=Faith and learning|publisher= Northwestern College|accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612193702/http://www.nwciowa.edu/academics/faithandlearning/  |archivedate = 2008-06-12[/tpl] The liberal arts are to be taught, not as self-contained disciplines, but as part of a greater whole. Another motto of the academic culture is "a whole education for your whole life".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nwciowa.edu/faith/|title=Faith|publisher= Northwestern College|accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] "Vocare: Find Your Place" is a project funded by a Lilly Endowment grant that aims to help students find their life's calling and follow it earnestly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nwciowa.edu/vocare/|title=Find Your Place|publisher= Northwestern College|accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614040855/http://www.nwciowa.edu/vocare/  |archivedate = 2008-06-14[/tpl] These goals and projects take form in many ways, both student and faculty-initiated.

===Spring service projects===

For college students all over the country, spring break means road trips to big cities and balmy beaches. Northwestern students do that too, but some of them pack a hammer. Northwestern College annually sends more than 200 students, faculty and staff in teams to serve with ministries in the U.S. and around the world. SSP teams have traveled to Nicaragua and the Netherlands, to California, New York, Oklahoma and Florida. Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans and other Gulf Coast communities have been frequent destinations. SSP teams build and repair homes, minister in prisons, tutor at youth centers, serve in soup kitchens, live with residents in homeless shelters and more. 
Spring Service Projects integrate faith, service and cross-cultural learning within a team setting that also allows for the involvement of faculty and staff. The SSP program benefits both the ministries and the students who serve: The efforts of a variety of ministries are encouraged, supported and helped in tangible ways. In addition, Northwestern students are challenged and strengthened in their faith as they see and experience the gospel being lived out in cultures different than the one in which they live.
Spring Service Projects provide students opportunities to participate in mission work taking place domestically and abroad during annual spring breaks in early March.  Students have spent their ten-day breaks serving in city missions, youth hostels, construction sites, disaster relief zones, and low-income schools.http://www.nwciowa.edu/faith/missions/ssp/

===Summer of Service===

The Summer of Service (SOS) program at Northwestern College challenges, prepares and encourages students to be effective Christian servants in the world. It also exists to assist and support missionaries and the communities they work in. Each year, 20 to 25 students serve cross-culturally for at least six weeks in the U.S. or overseas. Past participants have traveled to countries like Croatia, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Malawi, Russia, South Africa and Thailand to serve with mission agencies like The Luke Society, Dublin Christian Mission, Pioneers International and TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance Mission). They have worked in hospitals, orphanages and refugee camps; taught Vacation Bible School and English as a second language; and served in sports and hospitality ministries.
Summer of Service team members return from their summer experiences more aware of the worldâ€™s problems and promises and more equipped to wrestle with biblical applications to what they experienced. Often these students remain involved in service and mission, either full- or part-time after graduating from college.http://www.nwciowa.edu/spiritual-life/mission-opportunities/sos-team
