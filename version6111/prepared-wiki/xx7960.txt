==History==

The company was founded in 1945 by Harold "Matt" Matson and Elliot Handler. Handler's wife, Ruth Handler, later became president, and she is credited with establishing the Barbie product line for the company in 1959.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] After the release of the Barbie doll, Mattel revolutionized the toy industry with its talking dolls and toys. After release of the talking Chatty Cathy doll in 1960, See 'N Say toys in 1965, and the introduction of the Hot Wheels line in 1968, it moved Mattel to its position as the number one toymaker in America.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1971, Mattel purchased the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus for $40 million from Irvin Feld. The Feld family bought the circus back in 1982.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1986, Mattel acquired Hong Kong based Arco Toys, a maker of action figures.
In the late 1980s, Mattel was the PAL manufacturer chosen by Nintendo to make and market the Nintendo Entertainment System. This had followed a failed attempt by Nintendo to enter a similar worldwide deal with Atari. After not securing an agreement with Atari, even later entering into various lawsuits with that company, Nintendo decided instead to take a risk and bring their console to North America on their own, while cutting PAL manufacturing and marketing costs by entering into a deal with Mattel. Mattel had previously made the Intellivision in 1979, and had some experience in the Video Games industry at that time. Nintendo had, in a previous incarnation, also been a toy manufacturer and the two companies believed they had much in common.
After the success of the system in America, this deal was later considered a mistake, in hindsight, by Nintendo, as the Mattel version of the console was outsold in the PAL regions by the main rival, the Sega Master System. Nintendo had misjudged Mattels enthusiasm for the console, which they had not considered a core product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/gycw-nes-ports-1-contra/ |title=Guru Larry's Retrospective on the regional variations and releases of the European Nintendo Entertainment System |publisher=Blisteredthumbs.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02[/tpl]
In May 1999, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Mattel acquired The Learning Company for $3.5 billion in stock[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_1_23/ai_69259287/pg_10  |title=Mattel sells Learning Co. – Buy high, sell low |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=January 1, 2001 |accessdate=July 31, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] or 4.5 times annual sales.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pdf/2002-1-0072.pdf |format=PDF|title=Learning from Mattel |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |publisher=Tuck School of Business[/tpl] The Learning Company had in 1997 accumulated losses of $475 million.[tpl]cite news |first=Larry |last=Dignan |title=Mattel/The Learning Co. in $3.8B merger |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-513105.html |publisher=ZDNet news |date=December 14, 1998 |accessdate=December 6, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223014556/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-513105.html  |archivedate = December 23, 2007[/tpl]
In December 2000, Mattel sued the band Aqua, saying their song "Barbie Girl" violated the Barbie trademark and turned Barbie into a sex object, referring to her as a "blonde bimbo." The lawsuit was rejected in 2002.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2150432.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Barbie loses battle over bimbo image |date=July 25, 2002 |accessdate=August 8, 2007[/tpl]
In 2002, Mattel closed its last factory in the United States, originally part of the Fisher-Price division, outsourcing production to China which began a chain of events that led to a scandal involving lead contamination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20070801/toy_recall_070830/ |title=CTV article on recall |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=June 9, 2011[/tpl]
On August 14, 2007, Mattel recalled over 18 million products. Many of the products had exceeded the US limits set on surface coatings that contain lead. Surface coatings cannot exceed .06% lead by weight.[tpl]cite web|last=Story|first=Louise|title=Lead Paint Prompts Mattel to Recall 967,000 Toys|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/business/02toy.html?_r=0|accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl]  Additional recalls were because it was possible that some toys could pose a danger to children due to the use of strong magnets that may detach. Mattel re-wrote its policy on magnets, finally issuing a recall in August 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://service.mattel.com/us/recall/default.asp?recall_id=52431 |title=Mattel to announce toy recall |publisher=Service.mattel.com |accessdate=June 9, 2011[/tpl] The recall included 7.1 million Polly Pocket toys produced before November 2006; 600,000 Barbie and Tanner Playsets; 1 million Doggie Daycare; Shonen Jump's One Piece; and thousands of Batman Manga toys due to exposed magnets. In 2009 Mattel would pay a $2.9 million fine to the Consumer Products Safety Commission for marketing, importing, and selling non-compliant toys.[tpl]cite web|last=Kavitanz|first=Parija|title=Mattel fined $2.3 million over lead in toys|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/05/news/companies/cpsc/|accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl]
Mattel was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, noting that only 1,292 positions were newly filled out of 164,045 job applications during the previous year, as well as the fact that more than 1,000 employees have been with the company longer than 15 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/best-companies/2013/snapshots/96.html?iid=bc_lp_arrow1 |title=Mattel - Best Companies to Work For 2013 - Fortune |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-07-10[/tpl]

==Mattel Electronics==

===History===

In 1971, a Mattel subsidiary Optigan Corporation released an electronic keyboard instrument based on pre-recorded optical soundtracks - Optigan.
In the early 1980s, Mattel – through its M Network division – released game cartridges for Atari 2600 consoles. In the mid-1980s, Mattel Electronics decided to make its own video game console, the Intellivision. After this failed, the company formed a deal with Nintendo in order to bring the Nintendo Entertainment System to the PAL regions. This was later believed to have been a mistake on Nintendo's part, as their North American success with the console (and its Japanese counterpart, the Famicom) was not replicated in the PAL regions, and they were outsold in these regions by the Sega Master System. This resulted in Nintendo being unhappy with the arrangement with Mattel, and cutting ties with the company. Nintendo released the Gameboy without Mattel's involvement and as a result, it was far more successful than the NES was.

==Critics==

2012, China Labor Watch (CLW) investigated labor conditions and informed the CEO, and responsible for corporate responsibility about the issues. 2013, CLW reminded the Mattel responsibles that Mattels own global manufacturing principles are not respected, and criticized that Kathleen A. Shaver and Bryan Stockton are denying the existence of problems instead of trying to correct them.Response Letter To Mattel: CLW’s investigation of four factories making Mattel toys, 2013-05Global Manufacturing Principles.
