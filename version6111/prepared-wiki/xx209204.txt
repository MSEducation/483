Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith is English folk / rock singer-songwriter and guitarist Roy Harper's second album and was released in 1968. The album was re-issued in 1977 as The Early Years.

==History==

Columbia Records, recognising Harper's potential, hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce the album. Musically it was notable for the 11 minute track "Circle", "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth" that, according to Harper was "totally unlike anything anyone else was doing. The Beatles weren’t doing anything like that at the time. The Stones weren’t doing anything like it, either. No-one was"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/uncut/roy-harper-i-was-an-absolute-rebel-i-once-painted-the-local-town-hall-with-swastikas-and-hamme |title=2011 Roy Harper Interview |publisher=Uncut.co.uk|date=July 2011 |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
Careerwise, the album was notable for marking a widening of Harper's musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music heard at the time. Harper had an interest in traditional folk but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained:-[tpl]quote| I was too much of a modernist, really. Just too modern for what was going on in the folk clubs. I wanted to modernise music, but more than that to completely modernise people’s attitudes towards life in general. I was involved in trying to bring (more) meat to the (contemporary) folk music...(of the time).2008 Roy Harper interview. Popmatters.com. Retrieved on 9 December 2011.[/tpl]
Harper's record company had different expectations. "They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album...they didn’t have a clue. They wanted hits. And I gave them "Circle"". Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album. During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig; manager of The Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix.

==Re-releases==

In 1977 the album was re-issued by CBS with a different cover under the title The Early Years. In 1991 the album was re-released again by Awareness Records with new artwork and additional content. 
The track "You Don't Need Money" appeared on the first bargain priced sampler album, The Rock Machine Turns You On, as "Nobody's Got Any Money In The Summer".
