Shamo or Ko-Shamo (軍鶏 or シャモ) is a breed of chicken of Japan which was originated in Thailand. The name "Shamo" was a corruption of "Siam" during the early Edo period but has been selectively bred for several hundred years and is very different from the original stock. Shamo in reality is a strain of the Asil (Kaura), taken to Siam (Thailand) and Taiwan and from there to Japan. Its real place of origin is Sindh, Pakistan and secondary place of origin is present day India (Hyderabad Dakkan and Rampure). This breed is used as fighting cocks for naked heeled cockboxing in Japanese cockfights, where it is still legal. It is also bred all over the world for its show quality and unique upright posture. Ko-shamo is mixture of O-shamo with small legged breeds.
