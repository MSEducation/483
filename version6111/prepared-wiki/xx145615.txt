Kevin Howley (1924-1997) was an English football referee from Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, who officiated in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Career==

Howley was 35 years of age when he took charge of the 1960 FA Cup Final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers, at the time the youngest ever referee to do so (The Daily Mirror, 7 May 1960, p.29). A newspaper of the time christened this the "The Dustbin Final", because Blackburn supporters, enraged by incidents during the game, threw rubbish at the Wolves players and their manager, Stan Cullis, as they were leaving the arena. Howley came in for certain criticism for allowing a dubious Wolves goal to stand. Dave Whelan also suffered a broken leg during the first half."The Dustbin Final", FA Cup 1960: Truls Månsson's Unofficial Wolverhampton Wanderers Site.
Howley represented England in the 1964 European Nations' Cup Preliminary round, when Spain defeated Romania by 6-0 on 1 November 1962, and also two matches in the qualifying rounds of the renamed competition in 1968, the European Championship. He was selected for the 1966 World Cup, acting as a linesman throughout the tournament, notably  for referee Ken Dagnall in the third place play-off match between Portugal and the Soviet Union at Wembley.
The final League match of Howley's career was the match between Tottenham and Arsenal at White Hart Lane on 3 May 1971; Arsenal won the game 1-0 and with it the First Division title, which formed the first part of the Double they achieved that season.† He died aged 73 in 1997 (The Guardian, 23 July 1997, p.22).
