==Life==

He entered the Franciscan Order at Mayorga in the Province of Santiago, built the monastery of Santa Maria del Berrogal, and was the chief founder of the Custody of San Gabriel, for which he visited Rome. 
In 1523 he was chosen to head a band of twelve Franciscans who were to work for the conversion of the Mexican natives. They reached their destination on May, 1524, and were received by Hernán Cortés shortly after their arrival.  Martin, as apostolic delegate, presided at the first ecclesiastical synod in the New World, 2 July 1524. At the same time he established the Custody of the Holy Gospel, of which he was elected the first custos. After an interval of three years he was re-elected in 1530. 
He led a penitential life, and he and his eleven companions, the band known as the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, are said to have baptized large numbers.
