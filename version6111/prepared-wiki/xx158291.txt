A work crew installing a utility pole support anchor punctured an underground natural gas pipeline, causing the explosion. The blast killed four people, injured eleven, destroyed six buildings, and caused an estimated $399,000 in damages.
An NTSB report on the incident faulted the safety and emergency practices of Cable Constructors, Inc., whose employees punctured the gas line, and the procedures and training of the St. Cloud fire department for responding to gas leaks.
