[[Radioligand]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry methods, Biomolecules, Receptors

A radioligand is a radioactive biochemical substance (in particular, a ligand) that is used for diagnosis or for research-oriented study of the receptor systems of the body.
In a neuroimaging application the radioligand is injected into the pertinent tissue, or infused into the bloodstream. 
It binds to its receptor.
When the radioactive isotope in the ligand decays it can be measured by positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In in vivo systems it is often used to quantify the binding of a test molecule to the binding site of radio ligand. The higher the affinity of the molecule the more radio ligand is displaced from the binding site and the increasing radioactive decay can be measured by scintillography. This assay is commonly used to calculate binding constant of molecules to receptors.
The transport of the radioligand is described by receptor kinetics.

==History==

Radioligands are credited with making possible the study of biomolecular behaviour, a previously mysterious area of research that had evaded researchers. With this capacity radioligand techniques enabled researchers to identify receptor devices within cells.

==Radioactive isotopes commonly used==

In PET the isotopes fluorine-18 and carbon-11 are often used in molecular neuroimaging.

==List of radioligands==

Radioligands may be constructed to bind selectively to a particular neuroreceptor or a particular neurotransmitter transporter.
