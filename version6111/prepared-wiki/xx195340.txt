Glass Candy is an American electronic music duo that formed in 1996 in Portland, Oregon by vocalist Ida No and producer and guitarist Johnny Jewel. While the band's early work blends elements of no wave, indie rock, and glam rock, their later work incorporates  disco, electronic rock, hip-hop, and industrial.
The band has evolved consistently through the years since their original collaboration, and experimenting with various musical styles. They have released a number of albums since the early 2000s, their most recent full-length being the B-side compilation album Deep Gems (2008). The band's upcoming studio album, Body Work, is set to be released sometime in the future.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Glass Candy was formed by Ida No, from Vancouver, Washington, and Johnny Jewel (born John Padgett), from Austin, Texas, in 1996.[tpl]cite journal |last=Rachel |first=T. Cole |date=April 2008 |title=Welcome to the Good Life |work=The Fader |issue=53 |page=74[/tpl] The two met the year before at a Fred Meyer grocery store where Jewel worked in Portland, Oregon.[tpl]cite web |last=Byrne |first=Michael |url=http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2008/02/glass-candy-mystical-death-disco |title=Glass Candy: Mystical Death Disco |work=XLR8R |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=December 7, 2012[/tpl] They soon began producing music under the name Glass Candy and the Shattered Theatre.
No describes their early work as "droney and weird." Nonetheless, their early releases show a heavy glam and new wave influence, as evidenced in their self-released first three singles, "Brittle Women" (1999), "Metal Gods" (2001) and a cover of Josie Cotton's "Johnny Are You Queer" (2002). They toured with The Convocation Of... in 2001, and released a live album that year on Vermin Scum.[tpl]cite web |last=Carr |first=Daphne |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/glass-candy-mn0000560554/biography |title=Glass Candy |publisher=AllMusic.

Their debut studio album, Love Love Love, was issued on Troubleman Unlimited Records in 2003. In 2006, Jewel founded Italians Do It Better with Mike Simonetti as a subsidiary of Troubleman. In November 2007, Glass Candy released their second studio album B/E/A/T/B/O/X on Italians Do It Better to considerable critical praise. A compilation album titled Deep Gems was released in late 2008, containing rarities, B-sides, and remixes. In a review of Deep Gems, Spin magazine referred to the band as an "eccentric Portland pair" that "spook the dance floor".[tpl]cite web |last=Beta |first=Andy |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/glass-candy-deep-gems-italians-do-it-better |title=Glass Candy, 'Deep Gems' (Italians Do It Better) |work=Spin |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2009[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

No's vocals have been likened to '60s German singer Nico and "a frightened Debbie Harry or a pissed-off Lene Lovich in a haunted disco". Their work as of 2008 borrows from Italo disco, freestyle music, Krautrock, hip hop, and new wave.
Jewel has cited Marilyn Monroe films, 1980s cop show soundtracks, Goblin, and John Carpenter soundtracks as inspirational.[tpl]cite web |last=Madigan |first=Claire |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/weblogs/street/2007/oct/31/must-see-opener-glass-candy/ |title=MUST-SEE OPENER: Glass Candy |work=U-T San Diego |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2008[/tpl] All music tracks are produced by basic analog equipment, without the use of computers.Rachel 2008, p. 75. Critics have also compared the group to Nina Hagen, The Shirelles,Rachel, p. 154. David Bowie, James Chance, and Jarboe. Glass Candy has covered songs by James "Sugar Boy" Crawford, Kraftwerk, Roxy Music, Belle Epoque, Dark Day,[tpl]cite web |last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10351-after-dark/ |title=Various Artists: After Dark |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2008[/tpl] The Rolling Stones, and Queen.
