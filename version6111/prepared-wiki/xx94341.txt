==Storms==

===Subtropical Storm One===

In the middle of January, an upper-level trough in the westerlies spawned a surface low pressure area to the east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles to the south of the subtropical ridge. Isolated from the detrimental effects of the westerlies, it was initially non-tropical in nature and intensified through a baroclinic energy source, or one that derives energy from the interaction of cold and warm air. Convection increased slightly despite cool sea surface temperatures of around 75° F (24° C). At 1200 UTC on January 18, it organized into a subtropical depression about 1725 mi (2790 km) east-northeast of Puerto Rico while maintaining a general westward track, which it would maintain for much of its duration.[tpl]cite web|author=Miles B.

===Tropical Storm Amelia===

Tropical Storm Amelia formed in the western Gulf of Mexico near Brownsville, Texas on July 30. The storm moved over land, but continued to intensify to a 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm. Land then took its toll, and the storm dissipated over Texas on August 1. Flooding rains due to torrential rains were reported to have reached [tpl]convert|48|in|mm[/tpl] led to the deaths of 30 people in Texas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/amelia1978.html|author=David M.

===Tropical Storm Bess===

A low pressure area developed in Georgia along a dissipating cold front on August 1. The system detached from the cold front and drifted southwestward, reaching northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 3. Satellite imagery, buoys, and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that by August 5, the system likely acquired a closed circulation. Thus, the National Hurricane Center estimated that a tropical depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC that day. On August 6, a reconnaissance flight into the depression resulted in an upgrade to Tropical Storm Bess, while located about [tpl]convert|250|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The storm had initially headed west-southwestward at [tpl]convert|8|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], before moving southwestward at nearly the same speed.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0073-jpg/1978/atlantic/bess/postevent/prelim.01.jpg|page=1|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Bess|author=Paul J. Hebert|date=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] 
At 1200 UTC on August 7, Bess attained its minimum barometric pressure of [tpl]convert|1005|mbar|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Thereafter, Bess began to turn nearly due southward under the influence of a high pressure area over southern Texas. Later on August 7, the storm reached its maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Early on August 8, Bess made landfall near Nautla, Veracruz, at the same intensity and then rapidly dissipated inland. In Tuxpan, Veracruz and Tampico, Tamaulipas, sustained winds reached only [tpl]convert|29|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0073-jpg/1978/atlantic/bess/postevent/prelim.02.jpg|page=2|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Bess|author=Paul J.

Roth|date=April 27, 2010|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] However, no flooding occurred and no damage or fatalities were reported.
 

===Hurricane Cora===

The tropical depression that became Hurricane Cora formed on August 7 in the tropical Atlantic. It gradually strengthened to a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane, but weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Windward Islands. The storm continued to weaken, and dissipated on August 12 near the island of Aruba.
 

===Tropical Storm Debra===

The origins of Debra were from the combination of a low that formed over southeast Florida and an area of convection near the Yucatan Peninsula, possibly related to a tropical wave. A tropical depression formed on August 26 in the Gulf of Mexico, tracking west-northwestward around a high pressure ridge. Gradual intensification began, and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra on August 28. The storm turned to the north, and it reached its peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) on August 29, shortly before making landfall in southwestern Louisiana. It was a disorganized storm, with most of the convection located to the east of the center.[tpl]cite report|author=Miles B.

===Hurricane Ella===

A cold front spawned a tropical disturbance near Bermuda, which became a tropical depression on August 30. The depression strengthened, and by early on August 31, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ella. Ship reports indicated that Ella became a hurricane later that day. Further significant intensification occurred, and the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h). A short-wave trough over the Eastern United States caused Ella to decelerate and turn north.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/prenhc/prelim_ella_30-05.01.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Ella|page=1|author=Miles B. Lawrence|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] Simultaneously, dry air diminished convection on September 2, which in turn resulted in weakening.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/tropdisc/tcd0303z.jpg|title=Tropical Cyclone Discussion Hurricane Ella|author=Paul J.

Lawrence|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate= January 1, 2013[/tpl] Eventually, another trough forced Ella to re-curve northeastward, thereby remaining well offshore the East Coast of the United States.
The storm then re-intensified and by 1200 UTC on September 4, Ella peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). Thereafter, Ella rapidly weakened as it passed offshore Atlantic Canada, before being absorbed by an extratropical storm while located more than [tpl]convert|700|mi|km[/tpl] northeast of St. John's. Ella threatened to pass within [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] of North Carolina during Labor Day Weekend.[tpl]cite web|author=Miles B.

===Hurricane Flossie===

A tropical wave passed westward across Dakar, Senegal on August 31 and entered the Atlantic Ocean later that day. Convection markedly increased over the next few days and by 0000 UTC on September 4, the wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Later that day, the Hong Kong Merchant reported tropical storm force winds, thus the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. It initially tracked northwestward at [tpl]convert|23|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and minimal strengthening occurred, possibly due to rapid forward speeds. On September 5, the storm curved westward, until turning north on September 7. A high pressure area transitioned into a trough, causing Flossie to re-curve northeastward and generating strong upper-level winds.
On September 8, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0072-jpg/1978/atlantic/flossie/prenhc/flossie_sept3-sept16.01.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Flossie|author=Paul J. Hebert|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|page=1|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] After the trough began weakening, favorable conditions returned, allowing Flossie to re-strengthen into a tropical storm on September 10. Flossie then decelerated and became nearly stationary on September 12. Around that time, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. Further intensification continued, and Flossie peaked with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) early on September 13. The storm began turned nearly due northward and began weakening. Flossie accelerated to the northeast and eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while [tpl]convert|700|mi|km[/tpl] north of the Azores on September 15.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0072-jpg/1978/atlantic/flossie/prenhc/flossie_sept3-sept16.02.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Flossie|author=Paul J. Hebert|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|page=2|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] The strong extratropical cyclone brought winds as high as [tpl]convert|104|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] to Fair Isle, Great Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~taharley/british_weather_in_septemb.htm|title=The British weather in September|author=Trevor A.

===Hurricane Greta===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 7 and developed into a tropical depression near Trinidad on September 13. By the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Greta. It headed westward to west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and slowly intensified, becoming a hurricane on September 16.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0077-jpg/1978/atlantic/greta/prenhc/prelim_greta_13-23.01.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Greta (& Hurricane Olivia)|page=1|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] The rate of intensification increased as Greta was approaching the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Greta briefly peaked as a Category 4 hurricane while brushing northeastern Honduras. Although the storm remained offshore, land interaction caused significant weakening. On September 19, Greta made landfall in Stann Creek District, Belize with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0077-jpg/1978/atlantic/greta/prenhc/prelim_greta_13-23.02.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Greta (& Hurricane Olivia)|year=1978|page=2|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] The storm rapidly weakened inland over Central America, but survived its passage and eventually became Hurricane Olivia in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0077-jpg/1978/atlantic/greta/prenhc/prelim_greta_13-23.03.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Greta (& Hurricane Olivia)|page=3|year=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl]   
Luckily, death and damage was much lower than Hurricane Fifi, a similar hurricane that devastated the same area in 1974. This was likely due to the lack of flooding, as well as using proper warnings from the affected countries. In all, Greta caused 5 deaths and over $75 million (2005 USD) in damage.  

===Tropical Storm Hope===

A mid-tropospheric low pressure area developed over the Southeastern United States on September 10. The system developed into a subtropical depression early on September 12, while located about [tpl]convert|75|mi|km[/tpl] east of St. Augustine, Florida. Over the next few days, the depression tracked east-northeastward to eastward. While strengthening into a subtropical storm on September 15, it passed just north of Bermuda,[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0078-jpg/1978/atlantic/hope/prenhc/hopesept11-sept21.01.jpg|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Hope|author=Gilbert B. Clark|date=1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] but produced only [tpl]convert|1.07|in|mm[/tpl] of rain on the island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/tcmaxima.html|title=Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima|year=2012|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] The storm then made a brief dip to the east-southeast, before resuming its east-northeastward course on September 16. Beginning on the following day, satellite imagery indicated that the system was acquiring tropical characteristics. As a result, it was reclassified as Tropical Storm Hope at 0600 UTC on September 17. 
Because Hope remained out of range of reconnaissance aircraft flights, the National Hurricane Center relied on ships and satellite estimates. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hope began to accelerate while slowly intensifying. Satellite estimates at 1200 UTC on September 19 indicated that the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum pressure of [tpl]convert|987|mbar|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl], recorded by the S.S. Banglar Mann. While located hundreds of miles north of the Azores on September 20, the storm turned northward and began crossing into sea surface temperatures of [tpl]convert|68|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0078-jpg/1978/atlantic/hope/tropdisc/tcd201500z.jpg|title=Tropical Cyclone Discussion Tropical Storm Hope|author=Miles B. Lawrence|date=September 20, 1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 1, 2013[/tpl] By 1200 UTC on September 21, Hope transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was absorbed by another extratropical storm while situated about [tpl]convert|220|mi|km[/tpl] south of Reykjavík, Iceland. 
 

===Tropical Storm Irma===

The origins of Tropical Storm Irma were from a subtropical depression that formed about 500 mi (805 km) south of the Azores on October 2.  During the next two days, thunderstorm activity gradually increased around the circulation center as the storm drifted northward. On October 2, the storm had taken the appearance of a tropical storm on satellite photographs, and upper-level anticyclonic flow over the center of the storm was evident on satellite time-lapse movies. By the afternoon of October 4, the system had acquired the characteristics of a tropical storm and was named Irma; the gale-force winds extended 150 mi (240 km) from the center of circulation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1978-prelim/irma/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report: Tropical Storm Irma|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0079-jpg/1978/atlantic/irma/public/pub041600z.jpg|title=Advisory 1|last=Pelissier|date=4 October 1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl]
Six hours after being named, Irma reached its peak intensity of 50 mph (80 km/h).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1978-prelim/irma/prelim02.gif|title=Preliminary Best Track: Tropical Storm Irma|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] On October 5, Tropical Storm Irma turned towards the north-northeast and passed about midway between the central and western Azores. Shortly thereafter, Irma became less organized,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0079-jpg/1978/atlantic/irma/public/pub051600z.jpg|title=Advisory 5|last=Pelissier|date=5 October 1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] and that evening was absorbed into an approaching cold front, about 450 mi (725 km) northeast of the Azores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0079-jpg/1978/atlantic/irma/public/pub052200z.jpg|title=Advisory 6|last=Lawrence|first=Miles B.|date=5 October 1978|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] Although Irma passed near parts of the western and central Azores with gale-force winds in some areas, no reports of damage or casualties caused by Irma were received. Several nearby ships reported winds around 46 mph (74 km/h). It was noted that heavy rains may have occurred on some of the mountainous islands as Irma passed.

===Tropical Storm Juliet===

Juliet formed from a tropical wave on October 7 about [tpl]convert|600|mi|km[/tpl] east of Puerto Rico. The storm passed north of the island, attained a wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h), and headed into the open Atlantic before dissipating on October 11 southwest of Bermuda. The highest rainfall report from Puerto Rico was [tpl]convert|4.51|in|mm[/tpl] from Toro Negro Plant.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/juliet1978.html|title=Tropical Storm Juliet|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=David M. Roth[/tpl] 

===Hurricane Kendra===

In late October, a tropical wave and an area of disturbed weather combined in the northwestern Caribbean, before crossing Puerto Rico. The system moved northwest and by late on October 28, it became a tropical depression while located about [tpl]convert|80|mi|km[/tpl] north of Mayaguana in The Bahamas. Early on the following day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kendra. The storm quickly intensified while moving either north or north-northwestward and became a hurricane late on October 29. After peaking with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on October 30, Kendra weakened significantly to a 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm in only 12 hours. Kendra continued north-northeastward or northeastward, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while located west-northwest of Bermuda early on November 1.
The precursor system dropped rainfall across much of southern Puerto Rico was at least [tpl]convert|7|in|mm[/tpl], with a peak at [tpl]convert|20.43|in|mm[/tpl] in Pico del Este. Mudslides and flooding from the heavy precipitation left many roads impassable, washed out or collapsed several bridges, and caused considerable damage to agriculture, especially livestock. Additionally, one fatality occurred and 1,710 families fled their homes for shelters. Damage in Puerto Rico reached $6 million. A high-pressure area and Kendra combined produced strong winds and abnormally high tides along the East Coast of the United States, though no damage was reported.
 

===Other storms===

In addition to the 12 other tropical cyclones, there were several tropical depressions that developed during the season. On August 7, a tropical depression formed about [tpl]convert|465|mi|km[/tpl] east of Barbados. It tracked westward without significantly intensifying, and passed through the Windward Islands over Bequia on the following day. The depression continued its westward motion, and passed near Aruba on August 9. It eventually traversed the Caribbean Sea, and made landfall to the south of Bluefields, Nicaragua on August 11.

The following names were used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic basin in 1978.[tpl]cite web|author=Associated Press|date=1978-05-31|title=Hedge Bets on Hurricanes|accessdate=2007-12-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=106090245_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=1&currentPage=0[/tpl] Storms were named Amelia, Bess, Cora, Flossie, Hope, Irma and Juliet for the first time in 1978. This was the last year that only female names were used, thus none of these names were used again. However, "Irma" will be re-instated in 2017 as a replacement when for "Irene", which was retired after its use in 2011. No names were retired after the 1978 season. Names that were not assigned are marked in [tpl]tcname unused[/tpl]. 

==Season effects==

This is a table of the storms in 1978 and their landfall(s), if any. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low.
