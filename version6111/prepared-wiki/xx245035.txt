Sophia Magdalena Krag Juel Vind (1734–1810), was a Danish Salon holder, landowner and noble. She is considered to have exerted considerable political influence in Danish politics during the late 18th century.  
Daughter of Carl Christian von Gram (1703–80) and Birgitte Christine Friis (1715–75) and in 1752 married to landowner Baron Jens Krag-Juel Vind (1724–1776). She belonged to the elite of the aristocraty and received the L’union parfaite in 1757. Nothing is known of her life prior to 1776. As a widow, she became the richest landowner of her country, and her house in Copenhagen became the center of the capitals aristocracy. During the 1780s and 1790s, she was the "hostess" of the “danske parti” (The Danish party) which opposed the ruling “tyske parti” (German party) who ruled Denmark from 1784, and she was in opposition to A.P. Bernstorff, Christian Ditlev, Ludvig Reventlow and Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann and was regarded a powerful enemy of the Reventlow family. In 1790, she was the instigator of proprietærfejde; the Jutian nobilitys opposition movement to the new country labour reforms, whose meetings took place at her estate Stensballegård; with her connections, she was a real treath to the ruling government.    
In 1799, she inherited the county of Frijsenborg after her aunt Elisabeth Sophie Desmercières.
