John Hunyadi ([tpl]lang-hu|Hunyadi János[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ro|Ioan de Hunedoara[/tpl]; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 1406–11 August 1456) was a  leading Hungarian military and political figure in Central and Southeastern Europe during the 15th century. According to most contemporary sources, he was son of a noble family of Romanian ancestry. He mastered his military skills on the southern borderlands of the Kingdom of Hungary that were exposed to Ottoman attacks. Appointed voivode of Transylvania and head of a number of southern counties, he assumed responsibility for the defense of the frontiers in 1441.
Hunyadi adopted the Hussite method of using wagons for military purposes. He employed professional soldiers, but also mobilized local peasantry against invaders. These innovations contributed to his earliest successes against the Ottoman troops who were plundering the southern marches in the early 1440s. Although defeated in the battle of Varna in 1444 and in the second battle of Kosovo in 1448, his successful "Long Campaign" across the Balkan Mountains in 1443–44 and defence of Belgrade/Nándorfehérvár in 1456, against troops led personally by the Sultan established his reputation as a great general. The bells of Catholic and older Protestant churches are daily rung at noon to commemorate the Belgrade victory, although the pope had ordered this in advance, a week before the siege, in order to encourage the soldiers fighting for Christendom.
John Hunyadi was also an eminent statesman. He actively took part in the civil war between the partisans of Wladislas I and the minor Ladislaus V, two claimants to the throne of Hungary in the early 1440s, on behalf on the former. Popular among the lesser nobility, the Diet of Hungary appointed him, in 1445, as one of the seven "captains of the realm" responsible for the administration of state affairs until Ladislaus V (by that time unanimously accepted as king) came of age. The next Diet went even further, electing Hunyadi as sole regent with the title of governor. When he resigned from this office in 1452, the sovereign awarded him with the first hereditary title (perpetual count of Beszterce/Bistrița) in the Kingdom of Hungary. He had by this time become one of the wealthiest landowners in the kingdom, and preserved his influence in the Diet up until his death.
This Athleta Christi ("Christ's Champion"), as Pope Pius II referred to him, died some three weeks after his triumph at Nándorfehérvár/Belgrade, falling to an epidemic that had broken out in the crusader camp. However, his victories over the Turks prevented them from invading the Kingdom of Hungary for more than 60 years. His fame was a decisive factor in the election of his son, Matthias Corvinus, as king by the Diet of 1457. Hunyadi is still a popular historic figure among Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bulgarians and other nations of the region, many[tpl]howmany|date=January 2014[/tpl] of them even considering him as their own hero.

==Childhood ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1406–[tpl]circa[/tpl] 1420)==

A royal charter of grant issued on 18 October 1409 contains the first reference to John Hunyadi.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=7[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=80[/tpl][tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=7[/tpl] In the document, Sigismund, King of Hungary bestowed Hunyad Castle (in present-day Hunedoara, Romania) and the lands attached to it upon John's father, Voyk and Voyk's four kinsmen, including John himself.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=7-8[/tpl] According to the document, John's father served in the royal household as a "court knight" at that time, suggesting that he was descended from a respected family.[tpl]sfn|Makkai|1994|p=227[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=8-9[/tpl] Two 15th-century chroniclers{–}Johannes de Thurocz and Antonio Bonfini{–}write that Voyk had moved from Wallachia to Hungary upon King Sigismund's initiative.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=7[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=83-84[/tpl] László Makkai, Malcolm Hebron, Pál Engel and other scholars accept the two chroniclers' report of Voyk's Wallachian origin.[tpl]sfn|Makkai|1994|p=227[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hebron|1997|p=86[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Molnár|2001|p=61[/tpl] In contrast with them, Ioan-Aurel Pop says that Voyk was a native of the wider region of Hunyad Castle.[tpl]sfn|Pop|2005|p=294[/tpl]
Antonio Bonfini was the first chronicler to have made a passing remark of an alternative story of John Hunyadi's parentage, soon stating that it was just a "tasteless tale" fabricated by Hunyadi's opponent, Ulrich II, Count of Celje.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=8-9[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl] According to this anecdote, John was actually not Voyk's child, but King Sigismund's illegitimate son.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=8-9[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl] The story became especially popular during the reign of John Hunyadi's son, Matthias Corvinus who erected a statue for King Sigismund in Buda.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=9[/tpl] The 16th-century chronicler Gáspár Heltai repeated and further developed the tale, but modern scholars{–}for instance, Cartledge, and Kubinyi{–}regard it as an unverifiable gossip.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl] Hunyadi's popularity among the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula give rise to further legends of his royal parentage.[tpl]sfn|Chadwick|Chadwick|2010|pp=316-317[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=80[/tpl] According to a bugarštica (a Serbian popular poem), he was the son of Stefan Lazarević, Despot of Serbia and Stefan's alleged wife, a girl from Hermannstadt (Sibiu, Romania).[tpl]sfn|Chadwick|Chadwick|2010|p=317[/tpl] Actually, the Despot did not father any children.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=523[/tpl]
The identification of John Hunyadi's mother is even less certain.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl][tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=9[/tpl] In connection with King Sigismund's supposed parentage, both Bonfini and Heltai say that she was the daughter of a rich boyar, or nobleman, whose estates were located at Morzsina (Margina, Romania).[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl][tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=9[/tpl] The two chroniclers do not name her, but Pop writes that she was called Elisabeth.[tpl]sfn|Pop|2005|p=294[/tpl] According to historian László Makkai, John Hunyadi's mother was a member of the Muzsina (or Mușina) kenez family from Demsus (Densuș, Romania), but Pop refuses the identification of the Morzsina and Muzsina families.[tpl]sfn|Pop|2005|p=294[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Makkai |first=László |title=Romanian Voivodes and Cnezes, Nobles and Villeins  |work= History of Transylvania, Volume I: From the Beginnings to 1606 |publisher=mek.niif.hu |date=2001 |url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/81.html |accessdate=2014-04-22[/tpl]
With regard of John Hunyadi's mother, Bonfini provides an alternative solution as well, stating that she was a distinguished Greek lady, but does not name her.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=8[/tpl] According to Kubinyi, her alleged Greek origin may simply refer to her Orthodox faith.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl] In a letter of 1489, Matthias Corvinus wrote that his grandmother's sister, whom the Ottoman Turks had captured and forced to join the harem of an unnamed Sultan, became the ancestor of Cem, the rebellious son of Sultan Mehmed II.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=9[/tpl] Based on this letter, historian Kubinyi says that the "Greek connection cannot be discounted entirely".[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=9-10[/tpl] If Matthias Corvinus' report is valid, John Hunyadi{–}the hero of anti-Ottoman wars{–}and the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II were first cousins.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=10[/tpl]
Hunyadi's year of birth is uncertain, but he seems to have born between around 1405 and 1407.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pop|2005|p=294[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=84[/tpl] Hunyadi's father died before 12 February 1419.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl] A royal charter issued on this day mentions Hunyadi, Hunyadi's two brothers (John the younger and Voyk) and their uncle Radol, but does not refer to their father.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl]

==Rise of a general==

===Youth ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1420–1438)===

Andreas Pannonius, who served Hunyadi for five years, writes that the future commander "accustomed himself to tolerate both cold and heat in good time".[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=84[/tpl] Just like other young noblemen, John Hunyadi spent his youth serving in the court of powerful magnates.[tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=64[/tpl] However, the exact list of his employers have not been completed, because 15th-century authors recorded contradictory data of his early life.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=513[/tpl]
Filippo Scolari's biographer, Poggio Bracciolini writes that Scolari{–}who was Ispán, or head, of Temes County{–}educated Hunyadi from his very youth, suggesting that Hunyadi was Scolari's page around 1420.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|pp=515-516, 523[/tpl] On the other hand, John of Capistrano writes, in a letter of 1456, that Hunyadi started his military career serving under Nicholas Újlaki.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=514[/tpl] For Nicholas Újlaki was at least six year younger than Hunyadi, historian Pál Engel writes that Capistrano confused him with his brother, Stephen Újlaki.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=514[/tpl] Finally, Antonio Bonfini says that at the beginning of his career Hunyadi worked either for Demeter Csupor, Bishop of Zagreb or for the Csákys.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|pp=516-518[/tpl]
According to the Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, the young Hunyadi "stayed for a time" at the court of Stefan Lazarević who died in 1427.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|pp=514-515, 523[/tpl] Hunyadi's marriage with Elisabeth Szilágyi substantiates Chalkokondyles' report, because her father, Ladislaus was the Despot's familiaris around 1426.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=515[/tpl] The wedding took place around 1429.[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=15[/tpl]
While still a young man, Hunyadi entered the retinue of King Sigismund and accompanied him to Italy in 1431.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=86[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=523[/tpl] Bonfini says that Hunyadi "served two years" in the army of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan after his arrival in Italy.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=517[/tpl] Modern scholars{–}for instance, Cartledge, Engel, and Teke{–}say that Hunyadi familiarized himself with the principles of contemporary military art, including the employment of mercenaries, in Milan.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=86-87[/tpl]
Hunyadi again joined the entourage of Sigismund, who had in the meantime been crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome, at the very end of 1433.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=517[/tpl] He served the monarch as a "court knight".[tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=87[/tpl] He loaned 1,200 gold florins to the Emperor in January 1434.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=87[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=13[/tpl] In exchange, Sigismund mortgaged Papi{–}a market town in Csanád County{–}and half of the royal incomes from a nearby ferry on the Maros River to Hunyadi and his younger brother.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=87[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=13[/tpl] The royal charter of the transaction mentions Hunyadi as John the Vlach (or Romanian).[tpl]sfn|Pop|2005|p=294[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=8[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=87[/tpl] In short, Sigismund granted Hunyadi further domains, including Békésszentandrás, and Hódmezővásárhely, each incorporating about 10 villages.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=87[/tpl]
Antonio Bonfini writes of Hunyadi's service in the retinue of one "Francis Csanádi" who "became so fond of him that treated him as if he were his own son".[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=518[/tpl] Historian Engel identifies Francis Csanádi with Franko of Talovac, Ban of Severin who was also Ispán of Csanád County around 1432.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|pp=518-522[/tpl] Engel says that Hunyadi served in the Ban's retinue for at least one and a half years from around October 1434.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=524[/tpl] A Vlach district of the Banate of Severin was mortgaged to Hunyadi in this period.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=524[/tpl]
Sigismund, who entered Prague in the summer of 1436, hired Hunyadi and his 50 lancers for three months in October 1437 for 1,250 gold florins, implying that Hunyadi had accompanied him to Bohemia.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=524[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=88[/tpl] Hunyadi seems to have studied the Hussites' tactics on this occasion, because he later applied its featuring elements, including the use of wagons as a mobile fortress.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=88[/tpl] On 9 December 1437 Sigismund died; his son-in-law, Albert was elected King of Hungary in nine days.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=279[/tpl] According to historians Teke and Engel, Hunyadi soon returned to the southern frontiers of the kingdom which had been subject to Ottoman raids.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2003|p=524[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=88[/tpl]

===First battles with the Ottomans (1438–1442)===

The Ottomans had occupied the larger part of Serbia by the end of 1438.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=530[/tpl] In the same year, Ottoman troops{–}supported by Vlad II Dracul, Prince of Wallachia{–}made an incursion into Transylvania, plundering Hermannstadt, Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) and other towns.[tpl]sfn|Makkai|1994|p=226[/tpl] After the Ottomans laid siege to Smederevo, the last important Serbian stronghold in June 1439, Đurađ Branković, Despot of Serbia fled to Hungary to seek military assistance.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=530[/tpl]
King Albert proclaimed the general insurrection of the nobility against the Ottomans, but few armed noblemen assembled in the region of Titel and they refrained themselves from the fight.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=280[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=96[/tpl] A notable exception was Hunyadi.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=96[/tpl] He made raids against the besiegers and defeated them in smaller skirmishes, which contributed to the rise of his fame.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=96[/tpl] The Ottomans captured Smederevo on 18 August.[tpl]sfn|Babinger|1978|p=17[/tpl] King Albert appointed the Hunyadi brothers Bans of Severin, elevating them to the rank of "true barons of the realm".[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=97[/tpl] He also mortgaged a Vlach district in Temes County to them.[tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=12[/tpl]
King Albert died of dysentery on 27 October 1439.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=280[/tpl] His widow, Elisabeth{–}Emperor Sigismund's daughter{–}gave birth to a posthumus son, Ladislaus.[tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=63[/tpl] The Estates of the realm offered the crown to Vladislaus, King of Poland, but she had his infant son crowned king on 15 May 1440.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=281[/tpl] However, Vladislaus accepted the Estates' offer and was also crowned king on 17 July.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=281[/tpl] During the ensuing civil war between the two kings' partisans, Hunyadi supported Vladislaus.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|pp=53-54[/tpl]
Hunyadi, together with Nicholaus Újlaki, annihilated the troops of Vladislaus' opponents at Bátaszék at the very beginning of 1441.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl] Their victory effectively put an end to the civil war.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl] The grateful King appointed Hunyadi and his comrade joint Voivodes of Transylvania and Counts of the Székelys in February.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=54[/tpl] In short, the King also nominated them Ispáns of Temes County and conferred the command of Nándorfehérvár (Belgrade, Serbia) and all other castles along the Danube on them.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=103[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283[/tpl]
For Nicholas Újlaki spent most time in the royal court, in practice Hunyadi administered Transylvania and the southern borderlands alone.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=105[/tpl] Soon after his appointment, Hunyadi visited Transylvania where the child Ladislaus V's partisans had preserved a strong position.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=284[/tpl] After Hunyadi pacified Transylvania, the regions under his administration remained undisturbed by internal conflicts, enabling Hunyadi to concentrate on the defence of the borders.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=284[/tpl] 
Hunyadi set about repairing the walls of Nándorfehérvár, which had been damaged during an Ottoman attack.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl] In retaliation of Ottoman raids in the region of the river Sava, he made an incursion in Ottoman territory in the summer or autumn of 1441.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=107[/tpl] He scored a pitched battle victory over Ishak Bey, the commander of Smederovo.[tpl]sfn|Babinger|1978|p=20[/tpl]
Early next year Bey Mezid invaded Transylvania with a force of 17,000 soldiers.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=106-107[/tpl] Hunyadi was taken by surprise and lost the first battle near Marosszentimre (Sântimbru, Romania).[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Makkai|1994|p=227[/tpl] Bey Mezid lay siege to Hermannstadt, but the united forces of Hunyadi and Újlaki, who had in the meantime arrived in Transylvania, forced the Ottomans to lift the siege.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl] The Ottoman forces were annihilated at Gyulafehérvár on 22 March.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Makkai|1994|p=227[/tpl]
Pope Eugenius IV, who had been an enthusiastic propagator of a new crusade against the Ottomans, sent his legate, Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini to Hungary.[tpl]sfn|Babinger|1978|pp=21-22[/tpl] The Cardinal arrived, in May 1442, with the task of mediating a peace treaty between King Vladislaus and Dowager Queen Elisabeth.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=285[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=110[/tpl] The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II dispatched Şihabeddin Pasha{–}the governor of Rumelia{–}to invade Transylvania with a force of 70,000 soldiers.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl] The Pasha stated that the mere sight of his turban would force his enemies to run far away.[tpl]sfn|Babinger|1978|p=21[/tpl] Although Hunyadi could only muster a force of 15,000 men, he sustained a crushing defeat at the Ialomița River in September, proving his exceptional tactical skills.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=285[/tpl] Hunyadi placed Basarab II on the princely throne of Wallachia, but Basarab's opponent, Vlad Dracul returned and forced Basarab to flee in early 1443.
Hunyadi's victories in 1441 and 1442 made him a prominent enemy of the Ottomans and renowned throughout Christendom.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=285[/tpl][tpl]sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=13[/tpl] He applied an offensive tactic in the battles, which enabled him to counterweight the superiority in size of the enemy forces.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=108[/tpl] He employed mercenaries (many of whom had served in recently disbanded Czech Hussite troops), increasing the level of professionalism of his army.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=108-109[/tpl] On the other hand, he was not afraid of employing 
irregulars mustered among local peasantry.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=109[/tpl]

==General and politician==

===The "Long Campaign" (1442–1444)===

In April 1443 King Vladislaus and his barons decided to mount a major campaign against the Ottoman Empire.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=113[/tpl] With the mediation of Cardinal Cesarini, Vladislaus reached a truce with Frederick III of Germany, who had been the guardian of the child Ladislaus V.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=283, 285[/tpl] The armistice guaranteed that Frederick III would not attack Hungary in the subsequent twelve months.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=285[/tpl]
Spending around 32,000 gold florins from his own treasury, Hunyadi hired more than 10,000 mercenaries.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=115[/tpl] The King also mustered troops, and reinforcements arrived from Poland and Moldavia.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=115[/tpl] The King and Hunyadi departed for the campaign at the head of an army of 25-27,000 men in the autumn of 1443.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=115[/tpl] In theory, Vladislaus commanded the army, but the true leader of the campaign was Hunyadi.[tpl]sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=53[/tpl] Despot Đurađ Branković joined them with a force of 8,000 strong.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=115[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=55[/tpl]
Hunyadi commanded the vanguards and routed four smaller Ottoman forces, hindering their unification.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=116-117[/tpl] He captured Kruševac, Niš and Sofia.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=117-119[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=548[/tpl] However, the Hungarian troops could not broke through the passes of the Balkan Mountains towards Edirne.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=119[/tpl] Cold weather and the lack of supplies forced the Christian troops to stop the campaign at Zlatitsa.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=286[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|pp=548-549[/tpl] They returned to Hungary in January 1444.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=119-120[/tpl]

===Battle of Varna and its aftermath (1444–1446)===

Although no major Ottoman forces had been defeated, Hunyadi's "long campaign" stirred enthusiasm throughout Christian Europe.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=286[/tpl] Pope Eugenius, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy and other European powers demanded a new crusade, promising financial or military support.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=56[/tpl] According to a letter of Đurađ Branković, Hunyadi spent more than 63,000 gold florins to hire mercenaries against the Ottomans in the first half of the year.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=130[/tpl]
The advance of Christian forces in Ottoman territory also encouraged the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula to revolt in periferies of the Ottoman Empire.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=119[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=286[/tpl] For instance, Skanderbeg, an Albanian noble, expelled the Ottomans from Krujë and all other fortresses once held by his family.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|pp=548, 556[/tpl] Sultan Murad II, whose main concern was a rebellion by the Karamanids in Anatolia, offered generous terms of peace to King Vladislaus.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=56[/tpl] He even promised to withdraw the Ottoman garrisons from Serbia, thus restoring its semi-autonomous status under Despot Đurađ Branković.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=549[/tpl] He also offered a truce for ten years.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=129[/tpl] The Hungarian envoys accepted the Sultan's offer in Edirne on 12 June 1444.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=129[/tpl]
Đurađ Branković, who was grateful for the restoration of his realm, donated his estates at Világos (Șiria, Romania) in Zaránd County to Hunyadi on 3 July.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=131[/tpl] Hunyadi proposed King Vladislaus to confirm the advantageous treaty, but Cardinal Cesarini urged the monarch to continue the crusade.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] On 4 August Vladislaus took a solemn oath of launching a campaign against the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year even if a peace treaty were concluded.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] According to Johannes de Thurocz, the King appointed Hunyadi to sign the peace treaty on 15 August.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] In a week, Đurađ Branković mortgaged his extensive domains in the Kingdom of Hungary{–}including Debrecen, Munkács (Mukacheve, Ukraine), and Nagybánya (Baia Mare, Romania){–}to Hunyadi.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] 
King Vladislaus, whom Cardinal Cesarini urged to keep his oath, decided to invade the Ottoman Empire in autumn.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=56[/tpl] Upon the Cardinal's proposal, he offered Hunyadi the crown of Bulgaria.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] 
The crusaders departed from Hungary on 22 September.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] They planned to advance towards the Black Sea across the Balkan Mountains.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|pp=56-57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=53[/tpl] They expected that the Venetian fleet would hinder Sultan Murad from transferring Ottoman forces from Anatolia to the Balkans, but the Genoese transported the Sultan's army across the Dardanelles.[tpl]sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=53[/tpl] 
The two armies clashed near Varna on 10 November.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=287[/tpl] 
Although outnumbered by two to one, the crusaders initially ruled the battlefield against the Ottomans.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=54[/tpl] However, the young King Vladislaus launched a premature attack against the janissaries and was killed.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl] Taking advantage of the crusaders' panic, the Ottomans annihilated their army.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Molnár|2001|p=63[/tpl] Hunyadi narrowly escaped from the battlefield, but was captured and imprisoned by Vlad Dracul of Wallachia.[tpl]sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|pp=10, 111[/tpl] Only the threats by Lawrence Hédervári, Palatine of Hungary brought the Wallachian ruler to release Hunyadi.[tpl]cite web|title=National Geographic Magyarország: A várnai csata|language=Hungarian|url=http://www.geographic.hu/index.php?act=napi&rov=5&id=742|accessdate=2008-06-02[/tpl]
At the next Diet of Hungary, which assembled in April 1445, the Estates decided that they would unanimously acknowledge the child Ladislaus V's rule if King Vladislaus, whose fate was still uncertain, had not arrived in Hungary by the end of May.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=288[/tpl] The Estates also elected seven "Captains in Chief", including Hunyadi, each being responsible for the restoration of internal order in the territory allotted to them.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=67[/tpl] Hunyadi was assigned to administer the lands east of the river Tisza.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=146[/tpl] Here he possessed at least six castles and owned lands in about ten counties, which made him the most powerful baron in the region under his rule.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=149[/tpl] 
Hunyadi was planning to organize a new crusade against the Ottoman Empire.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=154[/tpl] For this purpose, he bombarded the Pope and other Western monarchs with letters in 1445.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=154[/tpl]  In September he had a meeting, at Nicopolis, with Waleran de Wavrin, the captain of eight Burgundian galleys, and Vlad Dracul of Wallachia, who had seized small fortresses along the Lower Danube from the Ottomans.[tpl]sfn|Vaughan|2002|p=272[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=154[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=109[/tpl] However, he did not risk a clash with the Ottoman garrisons stationed on the south bank of the river, and returned to Hungary before winter.[tpl]sfn|Vaughan|2002|p=272[/tpl] Vlad Dracul soon concluded a peace treaty with the Ottomans.[tpl]sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=109[/tpl]

===Governorship (1446–1453)===

The Estates of the realm proclaimed Hunyadi regent, bestowing the title "governor" upon him on 6 June 1446.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=288[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=49[/tpl] As governor, Hunyadi was authorized to exercise most royal prerogatives for the period of King Ladislaus V's minority.[tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=67[/tpl] For instance, he could made land grants, but only up to the size of 32 peasant holdings.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=288[/tpl] 
Hunyadi attempted to pacify the border  regions.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl] Soon after his election, he launched an unsuccessful campaign against Ulrich II, Count of Celje.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=290[/tpl] Count Ulrich administered Slavonia with the title ban (which he had arbitrarily adopted) and refused to renounce of it in favor of Hunyadi's appointee.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=290[/tpl] Hunyadi could not force him to submit.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=290[/tpl]
Hunyadi persuaded John Jiskra of Brandýs{–}a Czech commander who controlled the northern regions (in present-day Slovakia){–}to sign an armistice for three years on 13 September.[tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=49[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl] However, Jiskra did not keep the truce, and armed conflicts continued.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl] In November Hunyadi proceeded against Frederick III of Germany, who had refused to release Ladislaus V and seized Kőszeg, Sopron and other towns along the western border.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|pp=288-289[/tpl] Hunyadi's troops plundered Austria, but no decisive battle was fought.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=288[/tpl] A truce with Frederick III was signed on 1 June 1447.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=289[/tpl] Although Frederick renounced of Győr, his position as the minor King's guardian was confirmed.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=289[/tpl] The Estates of the realm were disappointed and the Diet elected Ladislaus Garai{–}a leader of Hunyadi's opponents{–}Palatine in September 1447.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=57[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=167[/tpl]
Hunyadi accelerated his negotiations, which had been commenced in the previous year, with Alfonso the Magnanimous, King of Aragon and Naples.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=167[/tpl] He even proposed the crown to Alfonso in exchange for the King's participation in an anti-Ottoman crusade and the confirmation of his position as governor.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=167[/tpl] However, King Alfonso refrained from signing an agreement.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=168[/tpl] 
Hunyadi invaded Wallachia, dethroned Vlad Dracul and installed a new voivode, Vladislav II in December 1447.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=289[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=109[/tpl] Early next year he entered into an anti-Ottoman alliance with Skanderbeg in preparation for a new crusade.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=168[/tpl] He made a new attempt to expel Count Ulrich of Celje from Slavonia, but could not defeat him.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=290[/tpl] In June Hunyadi and the Count reached an agreement, which confirmed Count Ulrich's position of Ban in Slavonia.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=290[/tpl]
Pope Eugenius suggested that the anti-Ottoman campaign should be postponed.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=168[/tpl] However, Hunyadi stated, in a letter dated 8 September 1448, that he "have had enough of our men enslaved, our women raped, wagons loaded with the severed heads of our people" and expressed his determination to expel "the enemy from Europe".[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=168[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] Hunyadi departed for the new campaign at the head of an army of 16,000 soldiers in September 1448.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] About 8,000 soldiers from Wallachia also joined his campaign.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] For Đurađ Branković refused to assist the crusaders, Hunyadi treated him as the Ottoman's ally and his army marched through Serbia plundering the countryside.[tpl]sfn|Fine|1994|p=554[/tpl]
In order to prevent the unification of the armies of Hunyadi and Skanderbeg, Sultan Murad II joined battle with Hunyadi on Kosovo Polje on 17 October.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] The battle, which lasted for three days, ended with the crusaders' catastrophic defeat.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl] Around 17,000 Hungarian and Wallachian soldiers were killed or captured and Hunyadi could hardly escape from the battlefield.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] On his way home, Hunyadi was captured by Đurađ Branković who kept him prisoner in the fort of Smederevo.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=174[/tpl] The Despot was initially contemplating to surrender Hunyadi to the Ottomans.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=174[/tpl] However, the Hungarian barons and prelates who assembled at Szeged persuaded him to make peace with Hunyadi.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=174[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] According to the treaty, Hunyadi was obliged to pay a ransom of 100,000 gold florins and to return all the domains that he had acquired from Đurađ Branković.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=174[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] Hunyadi's oldest son, Ladislaus was sent to the Despot as a hostage.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] Hunyadi was released, and he returned to Hungary in late December 1448.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=174[/tpl]
His defeat and his humiliating treaty with the Despot weakened Hunyadi's position.[tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=58[/tpl] The prelates and the barons confirmed the treaty and assigned Branković to negotiate with the Ottomans, and Hunyadi resigned from the office of Voivode of Transylvania.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=175[/tpl] He invaded the lands controlled by John Jiskra and his Czech mercenaries in the autumn of 1449, but could not defeat them.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=175-176[/tpl] On the other hand, the rulers of two neighboring countries{–}Stjepan Tomaš, King of Bosnia, and Bogdan II, Voivode of Moldavia{–}concluded a treaty with Hunyadi, promising that they would remain loyal to him.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=177[/tpl] In early 1450 Hunyadi and Jiskra signed a peace treaty in Mezőkövesd, acknowledging that many prosperous towns in Upper Hungary{–}including Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) and Kassa (Košice, Slovakia){–}remained under Jiskra's rule.[tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=177-178[/tpl]
Upon Hunyadi's demand, the Diet of March 1450 ordered the confiscation of Branković's estates in the Kingdom of Hungary.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl] Hunyadi and his troops departed for Serbia, forcing Branković to release his son.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=178[/tpl] Hunyadi, Ladislaus Garai and Nicholas Újlaki concluded a treaty on 17 July 1450, promising each other assistance to preserve their offices in case King Ladislaus V returned to Hungary.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=178[/tpl] In October Hunyadi made peace with Frederick III of Germany, which confirmed the German monarch's position as guardian of Ladislaus V for further eight years.[tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=178[/tpl] With the mediation of Újlaki and other barons, Hunyadi also concluded a peace treaty with Branković in August 1451, which authorized Hunyadi to redeem the debated domains for 155,000 gold florins.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=181[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl] In short, Hunyadi launched a military expedition against Jiskra, but the Czech commander routed the Hungarian troops near Losonc (Lučenec, Slovakia) on 7 September 1451.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl]
The Austrian noblemen rose up in open rebellion against Frederick III of Germany, who governed the duchy in the name of Ladislaus the Posthumus at the turn of 1451 and 1452.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=68[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=180[/tpl] The leader of the rebellion, Ulrich Eizinger sought the assistance of the Estates of Ladislaus's two other realms, Bohemia and Hungary.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=292[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=180[/tpl] The Diet of Hungary, which assembled in Pressburg in February 1452, sent a delegation to Vienna.[tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl] On 5 March the Austrian and Hungarian Estates jointly requested Frederick III to renounce the guardianship of their young sovereign.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=181[/tpl] Frederick, who had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor, initially refused to satisfy their demand.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=182[/tpl] Hunyadi convoked a Diet to discuss the situation, but before the Diet made any decision the united troops of the Austrian and Bohemian Estates forced the Emperor to hand over the young monarch to Count Ulrich of Celje on 4 September.[tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=182[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=59[/tpl] In the meantime, Hunyadi had met Jiskra in Körmöcbánya (Kremnica, Slovakia) where they concluded a treaty on 24 August.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=50[/tpl] According to the treaty, Jiskra retained Léva (Levica, Slovakia) and his right to collect the "thirtieth"{–}a custom duty{–}at Késmárk (Kežmarok, Slovakia) and Ólubló (Stará Ľubovňa, Slovakia).[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=291[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|pp=50, 318[/tpl]
Hunyadi convoked a Diet to Buda, but the barons and the prelates preferred to visit Ladislaus V in Vienna in November.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=182[/tpl] At the Diet of Vienna, Hunyadi renounced the regency, but the King  appointed him "captain general of the kingdom".[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=182[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=293[/tpl] The King even authorized Hunyadi to keep the royal castles and royal revenues that he possessed at that time.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=293[/tpl] Hunyadi also received Beszterce (Bistrița, Romania){–}a district of the Transylvanian Saxons{–}with the title "perpetual count" from Ladislaus V, which was the first grant of a hereditary title in the Kingdom of Hungary.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=293[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bak|1994|p=68[/tpl]

===In isolation (1453–1456)===

In a letter of 28 April 1453, Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini{–}the future Pope Pius II{–}stated that King Ladislaus V's realms were administered by "three men": Hungary was ruled by Hunyadi, Bohemia by George of Poděbrady, and Austria by Ulrich of Celje.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|p=185[/tpl] However, Hunyadi's position gradually weakened, because even many of his former allies considered his acts to retain his power with suspicion.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=295[/tpl] In September Nicholas Újlaki made a formal alliance with Palatine Ladislaus Garai and Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, declaring their intention to restore royal authority.[tpl]sfn|Engel|2001|p=295[/tpl] On the other hand, Hunyadi accompanied the young King to Prague and concluded a treaty with Ulrich Eizinger (who had expelled Ulrich of Celje from Austria) and George of Poděbrady at the end of the year.[tpl]sfn|Teke|1980|pp=189-190[/tpl]

===Belgrade victory and death (1456)===

Meanwhile, the Ottoman issue had again become acute, and, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, it seemed natural that Sultan Mehmed II was rallying his resources in order to subjugate Hungary. His immediate objective was Nándorfehérvár (today Belgrade). Nándorfehérvár was a major castle-fortress, and a gate keeper of south Hungary. The fall of this stronghold would have opened a clear way to the heart of Central Europe. Hunyadi arrived at the siege of Nándorfehérvár at the end of 1455, after settling differences with his domestic enemies. At his own expense, he restocked the supplies and arms of the fortress, leaving in it a strong garrison under the command of his brother-in-law Mihály Szilágyi and his own eldest son László Hunyadi. He proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of two hundred ships. His main ally was the Franciscan friar, Giovanni da Capistrano (known today as St. John of Capistrano), whose fiery oratory drew a large crusade made up mostly of peasants. Although relatively ill-armed (most were armed with farm equipment, such as scythes and pitchforks) they flocked to Hunyadi and his small corps of seasoned mercenaries and cavalry.
On 14 July 1456 the flotilla assembled by Hunyadi destroyed the Ottoman fleet. On 21 July, Szilágyi's forces in the fortress repulsed a fierce assault by the Rumelian army, and Hunyadi pursued the retreating Ottoman forces into their camp, taking advantage of the Turkish army's confused flight from the city. After fierce but brief fighting, the camp was captured, and Mehmet lifted the siege and returned to Constantinople. A 70-year period of relative peace on Hungary's southeastern border began with his flight. However, plague broke out in Hunyadi's camp three weeks after the lifting of the siege, and he died August 11. On his deathbed Hunyadi said Defend, my friends, Christendom and Hungary from all enemies... Do not quarrel among yourselves. If you should waste your energies in altercations, you will seal your own fate as well as dig the grave of our country..[tpl]cite book|last=Sisa|first=Stephen |title=The spirit of Hungary: a panorama of Hungarian history and culture|publisher=Vista Books (original from University of Michigan)|year=1990|pages=56|edition=2[/tpl] He is buried in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Alba Iulia, former Gyulafehérvár  next to his younger brother, John.[tpl]citation needed|date = January 2013[/tpl] Sultan Mehmet II paid him tribute:"Although he was my enemy I feel grief over his death, because the world has never seen such a man."

====The Noon Bell====

Pope Callixtus III ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the Christian defenders of the city of Belgrade.István Lázár: Hungary: A Brief History (see in Chapter 6) The practice of Noon bell is traditionally attributed to the international commemoration of the Belgrade victory and to the order of Pope Callixtus III.[tpl]cite book | author = Kerny, Terézia | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title =The Hungarian Quarterly|chapter=The Renaissance – Four Times Over.

Hunyadi’s feat—carried out with a small standing army combined with peasants rallied to fight the infidel by the Franciscan friar St John of Capistrano— had the effect of putting an end to Ottoman attempts on Hungary and Western Europe for the next seventy years, and is considered to have been one of the most momentous victories in Hungarian military history. The bells ringing at noon throughout Christendom are, to this day, a daily commemoration of John Hunyadi’s victory. | isbn =  | oclc = | doi = | url =http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=36917033-77c7-4622-8f76-dae90f531363&articleId=ca7d4a8b-cee0-4d8b-beab-fb1536ba3597 | accessdate = [/tpl]http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/hunyadi/hu01.htmhttp://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/CLXVII/sep08/171-d
The custom still exists even among Protestant and Orthodox congregations. In the history of Oxford University, the victory was welcomed with a peal of bells and great celebrations in England too. Hunyadi sent a special courier (among other), Erasmus Fullar, to Oxford with the news of the victory.Imre Lukinich: A History of Hungary in Biographical Sketches (page: 109.)
Unlike most of his contemporaries, Hunyadi did not use his great revenues or the military and political weight of his thousands of retainers simply for his personal aggrandizement. For many years, he bore a large share of the cost of fighting the Ottomans.http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/84.html

==Family==

In 1432, Hunyadi married Erzsébet Szilágyi (c. 1410–1483), a Hungarian noblewoman. John Hunyadi had two children, Ladislaus and Matthias Corvinus.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2012[/tpl] The former was executed on the order of King Ladislaus V for the murder of Ulrich II of Celje, a relative of the king.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2012[/tpl] The latter was elected king on 20 January 1458, Matthias after Ladislaus V's death. It was the first time in the history of the Kingdom of Hungary that a member of the nobility, without dynastic ancestry and relationship, mounted the royal throne.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2012[/tpl]

Along with his son Matthias Corvinus, Hunyadi is considered a Hungarian national hero and praised as its defender against the Ottoman threat.[tpl]cite book|title=Volume 7 of World and Its Peoples: Europe|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2009|pages=891|isbn=978-0-7614-7883-6|quote=In the war, Janos Hunyadi (1387–1456), subsequently a Hungarian national hero, emerged to lead Hungary's political life.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Shaw|first=Stanford Jay|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Volume 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|pages=51|isbn=978-0-521-29163-7|quote=Hunyadi had suddenly risen as the great Hungarian national hero as a result of his victories over the Turks in 1442.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Matthews|first=John P.

Hunyadi was "recognised as being Hungarian..." and "frequently called Ugrin Janko, 'Janko the Hungarian'" in the Serbian and Croatian societies of the 15th century,[tpl]sfn|Varga|1982|p=66[/tpl] while another bugarštica makes him of Serbian origin.[tpl]sfn|Chadwick|Chadwick|2010|pp=316-317[/tpl] He is also portrayed as an ardent supporter of the Catholicization of Orthdox peopleshttp://books.google.com/books?id=8LkrAQAAIAAJ&q=iancu+de&dq=iancu+de&hl=en&ei=uWl7TZy8O8ur8QPCv8SkCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU
In Bulgarian folklore, the memory of Hunyadi was preserved in the epic song hero character of Yankul(a) Voivoda, along with Sekula Detentse, a fictitious hero perhaps inspired by Hunyadi's nephew, Thomas Székely.[tpl]cite book|last=Балкански|first=Тодор |title=Трансилванските (седмиградските) българи.

==Corvinus legend==

The epithet Corvinus (referring to the raven) was first used by Antonio Bonfini the biographer of his son Matthias Corvinus, but is also applied to Hunyadi.Péter Kulcsár: A Corvinus-legenda. História (vol. 1993-01). According to a legend inventedBalázs Trencsényi (ed.), Márton Zászkaliczky: Whose Love of Which Country?: Composite States, National Histories and Patriotic Discourses in Early Modern East Central Europe (Studies in the History of Political Thought) by Gáspár Heltai said that Hunyadi was the illegitimate son of Hungarian King Sigismund of Luxembourg,[tpl]CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07564b.htm|title=János Hunyady[/tpl] and that Vojk was a faithful soldier of his father for two decades. After the death of his wife, King Sigismund met Elizabeth Morzsinai, a virgin noblewoman, and fell in love. In the morning, the king gave a royal ring to the lady, promising her that he would take care of the son. After the boy was born, the family set off to Buda to the palace of Sigismund. During the trip, they took a rest, and baby Hunyadi started crying. Elizabeth gave him the ring to make him quiet, whereupon a rook stole the ring. Elizabeth's brother took his bow and arrow and shot the rook, whereupon, as if by a miracle, the rook did not die, and the ring was recovered.[tpl]clarify|date = September 2013[/tpl] Arriving at the royal court in Buda, Sigismund filled the baby's cradle with precious stones.Gáspár Heltai: Az Hunyadi Jánosról, erdéli vajdáról és annak jeles dolgairól[tpl]better source|date = September 2013[/tpl]
