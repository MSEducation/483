KJLA, virtual channel 57 (UHF digital channel 49), is a LATV owned-and-operated television station that is licensed to Ventura. The station is owned by LATV Networks, LLC (under the control of Entravision Communications CEO Walter Ulloa, whose brother Ronald owns KXLA, virtual channel 44 and digital channel 51 and Twentynine Palms-based KVMD, virtual channel 31 and digital channel 23). KJLA's studios are located on Corinth Avenue (near Interstate 405) in West Los Angeles, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.
It is a multilingual television station, which in addition to Spanish language programming from LATV, also carried programs in English, Vietnamese and Mandarin on separate digital subchannels. KJLA operates two low-power repeater stations: KLFA-LD (channel 25) in Santa Maria and KFUL-LP (channel 44) in San Luis Obispo (both are part of the Santa Barbara market).

==History==

The station first signed on the air on October 1, 1990 as KSTV-TV. It was the second attempt to operate a television station in Ventura; the first, KKOG-TV (channel 16), operated from December 14, 1968 to September 13, 1969, with a schedule of entirely live, local programming. KSTV-TV was originally owned by Costa de Oro Television, Inc., and originally aired Spanish language programming from the Galavisión network. A low-power translator in Santa Maria went on the air in 1992.
In 1994, Walter Ulloa purchased Costa de Oro Television and KSTV-TV, intending to increase its transmitting power and extend its signal to better reach to the Los Angeles area. However, although Ventura is considered part of the Los Angeles market, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules at the time placed KSTV-TV within the Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo market, similar to the situation of KADY-TV in Oxnard, which became Santa Barbara's UPN affiliate when the network launched in January 1995. Unable to get cable coverage in the Los Angeles area, on November 1, 1995, KSTV switched to an English language format and became the WB affiliate for the Santa Barbara market.
However, the station continued in its attempts to enter the Los Angeles market. In July 1997, KSTV increased its power to 5,000 kilowatts, In February 1998, the improved signal helped the station to obtain must-carry status on most cable providers in western Los Angeles County. But because Los Angeles already had a WB affiliate, KTLA (channel 5), KSTV-TV was forced to drop its WB affiliation. The station changed its call letters to KJLA on July 20, 1998, to further reflect its intentions to serve the Los Angeles market. Shortly before the callsign change, the station relocated its studios and offices from Ventura to West Los Angeles. Translators in Santa Barbara and San Bernardino signed on the air in 1999, with additional repeaters in San Luis Obispo and Palm Springs launching in 2000.
In July 20, 1998, KJLA began carrying Business News 57, the financial news programming which called as Business News 57. Business news programming and also this station aired Spanish Independent programming like La Isla de Jordan, Quien tiene la Razon, Cuanto Cuesta el Show, La Corte del Pueblo, La Corte Familiar,  El Salvador de Cerca, Ritmo Latino, La Paloma, Vida Dura, Tu Musica, Explosivo Musical, No Confies en Nadie, Santana En Vivo, Cafe California, also this station aired local news as Noticias 57 and many other Spanish Independent programming. KJLA also aired Shop at Home Network every night at Midnight to 6AM.
In April 2007, LATV transitioned from a programming block on KJLA into a national network, it became distributed to several television stations (mainly carried on digital subchannels and low-power stations, beginning with the subchannels of four stations owned by Post-Newsweek Stations).http://www.latv.com/sales/articles/PNewswekkStations.html

===Digital channels===

The station's digital channel is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===

KJLA had applied to convert to a digital-only signal, citing low over-the-air analog viewership rates and high operating costs to maintain the simulcast; this request was refused by the Federal Communication Commission on February 9, 2005. The higher operating costs were in part due to KJLA having two different transmitter sites. The KJLA-TV analog transmitter for channel 57 was located on South Mountain near Santa Paula in Ventura County. The digital facilities for KJLA-DT channel 49 are located on Mount Wilson in Los Angeles County."Request to Discontinue Analog Operations of Station KJLA(TV)", Federal Communications Commission, Mar 10, 2005.
KJLA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 57, on August 27, 2008.List of Digital Full-Power Stations The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using PSIP to display KJLA's virtual channel as 57 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. KJLA is the second television station in the Los Angeles market to discontinue its analog signal, after KVMD, which shut down its analog signal in 2003.

====Channel sharing trial====

In February 2014, KJLA and PBS member station KLCS was granted special temporary authority by the FCC to conduct trials in partnership with CTIA and the Association of Public Television Stations, which will see the two stations test use of the H.264 video codec for digital television transmission, and more importantly, the ability and viability of broadcasting two sets of television services within the same 6 MHz channel band. These tests come as the FCC prepares to perform a spectrum auction in 2015; broadcasters will be able to voluntarily sell their television spectrum to the government, and then receive profits from its sale to wireless providers. An FCC spokesperson stated that channel sharing would allow broadcasters to "take advantage of the incentive auction’s once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity", while still maintaining its ability to run over-the-air television programming.[tpl]cite web|title=FCC Grants STA for L.A.
