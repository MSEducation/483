Peter "Pete" Doherty (born 12 March 1979) is an English musician, writer, actor, poet and artist. He is best known musically for being co-frontman of The Libertines, which he formed with Carl Barât in 1997. His other musical project is indie band Babyshambles. In 2005, Doherty became prominent in tabloids, the news media, and pop culture blogs because of his romantic relationship with model Kate Moss and his frequently-publicised drug addictions.

==Early life==

Doherty was born in Hexham, Northumberland to mother Jacqueline (née Michels), a nurse and lance corporal, and a Catholic father, Peter John Doherty, a major in the British Army. His paternal grandfather was Irish, from Cheekpoint, County Waterford; his maternal grandfather was Jewish (the son of immigrants from France and Russia) and his maternal grandmother was of English descent.[tpl]cite news|title=Family detective: Pete Doherty|first=Nick|last=Barratt|date=24 November 2006|accessdate=27 September 2007|publisher=Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435134/Family-detective-Pete-Doherty.html|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Shennan|first=Paddy|title=I wanted to hit Pete when I found out about the drugs; Says Babyshambles stars Scouse mum Paddy Shennan reports on a Liverpool mother's love for her drug addict son who also happens to be one of Britain's biggest rock stars says Baby shambles star's Scouse mum|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=18 September 2006|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_objectid=17772329%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=i-wanted-to-hit-pete-when-i-found-out-about-the-drugs---says-babyshambles-star-s-scouse-mum-name_page.html|accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Lament  for a lost boy|first=Jackie|last=McGlone|date=3 September 2006|accessdate=12 May 2007|work=The Scotsman|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1288012006|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20071221013935|url=http://living.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2807513|archivedate=21 December 2007[/tpl] Doherty had a Catholic upbringing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1381347,00.html|title=The Guardian profile: Pete Doherty|first=Patrick|last=Barkham|date=31 December 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2011|location=London[/tpl] He grew up at a number of army garrisons, due to his father's work, living at various times at garrisons in Catterick, Belfast, Wildenrath Barracks in the north west of Germany, Bedworth, Dorset, and Larnaca, along with his mother and two sisters, Amy Jo and Emily. Doherty was the second of the three children. It was while in Dorset, at the age of 11, that Doherty was first inspired to play guitar. He started playing in order to impress classmate Emily Baker whom he fancied. 18 years later they  were reunited where the now Brighton based singer/songwriter won his support slot. He achieved 11 GCSEs,[tpl]cite news|title=What a Shambles!|first=Laura|last=Wetton|date=31 August 2005|accessdate=12 May 2007|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/08/31/blast05_what_a_shambles_feature.shtml[/tpl] 7 of which were A* grades, at Nicholas Chamberlaine Comprehensive School in Bedworth and four passes at A Level, two at grade A.

After his A-levels, he moved to his grandmother's flat in London – where he said he felt 'destined' to be – and got a job filling graves in Willesden Cemetery, although most of his time was spent reading and writing while sitting on gravestones. In a clip later made famous by YouTube, an eighteen-year old Doherty can be seen in an interview with MTV, on the day of the release of Oasis' Be Here Now album. He attended Queen Mary, a college of the University of London, to study English literature, but left the course after his first year. After leaving university, he moved into a London flat with friend and fellow musician Carl Barât, who had been a classmate of Doherty's older sister at Brunel University.

==Career==

===The Libertines===

Doherty and Barât formed a band called The Libertines in the late '90s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut album Up the Bracket, that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.
The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty in particular being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty's increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Barât's flat.
The two initially fell out over this incident, but made amends whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to 6 months, but his sentence was cut to 2 months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Barât and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap 'n' Tin pub in Chatham, Kent.
Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre Wat Tham Krabok, a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation program for crack and heroin users. He left after three days and returned to England.
As a consequence of this, The Libertines cancelled appearances that they were due to make at the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury festivals.
However, while post-production work was taking place on the second Libertines album in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty's continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal, but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Barât had previously stated that the Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty's recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty's departure at the end of 2004. The remaining members became involved in other projects (see Yeti and Dirty Pretty Things).
On 12 April 2007, Pete Doherty and Carl Barât played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty's "An Evening with Pete Doherty" gigs at the Hackney Empire, London.
In 2010 The Libertines reformed for appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They performed on 27 August at Leeds Festival and on 28 August at Reading Festival.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/aug/28/libertines-leeds-festival-2010 |title=The Libertines rekindle the good old days at Leeds festival 2010 |first=Sam |last=Wolfson |date=28 August 2010 |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=29 May 2011 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=120&title=the_libertines_at_reading_festival_2010_&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title=The Libertines at Reading Festival 2010 – Review |first=David |last=Moynihan |date=29 August 2010 |work=NME   |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] The festival appearances were preluded by two gigs at the HMV Forum on 24 and 25 August.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/58078/The-Libertines-Make-Thrilling-Comeback-At-London-Gig |title=The Libertines Make Thrilling Comeback at London Gig |first=Jason |last=Gregory |date=25 August 2010 |publisher=gigwise.com |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl]

===Collaborations===

Prior to the disbanding of The Libertines, Doherty collaborated with local poet Wolfman. Together they recorded the single "For Lovers", which entered the top 10, charting at number 7,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/2004-04-24/ |title=Archive Chart |date=24 April 2004 |publisher=The Official Charts Company |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] in April 2004. Despite the success of the single, which was nominated for a prestigious Ivor Novello Award for songwriting, Doherty and Wolfman received relatively little money, having already sold the publishing rights for a small sum in a pub.
Later in 2004, Doherty provided guest vocals to the song "Down to the Underground" by the British group Client. The song was released in June 2004 as a B-side to the group's single "In It for the Money" and appears on their second album City.
In 2005 Doherty collaborated with the British rock band Littl'ans on the single "Their Way".
In 2006, Doherty was featured on the charity single "Janie Jones", which was released to raise funds for Strummerville. A number of artists and bands, such as Dirty Pretty Things, We Are Scientists, The Kooks and The Holloways, also featured on the track.
In August 2006 it was announced that Doherty was recording with The Streets frontman Mike Skinner on a new version of "Prangin' Out", from Skinner's album The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living.

===Babyshambles===

Doherty founded Babyshambles towards the end of his time with The Libertines. The group has released two studio albums, Down in Albion, in November 2005 and Shotter's Nation in October 2007. The band's touring schedule and releases have occasionally been disrupted by Doherty's ongoing legal problems.
The line-up of the band has changed several times: drummer Gemma Clarke left the band due to Doherty's drug problems and was replaced by Adam Ficek, and guitarist and co-songwriter Patrick Walden has also left the band and was replaced by Mick Whitnall.
In August 2006, Babyshambles signed up with major record label Parlophone, on which they released The Blinding EP on 9 December 2006. In January 2007, they signed a long term record deal with Parlophone.
In November 2007 Babyshambles played their first arena tour, taking in dates at the MEN Arena in Manchester, the Nottingham Arena, Bournemouth International Centre, London's Wembley Arena and Birmingham's National Indoor Arena.[ref]

In September 2013, the band's third album Sequel to the Prequel was released.

===Solo work and guerrilla gigs===

Doherty has been working on new acoustic material, similar to the wealth of his unreleased songs that can already be downloaded on the internet.NME Magazine – various issues On his own, and often with his band, he has continued The Libertines' tradition of performing on short notice guerrilla gigs in small venues. On New Year's Eve 2005, Doherty held a guerrilla gig in his North London flat where he showcased some of his solo works, many of which later leaked onto the internet.[ref]
