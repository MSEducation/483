Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high-school student who turns to crimefighting after developing spider-like powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. the Green Goblin), Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.
After being stuck in development hell for nearly 25 years, the film was licensed for a worldwide release by Sony Pictures Entertainment in 1999 after it acquired options from MGM on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from this multi-script acquisition (a screenplay credited to James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen and "Joseph Goldman" (the pen name of Menahem Golan) and a later treatment credited solely to Cameron), Sony hired David Koepp to create a working screenplay from this "Cameron material". Directors Roland Emmerich, Tim Burton, Chris Columbus, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during preproduction and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production.
Filming of Spider-Man took place in Los Angeles, and New York City from January 8 to June 30, 2001. Spider-Man was released on May 3, 2002, and became a critical and financial success. With $821.7 million worldwide, it was 2002's third highest-grossing film and is the 41st highest-grossing film of all time. Reviews were largely positive with critics praising the film in several aspects. Spider-Man was, for its time, the only film to reach $100 million in its first weekend, had the largest opening weekend gross of all time, and was the most successful film based on a comic book. At the 75th Academy Awards ceremony, it was nominated the awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mixing. It also has two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. A reboot titled The Amazing Spider-Man was released on July 3, 2012.

==Plot==

High-school senior Peter Parker visits a genetics laboratory with his friend Harry Osborn and Peter's love interest, Mary Jane Watson. There, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered "super spider". Shortly after arriving home to his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, he is rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist Norman Osborn, owner of Oscorp, is attempting to preserve his company's critically important military contract. He experiments on himself with a new but unstable performance-enhancing chemical vapor that increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also drives him insane and he kills his assistant, Mendel Stromm. The next morning, Peter finds that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has metamorphosized into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds his body producing webbing and that his quickened reflexes let him avoid injury during a confrontation with bully Flash Thompson. Peter discovers he has developed superhuman speed, strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and a heightened ability to sense danger. 
Brushing off Uncle Ben's advice that "With great power comes great responsibility," Peter enters a wrestling tournament to get money to buy a car and impress Mary Jane.  He wins his match, but the promoter cheats him out of the contest money. When a thief steals money from the promoter, Peter allows the thief to escape. He later discovers his Uncle Ben has been carjacked and shot dead. Peter confronts the carjacker only to realize it was the same thief he let get away. After Peter disarms him, the fleeing carjacker falls out a window and dies. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn kills several scientists and the military's General Slocum.
Upon graduating school, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a costume and the persona of Spider-Man. Newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson hires as a freelance photographer, since Peter is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man. 
Norman, upon learning Oscorp's board members plan to sell the company, assassinates them at the World Unity Fair. Jameson quickly dubs the mysterious killer the Green Goblin. The Goblin offers Spider-Man a place at his side, but Spider-Man refuses. At the Osborn and Parkers' Thanksgiving dinner, Norman, unknown to Peter, deduces Spider-Man's true identity; the Green Goblin subsequently attacks and hospitalizes Aunt May. 
Mary Jane admits she has a crush on Spider-Man, who has rescued her on numerous occasions, and she asks Peter whether Spider-Man ever asked about her. Harry, who loves Mary Jane, arrives and learns she does not feel likewise toward him. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unintentionally revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.
The Goblin holds Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tram car full of children hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. He forces Spider-Man to choose who he wants to save, and drops Mary Jane and the children. Spider-Man manages to save both Mary Jane and the tram car, while the Goblin is pelted by civilians showing loyalty to Spider-Man. The Goblin then grabs Spider-Man and throws him into an abandoned building where they fight. When the Goblin boasts of how he will later kill Mary Jane, an enraged Spider-Man overpowers the Goblin, unmasking him.
Norman begs for forgiveness, but his Goblin persona attempts to remote-control his glider to impale Spider-Man. The superhero avoids the attack, causing the glider to impale Norman instead, finally killing him. In his dying breath, Norman tells Peter not to tell Harry about his crimes. Spider-Man takes Norman's body back to Osborn's house and hides the Green Goblin's equipment. At Norman’s funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, believing him responsible for killing his father, and asserts that Peter is all he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter she is in love with him, but Peter, feeling that he must protect her from the unwanted attentions of Spider-Man's enemies, hides his true feelings and tells her that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words about responsibility, and accepts his new life as Spider-Man.

==Cast==

Bruce Campbell, a long-time colleague of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw (played by former professional wrestler "Macho Man" Randy Savage).[tpl]cite video | people = Sam Raimi, Avi Arad, Laura Ziskin, Kirsten Dunst | title = Audio Commentary | format = DVD | publisher = Sony |date = 2002[/tpl] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, "Hey kid, would you like a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R&B/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. Lucy Lawless, star of Xena: Warrior Princess (produced by Raimi), also appears as a punk rock girl. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen.[tpl]cite news | author = Chris Hewitt, Simon Braund | title = Spider-Man | pages = 58–62 | publisher = Empire | date = July 2002[/tpl]

==Production==

===Development===

In April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer all preceding script versions of Spider-Man, it only exercised the options on "the Cameron material," which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five page "scriptment" credited only to James Cameron.  The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film.[tpl]cite news | author=Daniel Frankel | url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b37970_Cameron_Spun_Out_of_Spider-Man_Movie.html | title=Cameron Spun Out of Spider-Man Movie | publisher=E!

Fincher did not want to depict the origin story, pitching the film as being based on The Night Gwen Stacy Died storyline, but the studio disagreed. Sam Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000,[tpl]cite news | author=Robert K.

Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the "organic webshooter" idea from the Cameron "scriptment".[tpl]cite book |last= Gross |first= Edward |title= Spider-Man Confidential |pages=206–208 |publisher=Hyperion |date=May 2002 |isbn= 0-7868-8722-2 [/tpl] Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's suspension of disbelief too far to have Peter invent mechanical webshooters.
Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences.[tpl]cite news | author=Claude Brodesser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782713.html?categoryid=-1&cs=1 | title='Spider-Man' snares scribe | publisher=Variety | date=June 16, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 [/tpl] Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train. As production neared, producer Laura Ziskin hired her husband, award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Peter and Mary Jane.[tpl]cite web | author=Greg Dean Schmitz | title=Greg's Preview - Spider-Man | publisher=Yahoo! | url=http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808406011&gpt=ch | accessdate=2008-08-09 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070429050554/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808406011&gpt=ch | archivedate=2007-04-29[/tpl] Columbia offered David Koepp's name to the WGA as sole screenwriter, despite the fact that it had acquired Cameron's script and hired two subsequent writers. Without reading and comparing any of the material, the Writers Guild approved sole credit to Koepp.

===Filming===

With Spider-Man cast, filming was set to begin the following November in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002,[tpl]cite news | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034459p1.html | title=Spider-Man Crawls Into 2002 | publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 [/tpl] filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film."Spider Man Twin Tower Trailers Scrapped"W.T.C. to be Digitally Removed From SPIDER-MAN Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California.DVD Booklet (2002), p.2–3 On March 6,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1555976.stm|title=Wife sues over Spider-Man death|publisher=BBC News|date=September 21, 2001|accessdate=2009-05-29[/tpl] forty-five-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in.

In Los Angeles, locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the Daily Bugle offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home). In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return.[tpl]cite news | title = They Took Spidey's Clothes! | publisher = Internet Movie Database | date=April 5, 2001 | url = http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2001-04-05#film3 | accessdate=2007-04-29[/tpl] They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested.[tpl]cite news | title = 7 Bizarre Stories of Stolen Movie Props | publisher = Mental Floss | date=June 16, 2010 | url = http://mentalfloss.com/article/24937/7-bizarre-stories-stolen-movie-props | accessdate=2013-05-21[/tpl] Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center. The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June. The Flatiron Building was used for the Daily Bugle.

===Design===

Although it wound up being faithful to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of had a red emblem over a black costume. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape.[tpl]cite news | author=Josh Tyrangiel | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997713,00.html?promoid=googlep | title=He has radioactive blood, now about those pecs | publisher=Time | date=August 14, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 [/tpl] It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.[tpl]cite news | author=KJB | title=Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Update | publisher=IGN | date=January 13, 2001 | url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034485p1.html | accessdate=2007-04-28[/tpl]
The Green Goblin's costume was created after Willem Dafoe was cast, as Dafoe rejected the initially bulky designs created beforehand. The finished design focused on a more streamlined and athletic feel, and the mask in particular was created to be an extreme cartoon version of his face, focusing on his long cheekbones.[tpl]cite news | author = Brian Hiatt | title = Green, With Envy: Inside the mind of Spider-Man's foe - Willem Dafoe reveals how he became the Green Goblin - and why he'd love to do a sequel | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | date = May 22, 2002 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,241249,00.html | accessdate=2007-04-28[/tpl] Some of the early designs were heavily inspired by black ops. One popular idea among the concept artists was to have the Goblin accompanied by adolescent women in costume and have their own gliders, an idea Raimi disliked.

===Effects===

Visual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000.[tpl]cite news | author=Scott Chitwood | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034448p1.html | title=Dykstra to animate Spider-Man | publisher=IGN | date=May 10, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 [/tpl] He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer generated, as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production. Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, "ballet in the sky." The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million. Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.
Saki said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, "the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero." Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.[tpl]cite news | author=Phillip Zonkel | title=SPINNING `SPIDER-MAN'S' VISUAL EFFECTS WEB - FORMER CSULB STUDENT JOHN DYKSTRA IS CREDITED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF COMPUTER-GENERATED MOVIE MAGIC | publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram | date=March 20, 2003[/tpl] When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts. In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer generated.[tpl]cite news | author = Rob Worley | title = Comics 2 Film | publisher = Comic Book Resources | date = March 6, 2002 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=comics2film&article=1259 | accessdate=2007-04-29[/tpl]

==Release==

After the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, Sony recalled teaser posters which showed a close-up of Spider-Man's face with the New York skyline (including, prominently, the World Trade Center towers) reflected in his eyes. The film's original teaser trailer, released in 2001, featured a mini-film plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel helicopter, which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net, then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the World Trade Center's towers. According to Sony, the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself and is consequently one of the most popular "Special Shoot" trailers since Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[tpl]cite news | author = Andrew Gumbel | title = Spider-Man Caught up in New York Destruction | publisher = Pretoria News | date = September 14, 2001 | url = http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=&fArticleId=qw10004699418S351 | accessdate=2010-11-05 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5u0wrMxvW | archivedate = 2010-11-05[/tpl] The trailer and poster were pulled after the events of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but can be found on the Internet on websites such as YouTube.[tpl]cite news | author = KJB | title = Sony Pulls Spider-Man Teaser Trailer & Poster | publisher = IGN | date = September 13, 2001 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/305/305861p1.html | accessdate=2007-04-28[/tpl]
Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a '12' certificate. Due to Spider-Man's popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended their decision, arguing that the film could have been given a '15'. Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a 'PG', and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a 'PG-12'. The U.S. rated it "PG-13"[tpl]cite news|title=Parents warned of Spider-Man violence|publisher=BBC|date=June 13, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2042729.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25[/tpl] for "stylized violence and action". In late August, the BBFC relaxed their policy to '12A', leading Sony to re-release the film.[tpl]cite news|title=Film ratings for children relaxed|publisher=BBC|date=August 29, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2222009.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25[/tpl]

===Critical reception===

Spider-Man received highly positive reviews from film critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes calculated an 89% overall approval based on 216 reviews.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman/?critic=creamcrop | title=Spider-Man | work=Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=Flixster|accessdate=2012-07-05[/tpl] The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the Houston Chronicle, was initially skeptical of the casting of Tobey Maguire, but, after seeing the film, he stated, "within seconds, however, it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1394713.html | title=Harrison review | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=2007-01-23 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012144642/http://chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1394713.html | archivedate=2007-10-12[/tpl] USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's Superman.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-05-03-spider-man.htm#more | title=Mike Clark review | publisher=USA Today | date=May 3, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-23[/tpl] Owen Gleiberman, of Entertainment Weekly, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. "Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey — the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger — together."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,234775~1~0~spider-man,00.html | title=Entertainment Weekly review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=May 1, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-24[/tpl] The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt thought, "the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss — after one of his many rescues of her — to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1468913|format=Registration required| title=Hollywood Reporter review | publisher=Hollywood Report | date=April 19, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-26 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070503002707/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1468913  | archivedate=2007-05-03[/tpl]
Conversely, LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis wrote, "It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated."[tpl]cite web|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film/i-bug/3951/|title=I, Bug|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=2009-05-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221160439/http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film/i-bug/3951/|archivedate=2007-12-21[/tpl] Giving it 2.5/4 stars, Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element; "Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea."[tpl]cite web | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020503/REVIEWS/205030303/1023 | title=Roger Ebert review | publisher=Chicago Sun-Times | date=May 3, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-26[/tpl] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression."[tpl]cite news | author = Richard George | title = Spider-Man in Film: Volume One | publisher = IGN | date=April 19, 2007|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html|accessdate=2007-04-27[/tpl]
Entertainment Weekly put "the kiss in Spider-Man" on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out.

===Box office performance===

Spider-Man was a major commercial success, becoming the first film to pass the $100 million mark in a single weekend. With the release in the United States and Canada on May 3, 2002 on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters, the film earned $39,406,872 on its opening day, averaging $10,901 per theater ($5,524.25 per screen). This was the highest-opening day at the time until it was surpassed by its sequel, Spider-Man 2, in 2004.
