Nanjing ([tpl]audio|Chinese-Nanjing.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|南京[/tpl]|p=Nánjīng|w=Nan-ching[/tpl]) is the capital of Jiangsu province in eastern China and has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having been the capital of China on several occasions. Its present name means "Southern Capital" and was widely romanized as Nankin and Nanking until the pinyin language reform, after which Nanjing was gradually adopted as the standard spelling of the city's name in most languages that use the Roman alphabet.
Located in the lower Yangtze River drainage basin and Yangtze River Delta economic zone, Nanjing has long been one of China's most important cities. It is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It was the capital of Wu during the Three Kingdoms Period and the capital of the Republic of China prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. Nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has long been a national centre of education, research, transport networks and tourism. The city will host the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics.
With an urban population of over seven million (2011), Nanjing is the second-largest commercial centre in the East China region after Shanghai. It has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of "Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honour of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award and National Civilized City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nanjing2009.fide.com/ |title=Home - Women GP - Nanjing |publisher=Nanjing2009.fide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

Nanjing was one of the earliest established cities in what is now China. According to legend,[tpl]which|date=September 2011[/tpl] Fu Chai, Lord of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng ([tpl]linktext|冶城[/tpl]) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BCE. Later in 473 BCE, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng ([tpl]linktext|越城[/tpl]) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BCE, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi ([tpl]linktext|金陵|邑[/tpl]) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. Under the Qin and Han dynasties, it was called Moling ([tpl]linktext|秣陵[/tpl]). Since then, the city had experienced destruction and renewal many times.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===Capital of the Six Dynasties===

Nanjing first became a capital in 229 CE, where Sun Quan of the Wu Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms Period relocated its capital to Jianye ([tpl]linktext|建業[/tpl]), a city he extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in 211 CE. Although conquered by the West Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighbouring areas had been well cultivated and developed into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the rule of East Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.
Shortly after the unification of the region, the state of West Jin collapsed in wars. It was at first rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of Jin in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang ([tpl]linktext|建康[/tpl]).
During the period of North–South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia and one of the largest cities in the world. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households.《金陵记》：“梁都之时，城中二十八万户，西至石头，东至倪塘，南至石子冈，北过蒋山，东西南北各四十里。” [tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Assuming an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District.[tpl]Cite book|author=Liang Baiquan|title=Nanjing-de Liu Chao Shike (Nanjing's Six Dynasties' Sculptures)|isbn=7-80614-376-9|pages=53–54|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475–518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.[ref]Albert E.

===Sui to Yuan dynasty===

The city of Nanjing was razed after the Sui took over it. It was reconstructed during the late Tang dynasty. It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling ([tpl]linktext|金陵[/tpl]) during the Southern Tang (937–976), a state that came succeeded the Wu.[tpl]cite book|author=Johannes L.

===Capital of the Ming===

The first emperor of the Ming dynasty Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor) who overthrew the Yuan dynasty rebuilt this city and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed what was the longest city wall in the world at that time. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the project. The present-day city wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time,[tpl]dubious|date=September 2011[/tpl] and it is the longest surviving city wall in China.
Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421, when the third emperor of the dynasty, Zhu Di (the Yongle Emperor), relocated the capital to Beijing. It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
Besides the city wall, other famous Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century.
A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming is the Yangshan Quarry (located some [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of the walled city an Ming Xiaoling), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or erect it.[tpl]harvnb|Yang|Lu|2001|pp=616–617[/tpl]
As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections: it was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (Boni 渤泥), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The king's tomb, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.''Johannes L. Kurz, "Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the  Qing Dynasties", Nalanda-Sriwijaya Centre Working Paper No 4 (July 2011),

===Qing period===

Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to the Li Zicheng's rebels and then to Manchu Qing invaders, and the suicide of the last legitimate Ming emperor Zhu Youjian (the Chongzhen Emperor) in the spring 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.
Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Manchu troops, when the Manchu army, led by Prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring.Struve (1993), p.55–56 Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial palace was looted by local residents.Struve (1993), pp. 60–61 On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them.Struve (1993), pp. 62–63 The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu way, requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and destroyed the former imperial palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Struve (1993), pp. 64–65, 72
Under the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning ([tpl]linktext|江寧[/tpl]) and served as the seat of government for the Liangjiang Viceroy. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces.
Nanjing was invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.
As the capital of the brief-lived Taiping Kingdom[tpl]cite web|author=Publicado por Eduardo Real |url=http://dangeroustravel.blogspot.com/2008/05/taiping-rebellion.html |title=Eduardo Real: ‘’The Taiping Rebellion’’ |publisher=Dangeroustravel.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing ([tpl]linktext|天京[/tpl], "Heavenly Capital" or "Capital of Heaven") Both the Qing Viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When the Qing under Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===Capital of the Republic===

The Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Dr. Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanking was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the North, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the last-Qing Emperor's abdication. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).
In 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanking as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade.
In 1937, Japan again invaded China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theatre of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the "Rape of Nanking"). The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal, was between 300,000 and 350,000.Document sent by former Japanese foreign minister Hirota Koki to the Japanese Embassy in Washington on January 17, 1938, (Ref. National Archives, Washington, D.C., Released in Sept. 1994.) The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.
A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (now Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the "Nanjing Regime" or "Nanjing Nationalist Government" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-Shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.

===People's Republic of China===

On April 23, 1949, the People's Liberation Army conquered Nanjing. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it soon became the provincial capital of Jiangsu, and retains that status to this day.

==Geography==

Nanjing, with a total land area of [tpl]convert|6598|km2|sqmi[/tpl], is situated in one of the largest economic zones of China, the Yangtze River Delta, which is part of the downstream Yangtze River drainage basin. The Yangtze River flows past the west side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south side of the city. The city is [tpl]convert|300|km|mi[/tpl] west-northwest of Shanghai, [tpl]convert|1200|km|mi[/tpl] south-southeast of Beijing, and [tpl]convert|1400|km|mi[/tpl] east-northeast of Chongqing.
Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast, one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze, Zhenjiang to the east, one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze, and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui province, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities.
Nanjing is the intersection of Yangtze River—an east-west water transport artery and Nanjing–Beijing railway—a south-north land transport artery, hence the name “door of the east and west, throat of the south and north”. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain is curling in the east of the city; the tiger-like Stone Mountain is crouching in the west of the city, hence the name “the Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching”. Mr. Sun Yet-sen spoke highly of Nanjing in the “Constructive Scheme for Our Country”, “The position of Nanjing is wonderful since mountains, lakes and plains all integrated in it. It is hardly [tpl]sic[/tpl] to find another city like this.”

===Climate and environment===

Nanjing has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) and is under the influence of the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct here, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the "Three Furnacelike Cities" along the Yangtze River ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|长江流域三大火炉[/tpl]) for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime.[ref]
