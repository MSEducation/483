The smoot [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|m|uː|t[/tpl] is a nonstandard unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity prank. It is named after Oliver R. Smoot, a fraternity pledge to Lambda Chi Alpha, who in October 1958 lay on the Harvard Bridge (between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts), and was used by his fraternity brothers to measure the length of the bridge.

==Unit description==

One smoot is equal to Oliver Smoot's height at the time of the prank (five feet and seven inches ~1.70 m).  The bridge's length was measured to be 364.4 smoots (620.1 m) plus or minus one ear, with the "plus or minus" intended to express uncertainty of measurement.Tavernor, Robert, Smoot's Ear: The Measure of Humanity, Yale University Press (2007), ISBN 978-0-300-12492-7, Preface, pp. xi-xvi Over the years the "or minus" portion has gone astray in many citations, including the markings at the site itself, but has now been enshrined in stone by Smoot's college class.

==History==

To implement his use as a measuring unit, Oliver Smoot repeatedly lay down on the bridge, let his companions mark his new position in chalk or paint, and then got up again.  Eventually, he got tired from all this exercise and was carried thereafter by the fraternity brothers to each new position.Smoot Day on October 4, 2008
Oliver Smoot graduated from MIT with the class of 1962, became a lawyer, and later became chairman of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)Oliver R. Smoot and president of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).MIT - a salute to Smoot He is the cousin of Nobel Prize winner George Smoot.  The prank's fiftieth anniversary was commemorated on October 4, 2008 as Smoot Celebration Day at MIT, which Smoot attended.
In 2011, "smoot" was one of the 10,000 new words added to the fifth edition of the American Heritage Dictionary.[tpl]cite news|last=Cornish|first=Audie|title=Looking Up Words In A Book Not So Strange Yet|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/11/13/142284657/looking-up-words-in-a-book-not-so-strange-yet|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=2011-11-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=smoot&submit.x=47&submit.y=23|work=American Heritage Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|title=American Heritage Dictionary entry|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl]

==Practical use==

People walking across the bridge today can see painted markings indicating how many smoots there are from where the sidewalk begins on the Boston river bank. The marks are repainted each semester by the incoming associate member class (similar to pledge class) of Lambda Chi Alpha.
Markings typically appear every 10 smoots, but additional marks appear at other numbers in between. For example, the 70-smoot mark is omitted in favor of a mark for 69.Photo from the location  The 182.2-smoot mark is accompanied by the words "Halfway to Hell" and an arrow pointing towards MIT.  Each class also paints a special mark for their graduating year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
The markings have become well accepted by the public, to the degree that during the bridge renovations that occurred in the 1980s, the Cambridge Police department requested that the markings be maintained, since they had become useful for identifying the location of accidents on the bridge.Keyser describes his top five hacks - MIT News Office The renovators went one better, by scoring the concrete surface of the sidewalk on the bridge at 5 foot 7 inch intervals, instead of the conventional six feet.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/07/AR2005120702328_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Measure of This Man Is in the Smoot | first=David A. | last=Fahrenthold | accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl]
Google Calculator also incorporates smoots, which it reckons at exactly 67 inches (1.7018 meters).Google: "1 smoot in meters" Google also uses the smoot as an optional unit of measurement in their Google Earth software and Google Maps distance measurement tool.Google Maps distance measurement tool
