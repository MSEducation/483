[[10BASE-FL]]

CATEGORIES: Ethernet

10BASE-FL is the most commonly used 10BASE-F specification of Ethernet over optical fiber. It replaces the original fiber-optic inter-repeater link (FOIRL) specification, but retains compatibility with FOIRL-based equipment.  Maximum segment length values 2000 meters[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techfest.com/networking/lan/ethernet4.htm TechFest |title=Ethernet Technical Summary |accessdate=2012-03-24[/tpl] When mixed with FOIRL equipment, maximum segment length is limited to FOIRL's 1000 meters.
In 10BASE-F standard, the 10 represents its maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and F indicates that it relies on medium of fiber-optic cable. In fact, there are at least three different kinds of 10BASE-F. All require two strands of 62.5/125 µm multimode fiber. One strand is used for data transmission and one strand is used for reception, making 10BASE-F a full-duplex technology.
After the introduction of 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL was developed. In 10BASE-FL, FL stands for fiber optic link: It is a version of fiber-optic cable for transmitting data package using pulses of light, rather than electrical signal. The use of fiber optic cable provides advantages over copper cables (Ethernet) for multiple reasons. Fiber optic cable is immune to electrical and magnetic interference so it can be used in high interference environment. 10BASE-FL can reach 2000 meters while 10BASE-T is limited to 100 meters.
Today, 10BASE-FL is rarely used in networking and has been replaced by the family of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet standards.
