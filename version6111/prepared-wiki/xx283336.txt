The 1958 Yellow River flood was an extraordinarily large rise in the water flow of the Yellow River in China that coincided with the onset of the Great Leap Forward. 
In July 1958, the peak discharge of the Yellow River at Huayuankou was 22,300 m3/s and the flood water level was so high that it rose up to the top of the levee in several places.Zhang Hai-Lun and Wen Kang, Flood Control and Management for Large Rivers in China, presented at: Workshop on Strengthening Capacity in Participatory Planning and Management for Flood Mitigation and Preparedness in Large River Basins: Regional Cooperation in Flood Control and Management in Asia and the Pacific, Phase II, Bangkok, 20â€“23 November 2001
