====2008 season====

On April 28, 2008, Guyton signed as an undrafted free agent with the New England Patriots. The previous day rumors circulated that Guyton had agreed to terms with the San Francisco 49ers, however confusion arose when 49ers General Manager Scot McCloughan said he would divulge names of undrafted free agents with whom the club had agreed to terms and the following day, Guyton had officially signed with the Patriots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/04/udfa_gary_guyto.html|title=UDFA Gary Guyton signs|work=Boston.com Reiss' Pieces|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://49ers.pressdemocrat.com/default.asp?item=2195440|title=UFDA Guyton gets away from 49ers|work=The Press Democrat|first=Matt|last=Maiocco|date=2008-04-29|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]
Guyton, an undrafted free agent, made the Patriots' 53-man roster, and was active for all but one game of his rookie season in 2008, while the Patriots' third-round draft pick Shawn Crable, an outside linebacker, was inactive, and another inside linebacker, sixth-round draft pick Bo Ruud, was placed on injured reserve. Guyton also started two games late in the season after an injury to Tedy Bruschi.
In the Patriots' Week 4 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Patriots employed multiple nickel and dime defenses that gave Guyton more defensive snaps than fellow rookie inside linebacker Jerod Mayo, the Patriots' 2008 first-round draft pick.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/10/defensive_snaps_3.html|first=Mike|last=Reiss|title=Reiss' Pieces: Defensive snaps analysis|work=Boston.com Reiss' Pieces|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] 
In interviews, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick noted that they had debated drafting Guyton over Ruud, but ultimately chose Ruud;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/patriots/content/sp_fbn_pats_journal05_11-05-08_1VC5QM4_v14.34b9741.html|title=Versatile linebacker Gary Guyton is a keeper|work=The Providence Journal|first=Robert|last=Lee|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] in retrospect, Belichick admitted that the Patriots should have drafted Guyton and undrafted free agent running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/11/09/webdan/?page=full|title=Green-Ellis making a name for himself|work=The Boston Globe|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl]

====2009 season====

Due to Bruschi's retirement just prior to the start of the season, Guyton would go to start all 16 games for the Patriots in 2009. He began the season as a 3-4 weakside linebacker before the middle linebacker, Mayo, was injured in Week 1. Guyton started at 4-3 middle linebacker for the Patriots in Weeks 2â€“5, in place of Mayo. Upon Mayo's return, the two started the rest of the season as 3-4 inside linebackers. Guyton finished the season with 85 tackles and 1.5 sacks.
Following the season, the Patriots signed Guyton to a two-year extension worth over $2.1 million, including a $650,000 signing bonus; as Guyton was an exclusive rights free agent, the Patriots were only required to offer him a one-year minimum tender of $470,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/2010/06/coming_to_the_n.html?comments=all&csort=desc|title=Coming to the numbers on Guyton|work=The Boston Globe|first=Albert|last=Breer|date=2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-07-21[/tpl]
