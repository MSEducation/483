The London Marathon is a long-distance running event held in London, United Kingdom and part of the World Marathon Majors. The event was first run on 29 March 1981 and has been held in the spring of every year since.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IsgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92-IA1&dq=London+Marathon#v=onepage&q=London%20Marathon&f=false |title=Runner's World, Vol. 42, No. 1|date=Jan 2007 |page=82 |publisher=Rodale, Inc.|ISSN= 0897-1706 |accessdate=30 September 2010 [/tpl] Since 2010, the race has been sponsored by Virgin Money, and is known as the Virgin Money London Marathon. The 34th London Marathon took place on 13 April 2014,[tpl]cite web|title=Virgin Money London Marathon|url=http://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/|accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl] and the 35th London Marathon is scheduled for 26 April 2015.

==Overview==

The race was founded by the former Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and Welsh athlete John Disley. It is organised by Hugh Brasher (son of Chris) as Race Director and Nick Bitel as Chief Executive. Set over a largely flat course around the River Thames, the race begins at three separate points around Blackheath and finishes in The Mall alongside St. James's Park. Since the first marathon, the course has undergone very few route changes. In 1982, the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall.
In addition to being one of the top five international marathons run over the distance of 42.195 kilometres, the IAAF standard for the marathon established in 1921 and originally used for the 1908 London Olympics, the London Marathon is also a large, celebratory sporting festival, second only to the Great North Run in South Shields in terms of the number of participants. The event has raised over £450 million for charity since 1981,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/news-and-media/news-and-media/why-virgin/ |title=Virgin London Marathon |publisher=www.virginlondonmarathon.com |accessdate=30 September 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9046495 | work=The Economist | title=Give it everything you've got | date=19 April 2007[/tpl] and holds the Guinness world record as the largest annual fund raising event in the world, with the 2009 participants raising over £47.2 million for charity.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8617000/8617462.stm |title=BBC – Your London Marathon guide |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=30 September 2010 |date=25 April 2010[/tpl] In 2007, 78% of all runners raised money.  In 2011 the official charity of the London Marathon was Oxfam.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]  In 2014, the official charity was Antony Nolan Trust, and in 2015, it will be Cancer Research UK.

==History==

The London Marathon was not the first long-distance running event held in the city, which has a long history of marathon events. The Polytechnic Marathon (also known as the Poly) was first held in 1909.Kingston Harriers, The Polytechnic Marathon, a short history[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
The current London Marathon was founded in 1981 by former Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and Welsh athlete John Disley.[tpl]cite web| title=Virgin London Marathon – Background | url=http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/history-london-marathon/in-the-beginning/ | accessdate=29 April 2009[/tpl] Shortly after completing the New York Marathon in November 1979 Brasher wrote an article for The Observer newspaper which began:
 
 To believe this story you must believe that the human race be one joyous family, working together, laughing together, achieving the impossible. Last Sunday, in one of the most trouble-stricken cities in the world, 11,532 men and women from 40 countries in the world, assisted by over a million black, white and yellow people, laughed, cheered and suffered during the greatest folk festival the world has seen.
Inspired by the people of New York coming together for this occasion, he asked "whether London could stage such a festival?" The following year Brasher and Disley made trips to America to study the organisation and finance of big city marathons (such as those in New York and Boston). Brasher signed a contract with Gillette for £50,000, established charitable status and outlined six main aims in the hope to mirror the scenes he witnessed in New York and establish the United Kingdom on the map as a country capable of arranging major events. The London Marathon was born.[tpl]cite web| title=Flora London Marathon – Background | url=http://www.london-marathon.co.uk/site/?pageID=2&submenu=12&article=1 | accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611044012/http://www.london-marathon.co.uk/site/?pageID=2&submenu=12&article=1  |archivedate = 11 June 2008[/tpl]
The first London Marathon was held on 29 March 1981, more than 20,000 applied to run. 6,747 were accepted and 6,255 crossed the finish line on Constitution Hill. The Marathon's popularity has steadily grown since then. As at 2009, 746,635 people have completed the race since its inception. In 2010, 36,549 people crossed the line, the biggest field since the race began.[tpl]cite web| title=Record Numbers Finish Virgin London Marathon | url=http://lrn.london-marathon.com/record-numbers-finish-first-virgin-london-marathon/ | accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl] The first wheelchair marathon race was held in 1983 and the event was credited with reducing the stigma surrounding disabled athletes.London Marathon.

For many years the London and Polytechnic Marathons competed with each other until, in 1996, the latter folded in due to the popularity of the former. Eleven participants have died since the event began, the most recent being in 2012 when a 30-year-old woman, Claire Squires, collapsed whilst running along Birdcage Walk, near St. James's Park.[tpl]cite news | title=BBC News Website Article: Runner dies after London Marathon | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6583677.stm | accessdate = 24 April 2007 | date=23 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mk-news.co.uk/mknews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=79406 |title=MK News |publisher=MK News |date= |accessdate=22 April 2012[/tpl] She had opened a JustGiving page to raise money for the Samaritans; as news of her death circulated, the number of donations increased from £500 to more than £1 million.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/london-marathon/9224715/Tragic-marathon-runner-Claire-Squires-inspired-by-memory-of-dead-brother.html |title=Tragic marathon runner Claire Squires 'inspired by memory of dead brother' - Telegraph |author=Victoria Ward and Donna Bowater |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 Apr 2012 |publisher=TMG |location=London |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=25 April 2012[/tpl]

==Organisation==

The race is currently organised by former 10,000 m world record holder David Bedford as Race Director and Nick Bitel as Chief Executive. Bedford and Bitel have overseen a period of great change for the race, including amendments to the course in 2005 which saw the famous cobbled section by the Tower of London replaced with a flat stretch along the Highway.[tpl]cite web | title=Flora London Marathon website: Marathon History: Course History | url=http://www.london-marathon.co.uk/site/marathon_history/index.php?page=2 | accessdate = 1 February 2007[/tpl]
Dr Dan Tunstall-Pedoe, was the medical director of the London Marathon for 25 years between the first one in 1981 until 2005. In 2003, Dr Tunstall-Pedoe was shadowed by Professor Sanjay Sharma from St George's University of London who took over the role in its entirety in 2006.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p8gDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=Medical+cover+at+London+marathon#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Runner's World, Vol. 43, No. 12|page=116|date=Dec 2008 |author=Amby Burfoot|ISSN= 0897-1706 |publisher=Rodale, Inc.|accessdate=1 October 2010 [/tpl] Medical cover is provided by 150 highly experienced doctors in internal medicine, intensive care, sports medicine, orthopaedics and anaesthetics. The doctors are assisted by more than 1,500 volunteers of St. John Ambulance, who organise over 50 first aid posts along the route, and three field hospitals at the finish. St John Ambulance also provide a large number of Healthcare Professionals for the event, including a vast number of Nurses and Paramedics. They also provide a large number of Ambulances and Ambulance Crews for use at the event and also across London to support the NHS Ambulance Service.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/london-marathon.html |title=london marathon |publisher=www.pponline.co.uk |accessdate=1 October 2010 [/tpl]
The BBC covers the event, devoting rolling coverage for most of the morning. The theme music associated with this coverage, and with the event itself, is called Main Titles to The Trap, composed by Ron Goodwin for the film The Trap.
There are three separate groups of starters: Elite Women, Wheelchair (Men and Women), and Elite Men followed by Mass Race.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]

==The course==

Set over a largely flat course around the River Thames, and spanning 42.195 kilometres (26 miles and 385 yards),[tpl]cite episode |title=The 2009 London Marathon Highlights |credits=Steve Cram (presenter) |network=British Broadcasting Corporation |station=BBC Two |airdate=26 April 2009 [/tpl] the London Marathon is generally regarded[tpl]by who|date=March 2014[/tpl] as a very competitive and unpredictable event, and conducive to fast times.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The route has markers at one mile and at five kilometre intervals.  Although the race publicity (athlete advice, timing charts and so on) is mile-oriented, the individual timing splits that are available to competitors after the event are kilometre-oriented.
The course begins at three separate points: the 'red start' in southern Greenwich Park on Charlton Way, the 'green start' in St John's Park, and the 'blue start' on Shooter's Hill Road. From these points around Blackheath at [tpl]convert|35|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, south of the River Thames, the route heads east through Charlton. The three courses converge after [tpl]convert|4.5|km|abbr=in[/tpl] in Woolwich, close to the Royal Artillery Barracks.[tpl]cite news |title=Interactive Marathon Map |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/8011891.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2009  | date=23 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Peter |last1=Storey |first2=Tola |last2=Onanuga |first3=Sam |last3=Murphy |first4=John |last4=Ashdown |title=London Marathon 2009: Mile-by-mile route map |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/interactive/2009/apr/22/london-marathon-route-map |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 [/tpl]
As the runners reach the [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|adj=mid|mark|abbr=in[/tpl], they pass by the Old Royal Naval College and head towards Cutty Sark drydocked in Greenwich. Heading next into Surrey Quays in the Docklands, and out towards Bermondsey, competitors race along Jamaica Road before reaching the half-way point as they cross Tower Bridge. Running east again along The Highway through Wapping, competitors head up towards Limehouse and into Mudchute in the Isle of Dogs via Westferry Road, before heading into Canary Wharf.
As the route leads away from Canary Wharf into Poplar, competitors run west down Poplar High Street back towards Limehouse and on through Commercial Road. They then move back onto The Highway, onto Lower and Upper Thames Streets. Heading into the final leg of the race, competitors pass The Tower of London on Tower Hill.  In the penultimate mile along The Embankment, the London Eye comes into view, before the athletes turn right into Birdcage Walk to complete the final [tpl]convert|352|m|yd|abbr=in[/tpl], catching the sights of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, and finishing in The Mall alongside St. James's Palace. This final section of the route formed part of the 2012 Olympic Marathon Course.
Since the first marathon, the course has undergone very few route changes. In the first race, the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re-joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel, en route to the Tower of London and the famous cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted, to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface.  In 1982, the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall. In 2005, the route around the Isle of Dogs between [tpl]convert|22|and|34|km|mi[/tpl] was switched from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise direction, and at [tpl]convert|35|km|mi|abbr=in[/tpl] the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the cobblestoned area near the Tower of London. In 2008, a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course, but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007.[tpl]cite news |first1=Abigail |last1=Gliddon |first2=Tola |last2=Onanuga |title=London Marathon: A brief history |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/24/london-marathon-brief-history |work=The Guardian |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=History of the London Marathon – Course History |url=http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/history-london-marathon/course-history/ |publisher=London Marathon |accessdate=13 May 2009 [/tpl]

In 1983, the first wheelchair races took place. Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.[tpl]cite web |title=1983 Race Report |url=http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/history-london-marathon/race-history/race-report-1983 |publisher=London Marathon |accessdate=12 May 2009 [/tpl]
World records for marathon running have been set four times. Khalid Khannouchi, representing the United States, set the men's world record in 2:05:38 in 2002. The following year, British runner Paula Radcliffe set the women's world record in 2:15:25 (later briefly downgraded to "world best" by the IAAF as it was achieved in a mixed race,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/olympics/story/15234/7256951 |title=Radcliffe to lose records.

Radcliffe's time also stands as the current course record in the Women's Elite Race: this followed women's records set in 1983 and 1985 by Grete Waitz and Ingrid Kristiansen respectively, both of Norway. The current men's course record is 2:04:29, set by Kenyan Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich in the 2014 edition. Kurt Fearnley of Australia set the Men's Wheelchair Race course record at 1:28:57 in 2009, and the Women's equivalent was set by American athlete Tatyana McFadden in 2013, with 1:46:02.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/sport/athletics/london_marathon_2013_american_tatyana_mcfadden_claims_victory_as_shelly_woods_finishes_fifth_1_2161381 |work=East London Advertiser |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |title=London Marathon 2013: American Tatyana McFadden claims victory as Shelly Woods finishes fifth[/tpl]

==Amateur runners==

The race attracts amateur runners who make up the bulk of the thirty thousand or more participants; commonly running in fancy dress for charity causes. In 2002, Lloyd Scott completed the marathon wearing a deep sea diving suit that weighed a total of [tpl]convert|110|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl], with each shoe weighing [tpl]convert|24|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]; he also set a record for the slowest London Marathon time.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1935471.stm |title=BBC News | UK | Marathon man erodes lead boots  |work=BBC News |date=17 April 2002 |publisher=BBC |location=London |accessdate=23 April 2012[/tpl] On 19 April 2003, former boxer Michael Watson, who had been told he would never be able to walk again after a fight with Chris Eubank, made headlines by finishing the marathon in six days. In 2006, Sir Steve Redgrave (winner of five consecutive Olympic gold medals) set a new Guinness World Record for money raised through a marathon by collecting £1.8 million in sponsorship. This broke the record set the previous year by the founder of the Oasis Trust, Steve Chalke MBE, who had collected over £1.25 million. Steve Chalke recovered the record in 2007, raising £1.86 million. In 2011 Chalke broke the record for a third time, raising £2.32 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oasisuk.org |title=Oasis Trust |publisher=Oasisuk.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2012[/tpl] The sum of £500 that Claire Squires collected before the race swelled to £920,000 after she died having collapsed during the 2012 race.
A small number of runners, known as the "Ever Presents", have completed each of the London Marathons since 1981. After 2014 their number has shrunk to 14. At the running of the 2014 event the oldest runner was Kenneth Jones, 80 years old, whilst the youngest runner was 55-year-old Chris Finill. They are all male.[tpl]cite web|author=Mike Peel robin-web.co.uk |url=http://www.everpresent.org.uk/ |title=Ever Present Home Page |publisher=Everpresent.org.uk |date= |accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl]
