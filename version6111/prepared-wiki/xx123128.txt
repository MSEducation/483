Cypriot Turkish ([tpl]lang-tr|Kıbrıs Türkçesi[/tpl]) is a dialect of the Turkish language spoken by Turkish Cypriots both in Cyprus and among its diaspora.

==History==

Emanating from Anatolia and evolved for four centuries, Cypriot Turkish is the vernacular spoken by Cypriots with Ottoman ancestry, as well as by Cypriots who converted to Islam during Ottoman rule. It is understood by expatriate Cypriots living in the UK, United States, Australia and other parts of the world.
Cypriot Turkish consists of a blend of Ottoman Turkish and the Yörük dialect spoken to this day in the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey. In addition it has absorbed influences from Greek, Italian and English.
Cypriot Turkish is mutually intelligible with Standard Anatolian Turkish, however may not be understood if natives speak without care, a similar comparison to Swiss and high German can be given.

===Differences between standard Turkish and Cypriot Turkish===

Cypriot Turkish is distinguished by a number of sound alternations not found in standard Turkish, but some of which are also quite common in other Turkish vernaculars:
The last two alternations are more specific to Cypriot Turkish.

===Consonants===

===Vowels===

==Grammar==

Cypriot Turkish is structured as VO language as opposed to standard Turkish which is OV language. It is very typical in forming a question.
Cypriot Turkish also lacks the question suffix of "mi".[tpl]cite paper|last=Demir|first=Nurettin|url=http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/DILBILIM/nurettin_demir_kibris.pdf|title=Kıbrıs Ağızları Üzerine Notlar|language=Turkish|publisher=Çukurova University|journal=Journal of Turcology|accessdate=14 June 2011[/tpl]
In Cypriot Turkish, the reflexive pronoun in third person is different, namely genni (him, himself, them, themself). In Standard Turkish, kendisini.

==Semantics==

Typical question sentences most of the time do not qualify as a standard Turkish question. See the example above.
This is due to the fact that question suffixes are most of the time dropped by native Turkish Cypriots. Another subtle difference is the emphasis on verbs.
