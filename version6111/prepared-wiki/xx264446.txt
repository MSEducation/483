==History==

Lifeway Foods was founded by Michael Smolyansky, an immigrant who arrived in the United States from Kiev, Ukraine, in 1976. Ten years after moving to the US, he found the fermented milk drink kefir at a food show and decided to start producing it. The company started in Michael's basement, but it soon turned public. After Michael's death in 2002, his daughter, Julie Smolyansky, took over the company.[tpl]cite web |url=http://origin-www.lexisnexis.com/ap/auth/ |title= BRIEFS[/tpl]"
