RTX is an annual gaming and internet convention created by Rooster Teeth Productions held in Austin, Texas, and run by Gus Sorola and Barbara Dunkelman of Rooster Teeth.
Starting as a small community gathering of 400 people in 2011, RTX significantly expanded in its following years, housing over 10,000 attendees in 2013. RTX has gained attention for its focus on internet lifestyle and gaming culture. The event includes panels on gaming and internet topics, exhibitor booths from independent and major game developers, as well as meet and greets with game developers, Rooster Teeth employees, and internet personalities. RTX is also notable for being one of the first places consumers may play major video game releases such as Halo 4 and most recently, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

==RTX 2011==

RTX 2011 was originally announced as a "test event". It would be a small gathering of 250 members of the Rooster Teeth community. However, minutes after tickets went on sale the community managed to buy more tickets than originally planned to be sold, accidentally selling over 500 tickets. RTX 2011 was still a small gathering of Rooster Teeth fans. It was held on May 28 and 29.[tpl]cite web|title=RTX Tickets (UPDATE)|url=http://roosterteeth.com/viewEntry.php?id=3171|accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl] Attendees were treated to a tour of the office, an exclusive t-shirt and the chance to take part in a special episode of the Rooster Teeth series, Immersion.
