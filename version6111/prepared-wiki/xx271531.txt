In Beginners, his fur was dyed using non-toxic vegetable colouring in order to make him look more similar to Bowser, a dog owned by writer/director Mike Mills as the story was based on Mills' early life. Working with Cosmo inspired actor Ewan McGregor to get a dog of his own. "I was looking for a replacement for Cosmo because I couldnâ€™t stand the idea of not having him around," said McGregor, who adopted a poodle mix called Sid. "I found my dog on the last day of the shoot. He is gorgeous and my little Cosmo replacement." McGregor stated that he takes Sid for walks with DeCagny and Cosmo in Venice on occasion.
