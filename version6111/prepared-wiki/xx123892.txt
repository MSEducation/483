After recuperating, he returned to the front in late 1915, but then chose to enter pilot training (despite his age, which made him much older than most pilot trainees).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] He received his Observer's Badge on 15 May 1916 and began service as an aerial observer. He flew as an observer for Eduard Ritter von Schleich.Franks, et al p. 59.

On 12 July 1917 he shot down and killed ace Lt. A.W.B. Miller (6 victories) of No. 29 Squadron RFC for his fifth victory. Adam continued to score, totaling 12 confirmed victories by the end of August. He rose to become Staffelführer of Jasta 6 on 30 August 1917, after von Dostler was shot down.Franks, et al p. 59. Adam scored again the following day, then ran off seven more victories in September. He scored his 21st and final victory on 6 November 1917.Franks, et al p. 59.

On 20 May 1919, Bavaria's highest military decoration, the Military Order of Max Joseph (Militär-Max-Joseph-Orden), was posthumously bestowed on Adam, retroactive to 28 July 1917. On that date, as deputy Staffelführer of Jasta 6, while his Staffelführer chased one bomber, Adam had attacked and broken up the rest of a formation of enemy bombers, and continued the pursuit despite damage to his own aircraft, until his squadron had destroyed the enemy formation.
