Carey was designated as referee of Super Bowl XLII between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, becoming the first African American referee to receive the prestigious assignment.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80614a4a&template=without-video&confirm=true | title=Carey to be first black referee in Super Bowl | publisher = Associated Press | date =  2008-01-18 | accessdate = 2008-01-19[/tpl] Carey officiated the same two teams when they played each other during the final week of the 2007 NFL season.
Carey is one of the two senior referees in the NFL, along with Walt Coleman. Carey was promoted in 1995 when the league added the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars and thus needed an extra officiating crew to handle up to 15 games per weekend instead of 14, which had been the case between 1976 and 1994.

Carey attended and later graduated from Santa Clara University in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in biology.  While at SCU, he played running back for four years until an ankle injury ended his playing career. The injury continues to impact Carey today as it limits his running ability.  He only allows himself to run on days he is scheduled to officiate games.
