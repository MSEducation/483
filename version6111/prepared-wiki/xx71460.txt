==General==

Individualist feminists attempt to change legal systems in order to eliminate class privileges and gender privileges and to ensure that individuals have equal rights, including an equal claim under the law to their own persons and property. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility for their own lives. It also opposes any government interference into the choices adults make with their own bodies because, it contends, such interference creates a coercive hierarchy (such as patriarchy).[tpl]cite book |editor=McElroy, Wendy |authorlink=Wendy McElroy |title=Liberty for Women: Freedom and Feminism in the 21st century |year=2002 |publisher=Ivan R.

Individualist feminism was cast to appeal to "younger women ... of a more conservative generation"Siegel, Deborah, Sisterhood, Interrupted: From Radical Women to Grrls Gone Wild (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 1st ed. 2007 (ISBN 978-1-4039-8204-9)), p. 123 and see pp. 122–124 & nn. 32–34 (author Ph.D., writer & consultant on women's issues, & fellow, Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership). and includes concepts from Rene Denfeld and Naomi Wolf, essentially that "feminism should no longer be about communal solutions to communal problems but individual solutions to individual problems", and concepts from Wendy McElroy and especially Joan Kennedy Taylor.

Wendy McElroy and Christina Hoff Sommers define individualist feminism in opposition to what they call political or gender feminism.[tpl]cite book |author=McElroy, Wendy |title=Liberty for Women: Freedom and Feminism in the 21st century |year=2002 |publisher=Ivan R.

Sommers focuses... on the feminists and cultural liberals against whom she has a long-standing animus... This intemperate book is a hindrance to such conversation." Other scholars note that individualist feminism has a long history that is somewhat different in tone that currently advocated by McElroy and Sommers.Reclaiming the Mainstream: Individualist Feminism Rediscovered (Prometheus, 1992) by Joan Kennedy Taylor (New York University Press, 1999)
