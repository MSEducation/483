[[New Jersey Route 184]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Middlesex County, New Jersey

Route 184 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It is an old section of Route 440 that was rerouted. Route 184's western end is at an intersection with the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge Township; NJ 184's eastern end is at an intersection with Route 35 in Perth Amboy. The highway passes several local landmarks along the highway, but is less populated than the surrounding area. The entire highway is concurrent with County Route 501, but is not county-maintained. 
The route originated as Route S4, which became NJ 440 on January 1, 1953. In 1974, a part of Route 440 was bypassed and rerouted, and the New Jersey State Highway Department reassigned the former alignment as NJ 184.

==Route description==

Route 184 begins at an interchange with the Garden State Parkway's exit 129 and County Route 501 (CR 501) n Woodbridge Township. The route, immediately concurrent with CR 501 is known as King Georges Road, which turns to the north near Fords Park. Just after the split from King Georges Road, Route 184 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 9 and passes south of Hopelawn Park. After passing the local cemetery, the route crosses a junction with CR 655 (Florida Grove Road). Continuing east, the route becomes known as Pfieffer Boulevard and crosses an interchange with Route 440 in Perth Amboy.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=king+georges+post+road+and+jensen+avenue+woodbridge,+nj&daddr=40.528055,-74.281332+to:route+184+and+route+35+perth+amboy,+nj&hl=en&geocode=&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=16&via=1&sll=40.529686,-74.285109&sspn=0.007665,0.013733&ie=UTF8&ll=40.533307,-74.292426&spn=0.01533,0.027466&t=h&z=15 |title=overview of New Jersey Route 184 |accessdate=2008-02-08[/tpl]
Just east of Route 440, the route continues northward until reaching an intersection with Route 35 (Convery Boulevard), marking the eastern terminus of Route 184.

==History==

Route 184 originated as a prefixed spur of Route 4 (currently an alignment of U.S. Route 9), New Jersey State Highway Route S-4, first defined in 1927. The highway was an alignment from the new Outerbridge Crossing to Route 4.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. It was eventually extended from Route 4 to the recently built Route 4 Parkway (now the Garden State Parkway) in 1951. In the 1953 renumbering on January 1, 1953, Route S-4 was decommissioned and renumbered to Route 440 to match up with New York State Route 440 in Staten Island.[tpl]Cite document|title=1953 renumbering|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering|publisher=New Jersey Department of Highways|accessdate=July 31, 2009|postscript=.[/tpl]
