==History==

1948-2009
Kippax Welfare rugby league has been a part of Kippax village for many years. The first ever team was formed in 1948 by Jack Kielty based at the 'Old Tree inn'.
In 1958 Kippax went on to win the Yorkshire Cup beating Castleford Lock Lane. By the late 1960s through to the 70s, Kippax were now playing from 'the White Swan'. Kippax were now at their best, famous for playing a no nonsense style of rugby and were amongst the elite of amateur rugby clubs. 
Kipaax has played in the Challenge Cup on numerous occasions, but 1973/74 was the first time Kippax played in the proper first round of the Challenge Cupcoming up against Leigh Centurions which Kippax fell just short of winning. 
In the early 1980s, Kippax moved to the Longdike Lane facilities. This also saw the introduction of youth and junior teams, producing some of super league's finest players such as Matt Crowther, Paul Darley, Gavin Swinson and as well as two England and Great Britain internationals, Danny Orr and Andy Lynch. 
During the early 2000s, Kippax Welfare were now playing in the Pennine Leagues, becoming Division Three Champions in 2002/03, Division Two Champions in 2004/05 and Division One Champions in 2008/09 as well as Castleford Cup Champions the same year meaning this was a double winning season, while the Kippax 'A' (second) team won Pennine Division Six (Undefeated).
2009â€“Present
In February 2009, the team was renamed Kippax Knights and they joined the Yorkshire Premier division of the Rugby League Conference. The Knights managed to win the 2009 Yorkshire Premier Division in this first season, then they also went on to win the Grand Final, making it a double winning 2009 season. 
2010, Kippax were promoted to the National League, with more challenging opposition they managed to finish in the play-off places, but couldn't go any further. The 2011 season started with a first round date in the Challenge Cup against Loughborough University with the Knights narrowly losing. The Knights finished 2011 in the Grand Final at Halliwell Jones stadium, losing to Huddersfield Underbank Rangers. 
With the Knights' establishment, the future looks bright with our several youth/junior teams going from strength to strength
both on & off the field.
