It is the second oldest continental football championship in the world after Copa Am√©rica.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] The winning team becomes the champion of Asia and automatically qualifies for the FIFA Confederations Cup.
The Asian Cup was held once every four years from the 1956 in Hong Kong until the 2004 in Mainland China. However, since the Summer Olympic Games and the European Football Championship were also scheduled in the same year as the Asian Cup, the AFC decided to move their championship to a less crowded cycle.  After 2004, the tournament was next held in 2007 co-hosted by four nations: (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam), and thereafter will be held every four years.
