Europium is a chemical element with the symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It is named after the continent Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common: all europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.
Europium becomes a superconductor when it is cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state,[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.11.2836|title=Generalized phase diagram for the rare-earth elements: Calculations and correlations of bulk properties|year=1975|last1=Johansson|first1=Börje|last2=Rosengren|first2=Anders|journal=Physical Review B|volume=11|issue=8|pages=2836–2857|bibcode = 1975PhRvB..11.2836J [/tpl] and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).[tpl]cite journal |title = Pressure-Induced Superconducting State of Europium Metal at Low Temperatures| journal = Phys.

===Chemical properties===

Europium is the most reactive rare earth element. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter-sized sample occurs within several days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl] Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium, and the reaction is
Because of the high reactivity, samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180 °C to form europium(III) oxide:
Europium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form pale pink solutions of the hydrated Eu(III), which exist as a nonahydrate:[tpl]cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/europium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Europium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl]

====Eu(II) vs. Eu(III)====

Although usually trivalent, europium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual to most lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an electron configuration 4f7 because the half-filled f-shell gives more stability. In terms of size and coordination number, europium(II) and barium(II) are similar. For example, the sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1002/9780470132333.ch19|chapter = Europium(II) Salts|title = Inorganic Syntheses|series = Inorganic Syntheses|year = 1946|last1 = Cooley|first1 = Robert A.|last2 = Yost|first2 = Don M.|last3 = Stone|first3 = Hosmer W.|isbn = 978-0-470-13233-3|volume = 2|pages = 69–73[/tpl] Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the "negative europium anomaly", the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the chondritic abundance. Bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate europium from the other trivalent lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 isotopes, 151Eu and 153Eu, with 153Eu being the most abundant (52.2% natural abundance). While 153Eu is stable, 151Eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half-life of [tpl]val|5|+11|-3|e=18|ul=years[/tpl],[tpl]cite journal|title=Search for α decay of natural europium|author= Belli, P.|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2007.03.001|year=2007|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=789|pages=15–29|display-authors=1|last2=Bernabei|first2=R|last3=Cappella|first3=F|last4=Cerulli|first4=R|last5=Dai|first5=C|last6=Danevich|first6=F|last7=Dangelo|first7=A|last8=Incicchitti|first8=A|last9=Kobychev|first9=V|bibcode = 2007NuPhA.789...15B [/tpl] giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium. This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope 151Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 150Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, 152Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and 154Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8 meta states, with the most stable being 150mEu (T½=12.8 hours), 152m1Eu (T½=9.3116 hours) and 152m2Eu (T½=96 minutes).[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |author=Nucleonica |date=2007–2011 |work=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |publisher=Nucleonica |accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl]

The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than 153Eu is electron capture, and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 153Eu are isotopes of samarium (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium (Gd).

====Europium as a nuclear fission product====

Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products.
Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often high enough to be neutron poisons.
151Eu is the beta decay product of samarium-151, but since this has a long decay half-life and short mean time to neutron absorption, most 151Sm instead ends up as 152Sm.
152Eu (half-life 13.516 years) and 154Eu (half-life 8.593 years) cannot be beta decay products because 152Sm and 154Sm are non-radioactive, but 154Eu is the only long-lived "shielded" nuclide, other than 134Cs, to have a fission yield of more than 2.5 parts per million fissions.Tables of Nuclear Data, Japan Atomic Energy Agency A larger amount of 154Eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the non-radioactive 153Eu; however, much of this is further converted to 155Eu.
155Eu (half-life 4.7612 years) has a fission yield of 330 parts per million (ppm) for uranium-235 and thermal neutrons; most of it is transmuted to non-radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium-156 by the end of fuel burnup.
Overall, europium is overshadowed by caesium-137 and strontium-90 as a radiation hazard, and by samarium and others as a neutron poison.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.2172/759039|title = Neutron cross section evaluations of fission products below the fast energy region|year = 2000|last1 = Oh|first1 = S.Y.|last2 = Chang|first2 = J.|last3 = Mughabghab|first3 = S.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.71.643|title = Activities Induced by Pile Neutron Bombardment of Samarium|year = 1947|last1 = Inghram|first1 = Mark|last2 = Hayden|first2 = Richard|last3 = Hess|first3 = David|journal = Physical Review|volume = 71|issue = 9|pages = 643–643|bibcode = 1947PhRv...71..643I [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1103/PhysRev.75.1500|title =Reactions Induced by Slow Neutron Irradiation of Europium|year =1949|last1 =Hayden|first1 =Richard|last2 =Reynolds|first2 =John|last3 =Inghram|first3 =Mark|journal =Physical Review|volume =75|issue =10|pages =1500–1507|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1500H [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ac60089a030|title = Activation Analysis of Several Rare Earth Elements|year = 1954|last1 = Meinke|first1 = W.

===Occurrence===

Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime and loparite.[tpl]cite book|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.120114201901021|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|volume = 14|chapter = Lanthanides|first1 = Patrick|last1 =Maestro|isbn = 978-0-471-23896-6|pages = 1096–1120[/tpl]
Depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as the europium anomaly.[tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=OmUXW8pqUe8C&pg=PA550|chapter = The Europium anomaly| pages = 550–553|title = Systematics and the properties of the lanthanides|isbn = 978-90-277-1613-2|last = Sinha|first= Shyama P.|author2 = Scientific Affairs Division, North Atlantic Treaty Organization|year = 1983[/tpl] Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.
Divalent europium (Eu2+) in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00308116|title = Color centers, associated rare-earth ions and the origin of coloration in natural fluorites|year = 1978|last1 = Bill|first1 = H.|last2 = Calas|first2 = G.|journal = Physics and Chemistry of Minerals|volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 117–131|bibcode=1978PCM.....3..117B[/tpl] The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.[tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1021/ed100182h|title =A Brief History of Fluorescence and Phosphorescence before the Emergence of Quantum Theory|year =2011|last1 =Valeur|first1 =Bernard|last2 =Berberan-Santos|first2 =Mário N.|journal =Journal of Chemical Education|volume =88|issue =6|pages =731–738|bibcode = 2011JChEd..88..731V [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1016/0016-7037(75)90008-3|title =Europium-activated cathodoluminescence in minerals|year =1975|last1 =Mariano|first1 =A|last2 =King|first2 =P|journal =Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume =39|issue =5|pages =649–660|bibcode = 1975GeCoA..39..649M [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00269-003-0341-3|title = Natural fluorite emitting yellow fluorescence under UV light|year = 2003|last1 = Sidike|first1 = Aierken|last2 = Kusachi|first2 = I.|last3 = Yamashita|first3 = N.|journal = Physics and Chemistry of Minerals|volume = 30|issue = 8|pages = 478–485|bibcode = 2003PCM....30..478S [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1038/135100a0|title = Fluorescence of Fluorite and the Bivalent Europium Ion|year = 1935|last1 = Przibram|first1 = K.|journal = Nature|volume = 135|issue = 3403|pages = 100–100|bibcode = 1935Natur.135..100P [/tpl]

==Production==

Europium is associated with the other rare earth elements and is therefore mined together with them. Separation of the rare earth elements is a step in the later processing. Rare earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite, xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. The first two are orthophosphate minerals LnPO4 (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), and the third is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate.[tpl]cite journal| pages = 197–248|url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/imr/1992/00000037/00000001/art00015|title =Extractive metallurgy of rare earths|journal = International Materials Reviews|year = 1992|volume = 37|first1 = C.

A few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare earth element oxides, the largest known deposit.[ref]
