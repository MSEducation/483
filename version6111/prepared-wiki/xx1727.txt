Absorption from these foods is enhanced if eaten with fats, as carotenes are fat soluble, and if the food is cooked for a few minutes until the plant cell wall splits and the colour is released into any liquid. 6 μg of dietary β-carotene supplies the equivalent of 1 μg of retinol, or 1 RE (Retinol Equivalent).  This is equivalent to 3⅓ IU of vitamin A.

==The multiple forms==

The two primary isomers of carotene, α-carotene and β-carotene, differ in the position of a double bond (and thus a hydrogen) in the cyclic group at one end (left in the diagram here).
β-Carotene is the more common form and can be found in yellow, orange, and green leafy fruits and vegetables. As a rule of thumb, the greater the intensity of the orange colour of the fruit or vegetable, the more β-carotene it contains.
Carotene protects plant cells against the destructive effects of ultraviolet light. β-Carotene is an antioxidant.

==β-Carotene and cancer==

It has been shown in trials that the ingestion of β-carotene supplements at about 30 mg/day (10 times the Reference Daily Intake) increases the rate of lung and prostate cancer development in smokers and people with a history of asbestos exposure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
An article on the American Cancer Society says that The Cancer Research Campaign has called for warning labels on β-carotene supplements to caution smokers that such supplements may increase the risk of lung cancer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp |title=British Cancer Organization Calls for Warning Labels on Beta-Carotene |date=2000-07-31 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061204074724/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp  |archivedate = 2006-12-04[/tpl]
The New England Journal of Medicine published an article[tpl]cite journal |author=The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group |title=The effect of vitamin E and beta carotene on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=330 |issue=15 |pages=1029–35 |year=1994 |pmid=8127329 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199404143301501 [/tpl] in 1994 about a trial which examined the relationship between daily supplementation of β-carotene and vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and the incidence of lung cancer. The study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and lower lung cancer rates. The research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements, and furthermore, these supplements may, in fact, have harmful effects.
The Journal of the National Cancer Institute and The New England Journal of Medicine published articles in 1996[tpl]cite journal |author=Omenn GS, Goodman GE, Thornquist MD, et al. |title=Risk factors for lung cancer and for intervention effects in CARET, the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |volume=88 |issue=21 |pages=1550–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8901853 |doi=10.1093/jnci/88.21.1550 |last12=Cherniack |first12=MG |last13=Brodkin |first13=CA |last14=Hammar |first14=S [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Omenn GS, Goodman GE, Thornquist MD, et al. |title=Effects of a combination of beta carotene and vitamin A on lung cancer and cardiovascular disease|journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=334 |issue=18 |pages=1150–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8602180 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199605023341802 |last12=Hammar |first12=S [/tpl] about a trial that was conducted to determine if vitamin A (in the form of retinyl palmitate) and β-carotene had any beneficial effects to prevent cancer. The results indicated an increased risk of lung cancer for the participants who consumed the β-carotene supplement and who had lung irritation from smoking or asbestos exposure, causing the trial to be stopped early.
A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the Cochrane Collaboration published in JAMA in 2007 found that synthetic β-carotene increased mortality by something between 1 and 8% (Relative Risk 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.08).[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud LL, Simonetti RG, Gluud C |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842[/tpl]
[/ref] However, this meta-analysis included two large studies of smokers, so it is not clear that the results apply to the general population.[ref]
See the letter to JAMA by Philip Taylor and Sanford Dawsey and the reply by the authors of the original paper.
[/ref] The review only studied the influence of synthetic antioxidants and the results should not be translated to potential effects of fruits and vegetables.

==β-Carotene and cognition==

A recent report demonstrated that 50 mg of β-carotene every other day prevented cognitive decline in a study of over 4000 physicians at a mean treatment duration of 18 years.[tpl]cite journal |author=Grodstein F, Kang JH, Glynn RJ, Cook NR, Gaziano JM |title=A randomized trial of beta carotene supplementation and cognitive function in men: the Physicians' Health Study II |journal=Arch Intern Med. |volume=167 |issue=20 |pages=2184–90 |date=Nov 2007 |pmid=17998490 |doi=10.1001/archinte.167.20.2184 [/tpl]

==β-Carotene and photosensitivity==

Oral β-carotene is prescribed to people suffering from erythropoietic protoporphyria. It provides them some relief from photosensitivity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]

==β-Carotene and nanotechnology==

β-Carotene and lycopene molecules can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes enhancing the optical properties of carbon nanotubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT). Encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of carotene molecules; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization.

==Carotenemia==

Carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess carotene, but unlike excess vitamin A, carotene is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia is not particularly dangerous, it can lead to an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the conjunctiva of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from jaundice). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of carrots, but it also can be a medical sign of more dangerous conditions.

==Production==

Most of the world's synthetic supply of carotene comes from a manufacturing complex located in Freeport, Texas and owned by DSM.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] The other major supplier BASF[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene. Together these suppliers account for about 85% of the β-carotene on the market.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] In Spain Vitatene produces natural β-carotene from fungus Blakeslea trispora, as does DSM but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation. In Australia, organic β-carotene is produced by Aquacarotene Limited from dried marine algae Dunaliella salina grown in harvesting ponds situated in Karratha, Western Australia. BASF Australia is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in Australia that are the world’s largest algae farms. In Portugal, the industrial biotechnology company Biotrend is producing natural all-trans-β-carotene from a non genetically modified bacteria of the Sphingomonas genus isolated from soil.
Carotenes are also found in palm oil, corn, and in the milk of dairy cows,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] causing cow's milk to be light yellow, depending on the feed of the cattle, and the amount of fat in the milk (high-fat milks, such as those produced by Guernsey cows, tend to be more yellow because their fat content causes them to contain more carotene).
Carotenes are also found in some species of termites, where they apparently have been picked up from the diet of the insects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]

===Total synthesis===

There are currently two commonly used methods of total synthesis of β-carotene. The first was developed by the Badische Anilin- & Soda-Fabrik (BASF) and is based on the Wittig reaction with Wittig himself as patent holder:Wittig G.; Pommer H.: DBP 954247, '1956'''[tpl]cite journal | author = Wittig G., Pommer H. | year = 1959 | title = | url = | journal = Chem. Abstr | volume = 53 | issue = | page = 2279 [/tpl]
The second is a Grignard reaction,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] elaborated by Hoffman-La Roche from the original synthesis of Inhoffen et al.  They are both symmetrical; the BASF synthesis is C20 + C20, and the Hoffman-La Roche synthesis is C19 + C2 + C19.

==Nomenclature==

Carotenes are carotenoids containing no oxygen. Carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as xanthophylls.
The two ends of the β-carotene molecule are structurally identical, and are called β-rings. Specifically, the group of nine carbon atoms at each end form a β-ring.
The α-carotene molecule has a β-ring at one end; the other end is called an ε-ring. There is no such thing as an "α-ring".
These and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme, according to which:
ζ-Carotene is the biosynthetic precursor of neurosporene, which is the precursor of lycopene, which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε.

==Food additive==

Carotene is also used as a substance to colour products such as juice, cakes, desserts, butter and margarine. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU (listed as additive E160a)UK Food Standards Agency: [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl] Australia and New Zealand (listed as 160a)Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl] and the USA.US FDA: [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part I |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl]
