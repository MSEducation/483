[[MRC (file format)]]

CATEGORIES: Computational chemistry, Chemical file formats

MRC is a file format for electron density that has become industry standard in Cryo-electron microscopy, where the result of the technique is a three-dimensional grid of voxels each with a value corresponding to density of electrons (see wave function). It was developed by the MRC (Medical Research Council) Laboratory of Molecular Biology.[ref]

The MRC format is supported by almost every molecular graphics suite that supports volumetric data. The major packages include:
