In ancient Levantine mythology, Azizos or Aziz is the Palmyran god of the morning star. He is usually portrayed as riding a camel with his twin brother Arsu. He was venerated separately in Syria as god of the morning star, in company with the astral god Monimos.
Azizos was identified as Ares by Julian in his work 'Hymn to King Helios'.  He says "Now I am aware that Ares, who is called Azizos by the Syrians who inhabit Emesa.."
