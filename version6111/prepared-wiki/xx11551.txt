</ref> TV Watch also participated in a [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] forum in June 2007, based on recent Kaiser research, which claims that most parents do monitor their children's television viewing, whether or not by means of the V-chip.<ref>

===Expenses===

As stated in an article in the Washington Times from March 1998, the V-chip was envisioned to be inexpensive. The cost to install the V-chip into televisions that are not already equipped with it is between $5â€“10. In addition, every television set with screens of 13 in. or larger sold after the year 2000 is required to have a V-chip pre-installed. Therefore, some say the cost is insignificant when purchasing a television.[ref]

===Ease of monitoring for parents===

The TV ratings system is designed to aid parents in deciding what programming they deem appropriate for their children to watch. One such site that explains the ratings system is TheTVBoss.org, which was created by the United States Ad Council. The website explains the various options for controlling children's viewing patterns. It also contains instructions for activating the chip.

===Support from PTA groups===

Many parents' groups are in favor of monitoring children's viewing habits, mostly for the purpose of building family values. "America's families will be now the ultimate judges of new ratings system's effectiveness,"http://www.educationpolicy.org/briefs/refrmnws-Jul97B.htm
said Lois Joan White, Parent-Teacher Association president, in 1997 in support of V-chip technology.  The V-chip is also supported by other websites like  FamilySafeMedia.com, http://www.familysafemedia.com/v-chip.html which presents technologies like the Weemote and TVGuardian as alternatives to the V-chip. http://www.familysafemedia.com/about_us.html

==The V-chip and commercials==

The V-chip has provided parents and guardians the ability to monitor and block television shows that are unfavorable for children to watch in specific households by reading the information that is encoded in the rated program and blocking it based upon that rating it has been given.FCC.gov However, due to the increasing variety of technology that is being developed and used in the household, parents are concerned that their children will be exposed to the same content they are trying to block through unrated commercials.FCC.gov Because commercials are not rated, the V-chip does not have the ability to censor lewd or inappropriate commercials.Fjallfoss.fcc.gov This raises issues because children can see the same content that they are blocked on regular shows while watching commercials.  This causes the V-Chip to be ineffective unless it applies to both television programs as well as commercials.
The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) disagrees with creating a V-chip for commercials because it would block commercials and therefore be "economically ruinous for content providers, especially broadcasters."Broadcastingcable.com Blocking certain commercials from being viewed will be detrimental financially to broadcasters as well as ad companies.
The ANA also believes that rating thousands of commercials due to a select amount being inappropriate would be a waste of time.  This would be seen as a clear example of "regulatory overkill."  The ad industry also already has guidelines in which commercials with sensitive matter have to follow and abide by. It also self-regulates which programs certain types of ads can be placed in. As far as it is concerned, these programs are very effective and do not need any modification or alteration.
Because rating commercials globally would be a difficult task, a possible suggestion would be to limit inappropriate commercials and promotions shown at certain times that children watch television. In order to give children some protection from seeing inappropriate commercials, certain improvements to the V-Chip should made that can follow the same standard across all areas of media that include "broadcast, cable, satellite, DVRs and, to the extent possible, the Internet."
