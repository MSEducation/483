Fear of the Dark is the ninth studio album released by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Released on 11 May 1992, it was their third studio release to top the UK albums chart and last to feature Bruce Dickinson as lead vocalist until his return in 1999.
It was the first album to be produced by Steve Harris, and last to feature Martin Birch (who retired after its release).

==History==

The Fear of the Dark album cover was the band's first not to be designed by artist Derek Riggs, whose contributions were rejected in favour of Melvyn Grant's. According to Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, the band began accepting contributions from other artists as "We wanted to upgrade Eddie for the 90s. We wanted to take him from the sort of comic-book horror creature and turn him into something a bit more straightforward so that he became even more threatening." Melvyn Grant has since drawn several more covers for Iron Maiden, making him the band's second most-frequent artist after Riggs.
After recording its predecessor (1990's No Prayer for the Dying) in a barn on Steve Harris' property with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, leading to negative results, for this album Harris had the building converted into a proper studio (christened "Barnyard").[tpl]cite book |author=Wall, Mick |authorlink=Mick Wall |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=316[/tpl] Bruce Dickinson describes the results as "a slight improvement because Martin Birch came in and supervised the sound. But there were big limitations on that studio – simply because of its physical size, things like that. It actually ended up not too bad, but, you know, a little bit under par."[tpl]cite journal |title=The Wicked Man |last=Berelian |first=Essi |journal=Classic Rock |date=June 2000 |issue=15 |pages=36–43[/tpl]
The album's musical style showed some experimentation with "Be Quick or Be Dead", a fast tempo song released as the album's first single, and "Wasting Love", the group's sole power ballad, which dates back to Dickinson's first solo album, Tattooed Millionaire.[tpl]cite book |author=Wall, Mick |authorlink=Mick Wall |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=290[/tpl] Both songs were Dickinson/Gers collaborations, which contrast with Harris' "Afraid to Shoot Strangers," a political song from the point of view of a soldier in the Gulf War,[tpl]cite book |author=Wall, Mick |authorlink=Mick Wall |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=289[/tpl] Dickinson would often introduce the song as an anti-war narrative.[tpl]cite journal |title=No Sleep |journal=Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem |year=2005 |first=Darren |last=James |pages=92–93 |id=[/tpl] "Fear Is the key" is about the fear in sexual relationships because of AIDS. The song was written around the time when the band learned about the death of Queen singer Freddie Mercury. Dickinson affirmed: «There's a line in 'Fear Is the Key' that goes: "nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies". And that's quite sadly true. ... As long as the virus was confined to homosexuals or drug-addicts, nobody gave a shit. It's only when celebrities started to die that the masses began to feel concerned».[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Bruce Dickinson|author=|publisher=ironmaiden-bg.com|date=June  1992|url=http://ironmaiden-bg.com/en/interviews-from-1992-1993/interview-with-bruce-dickinson-june-1992.php|accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl] "Weekend Warrior" is about football and the violence that plagues it.
Only two of the album's songs, the title track and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers", would survive on tours past 1993. "Fear of the Dark" has been on the set list of every subsequent tour except 2005, in which the band only played songs from their first 4 albums,[tpl]cite web |title=Eddie Rips Up The World Tour Begins in Prague; Setlist Revealed |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/28302 |work=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |accessdate=29 November 2012 |date=29 May 2005[/tpl] and was the only song played on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and the Maiden England World Tour (other than "Afraid to Shoot Strangers") which was not from the 1980s. "Afraid to Shoot Strangers" became a frequent addition on setlists during Blaze Bayley's tenure with Iron Maiden, following which it returned in 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/first-iron-maiden-maiden-england-us-tour-setlist-revealed-rest-of-world-weeps-with-jealousy/ |title=First Iron Maiden 'Maiden England' US Tour Setlist Revealed, Rest of World Weeps With Jealousy |last=Alderslade |first=Merlin |accessdate=22 June 2012 |date=22 June 2012 |publisher=Metal Hammer |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B19NVweK |archivedate=28 September 2012[/tpl]
"Be Quick or Be Dead", "From Here to Eternity", "Wasting Love" and a live version of the title track were released as singles.
Fear of the Dark Tour was the tour supporting the album.

==Reception==

Reviews for the album were mixed, with AllMusic commenting that, while "easily an improvement over 1990's lackluster No Prayer for the Dying (both musically and sonically)," the release "still wasn't quite on par with their exceptional work from the '80s." Sputnikmusic were more positive about the release, stating that "though many of the songs are still sub-par by their standards... the band returns to the lofty heights that they enjoyed for the entirety of the 80's." Billboard had a positive reception upon release, saying Dickinson's voice "shows no sign of wear and tear" and the guitar work "sounds fresh and crisp".
In October 2011, Fear of the Dark was ranked No. 8 on Guitar World magazine's top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/photo-gallery-top-10-guitar-albums-1992 |title=Photo Gallery: The Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1992 |last=Grassi |first=Tony |publisher=Guitar World |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl]
Fear of the Dark became the third Iron Maiden album to top the UK Albums Chart. It is the band's most successful record in North America after the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1991, with 438,000 copies sold as of 2008.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8hIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51 |title=Iron Men |journal=Billboard |date=15 May 2008 |volume=120 |issue=20 |page=51 |accessdate=1 January 2010[/tpl]
