[[Lulu (Trip Shakespeare album)]]

CATEGORIES: Trip Shakespeare albums, 1991 albums, A&M Records albums

Lulu is a 1991 album by the Minneapolis-based rock band Trip Shakespeare, the group's final major-label release.
A polished, melodic album released at the height of the grunge phenomenon, Lulu was met with critical and popular indifference. Describing it as a "melodically complex and romantic pop masterpiece", Allmusic declares:
The album's title track, about an old crush with whom the singer used to see a band, has the refrain, "Do you remember? Do you recall?" Those words are printed in large type on the album's liner notes, with the last phrase altered to "dü you recall"--an allusion to another Minneapolis-based band, Hüsker Dü, whose name is Danish for "do you remember".
