CATEGORIES: 2005 singles

"Interstate 5" is a song by The Wedding Present. It was released as the first single from the album Take Fountain. The single was released on November 15, 2004 on CD. Two versions of the song were initially released: the "original version" (the single version), which runs 6:07 in time, and the "extended version" (the album version), which runs 8:17 in time. The single version omits the mariachi outro found on the album version. A music video was produced for the song, featuring David Gedge singing and standing in the middle of a road while a woman (played by actress Catherine Bennett) runs through cities and scenes for the entire duration of the song. As she is running towards Gedge, he turns around to grab her and stop her from running. The video can be found on the bonus DVD from the compilation album Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5, released in 2006.
The song is named for and mentions the West Coast highway, Interstate 5.
In 2009, the song was used on a post-bankruptcy General Motors TV commercial.[tpl]cite web |last=Luscombe |first=Belinda |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1903780,00.html |title=GM's New Ad Campaign: Will It Restart the Engines? |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2009-07-05[/tpl]
