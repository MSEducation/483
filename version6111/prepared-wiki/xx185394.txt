Pretty Balanced were an American band based in Columbus, Ohio. Its unique sound is the result of a fusion of instruments often associated with chamber music, such as violin, cello, and piano, playing rock compositions, and often employing electronic production. Its members are Judith Shimer (also of The Sneaky Mister) on piano and cello, Forest Christenson (of Solarist, formerly The Liberty Tax, and Starving Goliath) on drums and violin, and Parker Ross (of El Jewbacabra) on bass.Judith Shimer, "HISTORY OF THE BAND", Pretty Balanced, 2007.

==History==

The band formed in 2004, while the members were attending Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center. The original lineup included John Siddall on bass, but he was replaced by Ross after leaving Columbus for college.
In 2005, the Pretty Balanced song "Simon's Sleeping" was featured on Projekt Records' compilation A Dark Cabaret, which sold nationally in Hot Topic stores.
In 2006, the band won second place in the Columbus Dispatch Battle of the Bands 3, winning $300 and five hours of recording time at John Schwab Recording.The Columbus Dispatch, "NATURAL HIGH FROM FORT HAYES WINS BATTLE OF THE BANDS", The Columbus Dispatch, 2006-02-16. URL accessed 3-January-2008.
After the members graduated from high school in 2006, the band went on a partial-hiatus, but still played shows throughout the Eastern and Midwest United States, and performed in the UK in 2008 and 2009.
In early 2009 they changed their name to "The Alphabet", and in 2010 Judith announced the band's breakup on her blog.http://thesneakymister.blogspot.com/2010/02/big-changes.html
