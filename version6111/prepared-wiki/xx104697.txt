[[SMCCDI (Information Service)]]

CATEGORIES: Organisations based in Iran

SMCCDI (Information Service) is the public-relations & information branch of the Student Movement Coordination Committee for Democracy in Iran (SMCCDI).  News is available in both English and Persian.  The news is distributed via the Internet and often contains information on Iranian politics and student movements not available anywhere else; however, the site displays a clear anti-regime bias in its reporting, occasionally editorializing in analysis sections of its articles.
Despite baseless rumors, SMCCDI does not receive money from the US National Endowment for Democracy. All the support, financial or non-financial, comes from the members of the Iranian Diaspora.  By using this support, SMCCDI broadcasts its satellite programs to Europe, USA, and Iran.
