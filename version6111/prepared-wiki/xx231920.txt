==History==

A construction permit by Florida City Radio was granted on February 18, 2008, to start this station, however it never signed on. The current callsign was issued on July 15, 2008, and it still didn't air until Salem went on an LMA with FCR. WZAB and its current format made its debut on October 7, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/salems-latest-startup-a-biz-talker-in-miami |title=Salem's latest startup â€“ a biz-talker in Miami |date=October 6, 2008 |work=Radio-Info.com[/tpl]
