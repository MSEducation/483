Dwayne Samuel Hosey (born March 11, 1967 in Sharon, Pennsylvania) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder for the Boston Red Sox. He threw right-handed, and was a switch hitter.
Hosey was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in [tpl]By|1987[/tpl], and spent most of his career in the minor league organizations of the Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, and Boston Red Sox.  In 1994 he had his best minor league season, winning the American Association MVP.  In 112 games hit .333 and slugging .628 with 27 home runs, 80 RBI, 27 stolen bases, and 95 runs scored.

He was signed by the Yakult Swallows in [tpl]By|1997[/tpl], and was immediately heralded as one of the worst players ever to come to Japan by Swallows manager Katsuya Nomura. However, Hosey worked hard to get used to Japanese pitching, and his work paid off in his first season, where he beat out Hideki Matsui to lead the Central League with 38 home runs. Opposing pitchers seemed to have figured him out in [tpl]By|1998[/tpl], and he ended the season with only 18 home runs. He was released during the 1998 off-season.
Currently, Dwayne Hosey works as a hitting instructor in Omaha Nebraska.  Most recently, he has been working as an instructor at Ultimate Baseball Academy. Mr. Hosey became well familiar with Omaha as a member of the Omaha Royals.
