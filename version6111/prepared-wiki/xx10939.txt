===Ancient===

According to the Mahāvamsa, a chronicle written in the Pāli language, the ancient period of Sri Lanka begins in 543 BC with the landing of Vijaya, a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers on eight ships 860 nautical miles to Sri Lanka from the southwest coast of what is now the Rarh region of West Bengal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mahavamsa.org/ |title=The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka |work=The Mahavamsa[/tpl] He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, near modern day Mannar. Vijaya is the first of the approximately 189 native monarchs of Sri Lanka described in chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Mahāvamsa, Chulavamsa, and Rājāvaliya (see List of Sri Lankan monarchs). Sri Lankan dynastic history spanned a period of 2,359 years from 543 BC to AD 1815, when the land became part of the British Empire.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/gen3000.html | title = Vijaya and the Lankan Monarchs – Family #3000 | work = Ancestry.com[/tpl]

Sri Lanka first experienced a foreign invasion during the reign of Suratissa, who was defeated by two horse traders named Sena and Guttika from South India. The next invasion came immediately in 205 BC by a Chola king named Elara, who overthrew Asela and ruled the country for 44 years. Dutugemunu, the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king, Kavan Tissa, defeated Elara in the Battle of Vijithapura. He built Ruwanwelisaya, the second stupa in ancient Sri Lanka, and the Lovamahapaya.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.beyondthenet.net/Saddha/ruvan.pdf| page = 4 | title = Ruvanveli Seya – The Wonderous Stupa Built by Gods and Men | work = beyondthenet.net[/tpl] During its two and a half millennia of existence, the Kingdom of Sri Lanka was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Asian dynasties such as the Chola, Pandya, Chera, and Pallava.

===Medieval===

The medieval period of Sri Lanka begins with the fall of Anuradhapura Kingdom. In
AD 993, the invasion of Chola emperor Rajaraja I forced the then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V to flee to the southern part of the country.Siriweera (2004), p. 44 Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I, son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in AD 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura. Subsequently, they moved the capital to Polonnaruwa.Siriweera (2004), p. 45 This marked the end of the two great houses of dynasties of ancient Sri Lanka, the Moriya and the Lambakanna. Following a seventeen-year long campaign, Vijayabahu I successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century.[tpl]cite book | author = Codrington, H.W. | title = A Short History of Ceylon | publisher = Macmillan & Co. | year = 1926 | place = London | url = http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap04.html | isbn = 978-0-8369-5596-5 | oclc = 2154168[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.localhistories.org/srilanka.html | title = A Brief History of Sri Lanka | author = Lambert, Tim | work = localhistories.org[/tpl] Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from Burma to Sri Lanka to re-establish Buddhism, which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign.[tpl]cite book | title = Relations between Ceylon and Burma in the 11th Century AD | author = Bokay, Mon | year = 1966 | work = Artibus Asiae Publishers | page = 93 | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/1522637[/tpl] During the medieval period, Sri Lanka was divided to three sub-territories, namely Ruhunu, Pihiti and Maya.[tpl]cite web | url = http://lakdiva.org/coins/medievallanka/1153_1186_parakramabahu~i_Em.html | title = Ancient Irrigation Works | work = lakdiva.org [/tpl]

During the reign of the Rajasinghe II, Dutch explorers arrived on the island.

In spite of on-going intermittent warfare with Europeans, the kingdom survived. Later, a crisis of succession emerged in Kandy upon king Vira Narendrasinha's death in 1739. He was married to a Telugu-speaking Nayakkar princess from South India and was childless by her. Eventually, with the support of bhikku Weliwita Sarankara, the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha's princesses, overlooking the right of "Unambuwe Bandara", Narendrasinha's own son by a Sinhalese concubine.[tpl]cite book | title = Language, Religion, and Ethnic Assertiveness: The Growth of Sinhalese Nationalism in Sri Lanka0 | author = Dharmadasa, K.

By then, the entire coastal area was under the British East India Company as a result of the Treaty of Amiens. But on 14 February 1815, Kandy was occupied by the British in the second Kandyan War, finally ending Sri Lanka's independence. Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last native monarch of Sri Lanka, was exiled to India.Codrington, A Short History, Ch. 11 The Kandyan Convention formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire.

The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms of 1833.[tpl]Harvnb|Corea|Kelegama|2004|pp=405–406[/tpl] They introduced a utilitarian and liberal political culture to the country based on the rule of law and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government. An Executive Council and a Legislative Council were established, later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature. By this time, experiments with coffee plantation were largely successful. Soon coffee became the primary commodity export of the country. Falling coffee prices as a result of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent.[tpl]Harvnb|Nubin|2002|p=115[/tpl] These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/gongalegoda.htm | title = Gongale Goda Banda (1809–1849) : The leader of the 1848 rebellion | work = Wimalaratne, K.

Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.
By the end of the 19th century, a new educated social class transcending race and caste arose through British attempts to staff the Ceylon Civil Service and the legal, educational, and medical professions.[tpl]Harvnb|Nubin|2002|pp=116–117[/tpl] New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the Ceylon Legislative Council on a communal basis.

But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for "communal representation" by creating a "Colombo seat" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s.[tpl]Harvnb|De Silva|1981|pp=389–395[/tpl] The Donoughmore reforms of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced universal adult franchise (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created State Council of Ceylon, which succeeded the legislative council.[tpl]cite web | url = http://tamilelibrary.org/teli/slhist.html | title = Chronology of events related to Tamils in Sri Lanka (1500–1948) | publisher = National University of Malaysia | work = Hellmann-Rajanayagam, Dagmar[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|De Silva|1981|p=423[/tpl] In 1937, Tamil leader G.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the widow of late S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an attempted coup d'état in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic polices, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection, which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s.[tpl]Harvnb|Nubin|2002|pp=128–129[/tpl] The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ices.lk/publications/esr/articles_jul97/Esr-kmdesilva.PDF| pages = 248–254 | title = Affirmative Action Policies: The Sri Lankan Experience | author = De Silva, K.

Flowering acacias flourish on the arid Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes.[tpl]cite web | url = http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/for_cou_144.PDF | title = Forests, Grasslands, and Drylands-- Sri Lanka| page = 4 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Yala National Park in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks. The Wilpattu National Park in the northwest, the largest national park, preserves the habitats of many water birds such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. The island has four biosphere reserves: Bundala, Hurulu Forest Reserve, the Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya, and Sinharaja.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/contact.asp?code=SRL | title = Sri Lanka | date = 1 September 2006 | publisher = UNESCO [/tpl] Of these, Sinharaja forest reserve is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species, including the elusive Red-faced Malkoha, the Green-billed Coucal and the Sri Lanka Blue Magpie.
The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Of the 211 woody trees and lianas within the reserve, 139 (66%) are endemic. The total vegetation density, including trees, shrubs, herbs and seedlings, has been estimated at 240,000 individuals per hectare. The Minneriya National Park borders the Minneriya tank, which is an important source of water for numerous elephants (Elephus maximus) inhabiting the surrounding forests. Dubbed "The Gathering", the congregation of elephants can be seen on the tank-bed in the late dry season (August to October) as the surrounding water sources steadily disappear. The park also encompasses a range of micro-habitats which include classic dry zone tropical monsoonal evergreen forest, thick stands of giant bamboo, hilly pastures (patanas). and grasslands (talawas).[tpl]cite web | url = http://trabanatours.com/locations/minneriya/ | title = Minneriya National Park | publisher = www.trabanatours.com [/tpl]

The first election under the universal adult franchise, held in June 1931, was for the Ceylon State Council. [tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Sir D. B.

During this time, struggle for independence was fought on "constitutionalist" lines under the leadership of D. S. Senanayake. The draft constitution was enacted in the same year, and Senanayake was appointed Prime Minister following the parliamentary election in 1947. The Soulbury constitution ushered in Dominion status and granted independence to Sri Lanka in 1948.
Current politics in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the centre-leftist and progressivist United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an offspring of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the comparatively right-wing and pro-capitalist United National Party (UNP).[tpl]Harvnb|Nubin|2002|p=95[/tpl] Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist, socialist and Tamil nationalist political parties.

===Government===

Sri Lanka is a democratic republic and a unitary state which is governed by a semi-presidential system, with a mixture of a presidential system and a parliamentary system.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_01_Amd.html | title = Chapter 1 – The People, The State and Sovereignty | work = The Official Website of the Government of Sri Lanka [/tpl] It constitutes a parliamentary system governed under the constitution. Most provisions of the constitution can be amended by a two-thirds majority in parliament. However, the amendment of certain basic features such as the clauses on language, religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state require both a two-thirds majority and approval in a nation-wide referendum.
In common with many democracies, the Sri Lankan government has three branches:

===Administrative divisions===

For administrative purposes, Sri Lanka is divided into nine provinces and twenty-five districts.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Schedle_1_Amd.html | title = The Constitution of Sri Lanka – First Schedule | publisher = Priu.gov.lk [/tpl]
Provinces
There have been provinces ([tpl]lang-si|පළාත[/tpl][tpl]lang-ta|மாகாணம்[/tpl]) in Sri Lanka since the 19th century, but they had no legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 1978 constitution established provincial councils after several decades of increasing demand for a decentralisation of the Government of Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.priu.gov.lk/ProvCouncils/ProvicialCouncils.html | title = Provincial Councils | work = The Official Website of the Government of Sri Lanka | date = 3 September 2010 [/tpl] Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any Ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities, but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/lanka-heads-for-collision-course-with-india/802524/ | title = Lanka heads for collision course with India: Report | publisher = Indian Express | date = 12 June 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.peace-srilanka.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=296:accepting-reality-and-building-trust&catid=1:latest&Itemid=121 | title = Accepting reality and building trust | work = Jehan Perera | publisher = peace-srilanka.org | date = 14 September 2010 [/tpl] Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the North-East Province.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2006/10/8947.html | title = North-East merger illegal: SC | publisher = LankaNewspapers.com | date = 17 October 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cnotes4%5Cnote344.html | title = North East De-merger-At What Cost?

Now each province is administered by a directly elected provincial council:
Districts and local authorities
Sri Lanka is also divided into 25 districts ([tpl]lang-si|දිස්ත්‍රි‌ක්‌ක sing. දිස්ත්‍රික්කය[/tpl][tpl]lang-ta|மாவட்டம்[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ds.gov.lk/dis_sec/dis_eng/District_Secretariats.php | title = District Secretariats Portal | publisher = District an Divisional Secretariats [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Each district is administered under a District Secretariat.

Originally, a Disa (usually rendered into English as Dissavony) was a duchy, notably Matale and Uva. A government agent, who is known as District Secretary, administers a district.
There are three other types of local authorities: Municipal Councils (18), Urban councils (13) and Pradeshiya Sabha, also called Pradesha Sabhai (256).[tpl]Cite book | author = Commonwealth Secretariat | year = 2004 | title = Commonwealth Local Government Handbook | place = London | isbn = 978-0-9542917-9-2 | page = 146[/tpl] Local authorities were originally based on feudal counties named korale and rata, and were formerly known as 'D.R.O. divisions' after the 'Divisional Revenue Officer'.[tpl]Cite book | author = Dilesh Jayanntha | year = 2006 | title = Electoral Allegiance in Sri Lanka | place = London | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-02975-9 | pages = 82–85[/tpl] Later the D.R.O.s became 'Assistant Government Agents' and the divisions were known as 'A.G.A. divisions'. These Divisional Secretariats are currently administered by a 'Divisional Secretary'.

==Foreign relations and the military==

Sri Lanka is a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). While ensuring that it maintains its independence, Sri Lanka has cultivated relations with India.[tpl]Cite news | title = Foreign Relations | url = http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/74.htm | work = Library of Congress Country Studies[/tpl] Sri Lanka became a member of the United Nations in 1955.

One of the two parties that have governed Sri Lanka since its independence, the United National Party, has traditionally favoured links with the West while its left-leaning counterpart, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has favoured links with the East.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a plantation economy, famous for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber and Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.historyofceylontea.com/articles/tea_feat_echoes_plantation_economy.html | title = Echoes of a Plantation Economy | publisher = historyofceylontea.com [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.asiapacificdefencereporter.com/articles/53/The-Strategic-Importance-of-Sri-Lanka-to-Australia | title = The Strategic Importance of Sri Lanka to Australia | publisher = asiapacificdefencereporter.com [/tpl] From 1948 to 1977 socialism strongly influenced the government's economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised and a welfare state established.

In more recent times, the British colonial culture has also influenced the locals. Sri Lanka claims a democratic tradition matched by few other developing countries.
The first Tamil immigration was probably around the 3rd century BC. Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early mixing rendered the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinct.[tpl]Harvnb|Nubin|2002|p=97[/tpl] Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius in hydraulic engineering and architecture. The rich cultural traditions shared by all Sri Lankan cultures is the basis of the country's long life expectancy, advanced health standards and high literacy rate.

===Food and festivals===

Dishes include rice and curry, pittu, Kiribath, wholemeal Roti, String hoppers, wattalapam (a rich pudding of Malay origin made of coconut milk, jaggery, cashew nuts, eggs, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg), kottu, and hoppers.[tpl]Cite book | author = Jayakody, Padmini | title = Simply Sri Lankan | publisher = Lulu.com | page = 3 | place = Australia | isbn = 978-1-4092-1942-2[/tpl] Jackfruit may sometimes replace rice and curries.

Ranmuthu Duwa (Island of treasures, 1962) marked the transition cinema from black-and-white to colour. It in the recent years has featured subjects such as family melodrama, social transformation and the years of conflict between the military and the LTTE.[tpl]Cite book | author = Dissanayake, Wimal | year = 2006 | title = Contemporary Asian cinema: popular culture in a global frame, Chapter 8 | publisher = Berg | pages = 108–119 | isbn = 978-1-84520-237-8[/tpl] Their cinematic style is similar to the Bollywood movies.

There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the Kandyan dances, low country dances and Sabaragamuwa dances. Of these, the Kandyan style, which flourished under kings of the Kingdom of Kandy, is more prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance,[tpl]cite web | title = Kandyan dance | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/310955/Kandyan-dance [/tpl] that consists of five sub-categories: Ves dance, Naiyandi dance, Udekki dance, Pantheru dance and 18 Vannam.[tpl]Cite book | author = Cummings, Joe | year = 2006 | title = Sri Lanka | publisher = Lonely Planet | pages = 50–52 | isbn = 978-1-74059-975-7[/tpl] An elaborate headdress is worn by the male dancers and a drum called Geta Béraya is used to assist the dancer to keep on rhythm.[tpl]cite web | title = Dance of Sri Lanka | publisher = lanka.com | url = http://www.lanka.com/sri-lanka/dance-and-drama-of-sri-lanka-104.html [/tpl] In addition, four folk drama variants named Sokri, Kolam, Nadagam, Pasu, and several devil dance variants such as Sanni Yakuma and Kohomba Kankariya can be also observed.

Sri Lankan literature spans at least two millennia, and is heir to the Aryan literary tradition as embodied in the hymns of the Rigveda. The Pāli Canon, the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, was written down in Sri Lanka during the Fourth Buddhist council, at the Alulena cave temple, Kegalle, as early as 29 BC.[tpl]cite web | title = Challenge to Buddha Jayanthi Stamp Selection Board | work = The Island | url = http://www.island.lk/2006/05/31/opinion6.html [/tpl] Ancient chronicles such as the Mahāvamsa, written in the 6th century, provide vivid descriptions of Sri Lankan dynasties. According to the German philosopher Wilhelm Geiger, the chronicles are based on Sinhala Atthakatha (commentary), that dates few more centuries back.

Kannangara led the establishment of the Madhya Maha Vidyalayas (Central Schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka's rural children. In 1942 a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality education system for the people. However, in the 1980s changes to this system saw the separation the of administration of schools between the central government and the provincial government. Thus the elite National Schools are controlled directly by the Ministry of Education and the provincial schools by the provincial government. Sri Lanka has approximately 9675 government schools, 817 private schools and Pirivenas. The number of public universities in Sri Lanka is 15.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ugc.ac.lk/downloads/statistics/stat_2010/Chapter1.pdf| page = 3 | title = Sri Lanka University Statistics 2010 | publisher = University Grants Commission [/tpl] However, lack of responsiveness of the education system to labour market requirements, disparities in access to quality education, lack of an effective linkage between secondary and tertiary education remain major challenges for the education sector.[tpl]cite web | url = http://portal.unesco.org/geography/fr/files/10905/12353682765Sri_Lanka.pdf/Sri%2BLanka.pdf| pages = 3–4 | title = Facing Global and Local Challenges: The New Dynamics for Higher Education – Sri Lanka Country Report | publisher = UNESCO [/tpl] A number of private, degree awarding institutions have emerged in recent times to fill in these gaps.
