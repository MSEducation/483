CATEGORIES: Forced migration, Sociology journals, Political magazines

Forced Migration Review (FMR) is acknowledged by the humanitarian community as the world's most widely read publication on refugee, internal displacement and statelessness issues.
It is published by the University of Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre in English, Arabic, Spanish and French. It is also distributed without charge. It started in 1987 as the Refugee Participation Network newsletter (RPN) and was re-launched as FMR in April 1998. It appears approximately three times a year, with occasional Supplements and Special issues. Most issues have a main theme and also carry some 'general articles' on other aspects of forced migration.
FMR provides a practice-oriented forum for debate on issues facing refugees and internally displaced persons in order to improve policy and practice and to involve refugees and IDPs in programme design and implementation.
