Azhdarchoidea is a group of pterosaurs within the suborder Pterodactyloidea.

==Classification==

There are currently two primary but competing views of azhdarchoid relationships. The first, presented by Felipe Pinheiro and colleagues in 2011, considers the tapejarids to be a monophyletic clade including the thalassodromines and chaoyangopterines.Pinheiro, F.L., Fortier, D.C., Schultz, C.L., De Andrade, J.A.F.G. and Bantim, R.A.M. (in press). "New information on Tupandactylus imperator, with comments on the relationships of Tapejaridae (Pterosauria)." Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, in press, available online 03 Jan 2011. [tpl]doi|10.4202/app.2010.0057[/tpl] The second, found by Lu et al. 2008 as well as Naish & Martill 2006, considers the tapejarids to be a paraphyletic grade of primitive azhdarchoids. All azhdarchoids closer to Azhdarcho than to Tapejara are included in the clade Neoazhdarchia ("new azhdarchids").LÃ¼, J., Unwin, D.M., Xu, L., and Zhang, X. (2008).
