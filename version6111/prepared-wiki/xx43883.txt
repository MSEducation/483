Mohair [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|ɛər[/tpl] is usually a silk-like fabric or yarn made from the hair of the Angora goat."Mohaire". The Oxford English Dictionary.
Both durable and resilient, mohair is notable for its high luster and sheen, which has helped give it the nickname the "Diamond Fiber", and is often used in fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair takes dye exceptionally well. Mohair is warm in winter as it has great insulating properties, while remaining cool in summer due to its moisture wicking properties. It is durable, naturally elastic, flame resistant, crease resistant, and does not felt. It is considered to be a luxury fiber, like cashmere, angora and silk, and is usually more expensive than most wool that comes from sheep.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Mohair is composed mostly of keratin, a protein found in the hair, wool, horns and skin of all mammals. While it has scales like wool, the scales are not fully developed, merely indicated. Thus, mohair does not felt as wool does.
Mohair fiber is approximately 25–45 microns in diameter.[ref]
