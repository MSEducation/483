Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo that was formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1994. Composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Jack Black and lead guitarist and vocalist Kyle Gass, the band has released three albums – Tenacious D (2001), The Pick of Destiny (2006) and Rize of the Fenix (2012). Tenacious D's studio releases, and (as of 2006) its live performances, feature a full band lineup, including such musicians as guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker. Drummer Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) played on every studio release, with Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman replacing Grohl on tour.
The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in their eponymous television series and began to support large rock acts. In 2001, they released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band. The first single, "Tribute", was the band's most successful achieving their only Top 10 in any chart, until they released "The Metal", which was first shown at Saturday Night Live. In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full band. They released their newest album Rize of the Fenix on May 15, 2012.
Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock".[tpl]cite news |first=Heather |last=Phares |title=AMG Biography |date= |publisher= |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p397913|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |work=Allmusic |pages= |accessdate=March 25, 2008 |language= [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Cathrin |last=Schaer |title=Tenacious D: Mock’n’rollers |work=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=9002730 |date=December 12, 2004 |accessdate=January 11, 2007[/tpl] Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.[tpl]cite news |first=Ted |last=Fry |title=Sympathy for the devil: Rockers seek Satan's pick |date=November 22, 2006 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2003441928_tenacious22.html |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |language= [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |title=Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006) |date=November 21, 2006 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562105,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=March 15, 2007[/tpl]

===Beginnings===

Jack Black and Kyle Gass met in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Edinburgh Fringe of 1989.

Initially when Black and Gass performed live they covered songs by Bobby McFerrin.[tpl]cite news |first=Lee |last=Grant |title=Longtime pals Jack Black and Kyle Gass make their 'Tenacious D' movie |date=November 20, 2006 |publisher= |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20061120-9999-mz1c20pick.html |work=The San Diego Union-Tribune |pages= |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |language= [/tpl] Up until 1994 the duo did not have a name, so they gave the audience at their first concert, at the now defunct Al's Bar, the chance to vote for one. Black and Gass gave them the choice between "Pets or Meat", "Balboa's Biblical Theatre" and "The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon's Mischief" (Gass' personal favorite). "Tenacious D"—a basketball term used by commentators to describe robust defensive positioning in basketball —did not get the majority of votes, however, but according to Black "we forced it through". In attendance was David Cross who later cast Jack Black in his sketch comedy television series, Mr. Show.[tpl]cite news |first=Steve |last=Palopoli |title=Cult Leader |work=Metro Silicon Valley |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/11.08.06/cult-0645.html |date=November 8, 2006 |accessdate=January 12, 2007[/tpl] At this point the two only had five of their own songs: "Tribute", "Kyle Quit", "Krishna", "History", and "Melissa". Black and Gass also recorded a demo tape out of four of these songs called Tenacious Demo in the early-to-mid 1990s and distributed it to various record companies until HBO offered them a TV show.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Tenacious-D-Demo-/release/2862109 |title=Discogs, Tenacious Demo, 1997 |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl]

The popularity of Tenacious D further increased as they began to open for high profile acts, including Beck, Pearl Jam and Foo Fighters.

===First album Tenacious D (2001–03)===

In May 2000, Tenacious D signed to Epic Records. As Black's profile increased due to his roles in films such as High Fidelity the band worked on recording their first album with producers the Dust Brothers. In 2001, they released their debut Tenacious D. It peaked at #33 on the Billboard 200 on October 13, 2001.[tpl]Cite news| first=Chris | last=Harris | title=Game Clobbers Akon, Takes Albums Chart | date=November 22, 2005 | url =http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1546450/20061122/tenacious_d.jhtml | work =VH1 | accessdate = February 3, 2007 | language = [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=tenacious d|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Tenacious D|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=March 6, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929124956/[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=tenacious d|chart=all[/tpl] |archivedate = September 29, 2007[/tpl] While Tenacious D usually appears as a duo, the album was backed by a full band, consisting of Dave Grohl on drums and guitar, keyboardist Page McConnell of Phish, guitarist Warren Fitzgerald of The Vandals, and bassist Steven Shane McDonald of Redd Kross.

On March 26, 2012 a 6-minute film was uploaded to the Tenacious D Vevo on YouTube. The mockumentary, titled 'Tenacious D - To Be the Best', documents the uncertain future Tenacious D faced after the box-office failure of The Pick of Destiny, KG's subsequent breakdown and incarceration in "an institution", and Jack's embracing of an indulgent Hollywood lifestyle. The film shows a deranged Kyle escaping the facility and attempting to kill Jack and then himself, before they each realize their importance to each other and revive the band. They produce a new album in 75 minutes in the studio, described as "awful", but try again and emerge with another new album, described at the end of the film as "the greatest album recorded by anyone, ever". The film features numerous cameo appearances, including Maria Menounos, Val Kilmer, Dave Grohl, Yoshiki Hayashi, Josh Groban, Richard Ghagan, Michael White, Tim Robbins and Jimmy Kimmel.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nai7w1frB1E |title=Tenacious D - To Be The Best |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-04-26[/tpl]

===Live===

In 2001, Tenacious D started their second nationwide concert tour, performing at larger venues, many of which sold out. Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars, rarely with a full backing band. The band has also staged two international concert tours as well as numerous domestic tours,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tenaciousd.com/tour.html |title=Tour |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |publisher=Tenacious D's official website |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080327023838/http://www.tenaciousd.com/tour.html  |archivedate = March 27, 2008[/tpl] though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are "a little funky" because "the subtleties do get lost in translation". In addition, he comments on the angst they experience before concerts saying: "We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute." The band permits live recording during concerts if the venue allows recording.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/TenaciousD/tour.html |title=Tour |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |work=Official Tenacious D website |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080219045107/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/TenaciousD/tour.html |archivedate = February 19, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TenaciousD |title=Internet Archive: Tenacious D |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |publisher=Internet Archive |last=Fleischli |first=Michele |date=November 25, 2002[/tpl] Many of these recordings have been recorded and released through Live Music Archive and are available for free digital download.
