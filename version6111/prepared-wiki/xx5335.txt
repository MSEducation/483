Joan of Arc ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Jeanne d'Arc[/tpl],Her name was written in a variety of ways, particularly prior to the mid-19th century. See Pernoud and Clin, pp. 220–221. Her signature appears as "Jehanne" (see www.stjoan-center.com/Album/, parts 47 and 49; it is also noted in Pernoud and Clin). [tpl]IPA-fr|ʒan daʁk|IPA[/tpl]; ca. 1412Modern biographical summaries often assert a birthdate of January 6th for Joan, which is based on a letter from Lord Perceval de Boullainvilliers on 21 July 1429 (see Pernoud's Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses, p. 98: "Boulainvilliers tells of her birth in Domrémy, and it is he who gives us an exact date, which may be the true one, saying that she was born on the night of Epiphany, 6 January"). – 30 May 1431), nicknamed "The Maid of Orléans" ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|La Pucelle d'Orléans[/tpl]), is considered a heroine of France and a Roman Catholic saint. She was born to a peasant family at Domrémy in north-east France. Joan said she received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret and Saint Catherine instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent Joan to the siege of Orléans as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted in only nine days. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims. On 23 May 1430, she was captured at Compiègne by the English-allied Burgundian faction, was later handed over to the English,Le Procès de Jeanne d'Arc, in Série "Les grands procès de l'histoire", Ministère de la Justice (France), 06 July 2012: http://www.justice.gouv.fr/histoire-et-patrimoine-10050/proces-historiques-10411/le-proces-de-jeanne-darc-24376.html and then put on trial by the pro-English Bishop of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges,Régine Pernoud, "Joan of Arc By Herself And Her Witnesses", pp. 179, 220-222 was convicted on 30 May 1431Régine Pernoud, "Joan of Arc By Herself And Her Witnesses", p. 228 and burned at the stake when she was about 19 years old.
Twenty-five years after her execution, an inquisitorial court authorized by Pope Callixtus III examined the trial, pronounced her innocent, and declared her a martyr.Andrew Ward (2005) [tpl]IMDb title|id=0421212|title=Joan of Arc[/tpl] Joan of Arc was beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920. She is one of the nine secondary patron saints of France, along with St. Denis, St. Martin of Tours, St. Louis, St. Michael, St. Remi, St. Petronilla, St. Radegund and St. Thérèse of Lisieux.
Joan of Arc has been a popular figure in cultural history since the time of her death, and many famous writers, filmmakers and composers have created works about her. Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc have continued in films, theatre, television, video games, music, and performances to this day.

==Background==

The historian Kelly DeVries describes the period preceding her appearance in the following terms: "If anything could have discouraged her, the state of France in 1429 should have." The Hundred Years' War had begun in 1337 as a succession dispute over the French throne with intermittent periods of relative peace. Nearly all the fighting had taken place in France, and the English army's use of chevauchée tactics (similar to scorched earth strategies) had devastated the economy.John Aberth, From the Brink of the Apocalypse, Routledge, 2000 ISBN 0-415-92715-3, ISBN 978-0-415-92715-4 p. 85  The French population had not recovered from the Black Death of the previous century and its merchants were isolated from foreign markets. At the outset of Jeanne d'Arc's appearance, the English had nearly achieved their goal of a dual monarchy under English control and the French army had not achieved any major victories for a generation. In DeVries' words, "The kingdom of France was not even a shadow of its thirteenth-century prototype."DeVries, pp. 27–28.
The French king at the time of Joan's birth, Charles VI, suffered bouts of [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/richardII/charlesVI.html |title=Charles VI |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] and was often unable to rule. The king's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans, and the king's cousin John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, quarreled over the regency of France and the guardianship of the royal children. This dispute escalated to accusations of an extramarital affair with Queen Isabeau of Bavaria and the kidnappings of the royal children.[tpl]cite book|last1=Pernoud|first1=Regine |first2=Narue-Veronique |last2= Clin |title=Joan of Arc: Her Story|year=1999|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=89|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rwNkZ6j0MawC&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The matter climaxed with the assassination of the Duke of Orléans in 1407 on the orders of the Duke of Burgundy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.burgundytoday.com/historic-places/history-of-burgundy/dukes-of-burgundy.htm |title=The Glorious Age of the Dukes of Burgundy |publisher=Burgundy Today |accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl]
The factions loyal to these two men became known as the Armagnacs and the Burgundians, respectively. Henry V of England took advantage of this turmoil to invade France, winning a dramatic victory at Agincourt in 1415 and capturing many northern French towns.DeVries, pp. 15–19. In 1418, Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who massacred the Count of Armagnac and about 2,500 of his followers.[tpl]Cite web|last=Sizer|first=Michael|title=The Calamity of Violence: Reading the Paris Massacres of 1418 |year=2007|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0035.002/--calamity-of-violence-reading-the-paris-massacres-of-1418?rgn=main;view=fulltext|accessdate=29 December 2013[/tpl] The future French king, Charles VII, assumed the title of Dauphin – the heir to the throne – at the age of fourteen, after all four of his older brothers had died in succession.Pernoud and Clin, p. 167. His first significant official act was to conclude a peace treaty with Burgundy in 1419. This ended in disaster when Armagnac partisans assassinated John the Fearless during a meeting under Charles's guarantee of protection. The new duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, blamed Charles for the murder and entered into an alliance with the English. The allied forces conquered large sections of France.DeVries, p. 24.
In 1420, the queen of France Isabeau of Bavaria signed the Treaty of Troyes, which granted the succession of the French throne to Henry V and his heirs instead of her son Charles. This agreement revived rumors about her alleged affair with the late duke of Orléans and raised fresh suspicions that the Dauphin was illegitimate rather than the son of the king.Pernoud and Clin, pp. 188–189. Henry V and Charles VI died within two months of each other in 1422, leaving an infant, Henry VI of England, the nominal monarch of both kingdoms. Henry V's brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, acted as regent.DeVries, pp. 24, 26.
By the beginning of 1429, nearly all of northern France and some parts of the southwest were under Anglo-Burgundian control. The English controlled Paris and Rouen while the Burgundian faction controlled Reims, which had been the traditional site of French coronations since 816. This was an important consideration since neither claimant to the throne of France had been officially crowned yet. The English had laid siege to Orléans, which was one of the few remaining cities still loyal to Charles VII and it held a strategic position along the Loire River, which made it the last obstacle to an assault on the remainder of the French heartland. In the words of one modern historian, "On the fate of Orléans hung that of the entire kingdom."Pernoud and Clin, p. 10. No one was optimistic that the city could long withstand the siege.DeVries, p. 28.

==Life==

Joan was born the daughter of Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle RoméeJacques d'Arc (1380–1440) was a farmer in Domremy who held the post of doyen – a local tax-collector and organizer of village defenses. He married Isabelle de Vouthon (1387–1468), called Romée, in 1405. Their other children were Jacquemin, Jean, Pierre and Catherine. Charles VII ennobled Jacques and Isabelle's family on 29 December 1429; the Chamber of Accounts registered the family's elevation to noble status on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to "du Lys". in Domrémy, a village which was then in the French part of the duchy of Bar.The French portion of the duchy, called the Barrois mouvant, was situated west of the Meuse River while the rest of the duchy (east of the Meuse) was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. The duchy of Bar was later incorporated to the province of Lorraine and the village of Domrémy renamed Domrémy-la-Pucelle, in honor of Joan of Arc. See Condemnation trial, p. 37.http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html. Retrieved 23 March 2006. Joan's parents owned about 50 acres (20 hectares) of land and her father supplemented his farming work with a minor position as a village official, collecting taxes and heading the local watch.Pernoud and Clin, p. 221. They lived in an isolated patch of eastern France that remained loyal to the French crown despite being surrounded by pro-Burgundian lands. Several local raids occurred during her childhood and on one occasion her village was burned.
At her trial, Joan stated that she was about 19, so she must have been born around the year 1412. She later testified that she experienced her first vision around 1424 at the age of 12 years, when she was in her "father's garden"Pernoud, Regine; Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses, p. 30 and saw visions of figures she identified as Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, who told her to drive out the English and bring the Dauphin to Reims for his coronation. She said she cried when they left, as they were so beautiful.Condemnation trial, pp. 58–59.http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html. Retrieved 23 March 2006.
At the age of 16, she asked a relative named Durand Lassois to take her to the nearby town of Vaucouleurs, where she petitioned the garrison commander, Robert de Baudricourt, for permission to visit the royal French court at Chinon. Baudricourt's sarcastic response did not deter her.DeVries, pp. 37–40. She returned the following January and gained support from two of Baudricourt's soldiers: Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy.Nullification trial testimony of Jean de Metz.http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null04.html. Retrieved 12 February 2006. Under their auspices, she gained a second meeting, where she made a remarkable prediction about a military reversal near Orléans.Oliphant, ch. 2.http://www.authorama.com/book/jeanne-d-arc.html.
