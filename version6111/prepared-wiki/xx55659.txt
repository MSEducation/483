The 4th Eurovision Young Dancers Competition final was held in Helsinki, Finland on 5 June 1991.
One new country took part in this edition (Bulgaria) and three countries withdrew (Austria, Canada and United Kingdom). However, the Austrian broadcaster Ã–RF and the Canadian CBC broadcast the event.
Each country could send one or two dancers, male or female, who could perform one or two dances. A total of 15 countries took part in this edition, but only 8 made it to the final, where the top 3 countries (winner, second and third positions) were chosen.
