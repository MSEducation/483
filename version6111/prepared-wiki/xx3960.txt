Henry Alfred Kissinger ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|s|ɪ|n|dʒ|ər[/tpl];[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Kissinger |title=Kissinger – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=October 23, 2009[/tpl] born Heinz Alfred Kissinger [tpl]IPA-de|haɪnts alfʁɛt kɪsɪŋɐ|[/tpl]; May 27, 1923) is a German-born American diplomat and political scientist. A recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize (shared with Le Duc Tho, who refused the prize), he served as National Security Advisor and later concurrently as Secretary of State in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. After his term, his opinion was still sought by some subsequent U.S. presidents and other world leaders.
A proponent of Realpolitik, Kissinger played a prominent role in United States foreign policy between 1969 and 1977. During this period, he pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, orchestrated the opening of relations with the People's Republic of China, and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords, ending American involvement in the Vietnam War.
Kissinger is still considered an influential public figure.A press release issued by the 45th Munich Conference on Security Policy on February 8, 2009 declared "His voice continues to bear weight and authority throughout the globe." see http://www.securityconference.de/konferenzen/2009/ewald_von_kleist_preis.php?sprache=en& Munich Security Conference – February 6, 2009 Press ReleaseHe is listed among the 500 most powerful people in the world by Foreign Policy. He is the founder and chairman of Kissinger Associates, an international consulting firm.

==Early life and education==

Kissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany, in 1923 during the Weimar Republic, to a family of German Jews.Isaacson, pp 20. His father, Louis Kissinger (1887–1982), was a schoolteacher. His mother, Paula (Stern) Kissinger (1901–1998), was a homemaker. Kissinger has a younger brother, Walter Kissinger. The surname Kissinger was adopted in 1817 by his great-great-grandfather Meyer Löb, after the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml?theme=print |title=Die Kissingers in Bad Kissingen |publisher=Bayerischer Rundfunk |language=German |date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929145809/http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml?theme=print  |archivedate = September 29, 2007[/tpl] As a youth, Heinz enjoyed playing soccer, and even played for the youth side of his favorite club and one of the nation's best clubs at the time, SpVgg Fürth. In 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution, his family moved to London, England, before arriving in New York on September 5.
Kissinger spent his high school years in the Washington Heights section of upper Manhattan as part of the German Jewish immigrant community there. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced Frankish accent, due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak.Isaacson, pp 37.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517217372&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Bygone Days: Complex Jew. Inside Kissinger's soul|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=September 4, 2008[/tpl] Following his first year at George Washington High School, he began attending school at night and worked in a shaving brush factory during the day.
Following high school, Kissinger enrolled in the City College of New York, studying accounting. He excelled academically as a part-time student, continuing to work while enrolled. His studies were interrupted in early 1943, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army.Isaacson, pp 38

==Army experience==

Kissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in Spartanburg, South Carolina. On June 19, 1943, while stationed in South Carolina, at the age of 20 years, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. The army sent him to study engineering at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, but the program was cancelled, and Kissinger was reassigned to the 84th Infantry Division. There, he made the acquaintance of Fritz Kraemer, a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger's fluency in German and his intellect, and arranged for him to be assigned to the military intelligence section of the division. Kissinger saw combat with the division, and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the Battle of the Bulge.Isaacson, pp 39–48.
During the American advance into Germany, Kissinger, only a private, was put in charge of the administration of the city of Krefeld, owing to a lack of German speakers on the division's intelligence staff. Within eight days he had established a civilian administration.Isaacson, pp 48 Kissinger was then reassigned to the Counter Intelligence Corps, with the rank of sergeant. He was given charge of a team in Hanover assigned to tracking down Gestapo officers and other saboteurs, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.Isaacson, pp 49 In June 1945, Kissinger was made commandant of the Bensheim metro CIC detachment, Bergstrasse district of Hesse, with responsibility for de-Nazification of the district. Although he possessed absolute authority and powers of arrest, Kissinger took care to avoid abuses against the local population by his command.Isaacson, pp 53
In 1946, Kissinger was reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School at Camp King, continuing to serve in this role as a civilian employee following his separation from the army.Isaacson, pp 55.

==Academic career==

Henry Kissinger received his AB degree summa cum laude in political science at Harvard College in 1950, where he lived in Adams House and studied under William Yandell Elliott. He received his MA and PhD degrees at Harvard University in 1952 and 1954, respectively. In 1952, while still at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board. His doctoral dissertation was titled "Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich)".
Kissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government and, with Robert R. Bowie, co-founded the Center for International Affairs in 1958.  In 1955, he was a consultant to the National Security Council's Operations Coordinating Board. During 1955 and 1956, he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He released his book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy the following year.[tpl]cite book |first=Henry |last=Kissinger |title=Nuclear weapons and foreign policy |year=1957 |page=455 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |isbn=0-393-00494-5[/tpl] From 1956 to 1958 he worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project. He was director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program between 1958 and 1971. He was also director of the Harvard International Seminar between 1951 and 1971. Outside of academia, he served as a consultant to several government agencies, including the Operations Research Office, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Department of State, and the Rand Corporation, a think-tank.
Keen to have a greater influence on U.S. foreign policy, Kissinger became a supporter of, and advisor to, Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 1960, 1964 and 1968.Rothbard, Murray, Why the War? The Kuwait Connection (May 1991) After Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968, he made Kissinger National Security Advisor.

==Foreign policy==

Kissinger served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon, and continued as Secretary of State under Nixon's successor Gerald Ford.[tpl]cite web |title=History of the National Security Council, 1947–1997 |publisher=whitehouse.gov |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/history.html |accessdate=December 30, 2006[/tpl]
A proponent of Realpolitik, Kissinger played a dominant role in United States foreign policy between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of détente. This policy led to a significant relaxation in U.S.-Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. The talks concluded with a rapprochement between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for helping to establish a ceasefire and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. The ceasefire, however, was not durable. As National Security Advisor, in 1974 Kissinger directed the much-debated National Security Study Memorandum 200.

===Détente and the opening to China===

As National Security Advisor under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers. As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest to the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.
Kissinger sought to place diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union. He made two trips to the People's Republic of China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret) to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai, then in charge of Chinese foreign policy. The USC U.S.-China Institute has collected documents relating to the diplomatic efforts between 1969 and 1971 that led to this successful trip.[tpl]cite web|last=Dube|first=Clayton|title=Getting to Beijing: Henry Kissinger's Secret 1971 Trip|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2483|publisher=USC U.S.-China Institute|accessdate=July 21, 2011[/tpl] According to Kissinger's book, "The White House Years", the first secret China trip was arranged through Pakistan's diplomatic and Presidential involvement that paved the way to initial vital contact with the Chinese, since the Americans were unable to communicate directly with the Chinese leaders because of earlier cold relations.
This paved the way for the groundbreaking 1972 summit between Nixon, Zhou, and Communist Party of China Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility. The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.
While Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of Liaison Offices in the Chinese and American capitals, with serious implications for Indochinese matters, full normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China would not occur until 1979, because the Watergate scandal overshadowed the latter years of the Nixon presidency and because the United States continued to recognize the government of Taiwan.

===Vietnam War===

[tpl]Main|Vietnam War[/tpl][tpl]See also|Cambodian Civil War[/tpl]
Kissinger's involvement in Indochina started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. While still at Harvard, he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the White House and State Department. Kissinger says that "In August 1965... Henry Cabot Lodge, an old friend serving as Ambassador to Saigon, had asked me to visit Vietnam as his consultant. I toured Vietnam first for two weeks in October and November 1965, again for about ten days in July 1966, and a third time for a few days in October 1966... Lodge gave me a free hand to look into any subject of my choice". He became convinced of the meaninglessness of military victories in Vietnam, "...unless they brought about a political reality that could survive our ultimate withdrawal".[tpl]cite book | title=White House Years | pages=231–32 | first= Henry A. | last=Kissinger | location=Boston | publisher=Little, Brown & co. | year= 1979[/tpl] In a 1967 peace initiative, he would mediate between Washington and Hanoi.
Nixon had been elected in 1968 on the promise of achieving "peace with honor" and ending the Vietnam War. In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of Vietnamization that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the South Vietnamese Army so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, a Communist guerrilla organization, and North Vietnamese army (Vietnam People's Army or PAVN). Kissinger played a key role in secretly bombing Cambodia to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the Ho Chi Minh trail and other routes, as well as the 1970 Cambodian Incursion and subsequent widespread bombing of suspected Khmer Rouge targets in Cambodia. The bombing campaign contributed to the chaos of the Cambodian Civil War, which saw the forces of U.S.-backed leader Lon Nol unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.[tpl]cite book|last=Totten|first=Samuel|coauthors=William S.

Available online at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc "In April–May 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea.

Along with North Vietnamese Politburo Member Le Duc Tho, Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the Paris Peace Accords on "Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam," signed the January previous.[tpl]cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/press.html |accessdate=December 31, 2006[/tpl] Tho rejected the award, telling Kissinger that peace had not been really restored in South Vietnam.Le Duc Tho to Henry Kissinger, October 27, 1973.

===1971 India–Pakistan War===

Under Kissinger's guidance, the United States government supported Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in South Asia as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the USSR, and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the USSR) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States.[tpl]cite web |title=The Tilt: The U.S. and the South Asian Crisis of 1971 |publisher=National Security Archive |date=December 16, 2002 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/ |accessdate=December 30, 2006[/tpl]
Kissinger later came under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh–Pakistan War in which he described Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a "bitch" and a "witch". He also said "The Indians are bastards," shortly before the war. He also sneered at people who “bleed” for “the dying Bengalis” and ignored detailed reporting about the killing from Archer K. Blood, the then United States consul general in East Pakistan.[tpl]cite news|last=Bass|first=Gary|title=Nixon and Kissinger’s Forgotten Shame|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/nixon-and-kissingers-forgotten-shame.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 29, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Bass|first=Gary|title=The act of defiance that infuriated Henry Kissinger|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/the-act-of-defiance-that-infuriated-kissinger/article18112161/|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=23 April 2014[/tpl]  Kissinger has since expressed his regret over the comments.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4640773.stm |title=Kissinger regrets India comments |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=December 15, 2006 |publisher=BBC[/tpl]

===Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry===

According to notes taken by H. R. Haldeman, Nixon "ordered his aides to exclude all Jewish-Americans from policy-making on Israel", including Kissinger.Chait, Jonathan (December 10, 2010) Nixon Disallowed Jewish Advisors From Discussing Israel Policy, The New Republic One note quotes Nixon as saying "get K. Kissinger out of the play—Haig handle it".
In 1973, Kissinger did not feel that pressing the Soviet Union concerning the plight of Jews being persecuted there was in the interest of U.S. foreign policy. In conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Golda Meir on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, "The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."[tpl]cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks |work=The New York Times |date= December 10, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html [/tpl] Kissinger argued, however:
 
 That emigration existed at all was due to the actions of "realists" in the White House. Jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40,000 in 1972. The total in Nixon's first term was more than 100,000. To maintain this flow by quiet diplomacy, we never used these figures for political purposes. ... The issue became public because of the success of our Middle East policy when Egypt evicted Soviet advisers. To restore its relations with Cairo, the Soviet Union put a tax on Jewish emigration. There was no Jackson–Vanik Amendment until there was a successful emigration effort. Sen. Henry Jackson, for whom I had, and continue to have, high regard, sought to remove the tax with his amendment. We thought the continuation of our previous approach of quiet diplomacy was the wiser course. ... Events proved our judgment correct. Jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high.Kissinger, Henry. "Putting The Nixon Tape In Context". The Washington Post. December 26, 2010.

====1973 Yom Kippur War====

Documents show that Kissinger delayed telling President Richard Nixon about the start of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 to keep him from interfering. On October 6, 1973, the Israelis informed Kissinger about the attack at 6 am; Kissinger waited nearly 3 and a half hours before he informed Nixon.[tpl]cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/book-says-kissinger-delayed-telling-nixon-about-yom-kippur-war-1.217323 |title=Book says Kissinger delayed telling Nixon about Yom Kippur War|work=Haaretz|date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2012[/tpl]
According to Kissinger, in an interview in November 2013, he was notified at 6:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. Israel time) that war was imminent, and his urgent calls to the Soviets and Egyptians were ineffective. He says Golda Meir's decision not to preempt was wise and reasonable, balancing the risk of Israel looking like the aggressor and Israel's actual ability to strike within such a brief span of time.[tpl]cite web|last=Laor |first=Yitzhak |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.555704 |title=Kissinger wants Israel to know: The U.S. saved you during the 1973 war|publisher=Haaretz|date=2013-11-02 |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl]
The war began on October 6, 1973, when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Kissinger published lengthy telephone transcripts from this period in the 2002 book Crisis. On October 12, under Nixon's direction, and against Kissinger's initial advice,[tpl]cite book |last1=Siniver |first1=Asaf |title=Nixon, Kissinger, and U.S. Foreign Policy Making; The Machinery of Crisis |publisher= Cambridge |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-521-89762-4 |page= 188 |year= 2008[/tpl] while Kissinger was on his way to Moscow to discuss conditions for a cease-fire, Nixon sent a message to Brezhnev giving Kissinger full negotiating authority.
Israel regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured Golan Heights, and additionally on the western bank of the Suez Canal, although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the Six Day War. Kissinger pressured the Israelis to cede some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli-Egyptian non-aggression. The move saw a warming in U.S.–Egyptian relations, bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President Jimmy Carter mediated the Camp David Accords, during which Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.

===Latin American policy===

The United States continued to recognize and maintain relationships with non-left-wing governments, democratic and authoritarian alike. John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress was ended in 1973. In 1974, negotiations about new settlement over Panama Canal started. They eventually led to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and handing the Canal over to Panamanian control.
Kissinger initially supported the normalization of United States-Cuba relations, broken since 1961 (all U.S.–Cuban trade was blocked in February 1962, a few weeks after the exclusion of Cuba from the Organization of American States because of U.S. pressure). However, he quickly changed his mind and followed Kennedy's policy. After the involvement of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in the liberation struggles in Angola and Mozambique, Kissinger said that unless Cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized. Cuba refused.

====Intervention in Chile====

Chilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a plurality in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C. due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics. The Nixon administration, with Kissinger's input, authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to encourage a military coup that would prevent Allende's inauguration, but the plan was not successful.[tpl]cite web |url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp |title=Church Report |date=December 18, 1975 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=November 20, 2006[/tpl]Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders (1975), Church Committee, pages 246–247 and 250–254.[tpl]cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Kornbluh|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1[/tpl][tpl]rp|115[/tpl][tpl]rp|495[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8240-1[/tpl][tpl]rp|177[/tpl]
United States-Chile relations remained frosty during Salvador Allende's tenure, following the complete nationalization of the partially U.S.-owned copper mines and the Chilean subsidiary of the U.S.-based ITT Corporation, as well as other Chilean businesses. The U.S. claimed that the Chilean government had greatly undervalued fair compensation for the nationalization by subtracting what it deemed "excess profits". Therefore, the U.S. implemented economic sanctions against Chile. The CIA also provided funding for the mass anti-government strikes in 1972 and 1973, and extensive black propaganda in the newspaper El Mercurio.[tpl]rp|93[/tpl]
The most expeditious way to prevent Allende from assuming office was somehow to convince the Chilean congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the election. Once elected by the congress, Alessandri—a party to the plot through intermediaries—was prepared to resign his presidency within a matter of days so that new elections could be held. This first, nonmilitary, approach to stopping Allende was called the Track I approach. The CIA's second approach, the Track II approach, was designed to encourage a military overthrow.
On September 11, 1973, Allende died during a military coup launched by Army Commander-in-Chief Augusto Pinochet, who became President.[tpl]cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/chile/allende.htm |title=Allende's Leftist Regime |accessdate=November 20, 2006 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists[/tpl]
A document released by the CIA in 2000 titled "CIA Activities in Chile" revealed that the United States, acting through the CIA, actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of Allende and that it made many of Pinochet's officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military.Peter Kornbluh, CIA Acknowledges Ties to Pinochet’s Repression Report to Congress Reveals U.S. Accountability in Chile, Chile Documentation Project, National Security Archive, September 19, 2000.

====Argentina====

Kissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentinian military, led by Jorge Videla, toppled the elected government of Isabel Perón in 1976 with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and "disappearances" against political opponents. During a meeting with Argentinian foreign minister César Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally, but urged him to "get back to normal procedures" quickly before the U.S. Congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions."Kissinger to the Argentine Generals in 1976: 'If There Are Things That Have To Be Done, You Should Do Them Quickly[tpl]'"[/tpl].

===Africa===

In September 1976 Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the Rhodesian Bush War. Kissinger, along with South Africa's Prime Minister John Vorster, pressured Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia. With FRELIMO in control of Mozambique and even South Africa withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete. According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs. Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's "death certificate". Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of minority-rule.[tpl]citation|last=Smith|first=Ian Douglas|title=Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal and the Dreadful Aftermath|year=2001|publisher=Blake Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-903402-05-0|oclc=1676807[/tpl]

===East Timor===

The Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S. attention to the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which lies within the Indonesian archipelago and declared its independence in 1975. Indonesian president Suharto was a strong U.S. ally in Southeast Asia and began to mobilize the Indonesian army, preparing to annex the nascent state, which had become increasingly dominated by the popular leftist FRETILIN party. In December 1975, Suharto discussed the invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed annexation. They only wanted it done "fast" and proposed to delay the invasion until they had returned to Washington.Agence France Press, "US Endorsed Indonesia's East Timor Invasion: Secret Documents", December 6, 2001 Accordingly Suharto delayed the operation for one day. Finally on December 7 Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony. U.S. arms sales to Indonesia continued, and Suharto went ahead with the annexation plan.

===Role in U.S. foreign policy===

====Yugoslav wars====

In several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav wars, he criticized the United States' policies in Southeast Europe, among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/7185|title=Charlie Rose – A panel on the crisis in Bosnia|publisher=charlierose.com|date=November 28, 1994|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl] Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs, and Croats for that part, being aggressors or separatist, saying that "they can't be separating from something that has never existed".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6651|title=Charlie Rose – An interview with Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=September 14, 1995|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]
In addition, he repeatedly warned the West of inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries.
Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo. In particular, he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement:
However, as the Serbs did not accept the Rambouillet text and NATO bombings started, he opted for a continuation of the bombing as NATO's credibility was now at stake, but dismissed the usage of ground forces, claiming that it was not worth it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4347|title=Charlie Rose – An hour with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=April 12, 1999|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]

In a November 19, 2006, interview on BBC Sunday AM, Kissinger said, when asked whether there is any hope left for a clear military victory in Iraq, "If you mean by 'military victory' an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country, that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support, I don't believe that is possible. ... I think we have to redefine the course. But I don't believe that the alternative is between military victory as it had been defined previously, or total withdrawal."[tpl]cite news|last=Marr|first=Andrew|title=US Policy on Iraq|date=November 19, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/sunday_am/6163050.stm|accessdate=December 29, 2006|publisher=BBC|work=Sunday AM[/tpl]
In an April 3, 2008, interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution, Kissinger re-iterated that even though he supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq he thought that the Bush administration rested too much of the case for war on Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Robinson noted that Kissinger had criticized the administration for invading with too few troops, for disbanding the Iraqi Army, and for mishandling relations with certain allies.Kissinger on War & More.

====Iran====

Kissinger's position on this issue of U.S.–Iran talks was reported by the Tehran Times to be that "Any direct talks between the U.S. and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet."[tpl]cite news|title=Kissinger backs direct U.S. negotiations with Iran|work=The Tehran Times|date=September 27, 2008|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=165193|accessdate=September 27, 2008[/tpl] (Transcript of a Bloomberg reportinterview.)
