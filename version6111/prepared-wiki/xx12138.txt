Waterlooville is a town in Hampshire, England, approximately 8 miles north of Portsmouth.
The town has a population of about 20,000 and is surrounded by Purbrook, Blendworth, Cowplain, Lovedean, Clanfield, Catherington, Crookhorn, Denmead, Hambledon, Horndean and Widley. It forms part of the South Hampshire conurbation. The town formed around the old A3 London to Portsmouth road.
Waterlooville is twinned with Maurepas, Yvelines in France and Henstedt-Ulzburg in Germany.

==History==

Legend has it that it was named after the pub that stood at the centre of town, then known as Waitland End. The Heroes of Waterloo was so named because, on its opening day, in 1815, soldiers who had just disembarked at Portsmouth, returning from the Battle of Waterloo, decided to stop there and celebrate their victory. According to local legend, many of them settled there. The public house was renamed in their honour and the area around the pub became known as Waterlooville.
The original "Heroes" public house was at a crossroads near the main bus-stop. A new pub has taken the name and is located at the northern end of the shopping precinct. There are two other pubs in the town centre, The Wellington, at the southern end of town, and the Denmead Queen, which is adjacent to the Heroes and part of the JD Weatherspoon pub chain.
The local electrical shop, Eric Jackson's Ltd, has been open since 1928 and is the oldest retailer in the town. The business, now in its 3rd generation was started by Eric, then passed down the family to Michael and then to Peter Jackson.
The town centre was closed to traffic in 1981 when a bypass was constructed to take traffic away from the main shopping area. The bypass, initially anonymous, was named Maurepas Way sometime after the two towns were twinned in 1995. An underpass was constructed for pedestrians walking up along the Hambledon road. Between 1982–83 the old road was then fully converted to a pedestrian precinct. The precinct had a fountain and raised area at the northern end, near the Heroes pub, however regular vandalism of the fountain soon resulted in its removal.
GEC Marconi built a site at Waterlooville for their Underwater Systems in the early 1980s, for the Stingray anti-submarine torpedo. A peace camp was set up near the construction site. After completion of the GEC building, a free music festival was held at Old Park Farm in Waterlooville called Torpedo Town. A second Torpedo Town festival was held in August 1987 at Bramdean Common near Winchester.
Near the town centre is the rebuilt St George's church. During the 1950s and 1960s the surrounding area saw extensive growth in housing, when large suburban public and private housing estates were constructed. This resulted in the original Victorian church failing to cope with the population growth. Plans for a new church were started and in 1970 the new church was built on the site of the old church. Parts of the old church were retained.
In July 2011 the town saw the consecration of its first Roman Catholic Church. For the preceding eighty years the growing Catholic community in the town had utilised at first one aisle of, and ultimately the entire of the chapel at St Michaels convent. However the decision of the sisters of Our Lady of Charity to sell the main convent site coupled with the inadequate capacity led to a new church being required. The new church which is dedicated to "The Sacred Heart and St Peter the Apostle" sits to the north of the town centre on London Road.
In August 2012 the northern part of the shopping centre underwent a £700,000 renovation, the raised area holding the former fountain was removed and new block paving installed.  The renovation increased the area available to the weekly Friday market and improved pedestrian accessibility.  In addition a "smoking-shelter" style band-stand was installed at pedestrian T-junction with The Boulevard.

==Climate==

Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows. In July and August average daytime maximum temperatures are around [tpl]convert|23|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], whereas in January and February average nighttime minimum temperatures drop to about [tpl]convert|2|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|1|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. both June 1976 and August 1990 recorded the highest temperature of just over [tpl]convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the lowest was recorded on January 1987 where the temperature dipped to [tpl]convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. There is adequate rainfall year round with February to August being drier months and September to January being wetter months. During winter, Waterlooville tends to have more frost than nearby Portsmouth as it has less influences from the sea and is more exposed to northerly winds. However, highs in the summer are slightly warmer than Portsmouth because there is less influence of cool breezes from the English Channel as the town is more inland. Sunshine averages are typical of that across the Portsmouth area, Isle of Wight and the south-west Sussex coast of around 1800 - 2100 hours of sunshine a year, where Southwesterly winds keep the sunshine hours up between late March and mid September, the town is also protected by the South Downs.

==Politics==

==Development==

Much of Waterlooville as well as Purbrook, Cowplain and Horndean, has 'spread' out from London Road. However to the west of Waterlooville and Purbrook, (the area bordered by Hambledon Road and London Road) contains much undeveloped land. As a result the centre of Waterlooville borders fields to the west just a few hundred meters away, while to the north, east and south it is bordered by housing estates and Cowplain and Purbrook respectively. This is due to the fact that Waterlooville, which is part of Havant Borough Council, is bordered by Winchester City Council and so has hindered any plans in the past. This is much evident with the lack of street lights on a stretch of Hambledon Road between Denmead and Waterloovlle.
However, in 2009, years of planning and joint involvement of Havant and Winchester councils came to fruition with the 'West of Waterlooville Major Development Area' housing scheme, starting with Maurepas Roundabout, being enlarged to accommodate for a new road and increased traffic that comes with the new homes. The work was delayed for some time, but continued in January 2012.

==Education==

Waterlooville contains ten primary schools:  Morelands Primary School, Meadowlands Junior and Infants School,
Padnell Infants and Junior School, Hart Plain Infants and Junior schools, Springwood Infant School (formerly Stakes Hill Infant School), Springwood Junior School (formerly Hulbert Junior School), Mill Hill Primary School, Purbrook Infant and Junior Schools, Queens Inclosure Primary and   St. Peter's Catholic Primary.
Two new two form entry primary schools are to be built in the new housing development area situated off the Maurepas Roundabout. The first of these is scheduled to open in September 2014 with a possible Year R only intake depending on the number of children needing places. The other primary school will be built when the need for it arises - possibly 2019.
It contains five secondary schools: Horndean Technology College, Cowplain Community School, Oaklands Catholic School, Purbrook Park School and Crookhorn College.
There are two colleges, Oaklands Catholic Sixth Form College and South Downs College.
