[[Jon Finn Group]]

CATEGORIES: American rock music groups

The Jon Finn Group is a rock band formed and led by the Boston guitarist Jon Finn. The band plays instrumental progressive rock, sounding like a mix between Dream Theater and Dixie Dregs with a blues approach.
The group consists of Finn on guitar, Joe Santerre on bass, Ross Ramsay on keyboards, and Larry Finn on drums; all of the members are teachers at the Berklee College of Music.
