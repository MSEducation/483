==Pacific Gas and Electric litigation==

The case alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium (also written as "chromium VI", "Cr-VI" or "Cr-6") in the southern California town of Hinkley. At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952, a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966 PG&E used hexavalent chromium to fight corrosion in the cooling tower. The wastewater dissolved the hexavalent chromium from the cooling towers and was discharged to unlined ponds at the site. Some of the wastewater percolated into the groundwater, affecting an area near the plant approximately [tpl]convert|2|by|1|mi[/tpl].PG&E Hinkley Chromium Cleanup California Environmental Protection Agency, 9/10/08 The case was settled in 1996 for US$333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in US history.  Brockovich's attorneys received 133.6 million dollars of that settlement, and Brockovich herself received a bonus of two million dollars. However, Brockovich's attorneys held onto the money more than six months, then, after several threats for lawsuits, they finally paid out.[tpl]cite web |last=Sharp |first=Kathleen |title='Erin Brockovich': The Real Story |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/04/14/sharp/|work=Salon |accessdate=18 April 2013[/tpl] The firm also billed $10 million for undetailed expenses, in a violation of the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct.[tpl]cite web |title=BILLING FOR PROFESSIONAL FEES, DISBURSEMENTS AND OTHER EXPENSES |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/genpractice/resources/costrecovery/ABA_CommEthics_Opinion.authcheckdam.pdf |work=ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 93-379 American Bar Association |publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=18 April 2013[/tpl]
A study, released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry, showed that cancer rates in Hinkley "remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008".Schwartz, Naoki (2010-12-13) "Survey shows unremarkable cancer rate in CA town", The Boston Globe Dec 13, 2010 An epidemiologist involved in the study said that the 196 cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer.  A June 2013 Mother Jones magazine article featured an extensive critique from the Center for Public Integrity of the author's work on the later epidemiological studies.http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/05/erin-brockovich-hinkley-california-junk-science
Average Cr-6 levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09 ppb. The PG&E Topock Compressor Station  averaged 7.8 ppb and peaks at 31.8 ppb based on the PG&E Background Study.PG&E Background Study  California's Public Health Goal (PHG), circa 2011, for hexavalent chromium is 0.02 ppb.

==Other litigation==

Working with Edward L. Masry, a lawyer based in Thousand Oaks, California, Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One of those accuses the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in Willits, California.  Another lawsuit, which lists 1,200 plaintiffs, alleges contamination near PG&E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in Kings County, California, along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006.  After experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the Conejo Valley, Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well.
Brockovich and Masry filed suit against the Beverly Hills Unified School District in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a cluster of oil wells on campus.Beverly Hills Mystery People Magazine. May 19, 2003, Accessed May 30, 2009. Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate substantial link, and Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs."More Brockovich Claims Tossed." Balance. Civil Justice Association of California. Third Quarter 2007, p.2. In May 2007, the School District announced that it was to be paid $450,000 as reimbursement for legal expenses.Justice Served as City of Beverly Hills and Beverly Hills Unified School District Receive Reimbursement in Oil Well Litigation, CJAC press release, Oct 9, 2007.
Brockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of St. Joseph, Missouri in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors (70 since 1996) around the town of Cameron, Missouri, which is currently being investigated by the EPA.Lawsuit alleges fertilizer was contaminated around Cameron, Mo.
In June 2009 Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in Midland, Texas."Brockovich: Midland, Texas Water Sullied." CBS News. June 10, 2009. Accessed June 10, 2009. "Significant amounts" of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply. Brockovich said "The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley."
In March 2013 Brockovich met with residents of Bayou Corne, Louisiana, in Assumption Parish in south Louisiana where a large sinkhole is growing as a result of underground waste storage from Texas Brine Inc."Erin Brockovich advises Assumption Parish residents on sinkhole issue" The Times-Picayune. March 10, 2013. Accessed March 11, 2013. The residents are under mandatory evacuation as the hole grows and swallows more of the swampland, emitting methane and other gases, some possibly infiltrating into the groundwater and the air. The residents have been told their area is unlivable. She and her legal team have met with hundreds of the residents.
