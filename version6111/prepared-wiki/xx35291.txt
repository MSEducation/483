[[Lake Gairdner National Park]]

Lake Gairdner is a national park in South Australia (Australia), 436Â km northwest of Adelaide. It is located just south of the Trans Australian Railway line, Stuart Highway, and the Woomera Prohibited area.
There is very limited public access to this park which is surrounded by pastoral leases. The easiest public access is from the main road running from Yardea to Kingoonya, at The Brothers Well, a concrete catchment at the side of the road at the Southern end of Moonarie station (though the road signs would have you believe that you were on Yardea Station). The road is dirt, but quite good enough for two-wheel drive vehicles unless it is wet, when it is likely that it will be closed by the Highways Dept..
Ordinarily, the country is totally arid, and devoid of free water, surface or underground. In the summer it can be extremely hot: in the springtime, though, this country has great attraction for birdwatchers and botanists.
This region is the home country of the Kokatha people, and traces of their occupation may still be found: sacred sites are still visited for ceremonies.
