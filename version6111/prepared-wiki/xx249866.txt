Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta is an annual Gaelic football competition contested by clubs from the Irish language-speaking  Gaeltacht areas of Ireland. Clubs compete on a county-basis at first, in order to qualify for the tournament that is hosted by a different club from the Gaeltacht each year. The inaugural competition was held in Gweedore, County Donegal in 1969,http://www.sportsmanager.i/cake/gaa2/donegal/contentPage/10698/Honours with the local club Gaoth Dobhairhttp://www.clgghaothdobhair.com/Notai.asp?id=130&page=43 being crowned as champions. From 1975 onwards, the competition has also been contested at junior level.
RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta provides extensive radio coverage of both the regional qualifiers and the national finals, held over the June Bank Holiday. TG4 provides live television coverage of the finals on the June Bank Holiday Monday and these are also webcast world wide online.

They managed to win the tournament outright on home soil also, the third consecutive team to do so. They beat Mayo's Cill tSéadhna, a team who remarkably made the final after three games in two days. Even more remarkably, they scored a total of 17 goals in 4 games (15 of them in the first 3 games). Gaoth Dobhair however, were by far the superior team over the weekend. They won the final on a scoreline of 1-13 to 2-9. An estimated crowd of 10,000 attended the picturesque coastal region for the finals.
The Waterford club Rinn Ó gCuanach CLG will host the competition in 2013. They hosted the tournament last in 1999. The Kerry teams An Ghaeltacht and Lios Póil won the senior and junior finals respectively that year.
