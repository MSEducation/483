[[Emathis]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Emathis is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders) with ten described species. Half of the species occurs from Sumatra to the Philippines, the other five occur in the West Indies. It is not certain that these two groups should reside within the same genus. This genus is very similar to the closely related Lepidemathis, which are larger.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 283f
