CATEGORIES: Standardized tests in the United States, Economics education

The Test of Economic Literacy or TEL is a standardized test of economics nationally norm-referenced in the United States for use in upper-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., Basic Economics Test (BET), Test of Economic Knowledge (TEK) and Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) ) sponsored and published by the National Council on Economic Education (NCEE) .
The TEL is in its third edition and is available, along with an examinerâ€™s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the National Center for Research in Economic Education (NCREE) and included norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from over 100 high schools across the United States.  The TEL has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option multiple-choice items with content validity based on the Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics.
