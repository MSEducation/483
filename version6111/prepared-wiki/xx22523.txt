The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) is a division of Environment Canada, which primarily provides public meteorological information and weather forecasts and warnings of severe weather and other environmental hazards.  MSC also monitors and conducts research on climate, atmospheric science, air quality, water quantities, ice and other environmental issues. MSC operates a network of radio stations throughout Canada transmitting weather and environmental information 24 hours per day called Weatheradio Canada.
There are currently five weather forecast offices:
MSC also operates the Canadian Meteorological Centre, which is tasked with providing forecast guidance, and the Canadian Ice Service,Canadian Ice Service which provides ice observations and forecasts for mariners.  In support of Canada's military, some MSC meteorologists are seconded to the Department of National Defence (Canada).
