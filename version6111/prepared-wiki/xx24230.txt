CATEGORIES: Partridges

Partridges are birds in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. They are a non-migratory Old World group. 
These are medium-sized birds, intermediate between the larger pheasants and the smaller quails. Partridges are native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Partridges are ground-nesting seed-eaters.[tpl]cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]
According to Greek legend, the first partridge appeared when Daedalus threw his nephew, Perdix, off the sacred hill of Athena in a fit of jealous rage. Supposedly mindful of his fall, the bird does not build its nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights and avoids high places.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5nvuxnsmS8MC&pg=PA1760&lpg=PA1760 | title=Falling Upwards: How We Took to the Air | publisher=HarperCollins | date=2013 | accessdate=16 April 2013 | author=Holmes, Richard | pages=1760[/tpl]
Partridges appear as part of the first gift listed in the Christmas carol, "The 12 Days of Christmas".  As such, "A partridge in a pear tree" is sung as the last line of each verse.
