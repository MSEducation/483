[[162]]

CATEGORIES: 162

Year 162 (CLXII) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rusticus and Plautius (or, less frequently, year 915 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 162 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
