Alcvin Ryuzen Ramos is a professional shakuhachi teacher and performer.  Born in Japan, Ramos has also lived in the United States and Canada.  As of 2001, he resides in British Columbia, Canada where he is founder and director of the Shakuhachi Society of British Columbia.
Ramos studied shakuhachi in Japan under several teachers, including Kaoru Kakizakai, Teruo Furuya, Atsuya Okuda and more recently Yoshinobu Taniguchi.  He received his shihan (master) title from Katsuya Yokoyama.  Ramos received his Dai Shihan (grand master) license from Yoshinobu Taniguchi, taking the new name, "Ryuzen" (Dragon Meditation) making him the first Canadian and one of only a handful of non-Japanese to receive this esteemed honor.  He also cites Watazumi Doso, teacher of Yokoyama, and his Dokyoku honkyoku repertoire as a strong influence.
In addition to teaching and performing, Ramos is a shakuhachi flute craftsman, specializing in the hocchiku variety of jinashikan (natural bore flutes, "without ji" or paste).
Ramos also plays biwa (a Japanese lute and ''shinobue' (a Japanese lside-blown flute.
