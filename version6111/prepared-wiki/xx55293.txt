The Battle of Ohaeawai was fought between British forces and local Māori during the Flagstaff War in July 1845 at Ohaeawai[tpl]cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period |url= http://www.archive.org/stream/newzealandwarshi01cowa/newzealandwarshi01cowa_djvu.txt |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The battle was notable in that it established that the fortified Pā could withstand bombardment from cannon fire and that frontal assaults by soldiers would result in serious troop losses.

==Kawiti's success at Ohaeawai Pā==

After the Battle of Te Ahuahu a debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui’s Pā at Ohaeawai.[tpl]cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Hekes War in the North | publisher=No. 16  Ao Hou, Te / The New World, National Library of New Zealand|pages =38–43|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012[/tpl] In the winter months of 1845 Lieutenant Colonel Despard led a combined force of troops from the 58th and 99th Regiments, Royal Marines and Māori allies in an attack on Pene Taui's Pā at Ohaeawai,[tpl]cite web| last =Cowan| first =James |title= Ground Plan of Ohaeawai Pā| publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64)|pages =|year =1955|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053a.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012[/tpl] which had been fortified by Te Ruki Kawiti, a prominent rangatira (chief) and military leader.[tpl]cite book |last1=  Raugh |first1= Harold E. |authorlink1= |title= The Victorians at war, 1815-1914: an encyclopedia of British military history |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 2004 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-57607-925-6 |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl]
The British troops arrived before the Ohaeawai Pā on 23 June and established a camp about [tpl]convert|500|m|ft[/tpl] away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within [tpl]convert|200|m|ft[/tpl] of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade,[tpl]cite web| last =Cowan| first =James |title= Flax-masked Palisade| publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64)|pages =|year =1955|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053c.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012[/tpl] but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences, so as to create a breach in the palisade.
After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32 pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene's colours - the Union Jack. The Union Jack was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak).[tpl]cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period, Volume I: 1845–1864 |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c8.html|accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour.[tpl]cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title=Vol II, The Life of Henry Williams|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1050&page=1&action=null|format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= Early New Zealand Books (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=112|pages= |chapter= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl] The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured.[tpl]cite web| last=King | first =Marie |title= A Most Noble Anchorage - The Story of Russell & The Bay of Islands | publisher=The Northland Publications Society, Inc., The Northlander No 14 (1974)|chapter=|year =1992|url= http://www.reocities.com/wlorac/russbois.txt| accessdate=9 Oct 2012[/tpl] The casualties included Captain Grant of the 58th Regiment and Lieutenant Phillpotts of [tpl]HMS|Hazard|1837|6[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last=|first=|title= New Zealand - Has the Work Died Out? |journal=The Church Missionary Gleaner|year=1870|volume=20|pages=115|url=http://books.google.co.il/books?id=rCsEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=1 December 2013[/tpl]
Shaken by the loss of a third of his troops, Despard decided to abandon the siege. However, his Māori allies contested this decision. Tāmati Wāka Nene persuaded Despard to wait for a few more days. More ammunition and supplies were brought in and the shelling continued. On the morning of 8 July the pā was found to have been abandoned, the occupants having disappeared in the night. When they had a chance to examine it the British officers found it to be even stronger than they had feared."Chapter 8: The Storming-Party at Ohaeawai", The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period, James Cowan, 1955
The defenders of the pā had four iron cannons on ship-carriages including a carronade that was loaded with a bullock-chain, and fired at close quarters at the attaching soldiers. The Colonial forces capture these cannons, one of which had been destroyed by a shot from a British cannon.[tpl]cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period, Volume I: 1845–1864 |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c8.html |accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The drawing by Mr Symonds of the 99th Regiment describes Ohaeawai’s inner palisade as being [tpl]convert|3|m|ft[/tpl] high, built using Puriri logs. In front of the inner palisade was a ditch in which the warriors could shelter and reload their muskets then fire through gaps in the two outer palisades.[tpl]cite web|first=|last= Thomas Hutton, copied from a drawing taken by Mr Symonds of the 99th Regt.|title = Plan of Ohaeawai pa|year =1845|url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/plan-ohaeawai-pa|publisher=New Zealand History Online|accessdate=4 Oct 2011[/tpl]
Relying on the report of her husband Henry who observed the battle, Marianne Williams commented on the ingenuity of the construction of the war pā:
The pā was duly destroyed and the British retreated once again to the Bay of Islands. Te Ruki Kawiti and his warriors escaped and proceeded to construct an even stronger pā at Ruapekapeka. The Battle of Ohaeawai was presented as a victory for the British force, notwithstanding the death of about a third of the soldiers. The reality of the end of the Battle of Ohaeawai was that Te Ruki Kawiti and his warriors had abandoned the pā in a tactical withdrawal; with the Ngāpuhi moving on to build the Ruapekapeka Pā from which to engage the British force on a battle field chosen by Te Ruki Kawiti.
Hone Heke did not participate in the Battle of Ohaeawai as he was recovering from the wounds he received at the  Battle of Te Ahuahu.

==Model for the gunfighter pa==

After the battle models were made of the ingenious design of the pā, with one being went to Britain where it sat forgotten in a museum. Other Māori tribes of New Zealand became aware of the techniques used in the design of the Ohaeawai Pā in order to blunt the effectiveness of cannon and musket fire and to create firing trenches located within the inner palisade and communication trenches linking to ruas - shelters dug into the ground and covered with earth."The Battle for Kawiti's Ohaeawai Pa", James Graham, HistoryOrb.com The design of the Ohaeawai Pā, and the pā subsequently built by Kawiti at Ruapekapeka, became the basis of what is now called the gunfighter pa."Gunfighter Pa", Historic Places Trust website

==Site of the battle==

Cowan identifies that "the site of the Ohaeawai pa is now occupied by a Maori church and burying-ground. The scene of the battle is five miles from Kaikohe and two miles from the Township of Ohaeawai. A Maori church of old-fashioned design is seen on the left as one travels from Kaikohe; it stands on a gentle rise a short distance west of the main road. The locality is usually called Ngawha, from the hot springs in the neighbourhood, but it is the true Ohaeawai; the European township which has appropriated the name should properly be known as Taiamai. The church occupies the centre of the olden fortification, and a scoria-stone wall, 7 ft. high, encloses the sacred ground."[tpl]cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/newzealandwarshi01cowa/newzealandwarshi01cowa_djvu.txt |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The church was built on the site of the Ohaeawai pā in 1870.
