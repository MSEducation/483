Mercury(II) hydroxide or mercury dihydroxide is an inorganic metal hydroxide with the chemical formula HgH2O2 or more commonly written as Hg(OH)2.

==Synthesis==

It is not possible to make the chemical by adding OH- to Hg2+ in aqueous solution since this merely precipitates yellow solid HgO, although it is possible that Hg(OH)2 is momentarily produced during  the reaction.[tpl]cite journal | title =Infrared Spectrum of Hg(OH)2 in Solid Neon and Argon|author1=Xuefeng Wang| author2= Lester Andrews|journal = Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages=108–11|date=November 18, 2004|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ic048673w | doi = 10.1021/ic048673w[/tpl]
The first experimental evidence for the existence of the molecule was reported by Wang and Andrews in 2004. They produced it by irradiating a frozen mixture of mercury, oxygen and hydrogen with light from a mercury arc lamp. The mixture had been produced by evaporating mercury atoms at 50 °C into a gas consisting of neon, argon or deuterium (in separate experiments) plus 2 to 8% hydrogen and 0.2 to 2.0% oxygen. The mixture was then condensed at 5 kelvin onto a caesium iodide window through which it could be irradiated.
