Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a decision that desegregated public schools.  He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy and then served as the Solicitor General after being appointed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967.

==Early life==

Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. He was the great-grandson of a slave who was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo;Kallen (1993), p. 8[tpl]Cite news | last = Lewis | first = Neil | title = A Slave's Great-Grandson Who Used Law to Lead the Rights Revolution | newspaper=The New York Times | date = June 28, 1991 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/28/us/a-slave-s-great-grandson-who-used-law-to-lead-the-rights-revolution.html | accessdate =May 18, 2010 | postscript = [/tpl] his grandfather was also a slave.[tpl]cite news|author=GMU|title=Thurgood Marshall, Supreme Court Justice|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hill/marshall.htm|accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood in second grade because he disliked spelling it.

==Education==

Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. Subsequently he went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.youngthurgood.com|title = Young Thurgood: The Making of a Supreme Court Justice | first1=Larry S. | last1=Gibson| publisher=Prometheus Books | year=2012|isbn=9781616145712|page=84[/tpl] Marshall stated that his goal was to become a lawyer.
Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students. He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team and in his freshman year opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university. Hughes later described him as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hLXXjgapVhAC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Marshall+Alpha+Phi&source=bl&ots=OogdQ8PQz7&sig=z7K5DkNgDm9akhq8A8Cj4ix-6-4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KeBkUPapN-Xo0QHPiIF4&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Marshall%20Alpha%20Phi&f=false|page=57|title=Thurgood Marshall: Supreme Court Justice |first1=Joseph |last1=Nazel |isbn=0870675842 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Melrose Square Pub, 1993|accessdate=September 27, 2012[/tpl] ISBN 9780870675843  In his second year he got involved in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theatre.

Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy.  Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UwWExjnyfoMC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=Thurgood+Marshall+Alpha+Phi&source=bl&ots=ajzp8mKRZb&sig=NSebyIgHFxT_nSfoc3CItB_-xa4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dNxkUMu8FYuhyAGQxoFA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Thurgood%20Marshall%20Alpha%20Phi&f=false|title = Thurgood Marshall | first1=Glenn | last1=Starks | first2=F. | last2=Erik Brooks| publisher=ABC-CLIO | year= 2012|isbn=9780313349171|pages= 7â€“9[/tpl]  In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[tpl]cite web|title=Biographies of the Robes: Thurgood Marshall|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/robes_marshall.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl]  

==Marriage and family==

Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:American Public Radio: Cissy Marshall Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.

==Law career==

After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25 year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.  
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to accept attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[tpl]cite book|last=Lomotey|first=Kofi|title=Encyclopedia of African American Education|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-4050-4|date=2010[/tpl] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state.

===Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund===

At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[ref]
http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_bush_bio_naacp.html[/ref] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."Root, Damon (March 20, 2009) A Forgotten Civil Rights Hero, Reason Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 132â€“35, 157â€“58. According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, â€œMarshallâ€™s disdain for Howard was almost visceral. He 'disliked Howardâ€™s militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hooverâ€™s attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration the NAACP and the FBI in civil rights.'"

===Court of Appeals and Solicitor General===

President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/news/2002/philatelic/sr02_053.htm |title=Civil Rights Giant and First Black Supreme Court Justice Honored on 2003 Black Heritage Series Stamp |publisher=United States Postal Service |date=August 7, 2002 |accessdate=June 29, 2010[/tpl] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.

===U.S. Supreme Court===

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69â€“11 on August 30, 1967.Graham, Fred P. (August 31, 1967) Senate Confirms Marshall As the First Negro Justice; 10 Southerners Oppose High Court Nominee in 69-to-11 Vote. New York Times. He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American. President Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that a lot of black baby boys would be named "Thurgood" in honor of this choice.Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true. According to the Social Security Administration Popular baby name database, Thurgood has never been in the top 1000 of male baby names.
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z8DX12_NJ2AC&printsec=frontcover#PPA64,M1|title=The Rehnquist Court and the Constitution |accessdate=May 1, 2009|author=Tinsley E. Yarbrough|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press US | isbn=978-0-19-510346-5[/tpl]  Marshall stated:
In conclusion Marshall stated:
Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Dan Kahan, Cass Sunstein, Eben Moglen, Susan Low Bloch, Martha Minow, Rick Pildes, Paul Gewirtz, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 and was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=v-0tK76f1t8C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39#v=onepage&q=|title=Advice and consent: the politics of judicial appointments |accessdate=August 13, 2009|author=Lee Epstein, Jeffrey Allan Segal|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press US | isbn=978-0-19-530021-5[/tpl]  Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

==Death and legacy==

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58Â pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84.

Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent.
