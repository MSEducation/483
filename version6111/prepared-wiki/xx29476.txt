</ref> Jewish sources teach that when Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]] ordered the destruction of the Temple, he ordered Pangar, Duke of Arabia, to destroy the Western Wall. Pangar however could not destroy the wall because of God's promise that the Wall will never be destroyed. When asked by Titus why he did not destroy it, Pangar replied that it would stand as a reminder of what Titus had conquered. He was duly executed.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref> There is a tradition that states that when water starts trickling through the stones of the Wall, it is a signal of the advent of the Messiah.<ref>

Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word kotel when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word kotel, meaning wall, is made up of two parts: "Ko", which has the numerical value of God’s name, and "Tel", meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.Kav ha-Yashar Ch. 50
Jewish sources, including the Zohar, write that the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall.Zohar Mishpatim 116 The Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: “Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never moved away from the Western Wall”.Exodus Rabbah 2:2 18th-century scholar Jonathan Eybeschutz writes that “after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour”.Ya'arot Devash Vol. 1, Ch. 4 It is told that great Jewish sages, including Isaac Luria and the Radvaz, experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.See also Kav ha-Yashar Ch. 93 and Shem Ha-gedolim for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.

====Prayer at the Wall====

The sages state that anyone who prays in the Temple in Jerusalem, “it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer”.Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer 35 Jewish Law dictates that when Jews pray the Silent Prayer, they should face towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies,Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 18:10. The Kaf hachaim (Orach Chaim 94:1:4 citing Radvaz Vol. 2; Ch. 648) rules that if a Jew was forced onto the Temple Mount and the time of prayer arrived while he’s standing between the Western Wall and the place of the Holy of Holies, "he should pray facing towards the Holy of Holies even though his back will be facing the Western Wall." as all of God’s bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. According to the Mishna, of all the four walls of the Temple Mount, the Western Wall was the closest to the Holy of Holies,Middot 2:1 and therefore that to pray by the Wall is particularly beneficial. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it is understandable that all Israel's prayers ascend on high there...as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's mate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.co.il/books?id=peGw2sZVN5QC&pg=PA486&dq=kabbalistic+segulah&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uTJmT_iDEsnS0QWdgc2wCA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=segulah&f=false |page=486 |last=Kiel |first=Dvora |title=When the Time is Right: Manifestations of Divine Providence in everyday life |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |year=2007 |isbn= 965-7371-29-5[/tpl] This practice was apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.[tpl]cite web |url=http://westernwallprayers.org/aboutwwp/originofthe40days.html |title=Origin of the 40 Days |year=2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |publisher=westernwallprayers.org[/tpl]
According to some, by Late Antiquity the privileged site of Jewish prayer in Jerusalem was located on the Mount of Olives and only towards the end of the Middle Ages did Jews gradually begin to congregate instead at the Western Wall for their prayers, authorized to do so by the waqf authorities.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, Fayard, Paris, 2002 vol.2 p.157 Indeed, most historians believe that the Western Wall became a popular prayer area only after the Ottoman conquest of Jerusalem in 1517. There are, however, recorded instances of the wall being used as a place of prayer before the Ottoman period. The Scroll of Ahimaaz, a historical document written in 1050 CE, distinctly describes the Western Wall as a place of prayer for the Jews. In around 1167 CE during the late Crusader Period, Benjamin of Tudela wrote that "In front of this place is the Western Wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court".Adler N. M. (1927) The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela London; pages 222–223. In 1334, Jewish traveller Isaac Chelo wrote: "It is this Western Wall which stands before the temple of Omar ibn al Khattab, and which is called the Gate of Mercy. The Jews resort thither to say their prayers, as Rabbi Benjamin has already related. Today, this wall is one of the seven wonders of the Holy City."[ref]
</ref> In 1625 "arranged prayers" at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.<ref name="report1930"/> Scrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity, as testified to in a narrative written by Rabbi Gedaliah of Semitizi who went to Jerusalem in 1699.
