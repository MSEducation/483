==1980 presidential primary debate==

The paper received national attention during the 1980 New Hampshire presidential primary, when it hosted a Republican debate paid for by the campaign of former California Governor Ronald Reagan. During a discussion over which candidates should be allowed to participate, Telegraph editor Jon Breen, acting as moderator, told the soundman to turn off Reagan's microphone. Reagan's response of "I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green," sic was wildly applauded by the audience and even his fellow Republican primary opponents, none of whom noted that he got the moderator's name wrong.

Reagan later recounted the incident as a "brief and seemingly small event, one lasting only a few seconds," that he said he thought, "helped take me to the White House." He continues:
After arriving at the debate, he found two chairs - one each for Bush and Reagan. The other candidates were confused, as was the audience.
