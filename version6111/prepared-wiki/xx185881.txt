[[ARFRP1]]

ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARFRP1 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schurmann A, Massmann S, Joost HG | title = ARP is a plasma membrane-associated Ras-related GTPase with remote similarity to the family of ADP-ribosylation factors | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 270 | issue = 51 | pages = 30657–63 |date=Jan 1996 | pmid = 8530503 | pmc =  | doi =10.1074/jbc.270.51.30657  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ARFRP1 ADP-ribosylation factor related protein 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10139| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane-associated GTP-ase and localizes to the plasma membrane.  It is related to the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and ARF-like (ARL) genes. The gene is located in a gene cluster that includes the a gene (M68) that is overexpressed in some tumors.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ARFRP1 ADP-ribosylation factor related protein 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10139| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Interactions==

ARFRP1 has been shown to interact with PSCD1.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schürmann A, Schmidt M, Asmus M, Bayer S, Fliegert F, Koling S, Massmann S, Schilf C, Subauste MC, Voss M, Jakobs KH, Joost HG | title = The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-related GTPase ARF-related protein binds to the ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin and inhibits the ARF-dependent activation of phospholipase D | journal = J.
