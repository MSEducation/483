==The fire==

At approximately 4:30 am local time,[tpl]cite news|last= Dron|first= Alan|title= Fire breaks out at Nairobi airport|url=  http://atwonline.com/airports-amp-routes/fire-breaks-out-nairobi-airport|newspaper= Air Transport World|date=[tpl]Date|2013-8-7[/tpl]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Ilj8aF9Q|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2013-8-10[/tpl][/tpl] a fire originating in the immigration section of Unit I (used for international departures) started and rapidly spread to adjoining Unit II, which is used for international arrivals. The construction of the building (it was completed in 1978), a roof collapse in Unit I, and heavy traffic in the area hindered initial efforts to extinguish the blaze. Initial media reports showed some firefighters using buckets to fight the fire.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000090374&story_title=delayed-response-to-jkia-inferno-exposes-kenya-s-soft-underbelly | title=Delayed response to JKIA inferno exposes Kenyaâ€™s soft underbelly | date=2013-08-07 | accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] Several groups, including the Kenya Army and firefighters from private companies, assisted in fighting the fire. After six hours, on-scene officials indicated that the fire had been contained.
After the fire had been extinguished, businesses affected by the fire reported that items were missing from their businesses. Various reports indicated that first responders had looted fire-damaged businesses during and after the fire, leading some to believe that the fire could have been put out sooner had all the firefighters kept their focus on extinguishing the blaze.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-kenya-airport-fire-20130808,0,4491052.story | title=In Nairobi's airport fire, looting and big tourism losses for Kenya | date=2013-08-08 | accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] Tourists who were displaced by the fire also reported that they were assaulted by thugs who blocked access to the main gate, where the tourists were attempting to retrieve their belongings.

==Victims==

A spokesman for Kenya Airways, the primary tenant at the airport, indicated that two of its employees had been transported to a local hospital for observation. One of the individuals was treated for smoke inhalation. There were no immediate reports of injuries to firefighting personnel or other airport employees.[tpl]cite news|last= O'Keeffe|first= Niall|title= Fire closes Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/fire-closes-nairobis-jomo-kenyatta-airport-389229/|newspaper= Flightglobal|date= [tpl]Date|2013-8-7[/tpl]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6IiZkS9JU|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2013-8-8[/tpl]|location= London[/tpl]

==Investigation==

After the fire was extinguished, a preliminary investigation was started. Possible terrorism was an initial concern because the fire occurred on the fifteenth anniversary of the terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania plus the fact that Kenya has been involved in an armed conflict with Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia. Investigators, however, soon ruled out terrorism as the cause of the fire.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000090537&story_title=uhuru-dismisses-any-acts-of-terrorism-in-jkia-fire | title=President Uhuru Kenyatta dismisses any acts of terrorism in Jomo Kenyatta International Airport fire | date=2013-08-09 | accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

The international arrival and departure units were completely destroyed in the fire. Airport officials have elected to use Unit III (used for domestic arrivals and departures) to handle some international traffic.
