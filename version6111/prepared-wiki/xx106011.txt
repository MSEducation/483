Parker Pearson became interested in Marxism, the socio-economic and political theory developed in the mid-19th century by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In the 1984 anthology Ideology, Power and Prehistory, edited by Daniel Miller and Christopher Tilley, Parker Pearson published a paper in which he examined the pre-state societies of Jutland from a Marxist perspective. At the start of this paper, he noted that it had repurcussions for Marxism in that its findings discerned "a certain blurring between capitalism and non-capitalism."Parker Pearson 1984. p. 69. He obtained his PhD from King's College, University of Cambridge in 1985, for a thesis which he had titled "Death, society and social change: the Iron Age of southern Jutland 200 BC - 600 AD" in which he discussed what was known about the bog bodies of Denmark; it would remain unpublished.Parker Pearson 1999. p. 234.
