[[Xenarthra]]

CATEGORIES: Xenarthrans

The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals (infraclass Eutheria), extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America.O'Leary, M. A., Bloch, J. I., Flynn, J. J., Gaudin, T. J., Giallombardo, A., Giannini, N. P., ... & Cirranello, A. L. (2013). The placental mammal ancestor and the post–K-Pg radiation of placentals. Science, 339(6120), 662-667. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation. They invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, they spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10914-010-9144-8 |title=The Great American Biotic Interchange: Dispersals, Tectonics, Climate, Sea Level and Holding Pens |year=2010 |last1=Woodburne |first1=Michael O. |journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=245–264 |pmid=21125025 |pmc=2987556[/tpl] Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.
Xenarthrans share several characteristics not present in other placental mammals. The name Xenarthra, which means "strange joints", was chosen because their vertebral joints have extra articulations and are unlike those of any other mammals — a character referred to as "xenarthry" — and ischiosacral fusion.[ref]
