[[Lebesgue measure]]

CATEGORIES: Measures (measure theory)

In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For n = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n''-dimensional volume''', n-volume', or simply volume.The term volume is also used, more strictly, as a synonym of 3-dimensional volume It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue measurable set A is denoted by λ(A).
Henri Lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901, followed the next year by his description of the Lebesgue integral. Both were published as part of his dissertation in 1902.[tpl]cite journal |author=Henri Lebesgue |title=Intégrale, longueur, aire |year=1902 |publisher=Université de Paris [/tpl]
The Lebesgue measure is often denoted dx, but this should not be confused with the distinct notion of a volume form.

==Properties==

The Lebesgue measure on Rn has the following properties:
All the above may be succinctly summarized as follows: 
The Lebesgue measure also has the property of being σ-finite.

==Null sets==

A subset of Rn is a null set if, for every ε > 0, it can be covered with countably many products of n intervals whose total volume is at most ε. All countable sets are null sets.
If a subset of Rn has Hausdorff dimension less than n then it is a  null set with respect to n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.  Here Hausdorff dimension is relative to the Euclidean metric on Rn (or any metric Lipschitz[tpl]dn|date=May 2012[/tpl] equivalent to it). On the other hand a set may have topological dimension less than n and have positive n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.  An example of this is the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set which has topological dimension 0 yet has positive 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

==Construction of the Lebesgue measure==

The modern construction of the Lebesgue measure is an application of Carathéodory's extension theorem. It proceeds as follows.
Fix [tpl]nowrap|n ∈ N[/tpl]. A box in Rn is a set of the form
where [tpl]nowrap|bi ≥ ai[/tpl], and the product symbol here represents a Cartesian product. The volume of this box is defined to be
For any subset A of Rn, we can define its outer measure λ*(A) by:
We then define the set A to be Lebesgue measurable if for every subset S of Rn,
These Lebesgue measurable sets form a σ-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by [tpl]nowrap|λ(A) [tpl]=[/tpl] λ*(A)[/tpl] for any Lebesgue measurable set A.
The existence of sets that are not Lebesgue measurable is a consequence of a certain set-theoretical axiom, the axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory.  The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of R that are not Lebesgue measurable.  Assuming the axiom of choice, non-measurable sets  with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach–Tarski paradox.
In 1970, Robert M. Solovay showed that the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue measurable is not provable within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in the absence of the axiom of choice (see Solovay's model).[tpl]Cite journal |last=Solovay |first=Robert M. |title=A model of set-theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable |journal=Annals of Mathematics |jstor=1970696 |series=Second Series |volume=92 |year=1970 |issue=1 |pages=1–56 |doi=10.2307/1970696 [/tpl]

==Relation to other measures==

The Borel measure agrees with the Lebesgue measure on those sets for which it is defined; however, there are many more Lebesgue-measurable sets than there are Borel measurable sets. The Borel measure is translation-invariant, but not complete.
The Haar measure can be defined on any locally compact group and is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (Rn with addition is a locally compact group).
The Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure that is useful for measuring the subsets of Rn of lower dimensions than n, like submanifolds, for example, surfaces or curves in R³ and fractal sets. The Hausdorff measure is not to be confused with the notion of Hausdorff dimension.
It can be shown that there is no infinite-dimensional analogue of Lebesgue measure.
