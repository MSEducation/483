Although it was also the place of death for former Major League Baseball pitcher Eric Show, it was best known between 1908 and 1914 as the home of a delicacy known as "Clark's Pickelized Figs," a candied fruit that was sold from small firkins at grocery stores across the United States. The figs were produced at Clark Ranch by Frank and Lila Clark. The advent of World War I resulted in a sugar shortage which effectively ended the family business. The Clark Ranch remains in the family to the present day, and the original "Pickle House" is now the ranch office.
The landmark Dulzura Schoolhouse was a one-room fixture in the community from the 1900s until it was closed in the 1950s.
The ZIP Code is 91917 and the community is inside area code 619. The community is largely rural and has a population of only about 700 people.
