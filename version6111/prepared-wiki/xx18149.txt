The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has formed the core part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict.
Despite the long going peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. The remaining key issues are: mutual recognition, borders, security, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/name-anmo/peace_process-processus_paix/canadian_policy-politique_canadienne.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canadian Policy on Key Issues in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |publisher=Government of Canada[/tpl] Palestinian freedom of movement,[tpl]cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf |title=Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency in the Palestinian Economy|publisher=World Bank |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=29 March 2010 |quote=Currently, freedom of movement and access for Palestinians within the West Bank is the exception rather than the norm contrary to the commitments undertaken in a number of Agreements between GOI and the PA.

The violence resulting from the conflict has prompted international actions, as well as other security and human rights concerns, both within and between both sides, and internationally.  In addition, the violence has curbed expansion of tourism in the region, which is full of historic and religious sites that are of interest to many people around the world.
Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside an independent Jewish state or next to the State of Israel (after Israel's establishment in 1948). In 2007, a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.[tpl]cite web|last=Yaar|first=Ephraim|last2=Hermann|first2=Tamar|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/933214.htm|title=Just another forgotten peace summit|work=Haaretz|date=11 December 2007|ref=harv[/tpl] Moreover, a considerable majority of the Jewish public sees the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state.[tpl]cite book | last=Kurtzer | first=Daniel | last2=Lasensky | first2=Scott | author3=Organization | title=Negotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: American Leadership in the Middle East | year=2008 | publisher=United States Institute of Peace Press | isbn=9781601270306 | page=79[/tpl] A majority of Palestinians and Israelis view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an acceptable location of the hypothetical Palestinian state in a two-state solution.Dershowitz, Alan. The Case for Peace: How the Arab-Israeli Conflict Can Be Resolved. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005[tpl]verify credibility|date=June 2012[/tpl] However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments.[tpl]harvnb|Yaar|Hermann|2007[/tpl]: "The source of the Jewish public's skepticism – and even pessimism – is apparently the widespread belief that a peace agreement based on the 'two states for two peoples' formula would not lead the Palestinians to end their conflict with Israel."
Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the level of violence witnessed for virtually its entire duration. Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals. Casualties have not been restricted to the military, with a large number of fatalities in civilian population on both sides. There are prominent international actors involved in the conflict.
The two parties engaged in direct negotiation are the Israeli government, currently led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), currently headed by Mahmoud Abbas. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the Quartet on the Middle East (the Quartet) represented by a special envoy that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Arab League is another important actor, which has proposed an alternative peace plan. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has historically been a key participant.
Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by conflict between the two major factions: Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, Hamas. After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006 the US, EU, and Israel refused to recognize its government and much of the funding to the Palestinian National Authority was suspended. A year later, following Hamas' seizure of power in the Gaza Strip in June 2007, the territory officially recognized as the State of Palestine (former Palestinian National Authority – the Palestinian interim governing body) is split between Fatah in the West Bank, and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The division of governance between the parties has effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the Palestinian National Authority (PA). The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 and are currently ongoing.

==Background==

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements among the Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining sovereignty for their people in the Middle East. The collision between those two forces in southern Levant and the emergence of Palestinian nationalism in the 1920s eventually escalated into the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 1947, and expanded into the wider Arab-Israeli conflict later on.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pdf/promiese/promises-timeline.pdf | title=History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict | publisher=PBS | date=December 2001 | accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl]
With the outcome of the First World War, the relations between Zionism and the Arab national movement seemed to be potentially friendly, and the Faisal–Weizmann Agreement created a framework for both aspirations to coexist on former Ottoman Empire's territories. However, with the defeat and dissolution of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in July 1920 following the Franco-Syrian War, a crisis fell upon the Damascus-based Arab national movement. The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under the emerging leadership of Haj Amin al-Husseini, from Damascus to Mandatory Palestine marked the beginning of Palestinian Arab nationalist struggle towards establishment of a national home for Arabs of Palestine.[tpl]cite book | editor-last=Sela | editor-first=Avraham | editor-link=Avraham Sela | chapter=Palestine Arabs | title=The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East | location=New York | year=2002 | publisher=Continuum | isbn=9780826414137 | pages=664–673 | ref=harv[/tpl] Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian Arab national movement, immediately marked Jewish national movement and Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|p=361|loc="al-Husseini, Hajj (Muhammad) Amin"[/tpl] "He Husseini incited and headed anti-Jewish riots in April 1920...He promoted the Muslim character of Jerusalem and ... injected a religious character into the struggle against Zionism. This was the backdrop to his agitation concerning Jewish rights at the Western (Wailing) Wall that led to the bloody riots of August 1929...He was the chief organizer of the riots of 1936 and the rebellion from 1937, as well as of the mounting internal terror against Arab opponents."  initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was the establishment of Jewish paramilitary force of Haganah. In 1929, a series of violent anti-Jewish riots was initiated by the Arab leadership. The riots resulted in massive Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.
In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, most notably Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936 Arab revolt. Following, the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, the tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence and the bloody revolt against the British and the Jews. In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, much of the Arab gangs were defeated by the British and a forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership was performed. The revolt led to the establishment of the Peel Commission towards partitioning of Palestine, though was subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted the recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders did not like it.[tpl]cite book | last=Louis | first=William Roger | title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization | year=2006 | publisher=I.B.Tauris | isbn=9781845113476 | page=391[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Morris | first=Benny | authorlink=Benny Morris | title=One State, Two States: Resolving the Israel/Palestine Conflict | year=2009 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0300156049 | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/One_State_Two_States.html?id=6RelhRR-9RUC | page=66[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Morris | first=Benny | title=The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited | year=2004 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521009676 | page=48[/tpl]
The renewed violence, which had sporadically lasted until the beginning of WWII, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards more a moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs, under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini however tended to cooperation with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. Defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded the Italians and the Germans to bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and the Palestinian Arab leadership. Immigration quotas were established by the British, while on the other hand illegal immigration and Zionist insurgency against the British was increasing.
On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II)[tpl]cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |publisher=United Nations |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28[/tpl] recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem.Baum, Noa. "Historical Time Line for Israel/Palestine." UMass Amherst. 5 April 2005. 14 March 2013. On the next day, Palestine was already swept by violence, with Arab and Jewish militias executing attacks. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating.[tpl]cite book | last=Morris | first=Benny | title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war | year=2008 | publisher=Yale University Press | page=79[/tpl] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi, strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs. Popular support for the Palestinian Arabs throughout the Arab world led to sporadic violence against Jewish communities of Middle East and North Africa, creating an opposite refugee wave.

==History==

Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.
Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then was put under the authority of Egyptian military administrator, making it a de-facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat. It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.
The 1967 Six Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as Israel gained authority of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, most notably the Battle of Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the Jordanian-Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".
Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. Israeli forces, however, quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed. In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the 1982 Lebanon War commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision. However, Israeli intervention in the civil war also led to unforeseen results, including small-scale conflict between Israel and Syria. By 1985, Israel withdrew to a 10 km occupied strip of South Lebanon, while the low-intensity conflict with Shia militants escalated.[tpl]citation needed span|text= Those Iranian-supported Shia groups gradually consolidated into Hizbullah and Amal, operated against Israel, and allied with the remnants of Palestinian organizations to launch attacks on Galilee through the late 1980s. By the 1990s, Palestinian organizations in Lebanon were largely inactive.|date=March 2013[/tpl]
The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s, international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the success of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority. The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime-Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli fanatic who objected to the policy of the government. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.
Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada on September 2000. The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian Authority security forces and the IDF, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to nearly 6,000 fatalities. Following the uprising, Israeli Prime-Minister Sharon decided upon the Gaza disengagement plan, implemented in 2005, removing Israeli settlers, though not releasing the territory from Israeli occupation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory?|last=Levs|first=Josh|date=2009-01-06|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-05-30[/tpl] One year later the Hamas party took power in Palestinian elections, while Israel responded it would not continue any peace negotiations as long as Hamas is taking part in the Palestinian government. Clashes between Israel and Hamas in 2006 led Israel to impose a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border. After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full control of the area.[tpl]cite book | last=Oren | first=Michael B. | authorlink=Michael Oren | title=Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present | year=2007 | publisher=W.

By February 2009, a cease-fire was signed with international mediation between the parties, though small and sporadic eruptions of violence continued.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/gazafacts|title=Operation Cast Lead – Gaza Facts | publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs | accessdate=19 March 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130421124821/http://www.mfa.gov.il/gazafacts | archivedate=21 April 2013[/tpl]http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Gazaincursion.html "Operation Cast Lead: Overview."] Jewish Virtual Library. 2013. 19 March 2013.

==Peace process==

===Oslo Accords (1993)===

In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts, the process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and finally unraveled when Arafat and Ehud Barak failed to reach agreement at Camp David in July 2000. Robert Malley, special assistant to US President Bill Clinton for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat "the Palestinians’ principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own".Malley, Robert and Hussein Agha. "Camp David: The Tragedy of Errors." The New York Review of Books. 9 August 2001. Consequently, there are different accounts of the proposals considered.de Jong, Jan and Philippe Rekacewicz.

===Camp David Summit (2000)===

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as 'bases for negotiation', via the U.S. to the Palestinian President; a non militarized Palestinian state split into 3-4 parts containing 87-92%Three factors made Israel’s territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man’s Land (50 sq. km near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 sq. km), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 sq. km), which reduces the total to 5,538 sq. km. Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538 sq. km) of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective.

"Camp David and After: An Exchange (1. An Interview with Ehud Barak)." The New York Review of Books.  13 June 2002.  1 June 2012.

The offer also included that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no soveignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley.http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2001/aug/09/camp-david-the-tragedy-of-errors/?page=4Jeremy Pressman, International Security, vol 28, no. 2, Fall 2003, "Visions in Collision: What Happened at Camp David and Taba?".

===Developments following Camp David===

Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of September.
Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On  Jerusalem the plan stated that, "the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and
that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgement of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and
an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan[tpl]cite web|title=EXCERPTS: STATE DEPT.

===Taba Summit (2001)===

The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt in January 2001.  The proposition removed the "temporarily Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections." The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon’s new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.

===Road Map for Peace===

One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, which called for a halt to Israeli settlement construction and a halt to Israeli and Palestinian violence, none of which was achieved.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Arab Peace Initiative===

[tpl]citation needed span|text= The Arab Peace Initiative ([tpl]lang-ar|مبادرة السلام العربية[/tpl] Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah) was first proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in the Beirut Summit. The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular.|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out "final-solution" borders based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian refugees."The Saudi Arabia peace initiative." Ynetnews.  23 March 2009.  21 September 2010.
A number of Israeli officials have responded to the initiative with both support and criticism. The Israeli government has expressed reservations on 'red line,' issues such as the Palestinian refugee problem, homeland security concerns, and the nature of Jerusalem."Response of FM Peres to the decisions of the Arab Summit in Beirut.".  Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  28 March 2002. However, the Arab League continues to raise it as a possible solution, and meetings between the Arab League and Israel have been held."Arab leaders relaunch peace plan." BBC News 28 March 2007.

===Present status===

The peace process has been predicated on a "two-state solution" thus far, but questions have been raised towards both sides' resolve to end the dispute.Palestinian Chief Negotiator, Saeb Erekat, on Israel’s Legal Obligations, by Richard Horowitz, World Policy Review, June 18, 2013  An article by S. Daniel Abraham, an American entrepreneur and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace in Washington, US, published on the website of the Atlantic magazine in March 2013, cited the following statistics: "Right now, the total number of Jews and Arabs living ... in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza is just under 12 million people. At the moment, a shade under 50 percent of the population is Jewish."[tpl]cite web|title=Israel's Dreaded Tipping Point Has Finally Arrived|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/israels-dreaded-tipping-point-has-finally-arrived/273830/|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=10 March 2013|author=S.

====Israel's settlement policy====

Israel has had its settlement growth and policies in the Palestinian territories harshly criticized by the European Union citing it as increasingly undermining the viability of the two-state solution and running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume negotiations.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/18/eu-report-israeli-settlement-growth | title=EU report calls for action over Israeli settlement growth | publisher=The Guardian | date=18 January 2012 | accessdate=11 February 2012 | author=Harriet Sherwood | location=London[/tpl][ref]See the following:

====Israeli use of military force in the occupation====

In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three year period of 2011-2013, Amnesty International asserted that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1 year sentence with a five month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the highest of professional standards".Crispian Balmer,'Amnesty says some Israeli West Bank killings may be war crimes,' Reuters 26 February 2014.'Trigger-happy:Israel's use of excessive force in the West Bank,' Amnesty International, February 2014 p.10.

====Palestinian incitement====

Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlement in the Palestinian territories,Gilead Sher, The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Negotiations, 1999-2001: Within Reach,Taylor & Francis, 2006 p.19. though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled significantly.Ben Sales, 'Some experts question extent of Palestinian incitement,' in The Times of Israel, 10 October 2013. Charges of incitement have been reciprocal,[ref]Jesper Svartvik,Jakob Wirén (eds.),

In Israeli usage, the term also covers failures to mention Israel's culture and history in Palestinian textbooks.Rapahael Israeli,The Oslo Idea: The Euphoria of Failure, Transaction Books, p.178.
In 2011, Israeli PM Benyamin Netanyahu stated that the incitement promulgated by the Palestinian Authority was destroying Israel’s confidence, and he condemned what he regarded as the glorification of the murderers of the Fogel family in Itamar on PA television. The perpetrator of the murders had been described as a "hero" and a "legend" by members of his family, during a weekly program.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=255695 | title=PA TV glorifies murderers of Fogel family | publisher=JPost | date=30 January 2012 | accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title='PA incitement is confidence destroying measure'|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=255633|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=29 January 2012[/tpl] This occurred shortly after the official Palestinian Authority Mufti in Jerusalem publicly read out an Islamic hadith that says killing Jews will speed up the redemption,[tpl]cite web|title=Palestinian Authority Mufti Mohammed Hussein says Muslims will kill Jews in the name of Islam|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDoV8ZL9Xkc|work=15/01/2012|publisher=Palestinian Media Watch[/tpl] which was criticised by the UK's Minister for the Middle East and North Africa as potentially stirring up "hatred and prejudice".[tpl]cite web|title=UK minister condemns 'inflammatory' words of J'lem mufti|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=254812|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl]

====Public support====

Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a two-state solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians. The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47% of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and 70% of Israelis expressing their support for an end to violence, an increase of 2% for Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=251311 | title=Support growing for two-state solution | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=28 December 2011 | accessdate=10 February 2012 | author=Lidman, Melanie[/tpl]

==Current issues in dispute==

The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a single position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include both moderate and extremist bodies as well as dovish and hawkish bodies.
One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is a deepset and growing distrust between its participants. Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hard-line political factions, coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace process. Support among Palestinians for Hamas is considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and violence remains a threat, security becomes a prime concern for many Israelis. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news-basics.com/2011/israel-and-the-palestinians/|title=Overview of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians|work=News Basics|accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]

===Jerusalem===

The border of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each side asserting claims over this city. The three largest Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—include Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives.Jerusalem is the holiest site in the world for Judaism. The two Divine Temples were built on what is called the Temple Mount, the first over three thousand years ago. Archaeological evidence has proven that the Divine Temple of the Jews was built at that time, and the second built a few centuries after its destruction. Jerusalem was the capital city of the Israeli Empire, established right before the construction of the First Temple. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest (after Mecca and Medina), where Mohammed allegedly tied his horse, el'Baruck, meaning lightning in Arabic. The Al-Aqsa Mosque was built on the Temple Mount several centuries ago. Israel controls Jerusalem today. However, Muslims are almost exclusively allowed on the Temple Mount site. Jews are rarely allowed onto the Temple Mount.  Symon, Fiona.  "Jerusalem: Crucible of the conflict."  BBC News.  4 December 2001. Israel asserts that the city should not be divided and should remain unified within Israel's political control. Palestinians claim at least the parts of the city which were not part of Israel prior to June 1967. As of 2005, there were more than 719,000 people living in Jerusalem; 465,000 were Jews (mostly living in West Jerusalem) and 232,000 were Muslims (mostly living in East Jerusalem).Zaritzky, Suzanna. "Press Release." Central Bureau of Statistics. 24 May 2006. 9 April 2006.
The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is centered in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel issued a new law stating, "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel.""Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel." Jewish Virtual Library. 9 April 2008.
At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–01, the United States proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were given to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would be jointly controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately failed.
Israel expresses concern over the security of its residents if neighborhoods of Jerusalem are placed under Palestinian control. Jerusalem has been a prime target for attacks by militant groups against civilian targets since 1967. Many Jewish neighborhoods have been fired upon from Arab areas. The proximity of the Arab areas, if these regions were to fall in the boundaries of a Palestinian state, would be so close as to threaten the safety of Jewish residents. Nadav Shragai states this idea in his study for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, "An Israeli security body that was tasked in March 2000 with examining the possibility of transferring three Arab villages just outside of Jerusalem – Abu Dis, Al Azaria, and a-Ram – to Palestinian security control, assessed at the time that: 'Terrorists will be able to exploit the short distances, sometimes involving no more than crossing a street, to cause damage to people or property. A terrorist will be able to stand on the other side of the road, shoot at an Israeli or throw a bomb, and it may be impossible to do anything about it. The road will constitute the border.' If that is the case for neighborhoods outside of Jerusalem's municipal boundaries, how much more so for Arab neighborhoods within those boundaries.

===Holy sites===

Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, no Jews were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish holy places, and the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was desecrated. Since 1975, Israel banned Muslims from worshiping at Joseph's Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. Settlers establish a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the mihrab. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and burned.Gold. The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City. Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, Inc., 2007. pp. 5–6.  Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious accidents have still occurred.Stern, Jessica.  "frontline: israel's next war?" PBS.  5 April 2005.  22 June 2010. Israel has allowed almost complete autonomy to the Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|pp=491–498|loc="Jerusalem"[/tpl]
Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and Muslim holy places under Israeli control."In general, Israeli policy towards holy places can be considered a success with regard to its primary goal: facilitating Israel’s acceptance into the international community of nations. However, the repeated failure of the Muslim Affairs Department to fulfill its mandate of protecting the Muslim holy places in Israel has been a largely forgotten chapter in Israeli history that deserves reexamination". Alisa Rubin Peled, Debating Islam in the Jewish State: The Development of Policy Toward Islamic Institutions in Israel, State University of New York Press, 2001 p.96 Additionally, some Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's collapse."Secret tunnel under Al-Aqsa Mosque exposed." Al Arabiya.  27 March 2008. The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied this claim in a 1996 speech to the United Nations"FM Levy- Address to the UN Security Council." Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  27 September 1997. and characterized the statement as "escalation of rhetoric."[ref]

However, according to reports of private peace negotiations with Israel they have countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees and their families to Israel as part of a peace settlement.

Shlaim (2000) states that from April 1948 the military forces of what was to become Israel had embarked on a new offensive strategy which involved destroying Arab villages and the forced removal of civilians.

===Israeli security concerns===

Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for Israelis.  Israel, along with the United States"Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006." Global Legal Information Network.  26 December 2006.  30 May 2009. and the European Union,  refer to the violence against Israeli civilians and military forces by Palestinian militants as terrorism.  The motivations behind Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians are multiplex, and not all violent Palestinian groups agree with each other on specifics, however a common motive is to eliminate the Jewish state and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Terrorism"|pp=822–36[/tpl] The most prominent Islamist groups, such as Hamas, view the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a religious jihad.
Suicide bombing is used as a tactic among Palestinian organizations like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and certain suicide attacks have received support among Palestinians as high as 84%.Palestinian Public Opinion Poll No (27), PSR – Survey Research Unit, March 24, 2008[tpl]cite news|last=Asser|first=Martin|title=Palestinian support for suicide bombers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2072851.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 June 2002|date=28 June 2002[/tpl]  In Israel, Palestinian suicide bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls, hotels and marketplaces."Analysis: Palestinian suicide attacks." BBC News.  29 January 2007. From 1993–2003, 303 Palestinian suicide bombers attacked Israel."Profile of Suicide Bombings." Jewish Virtual Library.
The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July 2003. Israel's coalition government approved the security barrier in the northern part of the green-line between Israel and the West Bank. Since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts have declined by more than 90%.Bard.  "Israel’s Security Fence." Jewish Virtual Library.  8 July 2010.
Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from the Palestinian Territories into Israel is also of great concern for Israeli defense officials.Harel, Amos.  "Defense officials concerned as Hamas upgrades Qassam arsenal." Haaretz.  7 December 2007.  30 March 2009. In 2006—the year following Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government recorded 1,726 such launches, more than four times the total rockets fired in 2005.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Victims+of+Palestinian+Violence+and+Terrorism+sinc.htm | title = Victims of Palestinian Violence and Terrorism since September 2000 | publisher = Israeli Ministry of Internal Affairs | accessdate =10 April 2007[/tpl] As of January 2009, over 8,600 rockets had been launched,"Q&A: Gaza conflict."

"Playing cat and mouse with Gaza rockets." BBC News.  28 February 2008. Over 500 rockets and mortars hit Israel in January–September 2010 and over 1,947 rockets hit Israel in January–November 2012.
According to a study conducted by University of Haifa, one in five Israelis have lost a relative or friend in a Palestinian terrorist attack."One in Five Israelis Has Lost Someone To War or Terror." Jewish Virtual Library.  7 July 2005.
There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country's security concerns.  Options have included military action (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security barriers.  The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have been called into question by various commentators.[tpl]verify credibility|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/oct/14/our-man-palestine/|title=Our Man in Palestine |author=Nathan Thrall |publisher=The New York Review of Books |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2010[/tpl]

===Palestinian violence outside of Israel===

Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against Israel. Many foreigners, including Americans"Terror Blast Kills 7, Including 5 Americans, at Jerusalem University." Fox News.  1 August 2002. and Europeans,Reeves, Phil.  "Mystery surrounds 'suicide' of Abu Nidal, once a ruthless killer and face of terror." The Independent.  20 August 2002. have been killed and injured by Palestinian militants.  At least 53 Americans have been killed and 83 injured by Palestinian violence since the signing of the Oslo Accords.Taillandier, Caroline, et al, eds.  "American Victims of Mideast Terrorist Attacks." Jewish Virtual Library.[tpl]Verify credibility|date=June 2012[/tpl]
During the late 1960s, the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use of international terror. In 1969 alone, the PLO was responsible for hijacking 82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking target."Attempt to carry explosives device on El Al flight foiled." Jerusalem Post.  28 September 2010.Encyclopedia of the developing world, Volume 3 pg. 1228 The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a hostage-rescue mission, where Israeli special forces successfully rescued the majority of the hostages.
However, one of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was the capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympic Games.Encyclopedia of the developing world, Volume 3. M. Leonard, Thomas

===Israeli violence outside of Palestine===

Israeli forces have launched attacks against Palestinians around the globe as part of the conflict. Israel has assassinated dozens of Palestinians and their supporters outside of Palestine, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. Israel has also bombed Palestinian targets in many[tpl]how many?|date=February 2014[/tpl] nations such as Syria and Lebanon, including the bombing of the PLO Headquarters in Tunisia, killing several hundred.

===Palestinian violence against other Palestinians===

Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian baathists broke from the Palestine Liberation Organization and allied with the Shia Amal Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that killed thousands of Palestinians.Syria A Country Study, Federal Research DivisionShiloaḥ le-ḥeḳer ha-Mizraḥ ha-tikhon ṿe-Afriḳah, Mekhon.  Middle East contemporary survey, Volume 11.  Google Books.
In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack down on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators. The Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.Taylor, Catherine.  "How Israel builds its fifth column." The Christian Science Monitor.  22 May 2002.
The policies towards suspected collaborators contravene agreements signed by the Palestinian leadership. Article XVI(2) of the Oslo II Agreement states:"THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT." Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  28 September 1995.
 "Palestinians who have maintained contact with the Israeli authorities will not be subjected to acts of harassment, violence, retribution, or prosecution." 
The provision was designed to prevent Palestinian leaders from imposing retribution on fellow Palestinians who had worked on behalf of Israel during the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip."Palestinian Authority Defying the Rule of Law: Political Detainees." Jewish Virtual Library.  April 1999.
In the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials have killed and tortured thousands of Fatah members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During the Battle of Gaza, more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day period."PCHR Publishes 'Black Days in the Absence of Justice: Report on Bloody Fighting in the Gaza Strip from 7 to 14 June 2007.'"Palestinian Center for Human Rights.  9 October 2007 The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil war by some commentators. By 2007, more than 600 Palestinian people had died during the struggle between Hamas and Fatah."Over 600 Palestinians killed in internal clashes since 2006." Ynetnews.  6 June 2007.

===International status===

In the past, Israel has demanded control over border crossings between the Palestinian territories and Jordan and Egypt, and the right to set the import and export controls, asserting that Israel and the Palestinian territories are a single economic space.
In the interim agreements reached as part of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority has received control over cities (Area A) while the surrounding countryside has been placed under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli control (Area C). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous.  The areas have changed over time because of subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts. Because of increased Palestinian violence[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] to occupation this plan is in abeyance.

===Water resources===

In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.532703 Haaretz 30 June 2013
While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/en/surveys/palestin/water.pdf |title=Till the Last Drop: The Palestinian Water Crisis in the West Bank, Hydrogeology and Hydropolitics of a Regional Conflict |accessdate=29 November 2008 |work= |author=Messerschmid, Clemens |year=2002 [/tpl]
In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain "existing quantities of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee.Annex III: Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs, Article 40 and SCHEDULE 8. On the Knesset website Many Palestinians counter that the Oslo II agreement was intended to be a temporary resolution and that it was not intended to remain in effect more than a decade later.
In 1999, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it continued to honor its obligations under the Interim Agreement."The Water Issue in the West Bank and Gaza." Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. June 1999. The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.[tpl]cite news|title=Water war leaves Palestinians thirsty|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2982730.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=16 June 2003[/tpl]
According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/israel/index.stm |title=Israel |year=2008 |work=Aquastat |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=25 February 2013[/tpl]
A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Maxwell Gaylard, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: “Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school”. Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza’s population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.[tpl]cite web|title=Lack of sufficient services in Gaza could get worse without urgent action, UN warns|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42751#.UP35DaF4YZc|work=UN News Centre|publisher=UN Publications|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=27 August 2012[/tpl]

====Future and financing====

Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities.  It is estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn[tpl]clarify|date=October 2010[/tpl] is needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.[ref]
</ref>
In order to support and improve the water sector in the Palestinian territories, a number of bilateral and multilateral agencies have been supporting many different water and sanitation programs.
There are three large seawater desalination plants in Israel and two more scheduled to open before 2014. When the fourth plant becomes operational, 65% of Israel's water will come from desalination plants, according to Minister of Finance Dr. Yuval Steinitz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/IsraeliEconomy/Economic_News/Desalination_plant_Sorek_23-May-2011.htm|title=One of the biggest desalination plants to be built in Sorek[/tpl]
In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA’s 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face."

===Israeli military occupation of the West Bank===

Occupied Palestinian Territory is the term used by the United Nations to refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYREP,PSE,4562d8cf2,4917ee8b2,0.html|title=Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem : report of the Secretary-General|date=5 November 2008|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=16 April 2009[/tpl] and the Gaza Strip—territories which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, having formerly been controlled by Egypt and Jordan."Disputed Territories—Forgotten Facts About the ..." Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  1 February 2003.  11 October 2010. The Israeli government uses the term Disputed Territories, to argue that some territories cannot be called occupied as no nation had clear rights to them and there was no operative diplomatic arrangement when Israel acquired them in June 1967. The area is still referred to as Judea and Samaria by some Israeli groups, based on the historical regional names from ancient times.
In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem."Israel & the Palestinians: Key Maps." BBC News.  10 April 2007. Israel has never annexed the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United Nations has demanded the "termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See Interpretations.
It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At Camp David, for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State. The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two or three areas, followed by: an of increase of 86-91% of the West Bank after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most settlements.Jeremy Pressman, International Security, vol 28, no. 2, Fall 2003, "Visions in Collision: What Happened at Camp David and Taba?". On http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/322/visions_in_collision.html. See pp. 7, 15-19 Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a counter-offer.
A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was similarly rejected with 52 objections.Shamir, Shimon.  "The Camp David Summit - What Went Wrong?: Americans, Israelis, And ...." Google Books.  17 December 2012."Arafat leads, misery follows." Chicago Tribune.  6 June 2001.  2 June 2012.Reich, Walter.  "Arafat Speaks Out of Both Sides of His Mouth." Los Angeles Times.  7 December 2001.  2 June 2012."Arafat at root of ongoing problem." AJC.  2 June 2012. The Arab League has agreed to the principle of minor and mutually agreed land-swaps as part of a negotiated two state settlement based on June 1967 borders.Somfalvi, Attila.  "Livni on Arab initiative: They realized border must change." Ynetnews.  30 April 2013.  30 April 2013. Official U.S. policy also reflects the ideal of using the 1967 borders as a basis for an eventual peace agreement.Benhorin, Yitzhak.  "Arabs soften stance on Israel's final borders." Ynetnews.  30 April 2013.  30 April 2013.[tpl]cite news|title=Arab states back Israel-Palestine land swaps|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/04/20134306544952976.html|accessdate=2013-04-30|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=2013-04-30[/tpl]
Some Palestinians claim they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion.[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|loc=Eran, Oded. "Arab-Israel Peacemaking" | pp=121–147[/tpl] Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute, and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be.  Other Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, have in the past insisted that Palestinians must control not only the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, but also all of Israel proper. For this reason, Hamas has viewed the peace process "as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable".[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Hamas"|pp=335–342[/tpl] "The PLO's agreement to support the participation of a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Madrid Peace Conferences in late October 1991 further fueled the tension between Fatah and Hamas, which embarked on an intensive campaign against the very idea of territorial compromise and peacemaking with the Jews, as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable" (339). 

===Israeli settlements in the West Bank===

According to DEMA, "In the years following the Six-Day War, and especially in the 1990s during the peace process, Israel re-established communities destroyed in 1929 and 1948 as well as established numerous new settlements in the West Bank.""Palestinian-Israeli Conflict." PDF. These settlements are, as of 2009, home to about 301,000 people.Garcia-Navarro, Lourdes.  "Israeli Military Order Targets West Bank 'Infiltrators.'" NPR.  11 May 2010.  13 October 2010. DEMA added, "Most of the settlements are in the western parts of the West Bank, while others are deep into Palestinian territory, overlooking Palestinian cities.  These settlements have been the site of much inter-communal conflict." The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, until 2005, the Gaza Strip, have been described by the UK"House of Commons – International Development – Second Report." United Kingdom Parliament.  2004. and the WEU"The Middle East and security in Europe." Assembly of WEU.  15 May 2001. as an obstacle to the peace process.  The United Nations and the European Union have also called the settlements "illegal under international law.""SC/6332 : ISRAEL SHOULD RESCIND DECISION TO BUILD SETTLEMENT IN EAST JERUSALEM, SAY SPEAKERS IN SECURITY COUNCIL." United Nations.  6 March 1997."EU-Settlements' Watch." 1 February  – 31 July 2002.  p. 1.  PDF.
However, Israel disputes this;"Israel confirms settlement growth." BBC News.  21 March 2005. several scholars and commentators disagree with the assessment that settlements are illegal, citing in 2005 recent historical trends to back up their argument.Ettinger, Yoram.  "Six reasons to settle." Ynetnews.  18 June 2005.Bard.  "Myths & Facts – Settlements." Jewish Virtual Library. 9 July 2007.Dershowitz. The Case for Israel.  Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003. pp. 176–177 Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242.Jacob, Aaron. "Historical, Legal, and Political Aspects of Israeli Settlement Policy." American Jewish Committee. 18 June 2009.  13 October 2010. On a practical level, some objections voiced by Palestinians are that settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to security considerations.
In 2005, Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, a proposal put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, was enacted. All residents of Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip were evacuated, and all residential buildings were demolished."Disengagement – August 2005." Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  15 August 2005.
Various mediators and various proposed agreements have shown some degree of openness to Israel retaining some fraction of the settlements which currently exist in the West Bank; this openness is based on a variety of considerations, such as, the desire to find real compromise between Israeli and Palestinian territorial claims.[ref]
Israel's position that it needs to retain some West Bank land and settlements as a buffer in case of future aggression,Gold.  "'What Happened to Secure Borders for Israel? The U.S., Israel, and the Strategic Jordan Valley' by Dore Gold." Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs.  23 June 2000. and Israel's position that some settlements are legitimate, as they took shape when there was no operative diplomatic arrangement, and thus they did not violate any agreement."Israeli Settlements and International Law."

"From 'Occupied Territories' to 'Disputed Territories,' by Dore Gold." Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs.  16 January 2002.  29 September 2005.
Former US President George W. Bush has stated that he does not expect Israel to return entirely to the 1949 armistice lines because of "new realities on the ground.""Israel 'to keep some settlements.'" BBC News.  12 April 2005. One of the main compromise plans put forth by the Clinton Administration would have allowed Israel to keep some settlements in the West Bank, especially those which were in large blocs near the pre-1967 borders of Israel. In return, Palestinians would have received some concessions of land in other parts of the country. The current US administration views a complete freeze of construction in settlements on the West Bank as a critical step toward peace. In May and June 2009, President Barack Obama said, "The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements,"Obama, Barack.  "Remarks by the President at Cairo University, 6–04–09." The White House.  4 June 2009.  Web.  15 October 2010. and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, stated that the President "wants to see a stop to settlements — not some settlements, not outposts, not ‘natural growth’ exceptions.”Landler, Mark and Isabel Kershner.  "Israeli Settlement Growth Must Stop, Clinton Says." The New York Times.  27 May 2009.  However, Obama has since declared that the United States will no longer press Israel to stop West Bank settlement construction as a precondition for continued peace-process negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.[tpl]cite web|last=Delaney |first=Paul |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/president-obama-abandoning-palestinian-cause |title=President Obama, West Bank Settlement Expansion and the Peace Process |publisher=Theroot.com |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]

===Gaza blockade===

The Israeli government states it is justified under international law to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons. The power to impose a naval blockade is established under customary international law and Laws of armed conflict, and a United Nations commission has ruled that Israel's security blockade is "both legal and appropriate."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=288686 |title=Court extends remand of Israelis aboard Gaza ship |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04[/tpl]"Position paper on the naval blockade on Gaza." 8 September 2010. The Military Advocate General of Israel has provided numerous reasonings for the policy:
 "The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed conflict has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in June 2007, and turned the territory under its de-facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern Israel."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mag.idf.il/592-4071-en/patzar.aspx |title=Interception of the Gaza flotilla-Legal aspects. |publisher=Mag.idf.il |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02[/tpl] According to Oxfam, because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in 2007, 95% of Gaza’s industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000 people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/downloads/oxfam_gaza_lowres.pdf |title=The Gaza Strip: A Humanitarian Implosion |accessdate=24 September 2010 |publisher=Oxfam[/tpl] By 2010, Gaza's unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.Kenyon, Peter. "As World Focuses On Gaza, Grim Lives Go On." NPR. 4 June 2010. The Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian AffairsThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  The Humanitarian Monitor. December Overview, 2011, OCHA 31 December 2011
In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli human rights organization Gisha's application to the high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.Hass, Amira. "2,279 calories per person: How Israel made sure Gaza didn't starve." Haaretz Newspaper, 17 October 2012."Israel used 'calorie count' to limit Gaza food during blockade, critics claim.""Israel set calorie limit during Gaza blockade."
Starting 7 February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the electricity it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of Israel’s High Court of Justice’s decision, which held, with respect to the amount of industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, “The clarification that we made indicates that the supply of industrial diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in the winter months of last year was comparable to the amount that the Respondents now undertake to allow into the Gaza Strip. This fact also indicates that the amount is reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip.” Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in the process of delivering fuel to the Nahal Oz fuel depot."Murder at the border." Jerusalem Post. 9 April 2008. 17 April 2008.
With regard to Israel’s plan, the Court stated that, “calls for a reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level of 13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third line, we Court were convinced that this reduction does not breach the humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the framework of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas organization that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in part, on the affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant Palestinian officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event limitations are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this capability in the past."
On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as (projects) that are under international supervision."[tpl]Cite news|publisher=Ynet news|last1=Benhorin|first1=Yitzhak|last2=Associated Press|title=Cabinet: All non-military items can enter Gaza freely|date=20 June 2010|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3907978,00.html|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod.[tpl]Cite news|last=Oster|first=Marcy|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|title=Reaction mixed to Israeli announcement on easing of Gaza blockade|date=21 June 2010|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/21/2739697/israel-announces-plan-to-ease-gaza-blockade|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl]
Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to Erdogan by telephone on March 22, 2013), the awarding of compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by Israel.

==Actions toward stabilizing the conflict==

In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing economic and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli military has removed over 120 check points in 2010 and plans on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas.

===Mutual recognition===

Beginning in 1993 with the Oslo peace process, Israel recognizes "the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people."Facts About Israel.  Jerusalem: Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2010. p. 52. In return, it was agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people.  Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a legitimate political entity.[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Arab-Israel Conflict"|pp=58–121[/tpl]Dershowitz. The Case for Israel.  p. 3.[tpl]verify credibility|date=June 2012[/tpl] Palestinians state that their ability to spread acceptance of Israel was greatly hampered by Israeli restrictions on Palestinian political freedoms, economic freedoms, civil liberties, and quality of life.
It is widely felt among Israelis that Palestinians did not in fact promote acceptance of Israel's right to exist. One of Israel's major reservations in regards to granting Palestinian sovereignty is its concern that there is not genuine public support by Palestinians for co-existence and elimination of terrorism and incitement."Hamas’ Mickey Mouse teaches children to hate and kill."

Some Palestinian groups, notably Fatah, the political party founded by PLO leaders, initially claimed they were willing to foster co-existence depending on the Palestinians being steadily given more political rights and autonomy. However, in 2010, even Fatah leaders such as Mahmoud Abbas refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state,[tpl]cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/report-abbas-reiterates-refusal-to-recognize-israel-as-jewish-state-1.234351 |title=Report: Abbas reiterates refusal to recognize Israel as 'Jewish state' |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=11 May 1949 |accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl] while the leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which is the official Fatah's military wing, publicly disclosed Fatah's "ultimate goal" to be the destruction of the Jewish state, and that Abbas would lie about recognition of Israel following "Zionist and American pressure" for "political calculations" as one of the means to achieve the aforementioned goal.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3311034,00.html | title=Fatah member: Abbas recognition of Israel political | publisher=YNet | date=4 October 2006 | accessdate=24 September 2011 | author=Klein, Aaron[/tpl] In 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, where it remains the majority party.

Israel cites past concessions—such as Israel’s disengagement from the Gaza Strip in August 2005, which did not lead to a reduction of attacks and rocket fire against Israel—as an example of the Palestinian people not accepting Israel as a state. Palestinian groups and Israeli Human Rights organizations (namely B'Tselem) have pointed out that while the military occupation in Gaza was ended, the Israeli government still retained control of Gaza's airspace, territorial water, and borders, legally making it still under Israeli control. They also say that mainly thanks to these restrictions, the Palestinian quality of life in the Gaza Strip has not improved since the Israeli withdrawal.

===Government===

The Palestinian Authority is considered corrupt by a wide variety of sources, including some Palestinians.[tpl]harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Palestinian Authority"|pp=673–679[/tpl]Bard. Will Israel Survive? New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.Massad, Joseph. "The (Anti-) Palestinian Authority." Al Ahram Weekly. 15–21 June 2006. 8 May 2008. Some Israelis argue that it provides tacit support for militants via its relationship with Hamas and other Islamic militant movements, and that therefore it is unsuitable for governing any putative Palestinian state or (especially according to the right wing of Israeli politics), even negotiating about the character of such a state. Because of that, a number of organizations, including the previously ruling Likud party, declared they would not accept a Palestinian state based on the current PA.

===Societal attitudes===

Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern to those promoting dispute resolution.
According to a May 2011 poll carried out by the Palestinian Center For Public Opinion that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following means is the best to end the occupation and lead to the establishing of an independent Palestinian state", 5.0% supported "military operations", 25.0% supported non-violent popular resistance, 32.1% favored negotiations until an agreement could be reached, 23.1% preferred holding an international conference that would impose a solution on all parties, 12.4% supported seeking a solution through the United Nations, and 2.4% otherwise. Approximately three quarters of Palestinians surveyed believed that a military escalation in the Gaza Strip would be in Israel’s interest and 18.9% said it would be in Hamas’s interest. Regarding the resumption of launching Al-Qassam missiles from Gaza into Israel, 42.5% said "strongly oppose", 27.1% "somewhat oppose", 16.0% "somewhat support", 13.8% "strongly support", and 0.2% expressed no opinion.[tpl]cite web|title=Poll No. 176|url=http://www.pcpo.ps/polls/poll176.htm|publisher=Palestinian Center For Public Opinion|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=14 May 2011[/tpl]
The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed concerns that Hamas promote incitement against and overall non-acceptance of Israel, including promotion of violence against Israel.Israel Foreign Ministry: Behind the Headlines: Hamas’ Mickey Mouse teaches children to hate and kill – Israeli Min of Foreign Affairs website. Retrieved 12 February 2007.

===Palestinian army===

The Israeli Cabinet issued a statement"Israeli Cabinet Statement on Road Map and 14 Reservations." Jewish Virtual Library. 8 April 2008. expressing that it does not wish the Palestinians to build up an army capable of offensive operations, considering that the only party against which such an army could be turned in the near future is Israel itself. However, Israel has already allowed for the creation of a Palestinian police that can conduct police operations and also carry out limited-scale warfare. Palestinians[tpl]Vague|date=April 2008[/tpl] have argued that the Israel Defense Forces, a large and modern armed force, poses a direct and pressing threat to the sovereignty of any future Palestinian state, making a defensive force for a Palestinian state a matter of necessity. To this, Israelis claim that signing a treaty while building an army is a show of bad intentions.
Since 2006, the United States has been training, equipping, and funding the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which have been cooperating with Israel at unprecedented levels in the West Bank to quell supporters of Hamas, the main Palestinian Islamist group that opposes direct negotiations with Israel. The United States government has spent over 500 million building and training the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard. The IDF maintains the US-trained forces will soon be capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and isolated Israeli communities" in the event of a conflict.Glick, Caroline B.  "Column One: Israel’s American-made foes." Jerusalem Post.  8 June 2010.

==Fatalities 1948–2011==

A variety of studies provide differing casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in conflict with each other between 1948 and 1997.Twentieth Century Atlas – Death Tolls." RCN D.C. Metro.  December 2005. Other estimations give 14,500 killed between 1948–2009."All wars in the 20th century." The Polynational War Memorial. Palestinian fatalities during the 1982 Lebanon War were 2,000 PLO combatants killed in armed conflict with Israel.White, Matthew.  "WebCite query result." WebCite.  2005.

Note: Figures includes 1,593 Palestinian fatalities attributed to intra-Palestinian violence.
Figures do not include the 600 Palestinians killed by other Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since 2006.

All numbers refer to casualties of direct conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF military operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns, Barrier demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The figures do not include events indirectly related to the conflict such as casualties from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the circumstances remain unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all reported casualties of all ages and both genders.
Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties in West Bank, Gaza and Israel.

===Criticism of casualty statistics===

As reported by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, since 29 September 2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741 civilians. 124 of those killed were minors."B'Tselem: Since 2000, 7,454 Israelis, Palestinians killed." Jerusalem Post.  27 September 2010.
The Israeli based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism criticized the methodology of Palestinian-based rights groups, including B'tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying civilian/combatant ratios.Mor, Avi, et al.  "Casualties in Operation Cast Lead: A closer look." Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya.  2009.  PDF.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/Nixon/TargetedKillings.pdf |title=Targeted Killings: Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Counterterrorism Poicy |format=PDF |date = January 2005|accessdate=9 August 2010[/tpl]"B'Tselem: 773 of Palestinians killed in Cast Lead were civilians." Ynetnews.  9 September 2009.
In a study published by Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, Elihu D. Richter and Dr. Yael Stein examined B'tselem methods in calculating casualties during Operation Cast Lead.  They argue that B'tselem's report contains "errors of omission, commission and classification bias which result in overestimates of the ratio of non-combatants to combatants."Richter, Elihu D. and Yael Stein.  [http://spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=5980 "Comments on B'Tselem's Civilian Casualty Estimates in Operation Cast Lead." Scholars for Peace in the Middle East.  13 September 2009. Stein and Richter claim the high male/female ratios among Palestinians, including those in their mid-to-late teens, "suggests that the IDF classifications are combatant and non-combatant status are probably far more accurate than those of B’Tselem."

===Land mine and explosive remnants of war casualties===

A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mineaction.org/country.asp?c=138|title=Country Overviews – Occupied Palestinian Territory|year=2009|publisher=United Nations Mine Action Service|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 to 2008 and that 12 people have been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War. The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces." There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the minefields.
