The Latvia national rugby union team represent Latvia at the sport of rugby union. They are governed by Latvijas Regbija FederƒÅcija (Latvia Rugby Federation) and have been playing international rugby since the early 1990s. Rugby has increased in popularity in Latvia recently due to a rise in form. Despite minimal playing numbers, Latvia continue to compete at a high level, and had an outside chance of finishing top of Division 2A of the European Nations Cup. However their hopes took a massive blow, when they failed to capitalise on Poland's surprise home defeat to Croatia, losing 16-13 to Malta in Paola. Latvia is an improving rugby team as now more players are playing in Russia, Germany, and Canada.
