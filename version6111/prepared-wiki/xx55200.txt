The Governor of Vermont is the governor of the U.S. state of Vermont. As the head of government of the state, the governor is elected in even numbered years by direct voting for a term of two years;  Vermont and bordering New Hampshire are the only states to hold gubernatorial elections every two years, instead of every four as in the other 48 states. There is no limit on the number of terms a governor can serve.Thegreenpapers.com
The incumbent governor is Peter Shumlin. In his 2010 election he was endorsed by the Vermont Democratic and Working Families Parties. He is the 81st governor of the State of Vermont. (Two others, Thomas Chittenden and Moses Robinson, served as governor of the Vermont Republic before Vermont's admission to the Union in 1791.)
The governor's working offices are located in The Pavilion in the state capital of Montpelier, Vermont. The governor's ceremonial office, used during the legislative session of the General Assembly, is located in the Vermont State House, also in Montpelier.
The Constitution of Vermont details the powers of the governor:
There is a separately-elected Lieutenant Governor of Vermont, who assumes the powers of the Governor in case there is a vacancy in the office of Governor or the Governor was unable to serve. The Lieutenant Governor is also the Lieutenant-General of the "forces of the State."
