Here "officer" is understood to include commissioned officers, cadets, and midshipmen of both sexes, hence the more common term conduct unbecoming. A gentleman is understood to have a duty to avoid dishonest acts, displays of indecency, lawlessness, dealing unfairly, indecorum, injustice, or acts of cruelty.[tpl]cite web|title = Article 133: Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman | url = http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm133.htm | author = Powers, Rod | publisher = About.com | accessdate = 2008-05-16[/tpl]
