[[File:A melodic minor scale ascending and descending.png|thumb|400px|The A melodic minor scale. When ascending, the sixth and seventh notes are both raised above the corresponding notes of the natural minor scale. The descending melodic minor scale is the same as the descending natural minor scale.

The distinctive sound of the harmonic minor scale is the interval between the (minor) sixth and (major) seventh degrees of the scale (in the case of A minor, F and G[tpl]music|#[/tpl]), which is an augmented second. While some composers, notably Mozart, have used this interval to advantage in melodic composition, other composers, having felt it to be an awkward leap, particularly in vocal music, considered a whole step between these two scale degrees more conducive to smooth melody writing, so either the sixth scale degree was raised or the seventh flattened, in both cases by a semitone. Traditionally, music theorists have called these two options the ascending melodic minor scale (also known as heptatonia seconda and jazz minor scale) and descending melodic minor scale respectively. The ascending melodic minor scale can be notated as
While the descending is:
In its upper tetrachord, the ascending melodic minor scale is identical to its major scale. The descending melodic minor scale is identical to the natural minor scale.
Composers have not been consistent in using these in ascending and descending melodies. Just as often, composers choose one form or the other based on whether one of the two notes is part of the most recent chord (the prevailing harmony). Particularly, to use the triad of the relative major—which is very common—since this is based on the third degree of the minor scale, the raised seventh degree would cause an augmented triad. Composers thus frequently require the lowered seventh degree found in the natural minor. In jazz, the descending aeolian is usually disregarded altogether.
Examples of the use of melodic minor in rock and popular music include Elton John's "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word", which makes, "a nod to the common practice...by the use of F[tpl]music|#[/tpl] leading-tone in G minor as the penultimate note of the final cadence."Stephenson (2002), p.41.

==Finding key signatures==

Major and minor keys that share the same signature are relative to each other; so C major is the relative major of A minor, and C minor is the relative minor of E[tpl]music|b[/tpl] major. The relative major is a minor third above the tonic of the minor. For example, since the key signature of G major has one sharp (see major scales for how to find this), its relative minor, E minor, also has one sharp in its key signature.
Music may be written in an enharmonic scale (e.g. C[tpl]music|#[/tpl] minor, which only has four sharps in its key signature, compared to the theoretical eight flats required for D[tpl]music|b[/tpl] minor). The following are enharmonic equivalents:
Double sharps/double flats can be written as accidentals, but not as part of a key signature. For example:
D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] minor key signature: E[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + A[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + G[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + C[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + F[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] + B[tpl]music|doubleflat[/tpl] (the B is now double flatted and therefore, notated after the single accidentals, which obviously do not include the B[tpl]music|♭[/tpl])
D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] natural minor = D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] E[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] F[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] G[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] A[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] B[tpl]music|doubleflat[/tpl] C[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl]
D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] melodic minor (ascending and descending) = D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] E[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] F[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] G[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] A[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] B[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] C D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] C[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] B[tpl]music|doubleflat[/tpl] A[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] G[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] F[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] E[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl]
D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] harmonic minor = D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] E[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] F[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] G[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] A[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] B[tpl]music|doubleflat[/tpl] C D[tpl]music|♭[/tpl]

==Related modes==

In the Western system, derived from the Greek system of modes, the principal scale that includes the minor third is the Aeolian mode, with the minor third also occurring in the Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode. Dorian is the same as minor mode except with a major sixth, and Phrygian mode is the same as minor mode except with a minor second.
