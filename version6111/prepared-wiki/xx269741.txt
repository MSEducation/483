==Political dimension of her activity==

The research activities performed by the vessel have sometimes beside its scientific and economic dimensions also political extent with diplomatic or military tone.
She was sent in 1987 to Aegean Sea after Greece announced that it will start oil and gas exploration in the region. As Greece declared to intervene, Turkey responded that this would be cause of war. The tension calmed down later with mediation efforts of NATO and the USA.

==2011 Eastern Mediterranean mission==

Following the decision of the Cyprus government to start an initiative for oil and gas exploration in the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey signed an agreement with Northern Cyprus to do the same within Northern Cyprus' territorial waters.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dunya.com/minister-gives-cyprus-confrontation-signals_133203_haber.html |newspaper=Dünya |title=Minister gives Cyprus confrontation signals |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2011-09-2 4 [/tpl] For this purpose, K. Piri Reis, which was commissioned by the Turkish government to conduct research work, departed on September 23, 2011 from its homeport in Urla, İzmir Province and headed for Eastern Mediterranean.
