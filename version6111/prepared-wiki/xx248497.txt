[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operations]]

CATEGORIES: Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Cetacean research and conservation, Ecuador

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society engages in various demonstrations, campaigns, and tactical operations at sea and elsewhere, including conventional protests and direct actions to protect marine wildlife. Sea Shepherd operations have included interdiction against commercial fishing, shark poaching and finning, seal hunting and whaling.[tpl]cite web| last=Heller| first=Peter| title=The Whale Warriors: Whaling in the Antarctic Seas| publisher=National Geographic|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0605/features/whales-5.html |accessdate=February 10, 2007[/tpl] Many of their activities have been called piracy or terrorism by their targets and by the ICRW.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10619393|title=Hardline warrior in war to save the whale|date=January 11, 2010|agency=The Observer|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/history.pdf|title=SEA SHEPHERD’S VIOLENT HISTORY|publisher=The Institute of Cetacean Research|date=2002|accessdate=December 1, 2013[/tpl] Sea Shepherd says that they have taken more than 4,000 volunteers on operations over a period of 30 years.

==Fishing (1987–present)==

===Anti-driftnetting campaigns (1987–present)===

Sea Shepherd engaged in a multi-year campaign against drift netting practices, which it calls a way of strip mining the ocean's wildlife. Sea Shepherd's Divine Wind vessel investigated suspected driftnet fleets and collected ghost nets in 1987, while in 1990–1992 Sea Shepherd II and the Edward Abbey several times rammed Japanese driftnetting vessels and destroyed their nets. Sea Shepherd only reduced their campaign activities after the United Nations in 1992 banned drift-netting in international waters.[tpl]cite web|title=The Return of the Walls of Death|publisher=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-061003-1.html|accessdate=January 11, 2010[/tpl]
Sea Shepherd in 2006 noted that drift netting had again gained prominence, due to the reduction of fish stocks tempting commercial fisheries to again use the method to keep up their catch volumes.

===Mexico tuna boat incident (1991)===

In February 1991, representatives of a tuna boat in the Pacific south of Mexico said that they had been rammed by Sea Shepherd II. Sea Shepherd accused it of catching and killing dolphins in its tuna nets and confirmed its ship had dealt the tuna boat a "glancing blow."[tpl]cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910218&slug=1266935|title=Business | World | Seattle Times |work=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|date=February 18, 1991|accessdate=January 10, 2010[/tpl]

===Cooperation with Costa Rica (2002)===

In April 2002, the Government of Costa Rica invited Sea Shepherd to assist in patrolling for poachers around Cocos Island. The group and Costa Rica had negotiated an agreement for this work which was due to be finalised on April 30, 2002.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-05-28/news/17544870_1_costa-ricans-sharks-farley-mowat|title=Rough seas for ocean activist / Criminal charges in Costa Rica for founder of Sea Shepherd|date=May 28, 2002|work=San Francisco Chronicle Foreign Service|work=SFGate.com|accessdate=February 20, 2010|first=Lauren|last=Wolkoff[/tpl] On April 22, the Farley Mowat (formerly the Ocean Warrior),Sea Shepherd Conservation Society http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/the-fleet.html captained by Paul Watson, was en route to the island when it came across the Varadero I which the group alleges was poaching sharks. The authorities were contacted and Sea Shepherd was told to bring the ship in. The Farley Mowat forced the other vessel into a nearby Guatemalan port with the use of pressure hoses, and in the altercation, the two vessels collided, causing some damage to the Varadero I.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2002/jun/03/fish.food|title=Champion of seas faces attempted murder case|date=June 3, 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 20, 2010|location=London|first=Duncan|last=Campbell[/tpl]
Subsequently, Watson was charged with attempted shipwrecking and murder by the fishermen. These charges were dropped on April 29 by the prosecutor when footage of the incident taken by a documentary team aboard the Farley Mowat was shown. Footage of the event can be seen in the film Sharkwater. The prosecutor was reported to have found no evidence of any wrongdoing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/archive/05_10_02_4.htm|title=More Woes for Sea Shepherd|last=Wolkoff|first=Lauren|date=May 10, 2002|work=Tico Times|accessdate=September 21, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] A new prosecutor was later appointed to repursue the charges and Watson's lawyer advised he leave the country. Local environmental groups argue that fishing interests opposed to marine conservation were behind the legal proceedings.

===Southern Pacific/Galápagos Islands (2000–present)===

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has operated in the Galápagos marine reserve to protect marine wildlife. The reserve was declared in 1986, with an increased area declared in 1998, and despite government attempts to limit catches, fishing continued in the waters around the Galápagos Islands. The Galápagos Parks Service lacked the manpower to adequately manage the marine park, and fishing laws were regularly flouted.CNN http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9808/24/sea.cukes.yoto/ Accessed August 14, 2009 The largest fisheries were for spiny lobster, sea cucumbers, and shark fins, mainly for export to Asian markets.BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3696376.stm Accessed August 15, 2009 Longline fishingThe Independent http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ecuador-pressured-to-save-galapagos-wildlife-485761.html Accessed August 15, 2009 and illegal netsCDNN http://www.cdnn.info/eco/e040530/e040530.html Accessed August 15, 2009 also cause a bycatch of seals,Darwin Foundation http://web.archive.org/web/20070606223336/www.darwinfoundation.org/en/our-work/featured-projects/sealion-monitoring Accessed August 15, 2009 turtles, sharks,Sydney Morning Herald http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Fishermen-resist-moves-to-protect-Galapagos/2005/04/01/1112302241937.html Accessed August 15, 2009 boobies and other marine animals.San Francisco Chronicle http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/24/MN4377.DTL Accessed August 15, 2009
In December 2000, the Sea Shepherd ship, Sirenian, was sent to the Galápagos to assist in patrolling the 130,000 square kilometre marine reserve around the Islands. Sea Shepherd had signed a five-year agreement with the Galápagos National Parks Service to provide the Sirenian, with some crew, as a patrol vessel.Sea Shepherd Vessel Departs US for Five-Year Patrol & Relief Mission in Galapagos Islands Business Wire, Accessed August 6, 2009. Under the agreement, the Sirenian had an Ecuadorian captain, engineer, and carries Parks Service officers. The Sirenian is a 95-foot former United States Coast Guard Cutter and is now permanently stationed in the Galápagos.
In November 2000, the fishers reacted to new catch limits on lobster by ransacking the Parks Service offices, the facilities of the Darwin Research Centre and trashing the Park Director's home, burning his possessions in the street.ABC News http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/earth/stories/s223307.htm Accessed August 6, 2009[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/galapagosislands/717876/Galapagos-Spills-and-thrills.html|title=Galápagos: Spills and thrills|date=April 11, 2001|work=Telegraph|accessdate=August 15, 2009|location=London|first=Juliet|last=Clough[/tpl] The Sirenian carried a cargo of new computers, cameras, and communications equipment to replace what was destroyed by the fishers.Business Wire http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sea+Shepherd+Vessel+Departs+US+for+Five-Year+Patrol+&+Relief+Mission...-a067627465 Accessed August 14, 2009 The Sirenian captured four illegal boats in the first three weeks of March, 2001.

In June 2004, a Sea Shepherd crew-member, Cathy Davies, along with at least six other Sea shepherd members, was taken hostage during protests by fishers who were protesting recently enacted quotas on sea cucumber (Holothuroidea).NZCity http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=40103&cat=977 Accessed August 6, 2009 Armed with clubs, pipes, and Molotov cocktails, the fishers had seized Parks Service offices and tourist locations.The Independent http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ecuador-pressured-to-save-galapagos-wildlife-485761.html Accessed August 6, 2009[tpl]cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/429366|title=Skipper to attempt risky rescue|date=June 5, 2004|agency=AAP|work=Television New Zealand|accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl] Sea Shepherd crew joined Parks Services officers at the barricades erected by fishers around the buildings. Another team of Sea Shepherd crew were dispatched to guard Lonesome George, one of the Galápagos Islands’ most famous turtles, as the fishers had threatened to kill him if the quota on sea cucumber was not lifted. About 100 residents of San Cristóbal Island marched in protest against the fishers actions.AP http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-95245895.html Accessed August 6, 2009 In July, the High Court of Ecuador upheld the Parks Service limits on the take of sea cucumber. The Parks Service banned the catch of sea cucumber for 2005 and 2006 to allow for the populations to recover from over-fishing. Watson called this a "great victory for conservation in the Galápagos."ENS http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2004/2004-07-29-01.asp Accessed August 6, 2009 In an agreement with the World Wildlife Fund, Sea Shepherd donated the Sirenian to the Galápagos National Park Service.

In May 2007, the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, relaxed an International ban on shark finning by legalizing the sale of fins from sharks caught accidentally. Sea Shepherd's Ecuadorian representative, Sean O’Hearn-Giminez, accompanied a police raid that found two tons of sharks fins caught before a Presidential decree.Economist http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9833189 Accessed August 6, 2009 Fifteen people were arrested in the raid at Manta. However, a prosecutor ordered them released and the shark fins were returned to the fishers. O’Hearn-Giminez was arrested and ordered to be deported. This order was revoked later that day at the request of President Correa. The reason given was that O’Hearn-Giminez had a valid visa, as his wife is Ecuadorian.USA Today http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-08-05-ecuador-us-activist_N.htm Accessed August 6, 2009
In June 2007, O’Hearn-Giminez participated in a raid on a house in Libertad that was being used for illegally processing sea cucumbers. At least 40,000 sea cucumbers were seized and two men arrested.ENS http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2007/2007-07-12-03.asp Accessed August 6, 2009 Later that month, Sea Shepherd staff and operatives from the Ecuadorian Environmental Police seized 18,673 shark fins and arrested four men. Sean O’Hearn-Giminez said that "This successful sting is the result of several months working covertly with the co-operation of General Bolivar Cisneros, Chief Commander of the Ecuadorian National Police. Sea Shepherd traced potential exit points in the illegal shark fin trade in the Galápagos and Ecuador."
Paul Watson was awarded the Amazon Peace Prize for his and Sea Shepherd's work on behalf of the environment and marine species in Latin America. The award was given in July 2007 by the Latin American Association for Human Rights and the Ecuadorian vice-President. Watson also signed two agreements at this time, one for Sea Shepherd's involvement in the protection of the Amazon River Dolphin and the Amazonian manatee; the other with the Ecuadorian Police to work with them to detect and destroy illegal fishing boats.
In 2008, US Federal agent Scott West resigned his position and joined Sea Shepherd to work in its intelligence and investigations department. West will work in partnership with the Ecuadorian National Police and the Galápagos National Park to oppose illegal fishing in the marine reserve.News.com http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,24600328-948,00.html Accessed August 6, 2009

==Canadian sealing (1979–2008)==

The first direct action undertaken by Sea Shepherd was against Canadian seal hunting in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In March 1979, 32 crew aboard the Sea Shepherd protested the hunt and eight members were arrested after going on the ice to spray the pups with colored organic dye so as to render the pelts worthless to traders.[tpl]cite news|title=Environmentalists Jailed After Painting Baby Seals Red|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=March 11, 1979|page=2A|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1iwTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ugUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5044,2964856&dq=sea-shepherd[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Seal-hunt protesters fear more trouble|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=March 12, 1979|page=3|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=78kRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8O0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7152,6911778&dq=sea-shepherd[/tpl]
Sea Shepherd protested a Canadian seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence off the north coast of Nova Scotia in March 1983. The arrival of the group led to a one day suspension of the hunt. On March 25, the Sea Shepherd II was ordered back by Canadian authorities after the vessel came within one half-mile of seal hunters. Watson promised to scuttle the ship if they attempted to board it.[tpl]cite news|title=17 Protesting Seal Hunt Arrested|date=March 28, 1983|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AHkUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=swIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6143,9063147&dq=sea-shepherd|work=Toledo Blade|page=11|accessdate=July 14, 2009[/tpl] The Sea Shepherd II was fortified with barbed wire and a water cannon.[tpl]cite news|title=Anti-Sealing Vessel Boarded|date=March 28, 1983|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WdURAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nu4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2081,6644518&dq=sea-shepherd|work=The Spokesman-Review|page=3|accessdate=July 14, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] On March 27, the vessel was stuck in ice and Watson and three others walked across the ice to Chéticamp where they were later arrested for viewing the seal hunt without a permit.[tpl]cite news|title=Neptune’s Navy|last=Khatchadourian|first=Raffi|work=The New Yorker|date=November 5, 2007|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/11/05/071105fa_fact_khatchadourian|accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl] 15 officers boarded the ship from a Canadian Coast Guard vessel with the use of tear gas and smoke bombs. The crew was arrested without any resistance or injuries. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mischief and conspiracy to commit extortion.[tpl]cite news|title=Anti-Seal hunt Protectors Charged|date=March 30, 1983|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EzcQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=944DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3267,7904102&dq=sea+shepherd+extortion|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|page=7|accessdate=July 14, 2009[/tpl] Watson was bailed out by actor Mike Farrell and was acquitted upon appeal of the charges.
In March 1995, the group protested the seal hunt in the Magdalen Islands. While staying in the town of Cap-aux-Meules, witnesses reported that 200 club-wielding fishermen stormed the hotel where the group was staying. The group, including Martin Sheen, was escorted to the airport under a heavy police guard. The attackers trashed the room in a two-hour rampage while Watson and Sheen caught a flight to another island.
In 2005, Sea Shepherd campaigned against that year's seal hunt in Canada, which includes a boycott of Canadian seafood products.ENS http://www.mywire.com/a/EnvironmentNewsService/Humane-Society-Boycotts-Canadian-Seafood/803938?extID=10051 Accessed August 2, 2009 Sea Shepherd crew went onto the ice to document the sealing and noted they were soon confronted by a group of sealers who verbally abused and punched the group of crew, as well as threatened them with spiked clubs called hak-a-piks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10118434|title=Seal defenders attacked|date=April 3, 2005|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=January 29, 2010[/tpl] Ten of the protestors were arrested for being too close to sealing without a permit.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?sf=143&set_id=1&click_id=31&art_id=vn20050403140806291C967633|title=Environment – Club-wielding hunters attack conservationists|date=April 3, 2005|work=Sunday Argus|accessdate=January 29, 2010[/tpl] Sea Shepherd recorded the incident and sent the video[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIJc-0Wp2r0|title=Broadcast Yourself|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=January 10, 2010[/tpl] to police, but say the sealers were not charged.
The MV Farley Mowat operated during Canadian seal hunting in March and April 2008. The group contends it was in international waters observing Canada's seal hunt, while Canadian authorities allege the vessel was harassing the seal hunters.
On March 29, 2008 the MV Farley Mowat and a Canadian Coast Guard ship collided. The coast guard icebreaker had put itself between the Farley Mowat and a smaller seal hunter's boat. The group says their vessel was rammed while the Canadian Fisheries and Oceans department says the coast guard ship was grazed by the Farley Mowat.
The captain and first officer were arrested for bringing their vessel to within one-half nautical mile of seal hunters on March 30, April 11, and April 12. The location of the ship at the time of the seizure is disputed. Sea Shepherd claims the boat was seized illegally in international waters,.Amherst Daily News http://www.amherstdaily.com/index.cfm?sid=125722&sc=508 Accessed 090801 On July 2, 2008, they entered a plea of not guilty. The lawyer set to defend the Captain and First Mate withdrew from the case. They did not want to be represented by a Sydney lawyer and were not represented during their four-day trial. On June 30, they were convicted of endangering lives by bringing the Farley Mowat to within one-half nautical mile from sealing activities without an official permit. The judge found that they had been warned to back away from the sealers but ignored the radioed commands. The Farley Mowat was forfeited and eventually sold by the Canadian Government to Green Ship LLC.

==Whaling (1979–present)==

Sea Shepherd has protested against whaling throughout the world. Some of its first actions were against whalers. The group has also acted against whaling by countries who they feel have not followed the 1986 internationally recognized nonbinding moratorium on commercial whaling. Dr. Sidney Holt, formerly of the International Whaling Commission and a chief architect of the moratorium, has called Watson's involvement in anti-whaling an "absolute disaster" for the cause. He referenced "blowback" for those who want to see an end to whaling by "playing piracy on the ocean."[tpl]cite news|title=Neptune’s Navy|last=Khatchadourian|first=Raffi|publisher=The New Yorker|date=November 5, 2007|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/11/05/071105fa_fact_khatchadourian|accessdate=January 18, 2008[/tpl]

===Spain and Portugal-area whaling (1979–80)===

Sea Shepherd spent part of 1979 hunting for the whaling ship Sierra which was notorious for having undetermined ownership, ignoring whaling agreements, hunting indiscriminately, and using non-explosive harpoons.Time Magazine http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948497,00.html Accessed July 21, 2009 To increase the effect of a ramming, the bow of the Sea Shepherd was filled with approximately 100 tonnes of cement. In July, the Sierra was found off the port of Oporto, Portugal. Sea Shepherd put non-essential crew ashore and manned by three crew (Paul Watson, Peter Woof, and Jerry Doran), returned to ram and cripple the Sierra. The Sea Shepherd then attempted to reach the United Kingdom, but was intercepted by the Portuguese Navy and escorted back to Oporto. The ship and crew were not arrested but the ship was held for what was called an "informal inquiry."The Age Conservationist Admits Ramming 'Whaler' Accessed July 21, 2009 The Sierra was able to make it back to port for extensive repairs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/5166346/Paul-Watson-Sea-Shepherd-eco-warrior-fighting-to-stop-whaling-and-seal-hunts.html|title=Paul Watson: Sea Shepherd eco-warrior fighting to stop whaling and seal hunts|accessdate=July 15, 2009|date=April 17, 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London[/tpl] In Oporto, Watson learned that one of the Sea Shepherd crew, Richard Morrison, had been beaten and left severely concussed by members of the Sierra crew. In December, Watson and Peter Woof returned to Portugal intending to steal the seized ship. They found the ship had been stripped of equipment and the Portuguese police advised them to leave, as they could not guarantee their safety. Watson decided to scuttle the ship rather than have it be sold for scrap and potentially used to compensate the owners of the Sierra.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BKYSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6969,1486411&dq=sea-shepherd+sierra|title=Seized Ship Scuttled|date=January 3, 1980|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|accessdate=September 21, 2009[/tpl]

In a 2004 interview Paul Watson said, "Meanwhile, the Sierra had been repaired and was ready to return to sea. It never did so: on February 6, 1980, my crew blew the bottom out of her and permanently ended her career. We traded a ship for a ship, but it was a great trade because we also traded our ship for the lives of hundreds of whales."The “Good” Pirate – The Bite Back Interview with Paul Watson – Satya Magazine, 2004
In April 1980, explosives were used to sink the whalers Isba I and Isba II in Vigo, Spain. Watson said that the boats were "victims of magnetic mines, one of them homemade, which had been planted by the same trio that destroyed the Sierra."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TqwOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=sea+shepherd+min+sierra&source=bl&ots=NnfwPcEK9-&sig=lTkSHMcWD3aYrSXoK0Xx7O8UCVU&hl=en&ei=AW1dStSPBJ_CmQeIgalx&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3|title=The whale war – Google Books|work=Books.google.com|accessdate=January 10, 2010[/tpl] Sea Shepherd does show these vessels on the tally of vessels "sunk" on the side of the Farley Mowat and the back of some Sea Shepherd shirts.

===Soviet Union-fleet whaling (1981–82)===

In July 1981, The Sea Shepherd II sailed for the Bering Sea with the intention of harassing the Soviet whaler Sevetny. The IWC had authorized a Soviet take of 179 migrating whales off the Siberian coast.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nHIQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EYsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1367,3333901&dq=sea-shepherd+russians|title=Anti-whalers safe in Soviet encounter|last=Larry|first=Evans|date=August 11, 1981|work=The Free-Lance Star|page=17|accessdate=August 13, 2009[/tpl] On August 10, the group photographed what they considered an illegal whaling operation at an onshore packing plant.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=siwQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CY8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3002,2952193&dq=sea-shepherd+russians|title=Soviets scare off protesters|date=August 10, 1981|work=Ellensburg Daily Record |page=7|accessdate=August 13, 2009[/tpl] The Sea Shepherd II was pursued towards American waters by Soviet helicopter gunships and a frigate.

===Norwegian whaling (1992, 1994)===

In late December 1992, O.R.C.A Force (Sea Shepherd) sabotaged the whaler Nybraena in response to Norway's decision to resume commercial whaling of minke whales in 1993.

===Faroe Islands whaling (1986, 2000, 2010, 2011)===

In 1986, Sea Shepherd went to document and obstruct whaling in the Faroe Islands. In a hunt known as the Grindadráp, islanders drive pilot whales ashore and kill them with knives. The Faroese Coast Guard claim the vessel defied orders to leave territorial waters. The Faroese Coast Guard claimed that they were fired upon with pistols while attempting to board, while Sea Shepherd claimed that they had been repelled by cannons firing chocolate and banana cream pie. The police responded with tear gas canisters. A spokesman for the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said they were driven away when the police fired machine guns and tear gas, and denied that there were any weapons on board.Police Thwart Anti-Whaling Protesters – Los Angeles Times, July 13, 1986.

In 2011, Sea Shepherd sailed to the Faroe Islands to stop the whaling there. The Steve Irwin and the Brigitte Bardot took part in the "Operation Ferocious Isles" and claimed to have stopped the harvest as long as they were there. This was publicized in the TV show "Whale Wars: Viking Shores".

===Icelandic whaling (1986)===

In November 1986, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claimed responsibility for actions against a whaling station in Hvalfjörður, Iceland. Computers were destroyed with sledgehammers and records were doused with acid. The Hvalur 6 and Hvalur 7, two of the nation's four whaling ships, were sunk by opening their seacocks while they were moored in Reykjavík harbor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962931,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=That Sinking Feeling|date=November 4, 1986|work=Time|accessdate=October 9, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t2cVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KOEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6875,2938514&dq=sea-shepherd+rock&hl=en|title=2 suspected of attacking whale boats|date=November 11, 1986|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=7A|accessdate=October 9, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&s_site=kentucky&p_multi=LH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB73921867F491D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Iceland Calls Saboteurs Terrorists|date=November 12, 1986|work=Lexington Herald-Leader|accessdate=September 21, 2009[/tpl] The Icelandic National Police did not arrive until the agents had left, and allowed them to pass through a routine traffic stop en route to an airport, after officers found nothing suspicious.

Kristjan Loftsson of Iceland's largest whaling company told The New Yorker that Watson is persona non grata in the country.

Under a quota trade deal between the US and Russiahttp://www.sei.org/Makah_hunt_facts.html the tribe were allowed to take 20 whales over the course of five years for 'cultural whaling'.http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1161284 The hunts had not occurred in 70 years due to the diminishment of the whale population by commercial whaling.

===Japanese whaling (2003–present)===

In its anti-whaling efforts, Sea Shepherd attempts to deter Japanese ships that hunt minke and fin whales in the Southern Ocean. In 2005, Japan decided to double its quota from the previous year to 935 minke whales and ten endangered fin whales. In 2007, they planned a take of 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales. Sea Shepherd claims that its activities reduced catches to a level where the Japanese had not been able to make a profit from the whaling for three years running as of 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100209zg.html|title=Watson to whalers: We will never surrender|date=February 9, 2010|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl]

Among other places, it can be found at Tokyo's famed Tsukiji fish market and Japanese restaurants. Sea Shepherd has stated that one of the main aims of their operations is to make commercial whaling financially unviable.
In his 2009 book, Whaling in Japan, Jun Morikawa states that Sea Shepherd's confrontational tactics have actually strengthened Japan's resolve to continue with its whaling program. According to Morikawa, Sea Shepherd's activities against Japan's whaling ships have allowed the Japanese government to rally domestic support for the program from Japanese who were otherwise ambivalent about the practice of hunting and eating whales.Kingston, Jeff, "Whaling whoppers debunked", The Japan Times, April 25, 2010, p. 11.

====Taiji-area dolphin hunts (2003, 2010–present)====

Between December 2005 and January 2006, a crew of 43 aboard the Farley Mowat attempted to stop the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean. During the campaign, the Farley Mowat 'sideswiped' a Japanese supply ship called the Oriental Bluebird.

Watson dispatched a press release that he would stop his attacks if the governments of New Zealand and Australia would initiate legal action to stop the whaling.
On January 16, the organization declared that its fuel supplies had run out and that they were heading to shore.

====Operation Leviathan (2006–07)====

Between December 2006 and February 2007, the Robert Hunter and Farley Mowat participated in "Operation Leviathan" against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. On February 9, 2007, Sea Shepherd was able to intercept the Nisshin Maru and engaged it, but later had to stop and search for one of their missing small boats. On February 12, 2007, the group stated it had spotted the Japanese vessel Kaiko Maru as it pursued a pod of minke whales and moved its vessels to intercept the hunt. The Institute for Cetacean Research in Tokyo said the Robert Hunter rammed the Kaiko Maru and that afterwards, both Sea Shepherd ships came to either side of the Kaiko Maru, stopping her from continuing. The Japanese stated that they then threw smoke pots on to the deck and released ropes and nets. The Japanese had already put out several distress calls due to a propeller they say was damaged during the attacks. Watson told the press that the Farley Mowat chased the whaler into the ice and that the Kaiko Maru then sideswiped the Robert Hunter to push the ship into the ice. The Robert Hunter sustained a one-metre gash in the starboard bow region according to Watson. He also said that shortly after that, the Kaiko Maru reversed and collided deliberately into the port stern section of the Robert Hunter causing a metre-long gash in the hull.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/feb/13/whaling.japan|title=Green ships and Japanese whalers in Antarctic clash | Environment|publisher=The Guardian|date=February 13, 2007|accessdate=January 10, 2010|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal[/tpl] This campaign was featured in the documentary At the Edge of the World.

The Australian Government, and the New Zealand Government called for restraint and expressed concern at the risk of human lives in the hostile environment. The New Zealand government also repeated its opposition to whaling in the Sanctuary. However, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully later stated that:
This brought a heated response by Paul Watson, who accused the "know-nothing politician" McCully of ignoring the fact that Sea Shepherd had not killed anyone in over three decades of direct action – and stated that McCully's comments were instead giving Japanese whalers a green light to endanger the lives of Sea Shepherd crews.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sea-shepherd-society/news/article.cfm?o_id=445&objectid=10619229|title=Whaling activist claims McCully puts lives at risk|author=Mathew Dearnaley and Isaac Davison|date=January 9, 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|title=McCully Gives Green Light to Japanese Whalers to Kill Kiwi’s|publisher=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|date=January 10, 2010|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-100110-1.html|accessdate=January 11, 2010[/tpl]
A New Zealand spokesman for the Institute of Cetacean Research noted that Japan would continue to protect their operations "in whatever way it can" and that further clashes would be likely unless Sea Shepherd stopped its operations.

Bethune, who reportedly had to overcome spikes and anti-boarding nets to board the Japanese vessel, was also to present the captain with a bill for $3 million USD and a letter outlining the findings of maritime experts who found that the Japanese vessel was at fault for the collision as it was the overtaking vessel and did not have right of way.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.ph.msn.com/top-stories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3881425|title=Anti-whaling activist 'boards Japanese ship'|date=February 15, 2010|agency=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl] According to the crew of the Shonan Maru, Bethune had thrown butyric acid onto the ship, giving a chemical burn to one sailor. Paul Watson, group founder and captain of the Steve Irwin, said that the mission was intended as a message to the New Zealand government which the SSCS accuses of hypocrisy and failure to represent the interests of the Ady Gil and its captain.

Bethune arrived in Japan approximately a month after his boarding.

On January 7, 2013, Watson was sued in Los Angeles County by the owner of the boat for $5 million. Gil says his vessel was rammed by a Japanese whaling ship in 2010 and suffered damage to the nose but the damage was repairable. According to Gil, Watson saw the collision as an opportunity to spin the incident into a major publicity and money maker for his organization so instead of towing the boat to port for repairs, he secretly gave an order to sink the ship "under the cover of darkness" and blamed the Japanese. Gil claims Watson knew that blaming the whalers for the destruction of his ship would garner sympathy for his cause and spark outrage against the whalers inspiring more people to donate to his anti-whaling organization.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/01/08/whale-wars-star-sued-for-5-million-by-ady-gil-ship-owner-report-says/ | work=Fox News | title='Whale Wars' star sued for $5 million by Ady Gil ship owner, report says | date=January 8, 2013[/tpl]

After Operation No Compromise, Watson said the group was seeking a fourth vessel for the following summer's campaign, "Divine Wind". On September 30, 2011, Japan based Asahi News announced Japan would return to the Southern Ocean, despite rumours that in the wake of the March 2011 tsunami the Japanese government may not justify the research program's continuation.Willacy, Mark, "Reports Japan whale hunt to go ahead", ABC Asia Pacific News, September 30, 2011.
The Japanese whaling fleet departed Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture for the southern oceans on December 6, 2011 with an announced goal of hunting 935 minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales.http://www.seashepherd.org/campaigns/operation-divine-wind/operation-divine-wind The fleet also carried an augmented security team of coast guard personnel. The hunt was funded, in part, by ¥2.3 billion from the Japanese government's 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami relief budget. The Japanese government explained that the use of its money to support the whaling program was justified as one of the whaling ships was home-ported in Tōhoku.McNeill, David, "Tohoku ¥ for whales?", Japan Times, December 11, 2011, p. 9; Associated Press, "¥2.3 billion for Tohoku diverted to whale hunt", Japan Times, December 10, 2011, p. 1.

====Operation Zero Tolerance (2012–2013)====

Operation Zero Tolerance was launched in November 2012. The campaign included a new ship called the Sam Simon.
On December 17, 2012, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction against Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd and any party acting in concert with them from physically attacking any person or vessel of the Institute of Cetacean Research and requiring them to stay at least [tpl]convert|500|yd|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from their vessels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/12/17/12-35266.pdf|title=Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Richard A.

On 5 January 2013, the MV Steve Irwin docked in Timaru, New Zealand and was met by customs officers who searched the vessel for Paul Watson. Watson, however, had transferred to another vessel in international waters to avoid arrest in relation to two Interpol Red Notices.http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/8148531/Fugitive-not-on-ship-during-visit
Also on that day in Timaru, a distress call was issued in relation to the MV Brigitte Bardot after an observer mistook the vessel for an overturned yacht. While several vessels nearby responded to the call, the MV Brigitte Bardot did not respond and instead turned away at high speed upon the arrival of a rescue helicopter. The South Canterbury Coastguard and Maritime New Zealand criticized Sea Shepherd over the incident, stating "There was no need for Sea Shepherd to behave like this".http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/8151904/Criticism-after-boat-thought-to-be-in-trouble It was reported that Watson was on board the MV Brigitte Bardot after transferring from the MV Steve Irwin to avoid possible arrest.http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/sea-shepherd-boats-set-sail-antarctica-5314738
On 7 January 2013, Watson stepped down as Captain of the Steve Irwin, which will now be captained by Siddharth Chakravarty of India. In response to an order by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Watson also resigned as President of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in the United States and Australia. He also resigned his position on the Executive Director of the Society in the United States. He also stepped down as the campaign leader for the operation and handed it over to former Greens Party leader and former Australian Senator, Bob Brown.[tpl]cite web|title=Statement from Captain Paul Watson|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/commentary-and-editorials/2013/01/07/statement-from-captain-paul-watson-592|publisher=Sea Shepherd|accessdate=9 January 2013[/tpl]
In January 2013, legal representatives of the ICR wrote to Sea Shepherd alleging a breach of the terms of the injunction due to the MV Brigitte Bardot having approached within 18.5m of the Yushin Maru 3 on 29 January 2013.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whalers-threaten-contempt-action-against-sea-shepherd-20130204-2du8z.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Whalers threaten contempt action against Sea Shepherd[/tpl] A motion was subsequently filed in America's 9th Circuit court seeking to find Sea Shepherd in contempt of court over the incident. In response, Sea Shepherd argued that the Brigitte Bardot is not subject to the U.S. law, being an Australian-flagged vessel operating in international waters.http://www.3news.co.nz/US-court-upholds-Sea-Shepherd-injunction/tabid/1160/articleID/286876/Default.aspx

No injuries were reported.
On 27 February 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared Sea Shepherd "pirates", clearing the way for Japan to pursue further legal action against the organization.  Said chief judge Alex Kozinzki, "When you ram ships, hurl glass containers of acid, drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders, launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks; and point high-powered lasers at other ships, you are, without a doubt, a pirate."Agence France-Presse/Jiji Press, "U.S. judge labels antiwhaling group ‘pirates’", Japan Times, 28 February 2013, p. 2
