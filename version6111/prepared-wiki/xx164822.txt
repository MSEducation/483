Colleen Suche, Q.C., was appointed a judge of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench on July 17, 2002.  She replaced Madam Justice Barbara Hamilton, upon her appointment to the Manitoba Court of Appeal.
Madam Justice Suche received a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Manitoba in 1979 and was admitted to the Bar of Manitoba the following year.  Throughout her legal career, her practice was primarily in arbitration, mediation and human rights law.  She has extensive civil litigation experience and has appeared before and been a member of various administrative tribunals.  She has been very active with a variety of professional organizations, including having served as President (1997–1998) and as Bencher (1990–1998) of the Law Society of Manitoba.  In 1999, she was named the Manitoba representative on the Federation of Law Societies of Canada.  Over the years, she has been a lecturer in civil procedure for the Manitoba Bar Admission Course.  Madam Justice Suche was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1990.
She is the current Chair on the Board of Directors for the Legal Help Centre of Winnipeg. This is a project she has been involved with since 2009, and it has recently (February 2011) opened its doors to serve the disadvantaged in Winnipeg. She has been able to be highly involved because this is a sabbatical year for her. During her time off from the Courts she has also been teaching a course on Sentencing to University of Manitoba Law students and University of Winnipeg Criminal Justice Students.
