</ref> The isotopes <sup>124</sup>Xe and <sup>134</sup>Xe are predicted to undergo [[double beta decay]], but this has never been observed so they are considered to be stable.<ref>

Besides these stable forms, there are over 40 unstable isotopes that have been studied. The longest lived of these isotopes is 136Xe, which has been observed to undergo double beta decay with a half-life of [tpl]nowrap|2.11 x 1021yr[/tpl]. 129Xe is produced by beta decay of 129I, which has a half-life of 16Â million years, while 131mXe, 133Xe, 133mXe, and 135Xe are some of the fission products of both 235U and 239Pu,[ref]

Nuclei of two of the stable isotopes of xenon, 129Xe and 131Xe, have non-zero intrinsic angular momenta (nuclear spins, suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor.[ref]
