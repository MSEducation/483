CATEGORIES: National symbols of Estonia, National anthems, Estonian songs

Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm ("My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy") was adopted as the national anthem ([tpl]lang-et|(riigi)hümn[/tpl]) of the Republic of Estonia in 1920, and again in 1990.
The lyrics were written by Johann Voldemar Jannsen and are set to a melody composed in 1848 by Fredrik (Friedrich) Pacius which is also that of the national anthem of Finland: Maamme ("Vårt Land" in Swedish).[tpl]cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/estonia-mu-isamaa-mu-onn-ja-room | title=Estonia - Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-21 [/tpl] It is also considered to be national anthem for Livonian people with text Min izāmō, min sindimō, My Fatherland, my native land.

==History==

The song was first presented to the public as a choral work in the Grand Song Festival of Estonia in 1869 and quickly became a symbol of the Estonian National Awakening.
Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm was officially adopted as the national anthem of Estonia in 1920, after the Estonian War of Independence.
During the Soviet occupation since 1944, Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm was banned. Between 1945 and 1990 the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic had a different anthem. Yet, the people of Estonia could often hear the melody, as Finland's state broadcaster Yleisradio, whose radio and television broadcasts were received in Northern Estonia, played an instrumental version of the Finnish national anthem, identical to this song (except for an additional repetition of the last verse in the Finnish version), at closedown every night.

==Note==

In English language media, the title is often spelt without the diacritical signs, so "Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm" becomes "Mu isamaa, mu onn ja room". Although Estonians can mostly recognize the incorrect form, it is usually considered humorous since it changes the meaning: while "õnn ja rõõm" means "happiness and joy", "onn ja room" can roughly be translated as "(small) hut and crawl".
