Previously in 2008, Andorra was hesitant to recognise the Republic of Kosovo's independence due to a possible precedent in the region and due to the pressure of Spain. Andorra and Kosovo established diplomatic relations on 14 September 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Kosova and Andorra establish diplomatic relations|publisher=MFA of Kosovo|url=http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,4,947|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2011-09-14[/tpl]

==Relations with the European Union==

Andorra has had a customs union with the European Union (EU) since 1991 though it excludes agricultural produce. Andorra also maintains its border controls by staying outside of Schengen, though citizens holding a Schengen visa can usually enter. Andorra is the only microstate to use the euro without an official agreement, though Andorra is in talks with the EU over an agreement that would allow it to mint its own coins.
