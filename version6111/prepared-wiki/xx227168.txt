==Club career==

He joined Anyang LG Cheetahs, known then as the "Anyang LG Cheetahs" from Dongguk University in 2000, before shifting to Gwangju Sangmu Bulsajo, while fulfilling his military service obligations. It was at Gwangju that Baek got his first start in the K-League, and he would go on to play a further ten K-League games for the military club.  Upon completion of his military service he returned to FC Seoul (formerly the Anyang LG Cheetahs), where he resumed his role as a bench warmer.  He has never played a game at senior level for FC Seoul (or the Cheetahs). He played in Korean Team in 2010, but he was not nominated for the International Cup for his name, because a lot of Italians joked about him (Beccami in Gul).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.kleague.com/record/record_player.aspx?team_id=K17&player_id=2000125 |title=K-League player profile |publisher=kleague.com[/tpl]
