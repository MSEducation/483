David Ferdinand Durenberger (born August 19, 1934) is an American politician and a former Republican member of the U.S. Senate from Minnesota.

==Early life==

Durenberger was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He graduated first from  Saint John's University and then from the University of Minnesota Law School, receiving his J.D. in 1959.Corrine Charais, Political Action Among Alumni, Perspectives, Spring 2007 (page 18). He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1956 to 1963.

==U.S. Senate==

On November 7, 1978, Durenberger was elected in a special election to complete the unexpired term of Senator Hubert Humphrey, whose position had temporarily been filled by Humphrey's wife Muriel. He was reelected in 1982 and again in 1988, serving from November 8, 1978, to January 3, 1995, in the 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd and 103rd Congresses. He served as the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence during the 99th Congress. Durenberger was unanimously denounced by the Senate on July 25, 1990, for unethical conduct relating to outside income. He was also disbarred for his actions.
In 1994, Durenberger was also a principal in the withdrawal of the nomination of Admiral Stan Arthur to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM).  At the time, Arthur was the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, effectively the Navy's number two officer, and was also the Navy's most senior Naval Aviator on active duty immediately after the 1991 Tailhook Incident.  During the Senate confirmation process for Arthur to assume command of USPACOM, Durenberger questioned Arthur's handling of sexual harassment allegations brought by one of the Senator's constituents, a female Navy student helicopter pilot, LTJG Rebecca Hansen, who was attrited from flight training for repeated, documented, poor performance in the flight phase of training.  To pressure the Navy for information, Durenberger placed a hold on the nomination of Arthur to command USPACOM.  Rather than let the USPACOM post continue to go unfilled during what might have been protracted Senate hearings, Arthur elected to retire from the Navy on February 1, 1995 as a four-star admiral.Stan Arthurhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/navy/ails/durenberger1.html

Durenberger gave an interview in 2005 on the Inside Minnesota Politics Podcast, stating that he is no longer a supporter of the Republican Party but is not a supporter of the Democratic Party either. He said in an interview with Peter Idusogie that Democrats are better equipped to handle health care and that President George W. Bush was wrong about the Iraq War.Inside Minnesota Politics Podcast: Sen.

==Personal papers==

A collection of Durenberger's senatorial files documents Durenberger's three terms in the United States Senate, and is strongest in its documentation of the final term (1989â€“1995). The papers are perhaps most significant for the information they contain about his interest in, and legislative activities regarding, health policy and health care reform issues.
