Since it became independent in 1957, Malaysia's economic performance has been one of Asia's best. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 6.5% per year from 1957 to 2005. Performance peaked in the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, as the economy experienced sustained rapid growth averaging almost 8% annually. High levels of foreign and domestic private investment played a significant role as the economy diversified and modernized. Once heavily dependent on primary products such as rubber and tin, Malaysia today is a middle-income country with a multi-sector economy based on services and manufacturing. Malaysia is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor components and devices, electrical goods, solar panels, and information and communication technology (ICT) products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2777.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl]

==Background==

===Early and colonial history===

The Malay Peninsula and indeed Southeast Asia has been a center for trade for centuries. Various items such as porcelain and spice were actively traded even before Malacca and Singapore rose to prominence. The Malacca Sultanate controlled the Straits of Malacca from its founding in 1402 to the 1511 invasion by Portugal. All the trade in the Straits, and especially the spices from the Celebes and the Moluccas, moved under its protection and through its markets.[tpl]cite news| title=Islam and the Sultanate of Malacca 1402-1511 | url= http://www.ualberta.ca/~vmitchel/rev7.html| accessdate=2008-07-23| author=[/tpl]
In the 17th century, porcelain and spices were found in several Malay states and were actively traded. Large deposits of tin were found in several Malay states. Later, as the British started to take over as administrators of Malaya, rubber and palm oil trees were introduced for commercial purposes. Instead of relying on the local Malays as a source of labour, the British brought in Chinese and Indians to work in the mines and plantations and provide professional expertise. Although many of them returned to their respective home countries after their agreed tenure ended, some remained in Malaysia and settled permanently. Over time, Malaya became the world's largest producer of tin, rubber, and palm oil.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] These three commodities along with other raw materials firmly set Malaysia's economic tempo well into the mid-20th century. As Malaya moved towards independence, the government began implementing economic five-year plans, beginning with the First Malayan Five Year Plan in 1955. Upon the establishment of Malaysia, the plans were re-titled and renumbered, beginning with the First Malaysia Plan in 1965.

===Post-independence===

In the 1970s, Malaysia began to imitate the four Asian Tiger economies (South Korea, Taiwan, the then British Crown Colony of Hong Kong, and Singapore) and committed itself to a transition from being reliant on mining and agriculture to an economy that depends more on manufacturing. In the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural based Malaysian economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s the industrial sector has led Malaysia's growth.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] High levels of investment played a significant role in this. With Japanese investment, heavy industries flourished and in a matter of years, Malaysian exports became the country's primary growth engine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] Malaysia consistently achieved more than 7% GDP growth along with low inflation in the 1980s and the 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.123independenceday.com/malaysia/economy.html|title=Economy of Malaysia|publisher=123independenceday.com|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl]
Central planning has been a major factor in the Malaysian economy, as government expenditure was often used to stimulate the economy. Since 1955, with the commencement of the First Malayan Five Year Plan, the government has used these plans to intervene in the economy to achieve such goals as redistribution of wealth and investment in, for instance, infrastructure projects.[tpl]cite news|last=Mills |first=Greg |url=http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/?itemid=4315 |title=South Africa: bumping against the Bumiputra policy |publisher=Malaysia Today|date=2007-05-01[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
A legacy of the British colonial system was the division of Malaysians into three groups according to ethnicity. The Malays were concentrated in their traditional villages, focusing mainly on agricultural activities, while the Chinese dominated Malaysian commerce. Educated Indians took up professional roles such as those of doctors or lawyers, while the less better-off worked the plantations.Abdullah, Asma & Pedersen, Paul B. (2003). Understanding Multicultural Malaysia, p. 44. Pearson Malaysia. ISBN 983-2639-21-2.Rashid, Rehman (1993). A Malaysian Journey, p. 28. Self-published. ISBN 983-99819-1-9. Chinese businesses in Malaysia developed as part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.[tpl]cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=4–8[/tpl]  The Reid Commission which drafted the Malaysian Constitution made a provision for limited affirmative action through Article 153, which gave the Malays special privileges, such as 60% of university entrance (quota). However, after the May 13 incident of racial rioting in the federal capital of Kuala Lumpur, the government initiated more aggressive programmes aimed at actively establishing a Malay entrepreneurial class through direct intervention in the economy, aimed at alleviating poverty. This was done with the controversial New Economic Policy (NEP).Jomo Kwame Sundaram. UNRISD The New Economic Policy and Interethnic Relations in Malaysia. Its main objective was the elimination of the association of race with economic function, and the first five-year plan to begin implementing the NEP was the Second Malaysia Plan. The success or failure of the NEP is the subject of much debate, although it was officially retired in 1990 and replaced by the National Development Policy (NDP). Recently much debate has surfaced once again concerning the results and relevance of the NEP. Some have argued that the NEP has indeed successfully created a Middle/Upper Class of Malay businesspeople and professionals.
Despite some improvement in the economic power of Malays in general, the Malaysian government maintains a policy of discrimination that favours ethnic Malays over other races—including preferential treatment in employment, education, scholarships, business, access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. This special treatment has sparked envy and resentment amongst non-Malays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-english/news/general/4188-nem-cast-in-deviant-vision-2020-nep-moulds|title=NEM cast in deviant Vision 2020, NEP moulds|last=Fernandez|first=Joe|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] The ethnic Chinese control of the locally owned sector of the country's economy has been ceded largely in favour of the bumiputra/Malays in many essential or strategic industries such as petroleum retailing, transportation, agriculture and automobile manufacturing.
Current GDP per capita grew 31% in the Sixties and 358% in the Seventies, but this proved unsustainable and growth scaled back sharply to 36% in the Eighties. It rose again to 59% in the Nineties led primarily by export-oriented industries.[tpl]cite news| url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html | title=Economics, Business, and the Environment — GDP: GDP per capita, current US dollars| publisher= Earth Trends[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] This increase in GDP was brought about due to a shift from the traditional agricultural and resource based economy to one based on manufactured goods. From 1988 to 1996, Malaysia's economy expanded at 8 per cent, the second fastest after China, resulting in manufactured goods such as microchips and semiconductors making up 80 per cent of exports. Per capita income doubled from 1990 to 1996. Infrastructure projects were greatly increased in this time. Other countries looked to Malaysia at the time as an example for economic reform.[tpl]cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |publisher=Time magazine |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=23 August 2011[/tpl]
The rate of poverty in Malaysia also fell dramatically over the years. However, its precipitous drop has been questioned by critics who suggest that the poverty line has been drawn at an unreasonably low level.[tpl]cite book |last=Musa |first=M. Bakri |title=Towards A Competitive Malaysia |year=2007 |publisher=Strategic Information and Research Development Centre |location=Petaling Jaya |isbn=978-983-3782-20-8|page=124 [/tpl] The rapid economic boom led to a variety of supply problems. Labour shortages soon resulted in an influx of millions of foreign workers, many illegal. Cash-rich PLCs and consortia of banks eager to benefit from increased and rapid development began large infrastructure projects.
As of 2006, the most recent five-year plan is the Ninth Malaysia Plan. The five-year plans have been criticised for resembling the central planning of Soviet communism; the five-year time frame has been attacked for being insufficient in dealing with short-term crises and long-term trends.Musa, p. 309. The effectiveness of the plans has also been disputed; at the beginning of 2005, the last year of the Eighth Malaysia Plan, almost 80% of the funds allocated under the plan had not been disbursed.Musa, p. 314.

====Macro-economic trend====

For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 1.71 Ringgit only. Mean wages were $6.95 per manhour in 2009.
From 1988 to 1997, the economy experienced a period of broad diversification and sustained rapid growth averaging 9% annually.
By 1999, nominal per capita GDP had reached $3,238. New foreign and domestic investment played a significant role in the transformation of Malaysia's economy. Manufacturing grew from 13.9% of GDP in 1970 to 30% in 1999, while agriculture and mining which together had accounted for 42.7% of GDP in 1970, dropped to 9.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in 1999. Manufacturing accounted for 30% of GDP (1999). Major products include electronic components – Malaysia is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices – electrical goods and appliances.
During the same period, the government tried to eradicate poverty with a controversial race-conscious positive program called New Economic Policy (NEP). First established in 1971 following race riots, commonly known in Malaysia as the May 13 Incident, it sought to eradicate poverty and end the identification of economic function with ethnicity. In particular, it was designed to improve the distribution of wealth among the country's population.. The NEP ostensibly ended in 1991, however the policies persist in the form of other programmes such as the National Development Policy. The policies are enforced overtly through race-based quotas for low-cost housing units, university placement, business equity ownership, etc.
Rapid growth was achieved partly through privatisation of inefficient state owned enterprises, thus subjecting them to commercial pressures and forcing them to better utilise their resources. Many deals were done behind closed doors and put through rather quickly. In one example Khazanah Nasional alienated shares in DRB Hicom to Mega Consolidated. This led to such deals being labelled mega projects.
Foreign funds were attracted to invest making the local money market and bourse liquid. This created opportunity for local businesses to raise capital on the KLSE, and carry out infrastructure development in areas like telecommunications, highways and power generation to meet bottlenecks caused by rapid industrialisation. An intense labor shortage created employment for millions of foreign workers. Subsequent events show that more than 50% were illegal.
The influx of foreign investment led to the KLSE Composite index trading above 1,300 in 1994 and the Ringgit trading above 2.5 in 1997. At various times the KLSE was the most active exchange in the world, with trading volume exceeding even the NYSE. The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Malaysia was valued at $181,236 million in 2005 by the World Bank.Data - Finance[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Some of the more visible projects from that period are Putrajaya, a new international airport (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), a hydroelectric dam (Bakun dam), the Petronas Towers and the Multimedia Super Corridor. Proposals that were eventually canceled include the 95 km Sumatra–Malaysia bridge (would have been world's longest), the Mega International Sea and Air port on reclaimed land in Kedah (would have been world's biggest) and the KL Linear City (would have been the world's longest mall and the world's first city built over a river).
Concerns were raised during the time about the sustainability of the rapid growth and the ballooning current account. The mainstream opinion prevalent at that time was that the deficit was temporary and would reverse once imported equipment started producing for export. In spite of that, measures were taken to moderate growth especially when it threatened to overheat into the double digits. The main target was asset prices, and restrictions were further tightened on foreign ownership of local assets. Exposure of local banks to real estate loans were also capped at 20%.
As was widely expected, the current account deficit did narrow steadily, year to year, from 9% to 5% of GDP.

===Asian financial crisis and recovery===

The year 1997 saw drastic changes in Malaysia. There was speculative short-selling of the Malaysian currency, the ringgit. Foreign direct investment fell at an alarming rate and, as capital flowed out of the country, the value of the ringgit dropped from MYR 2.50 per USD to, at one point, MYR 4.80 per USD.The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's composite index fell from approximately 1300 to nearly merely 400 points in a few short weeks. After the controversial sacking of finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, a National Economic Action Council was formed to deal with the monetary crisis. Bank Negara imposed capital controls and pegged the Malaysian ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar. In addition, it also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately US$4.47 billion worth of shares  and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BI02Ae05.html|title=INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA|publisher=Asia Times|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/business/international-business-malaysia-extends-deadline-in-singapore-exchange-dispute.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Malaysia Extends Deadline in Singapore Exchange Dispute|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=2000-01-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/221572|title=Malaysia’s stockmarket; Daylight Robbery|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1999-07-10[/tpl]
Malaysia refused economic aid packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, surprising many analysts. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]  By refusing aid and thus the conditions attached thereof from the IMF, Malaysia was not affected to the same degree in the Asian Financial Crisis as Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.
Regardless, the GDP suffered a sharp 7.5% contraction in 1998. It however rebounded to grow by 5.6% in 1999. The Government of Malaysia predicted 5.8% real GDP growth in the year 2000, but most analysts predicted growth will exceed 8% for the year. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In order to rejuvenate the economy, massive government spending was made and Malaysia continuously recorded budget deficits in the years that followed. Economic recovery has been led by strong growth in exports, particularly of electronics and electrical products, to the United States, Malaysia's principal trade and investment partner. Inflationary pressures remained benign, and, as a result, Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, had been able to follow a low interest rate policy. The Malaysian economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis sooner than neighbouring countries, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800.[tpl]Cite book|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy|author=Paweł Bożyk|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries|page=164|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=0-7546-4638-6[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Principles of Economics|author=N.

The post Y2K slump of 2001 did not affect Malaysia as much as other countries. This may have been clearer evidence that there are other causes and effects that can be more properly attributable for recovery. One possibility is that the currency speculators had run out of finance after failing in their attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August 1998 and after the Russian ruble collapsed. (See George Soros)
The fixed exchange rate was abandoned on July 21, 2005 in favour of a managed floating system within an hour of China announcing the same move.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/investors/dec2007/mktre.htm|title=Global Economy Malaysia|first=Investor's Business and Financial Journal|publisher=Jang Group of Newspapers|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] In the same week, the ringgit strengthened a percent against various major currencies and was expected to appreciate further. As of December 2005, however, expectations of further appreciation were muted as capital flight exceeded USD 10 billion. According to Bank Negara's published figures, Malaysia's foreign exchange reserves increased steadily since the initial capital flight, from USD75.2 billion as at 15 July 2005 (just before the peg was removed) to peak at USD125.7 billion as at 31 July 2008, a few months before the global credit crisis that started in September 2008. As at 29 May 2009, the reserves stood at USD88.3 billion. In spite of the large positive current account surplus, foreign reserves have started to fall at a rapid rate. Official statistics released in March 2006, confirmed capital flight of more than US$10 billion. However, as of the 4th fiscal year, a surge of FDI has pushed the KLSE above 1200 points, and is expected to strengthen to pre 1997 levels.
In March 2005, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published a paper on the sources and pace of Malaysia's recovery, written by Jomo K.S. of the applied economics department, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. The paper concluded that the controls imposed by Malaysia's government neither hurt nor helped recovery. The chief factor was an increase in electronics components exports, which was caused by a large increase in the demand for components in the United States, which was caused, in turn, by a fear of the effects of the arrival of the year 2000 (Y2K) upon older computers and other digital devices.
In September 2005, Sir Howard J. Davies, director of the London School of Economics, at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, cautioned Malaysian officials that if they want a flexible capital market, they will have to lift the ban on short-selling put into effect during the crisis. In March 2006, Malaysia removed the ban on short selling.Financial Times. Malaysia relaxes short-selling ban. Retrieved 28 March 2006. It is interesting to note that some of the measures taken by the Malaysian government in response to the Asian crisis, such as the ban on short selling, were swiftly adopted by the very countries that had previously been critical of the Malaysian response.
Regardless of cause and effect claims, rejuvenation of the economy also coincided with massive government spending and budget deficits in the years that followed the crisis. Later, Malaysia enjoyed faster economic recovery compared to its neighbours. The country has recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era – as an example, the KLCI Composite Index hit an all-time high of 1,386 on 20 June 2007 which is approximately 100 points higher than the pre-crisis record of 1,275 in 1993. While the pace of development today is not as rapid, it is seen to be more sustainable. Although the controls and economic housekeeping may or may not have been the principal reasons for recovery, there is no doubt that the banking sector has become more resilient to external shocks. The current account has also settled into a structural surplus, providing a cushion to capital flight. Asset prices are generally back to their pre-crisis heights, despite the effects of the global financial crisis. As of 21 May 2007, the Ringgit touched a nine-year high record at 3.39 against the US dollar. Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz says the Ringgit moves up on its own merit and in line with the Malaysian economy and not in tandem with the Chinese Yuan. Malaysia has shown the ability to absorb the crude oil price increases and most economies have shown high resilience in absorbing higher energy prices. Malaysia is the world's largest Islamic banking and financial centre.

==Economic policies==

Like many other independent nations, Malaysia's economic policies were shaped by various events in the nation's history since independence.

===Monetary policy===

Prior to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Malaysian ringgit was an internationalized currency, which was freely traded around the world. Just before the crisis, the Ringgit was traded RM2.50 at the dollar. Due to speculative activities, the Ringgit fell to as much as RM4.10 to the dollar in matter of weeks. Bank Negara Malaysia, the nation's central bank, decided to impose capital controls to prevent the outflow of the Ringgit in the open market. The Ringgit is not traded internationally; a traveler needs to declare to the central bank if taking out more than RM10,000 out of the country and the Ringgit itself was pegged at RM3.80 to the US dollar.
The fixed exchange rate was abandoned in favour of the floating exchange rate in July 2005, hours after China announced the same move.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/contentPrint.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_3f579c44-cb73c03a-1cf662f0-6b76946b&paging=0 | title = 22-07-2005: Ringgit depeg not likely to have immediate impact on sovereign, banks, corporates | work = The Edge | author= [/tpl] At this point, the Ringgit was still not internationalized. The Ringgit continued to strengthen to 3.18 to the dollar by March 2008. Meanwhile, many aspects of capital control have been slowly relaxed by Bank Negara Malaysia. However, the government continues to not internalize the Ringgit. The government stated that the Ringgit will be internationalized once it is ready.[tpl]cite news | publisher=Reuters | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSKLR5369320070319| title = Malaysia says offshore ringgit trade not needed | author = Liau Y-Sing | date=2007-03-19[/tpl]
Bank Negara Malaysia for the time being, uses interest rate targeting. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is their policy instrument, and is used to guide the short term interbank rates which will hopefully influence inflation and economic growth.

The Malaysian New Economic Policy was created in 1971 with the aim of bringing Malays a 30% share of the economy of Malaysia and eradicating poverty amongst Malays, primarily through encouraging enterprise ownership by Bumiputeras. After 30 years of the program, the NEP had somewhat met some of its goals. Bumiputera ownership increased to 18.9% in 2004 against 2.4% in 1970 and poverty decreased to 8.3% in 2004 against 64.8% in the 1970s.[tpl]cite news|title= Govt reaffirms Bumiputra corporate equity ownership at 18.9%| url= http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16096| publisher=The Sun, Prime Minister's Department| date=2006-11-13| accessdate=2008-07-30| author=[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation| title=Ending Poverty and Rising Inequality in Malaysia| url= http://www.mier.org.my/presentations/archives/pdf/Leete%20(UNDP).pdf| publisher=United Nations Development Program| accessdate=2008-07-30| page=4| date=2007-11-27| author=Dr. Richard Leete[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Subsidies and price controls===

The Malaysian government subsidizes and controls prices on a lot of essential items to keep the prices low. Prices of items such as palm oil cooking oil, petrol, flour, bread, rice and other essentials have been kept under market prices to keep cost of living low. In 2008, the government announced that it has spent RM40.1 billion in 2007 in subsidies to keep prices leveled.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/international_business/2008/02/25/malaysia_2007_fuel_subsidies_at_rm40b_pm| title=Malaysia 2007 fuel subsidies at RM40b: PM[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] As of 2009, 22 per cent of government expenditures were subsidies, with petrol subsidies alone taking up 12 per cent.Economic numbers bode well for M'sia. Business Times. 2009-09-22
Smuggling and hoarding, which leads to shortages, is a prominent problem in Malaysia due to the subsidies. For example, cooking oil is subsidised for domestic use only. This situation creates an environment where industrial players hoard domestic cooking oil for industrial use. During shortage time, such as the January 2008 cooking oil crisis, the government imposed a 5 kg limit for each purchase to relief domestic demand. However, the limited purchase has created more panic buying, which prompt the Government to negotiate with cooking oil manufacturers to increase their production capacity, and the situation reverted to normal within one week.[tpl]cite news| author=MAZWIN NIK ANIS et al.| title=5kg buying limit on cooking oil| url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/5/nation/19925382&sec=nation |work=The Star[/tpl] Another example is when vehicles in Thailand come to Malaysia to smuggle cheap petrol and diesel out of the country. The government also looking into restructuring the fuel subsidy so that the selected needy group will get the subsidy. The government is considering removing subsidies on diesel for general consumers while maintaining subsidies for suitable groups, such as those involved in public transport.[tpl]cite news| title= Subsidy on diesel to go first, says Shahrir| url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/25/nation/21060846&sec=nation| work=The Star| author=Teh Eng Hock| accessdate=2008-04-25[/tpl]
On January 2010, the government announce dual price structure for fuel, based on citizenship.

===Government influence===

Although the federal government promotes private enterprise and ownership in the economy, the economic direction of the country is heavily influenced by the government though five years development plans since independence. The economy is also influenced by the government through agencies such as the Economic Planning Unit and government-linked wealth funds such as Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Employees Provident Fund and Pemodalan Nasional Berhad.
The government's development plans, called the Malaysian Plan, currently the Ninth Malaysia Plan, started in 1950 during the British colonial rule.[tpl]cite news| title=Growth, Structural Change, and Regional Inequality in Malaysia| author=Asan Ali Golam| page=67| url=http://books.google.com.my/books?id=TtKxDem7CrsC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=malaysia+five+years+development+plans&source=web&ots=cXBxV18rJB&sig=PN5-PK8E-1mIYniGISthDHeQBbs&hl=en[/tpl] The plans were largely centered around accelerating the growth of the economy by selectively investing in selective sectors of the economy and building infrastructure to support said sectors. For example, in the current national plan, three sectors - agriculture, manufacturing and services, will receive special attention to promote the transition to high value-added activities in the respective areas.[tpl]cite news|  title= Investment in Malaysia| url =http://www.innovasjonnorge.no/Internasjonale-markeder/Kontorer-i-utlandet/Malaysia/|author=| publisher=Innovasjon Norge[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Other than the generalized plans like the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the government also have a development plan that are targeted to improve the manufacturing sector which is called the Industrial Master Plan. Currently, the plan is called the Third Industrial Master Plan (IMP3) which covers a period from 2006 to 2020.

==Natural resources==

Malaysia is well-endowed with natural resources in areas such as agriculture, forestry and minerals. It is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, the most valuable exported resource being petroleum. At one time, it was the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/TED/tin.htm |title=TED Case Studies: MALAYTIN: Historical Tin Mining in Malaysia |publisher=American.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In terms of agriculture, Malaysia is one of the top exporters of natural rubber and palm oil, which together with sawn logs and sawn timber, cocoa, pepper, pineapple and tobacco dominate the growth of the sector. Palm oil is also a major generator of foreign exchange.
Regarding forestry resources, it is noted that logging only began to make a substantial contribution to the economy during the nineteenth century. Today, an estimated 59% of Malaysia remains forested. The rapid expansion of the timber industry, particularly after the 1960s, has brought about a serious erosion problem in the country's forest resources. However, in line with the Government's commitment to protect the environment and the ecological system, forestry resources are being managed on a sustainable basis and accordingly the rate of tree felling has been on the decline. [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In addition, substantial areas are being silviculturally treated and reforestation of degraded forest land is also being carried out. The Malaysian government provide plans for the enrichment of some 312.30 square kilometres (120.5 sq mi) of land with rattan under natural forest conditions and in rubber plantations as an inter crop. [tpl]Cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] To further enrich forest resources, fast-growing timber species such as meranti tembaga, merawan and sesenduk are also being planted. At the same time, the cultivation of high-value trees like teak and other trees for pulp and paper are also encouraged. Rubber, once the mainstay of the Malaysian economy, has been largely replaced by oil palm as Malaysia's leading agricultural export.
Tin and petroleum are the two main mineral resources that are of major significance in the Malaysian economy. Malaysia was once the world's largest producer of tin until the collapse of the tin market in the early 1980s. In the 19th and 20th century, tin played a predominant role in the Malaysian economy. It was only in 1972 that petroleum and natural gas took over from tin as the mainstay of the mineral extraction sector. Meanwhile, the contribution by tin has declined. Petroleum and natural gas discoveries in oil fields off Sabah, Sarawak and Terengganu have contributed much to the Malaysian economy. Oil and gas resources are managed by Petronas, the state controlled oil company which forms production sharing contracts with other players like Exxon-Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell to explore oil fields in Malaysia. Other minerals of some importance or significance include copper, bauxite, iron-ore and coal together with industrial minerals like clay, kaolin, silica, limestone, barite, phosphates and dimension stones such as granite as well as marble blocks and slabs. Small quantities of gold are produced.
Malaysia's broad and shallow continental shelf consists of several deep water prospective areas. Malaysia has 500,000 km2 available for oil and gas exploration. 51 of the 70 producing fields in Malaysia are oil fields. In January 2004, Malaysia's oil reserves were estimated to be [tpl]convert|4.84|Goilbbl|m3[/tpl], while natural gas reserves stood at 87 trillion standard cubic feet (2,460 km3).

Petronas is also the custodian of oil and gas reserves for Malaysia. Hence, all oil and gas activities are regulated by Petronas. Malaysia encourages foreign oil company participation through production sharing contracts, in which significant amount of oil will be given away to the foreign oil company until it reaches a production milestone. Currently, many major oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Nippon Oil, and Murphy Oil are involved in such contracts.[tpl]cite news| title=Petronas Corperate Milestones 1974-2002| author=Petronas| accessdate=2008-06-28| url= http://www.petronas.com.my/internet/corp/centralrep2.nsf/0ddc209ca3aa90e848256e9900178727/ebe8f95b4e4b83db48256a9900456959?OpenDocument[/tpl] As a result, 40% of oil fields in Malaysia are developed.[tpl]cite news| title=Oil and Gas opportunity in Malaysia| url=http://www.malaysiamission.com/team.php?id=19| author=Malaysia Trade Mission to US| accessdate=2008-06-27| year=2005[/tpl]

===Tourism===

In an effort to diversify the economy and make Malaysia’s economy less dependent on exported goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism in Malaysia. As a result tourism has become Malaysia’s third largest source of income from foreign exchange.[ref]
</ref> The majority of Malaysia's tourists come from its bordering country, Singapore. In 1999, Malaysia launched a worldwide marketing campaign called “Malaysia, Truly Asia” which was largely successful in bringing in over 7.4 million tourists.<ref>Munan, Heidi. ''Malaysia''. New York: Benchmark Books, 2002. pp. 29.</ref> In recent years tourism has been threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism.<ref>Munan, Heidi.

The Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism (MOCAT) was established in 1987 under which the TDC was incorporated.

===Science and technology===

Science Policy in Malaysia is regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment. Other ministries, such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health also have science departments. Training in scientific areas was promoted during the 1970s and 1980s. From 1987-1997 research and development used 0.24% of GNP, and in 1998 high-tech exports made up 54% of Malaysia's manufactured exports.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Malaysia-SCIENCE-AND-TECHNOLOGY.html |title=Malaysia - Science and technology |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=1 October 2010[/tpl] The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical goods, and information and communication technology products.

It is focused on developing the "RazakSAT" satellite, which is a remote sensing satellite with CCD cameras.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theknowledgeworld.com/world-of-aerospace/MSNA-Malaysia-Space-Agency.htm |title=Malaysian National Space Agency MSNA |publisher=Theknowledgeworld.com |accessdate=24 September 2010[/tpl] In early 2006, Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor and three other finalists were selected for the Angkasawan spaceflight programme.

In an effort to create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. This has created a defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to try to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. One way it does this is through the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition, one of the largest defence and civil showcases in the Asia Pacific, regularly attended by over 500 companies.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/malaysia/industry.htm |title=Malaysia Defence Industry |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=24 September 2010[/tpl] The Malaysian Armed Forces relies heavily on local military technology and high-tech weapons systems designed and manufactured by foreign countries.
