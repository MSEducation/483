Boobs in Arms is the 52nd short subject starring American slapstick comedy team the Three Stooges. The trio made a total of 190 shorts for Columbia Pictures between 1934 and 1959.

==Plot==

The Stooges are street peddler greeting card salesmen who anger a man on the street after an accidental altercation. They are then approached by a woman (Evelyn Young) with a request to help her make her husband (Richard Fiske) jealous. The Stooges defend themselves against the irate husband with their usual combatives and flee from the husband shouting his threats. In hiding from him, they line up on a queue that takes them to a recruitment office by mistake and end up joining the army.thumb|250px|left|The Stooges push Sgt.

No sooner are they getting acclimated with their new army surrounding when they meeting their Drill instructor-sergeant: Hugh Dare, the irate husband/man on the street. Sgt. Dare desperately attempts to teach the Stooges the standard military drill from the manual of arms. He then threatens them during bayonet practice.
The Stooges are sent to the front line, where they decide to take a long nap. After learning that Sgt. Dare has been captured by the enemy, they are instructed to detonate a laughing gas shell, which manages to explode on them rather than the enemy due to their pointing the cannon upward. Laughing hysterically, the Stooges are brought to enemy headquarters where Sgt. Dare is being detained. The enemy communicate in pig latin; hopped up by the gas, the Stooges gleefully use their violence in a wild free for all fight against their captors, including an accidental sword thrust to the rear of the sergeant and his retaliatory punch to the enemy captain that makes him fall on the pointed end of his pickelhaube helmet. The Stooges knock out everyone, including all the enemy soldiers and Sgt. Dare. After emerging victorious, several guns fire at them, with shells whizzing past, the Stooges always ducking in laughter or leaning back giggling, each time missing another shell. Finally, the last shot's shell passes between their legs and takes them into the clouds.

The drill sergeant training routine was originally performed by future third Stooge Joe Besser in Broadway revues with partner Jimmy Little in the 1930s. Jules White adapted the routine for Boobs in Arms, and would reuse the footage for the ending of Dizzy Pilots in 1943. White eventually filmed Besser performing the routine in Aim, Fire, Scoot and its remake, Army Daze.[tpl]cite book| last = Solomon| first = Jon| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion| publisher = Comedy III Productions, Inc| year = 2002| location = | pages = 183| url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0971186804 | doi =| id = | isbn = 0-9711868-0-4[/tpl]Aim, Fire Scoot at threestooges.net

===Hollywood and the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940===

The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 was passed by the United States Congress on September 16, 1940, becoming the first peacetime conscription in United States history. Hollywood reflected the interest of the American public in Conscription in the United States by having nearly every film studio bring out a military film comedy in 1941 with their resident comedian(s):
The minor studios such as Republic Pictures provided Bob Crosby and Eddie Foy Jr. as Rookies on Parade and Monogram Pictures enlisted Nat Pendleton as Top Sergeant Mulligan.
However, the first comedians to appear in an army comedy were the Stooges with Boobs in Arms. Columbia Pictures placed the Stooges in an unnamed army with military uniforms consisting of Zorro hats and tan uniforms with sergeant chevrons worn upside down to the American way; they are also armed with Civil War-type muskets instead of modern rifles.
Ironically, Richard Fiske (Sergeant Dare) was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II; he was killed in action in August 1944 in La Croix-Avranchin, France. Fiske was only 28.Richard Fiske (1915 - 1944) - Find A Grave Memorial
