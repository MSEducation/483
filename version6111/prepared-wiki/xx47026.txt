Cameo was a USA based budget record label, first flourishing in the 1920s, not connected with a later record label of the same name which was active in the 1950s and 1960s.
The Cameo Record Company was based in Manhattan, New York.  Cameo records were introduced in February 1922, selling for 50 cents each, and soon Cameo became one of the more popular budget labels.
Cameo Records are noted for a wealth of jazz-influenced 1920s dance music.  While there is little of outstanding importance on Cameo, a high percentage of Cameo Records have fairly good hot music.  New York based musicians such as Red Nichols, Miff Mole, Adrian Rollini, and Frank Signorelli made many trips to the Cameo studios.  Cameo also featured a series of recordings by noted early blues singer Lucille Hegamin.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mainspringpress.com/cameo.html|title= The Cameo Discography|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= November 24, 2009|work= The Mainspring Online Discography Project|publisher= Mainspring Press|accessdate=February 3, 2010[/tpl]  In 1926, Cameo started recording using a microphone-electrical process. An interesting blues number is 583, "Crazy Blues", by Salt & Pepper. Listen to the podcast at 26:46, where the disc is mentioned as an "early electric".
Cameo also owned the Lincoln Records and Romeo Records labels, as well as a subsidiary for making records for children, Cameo-Kid.  Cameo was purchased by Pathé Records in 1928; the label continued in use until 1930. Pathé was in turn acquired by the American Record Corporation.
