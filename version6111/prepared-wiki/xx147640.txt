The Claudia Quintet is an "eclectic post-jazz"Semi-Formal ensemble formed by drummer and composer John Hollenbeck.

==Personnel==

==History and name==

After the dissolution of the Refuseniks trio upon the departure of bassist Reuben Radding, Hollenbeck formed The Claudia Quintet.
{{cquote|Between sets on the Refuseniks' first gig, we met an attractive, bubbly, enthusiastic young lady named Claudia who rambled on incessantly about how "she was going to make this a regular thing" (coming to our regular gig), "she was going to invite and tell all of her friends", blah, blah, blah. When she was done captivating us (or at least me) with her good intentions, Reuben and I sauntered up to our instruments for the next set. He softly whispered, "She's never coming back". I was shocked, "What do you mean? She saidâ€¦" Reuben answered, "Trust me, she's never coming back." Reuben proved to be more experienced in this department; we never saw Claudia again.
Amongst the trio, we tried to continue this relationship with Claudia with casual remarks, such as "Hey, I saw Claudia on the street, she says hi," or "Claudia left me a message that she is definitely coming by next week." As time passed, our imaginations continued to recreate Claudia's life. Claudia, according to me, eventually became pregnant and moved to New Jersey with her dot.com entrepreneur boyfriend.
I chose to name this group The Claudia Quintet.
