Mickey's Revue is a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon, directed by Wilfred Jackson, which features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow performing a song and dance show.  This was also the debut of Goofy in the animated movie.

==Synopsis==

The short begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but is set apart from all that had come before by the inclusion of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. This cartoon introduced Dippy Dawg (later to be known as Goofy) as a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two spectators knocked him out with their mallets.
