Primary colors (or primary colours) are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors.  For human applications, three primary colors are usually used, since human color vision is trichromatic.
For additive combination of colors, as in overlapping projected lights or in CRT displays, the primary colors normally used are red, green, and blue. For subtractive combination of colors, as in mixing of pigments or dyes, such as in printing, the primaries normally used are cyan, magenta, and yellow,[tpl]cite book |title=Color and Its Applications |author=Matthew Luckiesh |year=1915 |publisher=D.

See RGB color model, CMYK color model, and RYB color model for more on these popular sets of primary colors.
Any particular choice for a given set of primary colors is derived from the spectral sensitivity of each of the human cone photoreceptors; three colors that fall within each of the sensitivity ranges of each of the human cone cells are red, green, and blue.The Science of Color - Steven K. Shevell, Optical Society of America - Google Books Other sets of colors can be used, though not all will well approximate the full range of color perception. For example, an early color photographic process, autochrome, typically used orange, green, and violet primaries.[tpl]cite book |title=The World's Work: Volume XV: A History of Our Time |author=Walter Hines Page and Arthur Wilson Page |publisher=Doubleday, Page & Company |year=1908 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hKPvxXgBN1oC&pg=PA9508&dq=autochrome+orange+violet+green [/tpl] However, unless negative amounts of a color are allowed the gamut will be restricted by the choice of primaries.
The combination of any two primary colors creates a secondary color.
The most commonly used additive color primaries are the secondary colors of the most commonly used subtractive color primaries, and vice versa.

==Biological basis==

Primary colors are not a fundamental property of light but are related to the physiological response of the eye to light. Fundamentally, light is a continuous spectrum of the wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye, an infinite-dimensional stimulus space.[tpl]cite book |title=Light |author=Michael I. Sobel |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-226-76751-5 |pages=52â€“62 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PDmAdQpmxl8C&pg=PA58&dq=spectrum+color+infinite-dimensional+cones [/tpl]  However, the human eye normally contains only three types of color receptors, called cone cells. Each color receptor responds to different ranges of the color spectrum.  Humans and other species with three such types of color receptors are known as trichromats.  These species respond to the light stimulus via a three-dimensional sensation, which generally can be modeled as a mixture of three primary colors.
Before the nature of colorimetry and visual physiology were well understood, scientists such as Thomas Young, James Clerk Maxwell, and Hermann von Helmholtz expressed various opinions about what should be the three primary colors to describe the three primary color sensations of the eye.[ref]

</ref> Young originally proposed red, green, and violet, and Maxwell changed violet to blue; Helmholtz proposed "a slightly purplish red, a vegetation-green, slightly yellowish (wave-length about 5600 tenth-metres), and an ultramarine-blue (about 4820)".<ref>
