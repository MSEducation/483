==History==

One of the first Serbian immigrants to the United States was the settler George Fisher, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1815 and later fought in the Texan Revolution. In the 1830s, many Serb sailors and fishermen from Montenegro and Herzegovina immigrated to New Orleans seeking employment. Other Serbs settled in Alabama and Mississippi, as well as California, where they joined the Gold Rush.[tpl]sfn|Henderson|Olasiji|1995|p=124[/tpl] Serb immigrants first came in significant numbers to the United States in the late 1800s from the Adriatic regions of Austria-Hungary and areas of the Balkans.[tpl]sfn|Alter|2013|p=1257[/tpl] During this time, most Serb immigrants to the United States settled in mid-western industrial cities or in California, which had a climate similar to that of the Dalmatian coast.[tpl]sfn|Powell|2005|p=267[/tpl] Serbian men often found employment in mines, and numerous Serb families moved to mining towns throughout the country. In 1943, many Serbian American miners were killed in the Smith Mine disaster in Montana.[tpl]sfn|Alter|2013|p=1257[/tpl] The number of Serbs that immigrated to the United States prior to World War II is difficult to determine as Serbian immigrants were often variously classified as Turks, Bulgarians, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians and Austro-Hungarians.[tpl]sfn|Powell|2005|p=267[/tpl]
During World War I, as many as 15,000 Serbian American volunteers returned to the Balkans to fight for the Allied cause in their homeland. Serbs in the United States who did not volunteer to fight marched for the creation of Yugoslavia, sent aid to the Balkans through the Red Cross, formed a Serbian Relief Committee, and urged notable Americans to support the Serbian cause. Distinguished Serbian American scientist Mihajlo Pupin, a friend of US President Woodrow Wilson, led the Serbian National Defence (SND), a Serbian American organization which collected money and attempted to influence American public opinion with regard to the Balkans.[tpl]sfn|Bock-Luna|2005|p=25[/tpl]
After World War II many Serbs immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia after the country came under the authoritarian rule of Communist leader Josip Broz Tito.[tpl]sfn|Powell|2005|pp=267-268[/tpl] Since then, many Serbian American cultural and religious organizations have been formed in the United States. With the fall of Communism and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Serbs in the United States have established several interests groups, the most organized of which is the Serbian Unity Congress (SUC).[tpl]sfn|Paul|2002|p=94[/tpl]
