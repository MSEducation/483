High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI or HDR) is a set of techniques used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity than possible using standard digital imaging or photographic techniques. HDR images can represent more accurately the range of intensity levels found in real scenes, from direct sunlight to faint starlight, and is often captured by way of a plurality of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter.[tpl]cite book |author=Reinhard, Erik; Ward, Greg; Pattanaik, Sumanta; Debevec, Paul |title=High dynamic range imaging: acquisition, display, and image-based lighting |year=2005 |quote=Images that store a depiction of the scene in a range of intensities commensurate with the scene are what we call HDR, or "radiance maps".

Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, resulting in the loss of detail in bright or dark areas. HDR compensates for this loss of detail by capturing multiple photographs at different exposure levels and combining them to produce a photograph representative of a broader tonal range.
The two primary types of HDR images are computer renderings and images resulting from merging multiple low-dynamic-range (LDR)[tpl]cite journal |title=Real-Time High Dynammic Range Texture Mapping |author=Cohen, Jonathan and Tchou, Chris and Hawkins, Tim and Debevec, Paul E. |journal=Proceedings of the 12th Eurographics Workshop on Rendering Techniques |editor=Steven Jacob Gortler and Karol Myszkowski |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=3-211-83709-4 |pages=313–320[/tpl] or standard-dynamic-range (SDR)[tpl]cite book |title=Advances in image and video technology: Second Pacific Rim Symposium (PSIVT) 2007, Santiago, Chile, December 17–19, 2007 |chapter=Fast automatic compensation of under/over-exposured image regions |author=Vassilios Vonikakis, Ioannis Andreadis |editor=Domingo Mery and Luis Rueda |publisher= |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-540-77128-9 |page=510 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=vkNfw8SsU3oC&pg=PA510&dq=hdr+sdr+%22standard+dynamic+range%22&q=hdr%20sdr%20%22standard%20dynamic%20range%22[/tpl] photographs. HDR images can also be acquired using special image sensors, like oversampled binary image sensor. Tone mapping methods, which reduce overall contrast to facilitate display of HDR images on devices with lower dynamic range, can be applied to produce images with preserved or exaggerated local contrast for artistic effect.

==Photography==

In photography, dynamic range is measured in EV differences (known as stops) between the brightest and darkest parts of the image that show detail. An increase of one EV or one stop is a doubling of the amount of light. Compare that, for example, 210=1024:
High-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard photographs, often using exposure bracketing, and then merging them into an HDR image. Digital photographs are often encoded in a camera's raw image format, because 8 bit JPEG encoding doesn't offer enough values to allow fine transitions (and introduces undesirable effects due to the lossy compression).
The images from any camera that allows manual exposure control can be used to create HDR images. This includes film cameras, though the images may need to be digitized so they can be processed with software HDR methods.
Some cameras have an auto exposure bracketing (AEB) feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the Canon EOS 40D, to the 18 EV of the Canon EOS-1D Mark II.[tpl]cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009[/tpl] As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufactures are now offering built-in HDR features. For example, the Pentax K-7 DSLR has an HDR mode that captures an HDR image and outputs (only) a tone mapped JPEG file.[tpl]cite web |title=The Pentax K-7: The era of in-camera High Dynamic Range Imaging has arrived! |url=http://www.adorama.com/alc/blogarticle/11608 |accessdate=18 August 2009[/tpl] The Canon PowerShot G12, Canon PowerShot S95 and Canon PowerShot S100 offer similar features in a smaller format.[tpl]cite web |title=Canon PowerShot G12 picks up HD video recording, built-in HDR |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/cameras/canon-powershot-g12-picks-up-hd-video-recording-built-in-hdr/?news=123[/tpl] Even some smartphones now include HDR modes, and most platforms have apps that provide HDR picture taking.[tpl]cite web |title=Apple – iPhone 4S – Shoot amazing photos with the 8MP camera.|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/built-in-apps/camera.html|accessdate=18 November 2011[/tpl]
Color film negatives and slides consist of multiple film layers that respond to light differently. As a consequence, transparent originals (especially positive slides) feature a very high dynamic range.[tpl]cite web |url=http://photo.net/learn/drange/ |title=Learn about Dynamic Range |publisher=photo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19[/tpl]

===Camera characteristics===

Camera characteristics such as gamma curves, sensor resolution, noise, photometric calibration and spectral calibration affect resulting high-dynamic-range images.[tpl]cite book |title=High Dynamic Range |edition=First |author=Asla M.

===Tone mapping===

Tone mapping reduces the dynamic range, or contrast ratio, of an entire image while retaining localized contrast.

====Software====

Several software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images. Notable titles include

===Comparison with traditional digital images===

Information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional digital images, which represent colors that should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called scene-referred, in contrast to traditional digital images, which are device-referred or output-referred. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human visual system (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called gamma encoding or gamma correction. The values stored for HDR images are often gamma compressed (power law) or logarithmically encoded, or floating-point linear values, since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.[tpl]cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4[/tpl]
HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than for traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g.m, 0..255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with as few as 10–12 bits for luminance and 8 bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author=Greg Ward, Anyhere Software[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=Max Planck Institute for Computer Science[/tpl]

==History of HDR photography==

===Mid-nineteenth century===

The idea of using several exposures to fix a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered as early as the 1850s by Gustave Le Gray to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, the luminosity range being too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.J. Paul Getty Museum. Gustave Le Gray, Photographer.

===Mid-twentieth century===

Manual tone mapping was accomplished by dodging and burning – selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction. This is effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph Schweitzer at the Lamp by W. Eugene Smith, from his 1954 photo essay A Man of Mercy on Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.
Ansel Adams elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called The Print, which features dodging and burning prominently, in the context of his Zone System.
With the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible, due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response over the years, or shot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by Charles Wyckoff and EG&G "in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force".[ref]
