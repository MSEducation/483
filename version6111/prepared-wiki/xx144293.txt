[[Actinin]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins

Actinin is a microfilament protein. α-Actinin is necessary for the attachment of actin filaments to the Z-lines in skeletal muscle cells,[tpl]cite book|title=Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 24th Edition|year=2012|publisher=Lange (Tata McGraw Hill)|page=100[/tpl] and to the dense bodies in smooth muscle cells. The functional protein is an anti-parallel dimer, which cross-links the thin filaments in adjacent sarcomeres, and therefore coordinated contractions between sarcomeres in the horizontal axis.
The non-sarcomeric α-actinins (ACTN1 and ACTN4) are widely expressed.  Both ends of the rod-shaped α-actinin dimer contain actin-binding domains.
Mutations in ACTN4 can cause the kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
