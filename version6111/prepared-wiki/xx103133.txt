[[Ground expression]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical logic, Logical expressions

In mathematical logic, a ground term of a formal system is a term that does not contain any free variables.
Similarly, a ground formula is a formula that does not contain any free variables. In first-order logic with identity, the sentence [tpl]all[/tpl] x (x=x) is a ground formula.
A ground expression is a ground term or ground formula.

==Examples==

Consider the following expressions from first order logic over a signature containing a constant symbol 0 for the number 0, a unary function symbol s for the successor function and a binary function symbol + for addition.

==Formal definition==

===Ground terms===

Ground terms are terms that contain no variables. They may be defined by logical recursion (formula-recursion):
Roughly speaking, the Herbrand universe is the set of all ground terms.

===Ground atom===

A ground predicate or ground atom or ground literal is an atomic formula all of whose argument terms are ground terms.
If p∈P is an n-ary predicate symbol and α1, α2, ..., αn are ground terms, then p(α1, α2, ..., αn) is a ground predicate or ground atom.
Roughly speaking, the Herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms, while a Herbrand interpretation assigns a truth value to each ground atom in the base.

===Ground formula===

A ground formula or ground clause is a formula without free variables.
Formulas with free variables may be defined by syntactic recursion as follows:
