Go Plastic is an electronic music album by Squarepusher. The album was preceded by the single "My Red Hot Car".
The album shows a marked increase in musical complexity over its predecessor, Selection Sixteen, featuring a more open-ended, less structured approach to composition which was explored further on Do You Know Squarepusher, and culminated with Ultravisitor.
The track "Tommib" was featured in the films Lost in Translation and Unleashed.

==Overview==

Unlike many of his earlier albums such as Hard Normal Daddy and Music Is Rotted One Note, which often prominently featured live instrumentation (particularly drums and bass guitar), the sound palette on Go Plastic is almost exclusively synthetic, with an emphasis on high-velocity breakbeats subjected to extensive manipulation and granular effects. In a contemporaneous interview, Squarepusher claimed to be 'fed up' with real instruments, wanting everything 'brutal and digital.'[tpl]YouTube|knnLsJ37PLI|TechTV interview 2001[/tpl]
Despite this, Squarepusher claims that the album was not produced using a computer but rather by utilizing a range of hardware including the Eventide DSP4000 and Orville digital effects processors, BOSS DR-660 and Yamaha QY700 sequencers, Yamaha TX81Z and FS1R synthesizers, and an Akai S6000 sampler.Rockin' On Magazine (Japan) interview 2004
