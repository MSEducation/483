Edward Covey (December 2, 1805 - May 2, 1875), a farmer of Talbot County, Maryland was an early 19th-century American slaveholder. He is described by Frederick Douglass in My Bondage and My Freedom (published in 1855) as a "first rate hand at breaking young negroes". In 1833, Douglass was rented to Covey for a year so that Covey would break the teenage slave's spirit.  One day, after numerous vicious beatings at Covey's hands, Douglass fought back. He fought off Covey's cousin and his fight with Covey himself, which lasted nearly two hours long, ended with Douglass's victory.  Covey did not physically assault Douglass thereafter.
