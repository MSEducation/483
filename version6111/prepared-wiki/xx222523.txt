Introduction To Mayhem is the major label debut album of American nu metal band Primer 55. Released on January 25, 2000, it is a reissue of the band's 1999 EP As Seen on TV. 
Much of the tracks were remixed to sound drastically different from the original EP versions, including the addition of overdubbed turntablism by Chris Kilmore and new hip hop instrumentation. Several bonus tracks were also added, and tracks that appeared on the original EP were deleted.
