George "Spanky" McFarland (October 2, 1928 – June 30, 1993) was an American actor most famous for his appearances as a child in the Our Gang series of short-subject comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. The Our Gang shorts were later syndicated to television as The Little Rascals.

==Early life==

McFarland was born in Denison, Texas,  on October 2, 1928 to Robert Emmett and Virginia Winifred McFarland (née Phillips).Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997. Texas: Texas Department of State Health Services. Microfiche. He had three siblings, Thomas ("Tommy," who himself appeared in a few Our Gang episodes as "Dynamite"), Amanda, and Roderick ("Rod").
Prior to joining the Our Gang comedies, "Sonny," as he was called by his family, modeled children's clothing for a Dallas department store and was also seen around the Dallas area on highway billboards and in print advertisements for Wonder Bread. This established Sonny early on in the local public's eye as an adorable child model and provided experience before cameras.

==Career==

===Our Gang===

In January 1931, in response to a trade magazine advertisement from Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, requesting photographs of "cute kids," Spanky's Aunt Dottie (Virginia's sister) sent pictures from Sonny's portfolio. An invitation for a screen test soon arrived, which happened that spring, leading to his acting career. Portions of Spanky's screen test are included in a 1932 Our Gang entry, aptly entitled Spanky.
McFarland's nickname "Spanky" is erroneously said to have arisen from warnings by his mother not to misbehave during one of the initial discussions with Hal Roach in his office. As the story goes, he had a habit of reaching out and grabbing things, and on doing so his mother Virginia would say, "Spanky, spanky, mustn't touch!" While this story has considerable folksy appeal, Spanky himself contradicted the tale, saying that the name was given by a Los Angeles newspaper reporter. The term "a spanky child" was late 19th century–early 20th century slang for an intelligent, gifted toddler. Spanky was an example of such a child in his earliest movies – a toddler who could act – so the name had meaning to the movie-going audience of that era that was lost for later generations. Use of the "Spanky" name by McFarland for subsequent business or personal activities was expressly granted to McFarland in one of his studio contracts. In later years some in his family would affectionately refer to him as "Spank."Maltin, Leonard and Bann, Richard W. (1977, rev. 1992). The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang, p. 118.

After his discovery at the age of three, he instantly became a key member of the Our Gang children's comedy movie series and one of Hollywood's stars. His earliest films show him as an outspoken toddler, grumpily going along with the rest of the gang. His scene-stealing abilities brought him more attention, and by 1935 he was the de facto leader of the gang, often paired with Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, and always the enterprising "idea man." Switzer's character became as much of a scene stealer as the young McFarland was, and the two boys' fathers fought constantly over screen time and star billing for their children.Maltin, Leonard and Bann, Richard W.

Spanky McFarland's only starring feature-film vehicle was the 1936 Hal Roach film General Spanky, an unsuccessful attempt to move the Our Gang series into features. He also appeared as a juvenile performer in many non-Roach feature films, including the Wheeler & Woolsey comedy Kentucky Kernels and two Fritz Lang features of the 1940s.
Following the 1938 Our Gang short Came the Brawn, McFarland "retired" from Our Gang, beginning a personal appearance tour.http://theluckycorner.com/rmt/166.html In mid-1938, Hal Roach sold the Our Gang unit to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who began casting for a new "team leader" character in Spanky's vein and ended up rehiring McFarland himself. He remained in the MGM Our Gang productions until his final appearance in the series, Unexpected Riches, in 1942 at age fourteen.

===Later years===

In 1952, at age 24, McFarland joined the U.S. Air Force. Upon his return to civilian life, indelibly typecast in the public's mind as "Spanky" from Our Gang, he found himself unable to find work in show business. He took less glamorous jobs, including work at a soft drink plant, a hamburger stand, and a popsicle factory. In the mid-1950s, when the Our Gang comedies were sweeping the nation on TV, McFarland hosted an afternoon children's show, The Spanky Show, on KOTV television in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The show included a studio audience and appearances by other celebrities such as James Arness, and it ran Little Rascals shorts.  The Spanky Show became the target of creative interference as station executives prevented McFarland from developing and expanding the show's format, and by 1960 McFarland had quit the show.Info about "The Spanky Show" can be found at tvparty.com
After that stint, he continued at odd jobs: selling wine, operating a restaurant and night club, and selling appliances, electronics and furniture. He was selling for Philco-Ford Corporation, where he advanced to national sales training director. As general manager, McFarland helped launch the classic movie channel, The Nostalgia Channel in 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&dat=19840704&id=Mv0jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iacEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1568,2143532|title='Nostagia' goes back to drawing board|work=Anchorage Daily News|date=July 4, 1984|accessdate=Jun 3, 2012[/tpl] During the 1990s, after his self-described "semi-retirement," Spanky lent his name and celebrity to help raise money for charities, primarily by participating in golf tournaments. Spanky also had his own namesake charity golf classic for 16 years, held in Marion, Indiana.
McFarland continued to make personal appearances and cameo roles in films and television, including an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show with Darla Hood and William "Buckwheat" Thomas. He also traveled the country doing speaking engagements and lectures about his movie roles and his days in The Little Rascals. His final television performance was in 1993, playing himself in the cold open of the Cheers episode "Woody Gets An Election".http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539930/
In January 1994, McFarland posthumously joined fellow alumnus Jackie Cooper to become one of only two Our Gang members to receive a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

==Death==

McFarland was in his bedroom getting dressed on June 30, 1993 when he collapsed. Paramedics had tried to revive him for approximately 30 minutes before transporting him to Baylor University Medical Center in Grapevine, Texas. He was pronounced dead within 40 minutes of being admitted. It was later determined that McFarland had died of cardiac arrest. His remains were cremated shortly thereafter.[tpl]cite news |first=|last=Knight-Ridder Newspapers|title=George ‘Spanky’ McFarland, former Little Rascal, is dead.|work=The Reading Eagle |date=July 1, 1993 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JWQxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O6IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1362,144619&dq=george+mcfarland+died&hl=en |accessdate=December 27, 2011[/tpl] He has a headstone at the Texas State Cemetery.[tpl]cite web|title=George Robert Phillips McFarland|url=http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form822.asp?pers_id=10744|publisher=Texas State Cemetery[/tpl]
