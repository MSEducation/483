You can't have your cake and eat it (too) is a popular English idiomatic proverb or figure of speech.[tpl]cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cake?view=uk |title=Definition of cake in English |publisher=Oxford Dictionaris |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] Many people misunderstand the meanings of "have" and "eat" as used here but still understand the proverb in its entirety and intent and use it in this form. Some people feel this form of the proverb is incorrect and illogical and instead prefer "you can't eat your cake and have it (too)", which is in fact closer to the original form of the proverb[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=eat+your+cake+and+have%2C+have+your+cake+and+eat&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3 |title=Ngram Viewer |publisher=Google |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] (see further explanations below) but very rare today. Other rare variants use "keep" instead of "have".[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=eat+your+cake+and+have%2Chave+your+cake+and+eat%2Ckeep+your+cake+and+eat%2Ceat+your+cake+and+keep&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share= |title=Ngram Viewer |publisher=Google |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl]
The proverb literally means "you cannot both possess your cake and eat it", "you cannot eat the cake and keep it" or "you can't eat the cake and have it still". It can be used to say that one cannot or should not have or want more than one deserves or can handle, or that one cannot or should not try to have two incompatible things. The proverb's meaning is similar to the phrases "you can't have it both ways" and "you can't have the best of both worlds." Conversely, in the positive sense, it refers to "having it both ways" or "having the best of both worlds."
Having to choose whether to have or eat your cake illustrates the concept of trade-offs or opportunity cost.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zyp_l6KziGoC |page=154 |title=John Stuart Mill's Political Philosophy: Balancing Freedom and the Collective Good |isbn=9781847143440 |author1=Fitzpatrick |first1=John R |date=2006-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=haxW_nawT0sC&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=17 |title=Ontology and Economics: Tony Lawson and His Critics |isbn=9780203888773 |author1=Fullbrook |first1=Edward |date=2008-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UvAOAQAAMAAJ |page=49 |title=Principles of economics |isbn=9780060465285 |author1=Suits |first1=Daniel Burbidge |year=1973[/tpl]

==History==

The order of the clauses in the saying has been the subject of some debate, and was even used in forensic linguistics (contributing to the identification and arrest of the so-called Unabomber[tpl]cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002762.html |title=Language Log: Forensic linguistics, the Unabomber, and the etymological fallacy|accessdate=2013-05-20[/tpl]).
An early recording of the phrase is in a letter on 14 March 1538 from Thomas, Duke of Norfolk to Thomas Cromwell, as "a man can not have his cake and eate his cake".[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=854|title=Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Volume 13 Part 1: January-July 1538 (p. 189 ref. 504)|publisher=Institute of Historical Research ("Sponsor")|accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl]
The phrase occurs with the clauses reversed in John Heywood's "A dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue" from 1546, as "wolde you bothe eate your cake, and have your cake?".[tpl]OED|cake[/tpl] In John Davies' "Scourge of Folly" of 1611, the same order is used, as "A man cannot eat his cake and haue it stil."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&pg=PA614&dq=“A+man+cannot+eat+his+cake+and+haue+it+stil.”|title=The Yale Book of Quotations|accessdate=2013-01-04|isbn=9780300107982|author1=Shapiro|first1=Fred R|year=2006[/tpl] In Jonathan Swift's 1738 farce "Polite Conversation", the character Lady Answerall says "she cannot eat her cake and have her cake."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=msVEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341&dq=%22She+cannot+eat+her+cake+and+have+her+cake%22|accessdate=2013-01-04|title=The Works of Jonathan Swift ...: Containing interesting and valuable papers|author1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|year=1841[/tpl]
The order was reversed again in a posthumous adaptation of "Polite Conversation" in 1749, "Tittle Tattle; or, Taste A-la-Mode", as "And she cannot have her Cake and eat her Cake."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GJgNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22And+she+cannot+have+her+Cake+and+eat+her+Cake%22|title=Tittle Tattle|accessdate=2013-01-04|author=Timothy Fribble (Pseud.), Jonathan Swift|year=1749[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20FOB-onlanguage-t.html|title=Have Your Cake and Eat It Too|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-08-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ableinnovationsblog.com/?p=750|title=Eat/Have, Have/Eat Your Cake!|publisher=ABLE Innovations Blog|accessdate=2012-08-25[/tpl] From 1812 (R. C. Knopf's "Document Transcriptions of War of 1812" (1959) VI. 204) is a modern-sounding recording as "We cannot have our cake and eat it too."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-IpkOkM3IfEC&pg=PT336&dq=“We+cannot+have+our+cake+and+eat+it+too."|title=Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs|accessdate=2013-01-04|isbn=9780199539536|author1=Speake|first1=Jennifer|year=2008[/tpl]

==Literal meaning==

Paul Brians, Professor of English at Washington State University, points out that perhaps a more logical or easier to understand version of this saying is, "You can’t eat your cake and have it too." Professor Brians writes that a common source of confusion about this idiom stems from the verb to have which in this case indicates that once eaten, keeping possession of the cake is no longer possible, seeing that it is in your stomach (and no longer exists as a cake).[tpl]cite book|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/eatcake.html|title=Common Errors in English: Eat Cake|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=2008-03-26[/tpl]
Alternatively, the two verbs can be understood to represent a sequence of actions, so one can indeed "have" one's cake and then "eat" it. Consequently, the literal meaning of the reversed idiom doesn't match the metaphorical meaning. The phrase can also have specialized meaning in academic contexts; Classicist Katharina Volk of Columbia University has used the phrase to describe the development of poetic imagery in Latin didactic poetry, naming the principle behind the imagery's adoption and application the "have-one's-cake-and-eat-it-too principle".[tpl]cite book|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-01-26.html|title=Katharina Volk, The Poetics of Latin Didactic.
