Spanish language in the Americas, also known as American Spanish ([tpl]lang-es|Español americano[/tpl]), refers to the Spanish spoken in the Americas, as opposed to European Spanish. Linguistically, this grouping is somewhat arbitrary, akin to having a term for "overseas English" encompassing variants spoken in the United States, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand and Ireland, but not England. The point is that there is great diversity among the various American dialects, and it would be hard to point to one trait shared by all of them which is not also in existence in one or more of the variants of Spanish used in Spain.
Of the more than 469 million people who speak Spanish as their mother tongue, more than 418 million are in Latin America and the United States.Lipski, J. "The role of the city in the formation of Spanish American dialect zones"
There are numerous regional particularities and idiomatic expressions within Spanish. In American Spanish, loanwords directly from English are relatively more frequent, and often foreign spellings are left intact. One notable trend is the higher abundance of loan words taken from English in Latin America as well as words derived from English.  In Latin America they speak of la computadora while in Spain it's el ordenador, and each word sounds foreign in the region where it is not used. Some differences are due to Iberian Spanish having a stronger French influence than Latin America, where, for geopolitical reasons, the United States influence has been predominant throughout the twentieth century.

==Main features==

Pronunciation varies from country to country and from region to region, just as English pronunciation varies from one place to another. In general terms, the speech of the Americas shows many common features akin to southern Spanish dialects, especially to western Andalusia (Seville, Cádiz) and the Canary Islands. Coastal dialects throughout Latin America show particularly strong similarities to Atlantic-Andalusian speech patterns while inland regions in Mexico and Andean countries are not similar to any particular dialect in Spain.

==Accent==

To understand the concept of the Latin American accents in Spanish, one must remember that every country in Latin America has different accents in this language, many of which are very similar. This is caused by interaction of different accents.
Spaniards arrived from many regions within Spain and brought with them their own regional dialects/accents. However, the great majority of Spanish immigrants to Latin America throughout its history came from the Hispano-Arabic area of Spain known as Andalusia. Another great majority arrived from North Africa, most notably the Canary Islands. Canarian and Latin American dialects share a similar intonation which, in general terms, means that stressed vowels are usually quite long. When visiting Tenerife or Las Palmas (Islas Canarias, Spain), Latin Americans are usually taken at first hearing for fellow-Canarians from a distant part of the Canary archipelago. It is the accents of these regions which served as the basis of the style of Spanish spoken in Latin America. Other Spanish immigrants like Castilians (another native Spanish-speaking people), Catalans, Galicians, and Basques also settled Latin America and affected the accents.
Native Americans who were met by Spaniards also affected the accents. Their languages, together with the strong influence of the Canarian dialect, have added to Latin American Spanish the softer sing-song speaking tone. Africans were brought to Latin America in as slave labor, the majority for work on coastal or lowland sugar plantations. They contributed hundreds of words, colloquialisms, intonations, and rhythm.
In late 19th century, European settlers of non-Spanish origin (including Italians, Germans, Britons, Scandinavians, Poles, and Russians) and Middle Eastern settlers (mostly Arabs from Lebanon and Syria) arrived in Hispanic America and affected various Latin American accents.
