"Il ragazzo della via Gluck" is a famous Italian song by artist Adriano Celentano. The lyrics meaning "The boy from Gluck Street" were by Luciano Beretta and Miki Del Prete and music by Celentano himself. It was released in 1966 as a double-A side single by Celentano alongside "Chi era lui". The lyrics for the latter were by Mogol and Miki Del Prete and music by Paolo Conte. "Il ragazzo della via Gluck/Chi era lui" single was arranged by Detto Mariano.

==History==

The song originally appeared in March 1966 in Celentano's album La festa and in the follow-up Celentano album Il ragazzo della via Gluck released in November 1966.
The song was launched at the Sanremo Festival in 1966 with little success and was eliminated from competition after the first night. But it gained great favour with fans making it the best-known and most representative song of Celentano, with many autobiographical references; Via Gluck was the street of Milan where he lived as a boy singer with the family, and "eight years" ("...passano gli anni, ma 8 son lunghi...." meaning "the years go by ... 8 long years....") is a reference to the top of Celentano's recording career from 1958 to 1966.
