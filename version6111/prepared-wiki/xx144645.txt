In 1956 Josephine Burtschi purchased the home and began restoring it to its original appearance. Burtschi, a local artist and historian was born in the home. Within the home's six rooms are furniture, china, engravings and books acquired from descendants of state officers, legislators and the Ferdinand Ernst Colony. The library in the home, called the Berry-Hall Room is a tribute to James William Berry, a talented Illinois artist and Judge James Hall who established Vandalia as "the first literary center west of Cincinnati. Through the years the home has been renovated and furnished with period furnishings and early artifacts of Vandalia.
