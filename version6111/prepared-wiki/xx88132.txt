Triglav (Bosnian, Croatian, Slovenian and Serbian Latin: Triglav; Ukrainian, Russian,  Macedonian,  Bulgarian and Serbian Cyrillic: Триглав; Czech and Slovak: Trihlav; [tpl]lang-pl|Trygław, Trzygłów[/tpl]; Belarusian:Трыглаў) (meaning 'three headed') also sometimes called troglav is a deity in Slavic mythology.
Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia, is unlikely to have any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 439. However, such a claim is made[tpl]by whom|date=March 2013[/tpl] for Mount Troglav, the highest peak of Dinara in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[tpl]cn|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Triglav is depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to others that serve as the representatives of the above mentioned realms. An early variation included Svarog, Perun, and Dajbog. Later, Dajbog was replaced by Svetovid or Veles. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods. 
Triglav is depicted as a three-headed man sometimes with bands of (gold) blindfolds over his eyes, or a man with three goat heads. Several temples dedicated to Triglav existed near present-day Szczecin, Poland. During the period of Christianization, these temples and statues of Triglav were completely destroyed.

==Three heads==

According to the writing of Ebbo, Triglav's heads were believed to represent sky, earth and the underworld. It was  believed that Triglav has three heads because he ruled these three kingdoms  and had a golden binding over his eyes and lips so he could not see people's sins nor speak about them.[ref]Ebbo, Vita Ottonts episcopi Bambergensis.
