Lights Out is the sixth studio album by the British rock band UFO, released in May and also on October 11, 1977 (see 1977 in music). All songs are band originals except for "Alone Again Or" which is a cover of a song by the band Love. 
The album was UFO's first to feature lush string arrangements alongside more complex song structures than their previous albums.  Producer Ron Nevison brought in Alan McMillan to handle the string and horn arrangements. The most notable song to feature the orchestral coloring was "Love to Love" which became one of the bands most successful singles.  
In 1994, a CD comprising this album and No Heavy Petting was released by BGO Records. 2008 EMI's remastered edition includes 4 live bonus tracks, recorded at The Roundhouse, London, the album cover states that these tracks were recorded in 1976 this is wrong, the tracks were recorded at The Roundhouse, London, in 1977. 
However EMI did get it right with the writing credits, with Paul Raymond at last being credited for his contributions.
The title track and "Love to Love" were featured in the 1999 movie Detroit Rock City. "Love to Love" was also covered by Djali Zwan for the 2002 movie Spun.
Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 28 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time".
