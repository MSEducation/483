==Memoirs== 
Colvin published her book of memoirs, Diamond in the Rough, in 2012. She says the book is about her survival from anorexia, clinical depression, alcoholism , motherhood, career crises, and relationships with men.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/us/shawn-colvin-releases-diamond-in-the-rough-a-memoir.html?_r=0|title=Surviving a Struggle with a Sense of Hope|accessdate=April 10, 2014[/tpl]“I hope it’s comical for readers to keep track of them,” she said. “That was my intention".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/us/shawn-colvin-releases-diamond-in-the-rough-a-memoir.html?_r=0|title=Surviving a Struggle with a Sense of Hope|accessdate=April 10, 2014[/tpl]
Andy Langer in The New York Times calls the book "candid about her heartaches but also comically self-deprecating. She balances the serious admission that she needs medication to combat her depression with a funny anecdote about the time she wet herself on national television while dancing with ’N Sync during a late ’90s Disney Christmas special".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/us/shawn-colvin-releases-diamond-in-the-rough-a-memoir.html?_r=0|title=Surviving a Struggle with a Sense of Hope|accessdate=April 10, 2014[/tpl]
