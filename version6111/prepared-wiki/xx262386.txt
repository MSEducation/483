The opinions of the Khatm-e-Nubuwwat Academy are corroborated by religious verdicts from across the world. They include Fatwa from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, America, South Africa and the UK. These verdicts confirm that Muslims categorically reject the Ahmadiyya community as being part of the Muslim community.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Well before this media report, the spokesperson for the academy had publicly denounced the assassination of Salman Taseer, expressed support for Aasia Bibi and criticized the wrong application of the blasphemy laws to the case

==Criticism==

In 2010, The Independent reported that the Khatme Nubuwwat Academy was allegedly being behind a campaign to kill Ahmadi Muslims in the UK.
At the time, the website belonging to the Academy described Ahmadis as nothing but a gang of traitors, apostates and infidels.  With reference to this, Akber Choudhry, a spokesman for the Academy stated, The words 'apostates' and 'infidels' are understood differently in English than in their Islamic theological sense, especially within the Urdu-speaking Muslims, and can be replaced by terms more sensitive to the current climate in which the connotations of these words have changed quite rapidly in the past few years
. The questionable phrases have since been removed and replaced.

==In the Media==

After The Independent article, BBC[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11947734|title=Ahmadiyya 'targeted by hate campaign'[/tpl] and Channel 4 [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/hate-crime-investigation-into-threats-against-ahmadi-muslims|title=Hate crime investigation into threats against Ahmadi Muslims[/tpl] also picked up the story and alleged that pamphlets advocating the killing of Ahmadis had been distributed in South London.
These media reports came days before a long-scheduled parliamentary debate on the attacks on the Ahmadiyya places of worship in Lahore, Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101020/halltext/101020h0001.htm|title=UK Parliament Debate about Ahmadiyya Community[/tpl] The application of Blasphemy Law in Pakistan was also aired in this debate, and due to the proximity of the media reports, the role of the Khatm-e-Nubuwwat Academy was also highlighted by Siobhain McDonagh, the MP for the area where the alleged 'killing' leaflets had been circulated. She specifically referenced the Wimbledon Guardian report.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/8451668.Relgious_hate_leaflets_found_in_Tooting__Streatham_and_Kingston/|title=Religious hate leaflets found in Tooting, Streatham and Kingston[/tpl]
The Crown Prosecution Service decided that no crime had been committed and no charges were brought. An Ahmadiyya spokesperson said that a judicial review was being considered and Lord Avebury asked for an inquiry into the CPS decision. However, no judicial review or inquiry occurred. Avebury remarked that the threshold for prosecution was too high and questioned why only one case had been filed since the law came into being.
