Alumni Gymnasium is a building on the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.  When it opened in 1924, replacing Alumni Hall (now known as Barker Hall and Buell Armory), it was a 2,800 seat multi-purpose arena, serving as home to the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball team.  It was replaced when the Memorial Coliseum opened in 1950. The building is now a student recreation facility, and is frequently used for recreational and intramural basketball. It is also the current home to the University of Kentucky Club Dodgeball team and the UK Men's Club Volleyball team.
