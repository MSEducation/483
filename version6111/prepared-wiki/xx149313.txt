Barabus (rendering of Tatar barabız (we are going)  + English bus) was a winter public transport in 19th century-beginning of 20th century, probably the first public transport in Kazan, after cabs. They were operated by private carriers, that were poor Tatar commoners from surrounding villages. Typical barabus was a sledge, sheeted with sacking. Barabus was a transport of paupers, competing with cabs, horse railways and later tramway. Until 1930s, when trams were installed at the suburbs and any private enterprise was prohibited, barabuses were the only transport to connect quarters of poor mill-hands with other parts of the city.
