[[Longest English sentence]]

CATEGORIES: English grammar, World records, Superlatives

There have been several claims for the longest sentence in the English language, usually with claims that revolve around the longest printed sentence. There is no absolute limit on the length of a written English sentence. A sentence can be made as long as time allows with concatenating (linking) clauses using grammatical conjunctions such as and. Sentences can also be extended indefinitely by the addition of modifiers and modifier clauses, such as

This ability to embed structures iteratively within larger ones is called recursion.[tpl]cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction - Third Edition|year=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Singapore|pages=33[/tpl] This also highlights the difference between linguistic performance and linguistic competence, because the language can support more variation than can reasonably be created or recorded. Human language grammars are phrase-generation systems, so—in their simplest forms—they must have infinite output. The deeper, more recursive structures reflect similarities among linguistic constituents and operations, but a listener can understand these structures without going into a deeper analysis.[ref]Stabler, Edward P., Recursion in grammar and performance,
