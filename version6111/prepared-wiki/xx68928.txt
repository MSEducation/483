Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the southern right whale (E. australis). They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice. Right whales can grow up to [tpl]convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weigh up to [tpl]convert|100|ST|t LT[/tpl], significantly larger than humpbacks or grays, but smaller than blues.
All three species are migratory, moving seasonally to feed or give birth. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that isolates the northern and southern species from one another. In the Northern Hemisphere, Right whales tend to avoid open waters and stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods. In the Southern Hemisphere, right whales feed far offshore in summer, but a large portion of the population occur in near shore waters in winter. Right whales feed mainly on copepods but also consume krill and pteropods. They may forage the surface, underwater or even on the ocean bottom. During courtship, males gather into large groups to compete for a single female, suggesting that sperm competition appears to be an important factor in mating behavior. Although the blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, the testes of the right whale are actually ten times larger than those of the blue whale – with each weighing up to [tpl]convert|525|kg|lb[/tpl], they are by far the largest of any animal on Earth. Gestation tends to last a year, and calves are born at [tpl]convert|1|ST|t LT[/tpl] in weight and [tpl]convert|4|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Weaning occurs after eight months.
Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were a preferred target for whalers. Today, the North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the most endangered whales in the world, and both species are protected in the United States by the Endangered Species Act. The western populations of both are currently endangered, with their total populations numbering in the hundreds. The eastern North Pacific population, on the other hand, with less than 50 individuals remaining, is critically endangered[tpl]IUCN2012.1 |assessors=Reilly, S.B.; Bannister, J.L.; Best, P.B.; Brown, M.; Brownell Jr.; R.L., Butterworth, D.S.; Clapham, P.J.; Cooke, J.; Donovan, G.P.; Urbán, J.; Zerbini, A.N.|year=2008|id=133706|title=Eubalaena japonica (Northeast Pacific subpopulation)|downloaded=30 September 2012[/tpl] – further still, the eastern North Atlantic population, which numbers in the low teens at best, may already be functionally extinct.[tpl]cite web|title=North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) 5-year review: Summary and Evaluation  |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service |location=Gloucester, MA |date=August 2012 |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/species/narightwhale_5yearreview.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 December 2012 |quote=The western North Atlantic population numbered at least 361 individuals in 2005 and at least 396 in 2010 (Waring et al. 2012).[/tpl]  Although no longer facing a threat from whaling, mankind remains by far the greatest threat to these species: the two leading causes of death are from being struck by ships, and from entanglement in fishing gear.

==Naming==

A popular explanation for the name "right whales" is that they were the "right" ones to hunt,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defenders.org/north-atlantic-right-whale/basic-facts|title=North Atlantic right whale | Basic Facts About Right Whales | Defenders of Wildlife|publisher=Defenders.org|date=|accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl] as they float when killed and often swim within sight of shore. They are quite docile, and do not tend to shy away from approaching boats. As such, they were hunted nearly to extinction during the active years of the whaling industry. This origin is apocryphal. In his history of American whaling, Eric Jay Dolin writes:
[tpl]quote|Despite this highly plausible rationale, nobody actually knows how the right whale got its name. The earliest references to the right whale offer no indication why it was called that, and some who have studied the issue point out that the word "right" in this context might just as likely be intended "to connote 'true' or 'proper,' meaning typical of the group."|E.J.

==Taxonomy==

The right whales were first classified in the Balaena genus in 1758 by  Carolus Linnaeus, who at the time considered all of the right whales (including the bowhead) as a single species.  Through the 1800s and 1900s, in fact, the Balaenidae family has been the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, Balaena mysticetus. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were in fact different, and John Edward Gray proposed the Eubalaena genus for the right whale in 1864.  Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale—one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern Ocean.[tpl]cite journal|author=Müller, J.|year=1954|title=Observations of the orbital region of the skull of the Mystacoceti|journal=Zoologische Mededelingen|volume=32|pages=239–90|url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/149549|format=PDF[/tpl] As recently as 1998, Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, Marine mammals of the world: systematics and distribution, listed just two species: Balaena glacialis (the right whales) and Balaena mysticetus (the bowheads).[tpl]Cite journal: Rice cetacea classification[/tpl]
In 2000, two studies of DNA samples from each of the whale populations concluded the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale.[tpl]cite journal|author=Malik, S., M. W. Brown, S.D. Kraus and B.N.

In 2001, Brownell et al. re-evaluated the conservation status of the North Pacific right whale as a distinct species,[tpl]cite journal|author=Brownell, R. L. Jr., P.J. Clapham, T. Miyashita and T. Kasuya|year=2001|title=Conservation status of North Pacific right whales|journal=Journal of Cetacean Research and Management (Special Issue)|volume=2|pages=269–286[/tpl] and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus.[tpl]cite web|title=List of Marine Mammal Species and Subspecies|url=http://www.marinemammalscience.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=645&Itemid=340|work=Committee on Taxonomy|publisher=Society for Marine Mammology|accessdate=29 September 2012|date=3 April 2012[/tpl] A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude the three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.
The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa; the point where each node branches is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the Balaenidae family serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the three right whales and the bowhead whale.

Whale lice, parasitic cyamid crustaceans that live off skin debris, offer further information through their own genetics. Because these lice reproduce much more quickly than whales, their genetic diversity is greater. Marine biologists at the University of Utah examined these louse genes and determined their hosts split into three species 5–6 million years ago, and these species were all equally abundant before whaling began in the 11th century.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2005|volume=14|pages=3439–3456|title=Population histories of right whales (Cetacea: Eubalaena) inferred from mitochondrial sequence diversities and divergences of their whale lice (Amphipoda: Cyamus)|author=Kaliszewska, Z.

===Others===

The pygmy right whale (Capera marginata), a much smaller whale of the Southern Hemisphere, was also included in the Balaenidae family, but has recently been found to warrant a separate family, Neobalaenidae. Yet another species of right whale was proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century - the so-called "Swedenborg whale". The description of this species was based on a collection of fossil bones unearthed at Norra Vånga, Sweden, in 1705 and believed to be those of giants. The bones were examined by Swedenborg, who realized they belong to a species of whale. The existence of this species has been debated, and further evidence for this species was discovered during the construction of a motorway in Strömstad, Sweden in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090605110420.htm|title=Prehistoric Whale Discovered On The West Coast Of Sweden|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|date=June 5, 2009|accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl] To date, however, scientific consensus still considers Hunterius swedenborgii to be a North Atlantic right whale.[tpl]cite web|last=Perrin|first=W.F.|title=Hunterius swedenborgii Lilljeborg, 1867|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/cetacea/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=383652|publisher=World Cetacea Database|accessdate=29 September 2012|year=2012[/tpl] According to a DNA analysis conducted by scientists, it was later confirmed that the fossil bones are actually from a Bowhead Whale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/whale-bones-found-highway-were-not-mystery-whale|title=Whale bones found in highway were not from mystery whale|publisher=ScienceNordic.com|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=March 26, 2013[/tpl]

===Synonyms and common names===

Due to their familiarity to whalers over a number of centuries, the right whales have had many names. These names were used throughout the world, reflecting the fact that only one species was recognized at the time. In his novel Moby-Dick, Herman Melville writes:
[tpl]quote|"Among the fishermen, the whale regularly hunted for oil is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland whale; the black whale; the great whale; the true whale; the right whale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. ... Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the Right whale of the Americans."| Melville, Moby Dick: or, The White Whale, Ch. XXXII Cetology[tpl]cite book|last=Melville|first=Herman|title=Moby Dick: or, the White Whale|year=1892|publisher=L.C. Page & Company|location=Boston|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cyokAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false|authorlink=Herman Melville|page=131|chapter=XXXII Cetology[/tpl][/tpl]
In fact, there was indeed a difference between the two – Melville's "Greenland whale", or "Greenland right whale", was in fact the modern-day bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus.
The following are junior synonyms for the genus Eubalaena:[tpl]cite web|last=Perrin|first=W.F.|title=Eubalaena Gray, 1864|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/cetacea/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=159022 |publisher=World Cetacea Database|accessdate=29 September 2012|year=2012[/tpl]
Although the right whale is now officially in the Eubalaena genus, the type species for a genus remains as it was first described – in the case of Eubalaena the type species is Balaena australis Desmoulins, 1822.
Some of the species-level synonyms are:

==Description==

Unlike other whales, a right whale has distinctive callosities (roughened patches of skin) on its head, along with a broad back without a dorsal fin, occasionally with white belly patches, and a long, arching rostrum, or upper jaw, that begins above the eye.  The callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice).[tpl]cite book |author= Carwardine, M.H.; Hoyt, E.|title=Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises|year=1998|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=Surry Hills, NSW|isbn=0-86449-096-8[/tpl] Each individual has a unique callosities pattern. Right whales can grow up to [tpl]convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weigh up to [tpl]convert|100|ST|t LT[/tpl], significantly larger than humpbacks or grays, but smaller than blues. An unusually large 40% of their body weight is blubber, which is of relatively low density. Consequently, unlike many other species of whale, dead right whales tend to float.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/2006jmorph.pdf|title=Morphological Specializations of Baleen Whales Associated With Hydrodynamic Performance and Ecological Niche|journal=Journal of Morphology|year=2006|volume=267|pages=1284–1294|quote=The true buoyancy of a particular whale is dependent upon its body composition, particularly the relative quantities of muscle and blubber tissues. Balaenopterid whales have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant while the opposite is true for right whales (Lockyer, 1976).|last1=Woodward|first1=Becky L.|last2=Winn|first2=Jeremy P.|last3=Fish|first3=Frank E.|doi=10.1002/jmor.10474|pmid=17051544|issue=11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Body weights of some species of large whales|author=Lockyer, C.|journal=Journal du Conseil Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer|year=1976|volume=36|issue=3|pages=259–273|doi=10.1093/icesjms/36.3.259[/tpl] Right whales swim slowly, reaching only [tpl]convert|5|kn|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] at top speed. However, they are highly acrobatic and frequently breach (jump clear of the sea surface), tail-slap and lobtail.

===Anatomy===

Adults may be between [tpl]convert|11|-|18|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and typically weigh [tpl]convert|60|-|80|ST|t LT[/tpl]. The most typical lengths are [tpl]convert|13|-|16|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The body is extremely thick with girth as much as 60% of total body length in some cases. The tail fluke is broad (up to 40% of body length). The North Pacific species is on average the largest of the three species. The largest specimens may weigh [tpl]convert|100|ST|t LT[/tpl]. Right whales have a distinctive wide V-shaped blow, caused by the widely spaced blowholes on the top of the head. The blow rises [tpl]convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above the surface. Right whales have between 200 and 300 baleen plates on each side of their mouths. These are narrow and approximately [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and are covered in very thin hairs. The plates enable the whale to filter feed.
The penis on a right whale can be up to [tpl]convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] – the testes, at up to [tpl]convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, [tpl]convert|78|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter, and weighing up to 525 kg (1157 lbs), are also by far the largest of any animal on Earth.[tpl]cite book|last1=Feldhamer|first1=George A.|last2=Thompson|first2=Bruce C.|last3=Chapman|first3=Joseph A.|title=Wild mammals of North America : biology, management, and conservation|year=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801874161|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-xQalfqP7BcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA432#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=2nd ed.|page=432[/tpl] The blue whale may be the largest animal on the planet, but the testicles of the right whale are actually ten times the size of those of the blue whale.  They also exceed predictions in terms of relative size, as well – they are six times larger than would be expected on the basis of body mass. Together, the testicles make up nearly 1% of the right whale's total body weight.  This strongly suggests sperm competition is important in mating, which correlates to the fact that right whales are highly promiscuous.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Eubalaena_glacialis.html|title=Eubalaena glacialis: North Atlantic right whale: Information|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|work=Animal Diversity Web|year=2002|accessdate=April 30, 2006|author=Crane, J.|author2=Scott, R.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Brownell, Jr.|first1=Robert L.|title=Potential for sperm competition in baleen whales|last2=Ralls|first2=K.|journal=Report of the International Whaling Commission|year=1986|volume=8|issue=8|pages=97–112[/tpl]

==Life history and ecology==

===Courtship and reproduction===

During the mating season, which can occur at any time in the North Atlantic, right whales gather into "surface-active groups" made up of as many as 20 males consorting a single female. The female has her belly to the surface while the males stroke her with their flippers or keep her underwater. The males do not compete as aggressively against each other as male humpbacks. The female may not become pregnant but she is still able to assess the condition of potential mates.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last=Kenney|first=Robert D.|editor=Perrin, W. F.; Wursig, B.; Thewissen, J.

===Lifespan===

Very little is known about the life span of right whales. One of the few well-documented cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.[tpl]cite book|last=Katona|first=S. K. and S. D. Kraus|editor=J. R. Twiss and R. R. Reeves|title=Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals|year=1999|publisher=Smithsonian Press|pages=311–331|chapter=Efforts to conserve the North Atlantic right whale[/tpl]

===Feeding and predation===

The right whales' diets consist primarily of zooplankton, primarily the tiny crustaceans called copepods, as well as krill, and pteropods, although they are occasionally opportunistic feeders. As with other baleens, they feed by filtering prey from the water. They swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. The whale then expels the water, using its baleen plates to retain the prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be large enough that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough that it cannot escape. The "skimming" may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies.
The right whales' three known predators are humans, orcas, and sharks. When danger lurks, a group of right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which sometimes proves to be an ineffective defense. The sheer size of this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.

===Range and habitat===

The three Eubalaena species inhabit three distinct areas of the globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to Alaska and all areas of the Southern Ocean. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer to stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.
Because the oceans are so large, it is very difficult to accurately gauge whale population sizes. Approximate figures:

====North Atlantic right whale====

Almost all of the 400 North Atlantic right whales live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In northern spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth.[tpl]cite web|author=Moore, M.|date=November 3, 2004|title=Whither the North Atlantic Right Whale?: Scientists explore many facets of whales' lives to help species on the edge of extinction|publisher=Woods Hole Oceangraphic Institution|accessdate=August 10, 2012|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2482[/tpl] There have been a smattering of sightings further east over the past few decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003.

====North Pacific right whale====

The North Pacific right whale appears to occur in two populations. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38016305/ns/technology_and_science/?gt1=43001|title=Smallest whale population identified|work=Discovery News|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=May 19, 2012|author=Viegas, Jennifer[/tpl] A larger western population of 100-200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very little is known about this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns  are not known.[tpl]cite web|title=North Pacific Right Whale|publisher=Alaska Sea Grant Marine Education|url=http://seagrant.uaf.edu/marine-ed/mm/fieldguide/right-whale.html|accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl]

====Southern right whale====

The last major population review of southern right whales by the International Whaling Commission was in 1998.  Researchers used data about adult female populations from three surveys (one in each of Argentina, South Africa and Australia) and extrapolated to include unsurveyed areas and estimated counts of males and calves (using available male:female and adult:calf ratios), giving an estimated 1997 population of 7,500 animals.  More recent data from 2007 indicate those survey areas have shown evidence of strong recovery, with a population approaching twice that of a decade earlier. However, other breeding populations are still very small, and data are insufficient to determine whether they, too, are recovering.[tpl]IUCN2012.1|assessors= Reilly, S.B.; Bannister, J.L.; Best, P.B.; Brown, M.; Brownell Jr.; R.L., Butterworth, D.S.; Clapham, P.J.; Cooke, J.; Donovan, G.P.; Urbán, J.; Zerbini, A.N.|year=2008|id=8153|title=Eubalaena australis|downloaded=30 September 2012[/tpl]
The southern right whale spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand and South Africa.[tpl]cite web|title=Southern right whales of Patagonia|publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society|accessdate=August 7, 2012|url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/southern_right_whales_patagonia_argentina.pdf[/tpl] Since hunting of the southern right whale ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.

===Vocalization and hearing===

Vocalizations made by right whales are not elaborate compared to those made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500 Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may be a form of communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts to reduce the number of ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.[tpl]cite news|last=Rincon|first=Paul|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3256406.stm|title=Northern Right Whales respond to emergency sirens|publisher=BBC News|date=December 3, 2003|accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Gaines CA, Hare MP, Beck SE, Rosenbaum HC|title=Nuclear markers confirm taxonomic status and relationships among highly endangered and closely related right whale species|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2895|date=March 7, 2005|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=272|issue=1562|pages=533–542|pmid= 15846869|pmc=1578701[/tpl]

==Relationship to humans==

===Whaling===

Right whales were so named because early whalers considered them the "right" whale to hunt. In the early centuries of shore-based whaling before 1712, right whales were virtually the only catchable large whales, for three reasons:
Basque people were the first to hunt right whales commercially, beginning as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque  voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.
"Yankee whalers" from the new American colonies replaced the Basques. Setting out from Nantucket, Massachusetts and Long Island, New York, they took up to 100 animals in good years. By 1750, the commercial hunt of the North Atlantic right whale was basically over. The Yankee whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The southernmost Brazilian whaling station was established in 1796, in Imbituba. Over the next hundred years, Yankee whaling spread into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, where the Americans were joined by fleets from several European nations. The beginning of the 20th century saw much greater industrialization of whaling, and the harvest grew rapidly. By 1937, there had been, according to whalers' records, 38,000 takes in the South Atlantic, 39,000 in the South Pacific, 1,300 in the Indian Ocean, and 15,000 in the North Pacific. The incompleteness of these records means the actual take was somewhat higher.[tpl]cite book|last1=Tonnessen|first1=J.N.|last2=Johnsen|first2=A.O.|year=1982|title=The History of Modern Whaling|publisher=C. Hurst & Co.|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-905838-23-8[/tpl]
As it became clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued off the coast of Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Randall R.|last2=Stewart|first2=Brent S.|last3=Clapham|first3=Phillip J.|last4=Powell|first4=James.

===Whale watching===

The southern right whale has made Hermanus, South Africa one of the world centers for whale watching. During the winter months (July–October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline, visitors can watch whales from strategically placed hotels.[tpl]cite web|title=Whale Watching in Hermanus at the Windsor Hotel|publisher=Windsor Hotel website|accessdate=August 10, 2012|url=http://www.windsorhotel.co.za/[/tpl] The town employs a "whale crier" (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.[tpl]cite web|title=Hermanus Whale Crier|publisher=SA Venues.com|accessdate=August 7, 2012|url=http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/hermanus-whale-crier.htm[/tpl] Southern right whales can also be watched at other winter breeding grounds.

==Conservation==

Both the North Atlantic and North Pacific species are listed as a "species threatened with extinction which is or may be affected by trade" (Appendix I) by CITES, and as "endangered" by the IUCN Red List. In the United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), a subagency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified all three species as  "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are listed as "depleted".[tpl]cite web|title=North Atlantic Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis)|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/rightwhale_northatlantic.htm|work=NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=North Pacific Right Whales (Eubalaena japonica)|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/rightwhale_northpacific.htm|work=NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Southern Right Whales (Eubalaena australis)|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/rightwhale_southern.htm|work=NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl]
The southern right whale is listed as "endangered" under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, as "nationally endangered" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, as a "natural monument" by the Argentine National Congress, and as a "State Natural Monument" under the Brazilian National Endangered Species List.
The US and Brazil added new protections for right whales in the 2000s to address the two primary hazards. While environmental campaigners were, as reported in 2001, pleased about the plan's positive effects, they attempted to force the US government to do more.[tpl]cite news|author=Author not specified |title=Right whales need extra protection|publisher=BBC News|date=November 28, 2001|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1681532.stm|accessdate=May 2, 2006[/tpl] In particular, they advocated [tpl]convert|12|kn|km/h[/tpl] speed limits for ships within [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of US ports in times of high right whale presence. Citing concerns about excessive trade disruption, it did not comply. The Defenders of Wildlife, the Humane Society of the United States and the Ocean Conservancy sued the NMFS in September 2005 for "failing to protect the critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, which the agency acknowledges is 'the rarest of all large whale species' and which federal agencies are required to protect by both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act", demanding emergency protection measures.[tpl]cite journal|author=The Southeast United States Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team and the Northeast Implementation Team|title=NMFS and Coast Guard Inactions Bring Litigation|date=November 2005|journal=Right Whale News|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://www.narwc.org/pdf/rwn/rwnov05.pdf|accessdate=May 2, 2006|format=PDF[/tpl] According to NOAA researchers, about 83% of right whale sightings in the mid-Atlantic region occur within [tpl]convert|20|nmi|km[/tpl] of shore.
The southern right whale, listed as "endangered" by CITES and "lower risk - conservation dependent" by the IUCN, is protected in the jurisdictional waters of all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some [tpl]convert|1560|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species' main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote whale watching.[tpl]cite web|title=Área de Proteção Ambiental|url=http://www.baleiafranca.org.br/area/area.htm|publisher=Projeto Baleia Franca|accessdate=4 September 2012|language=Portuguese[/tpl]
On February 6, 2006, NOAA proposed its Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales.NOAA.  Proposed Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales. The proposal, opposed by some shipping interests, limited ship speeds during calving season. The proposal was made official when on December 8, 2008, NOAA issued a press release that included the following:
The Stellwagen Bank area has implemented an autobuoy program to acoustically detect right whales in the Boston Approaches and notify mariners via the Right Whale Listening Network website.

===Threats===

The leading cause of death among the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates through some of the world's busiest shipping lanes while journeying off the east coast of the United States and Canada, is from being struck by ships.The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, the result is that the marine animal is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage.[tpl]cite web|author=Vanderlaan & Taggart|title=Vessel collisions with whales: the probability of lethal injury based on vessel speed|publisher=Mar. Mam. Sci|year=2007|url=http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/~taggart/Publications/Vanderlaan_Taggart_MarMamSci-23_2007.pdf|accessdate=May 10, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] At least 16 ship-strike deaths were reported between 1970 and 1999, and probably more remain unreported. According to NOAA, 25 of the 71 right whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.[tpl]cite web|last=NOAA|title=Press Release on Effective Date of Speed Regulations|date=December 8, 2008|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/shipstrike/pressrelease_effective.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 21, 2008[/tpl] Recognizing this toll could tip the delicately balanced species towards extinction, in July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan.[tpl]cite web|title=Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=1997|url=http://www.nero.noaa.gov/whaletrp/|accessdate=May 2, 2006[/tpl] A key part of the plan was the introduction of mandatory reporting of large whale sightings by ships using US ports.
A second major cause of morbidity and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled.[tpl]cite web|title=Whales Entangled In Fishing Lines: What Can Be Done?|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=August 7, 2012|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070426143431.htm[/tpl] If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Animal welfare and extinction concerns align in emphasizing the harm of such entanglements.
The U.S. Navy proposed plans to create a new undersea naval training range immediately adjacent to northern right whale calving grounds in shallow waters off the Florida/Georgia border.  Legal challenges by leading environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council were recently denied in federal court, allowing the Navy to proceed.Whale Defenders Lose Navy Training Challenge, courthousenews.com, accessed on 9/20/2012Right Whales Wronged, NRDC Blog, accessed 9/10/2012  These rulings were made despite the extremely low numbers (as low as 313 by some estimates) of right whales in existence at this time, and a very poor calving season.Poor Calving Season for Right Whales, Savannah Morning News Savannahnow.com, April 1, 2012
