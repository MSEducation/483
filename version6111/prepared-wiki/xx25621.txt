In 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize the Nazi crimes as propaganda and took steps against it:

Eisenhower, upon finding the victims of the death camps, ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. He wrote the following to General Marshall after visiting a German internment camp near Gotha, Germany: [tpl]quote|The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they there were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to "propaganda".Eisenhower, Dwight D., Dear General: Eisenhower's Wartime Letters to Marshall, p. 223, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999[/tpl]

==History and development after World War II==

===Harry Elmer Barnes===

Harry Elmer Barnes, at one time a mainstream historian, assumed a Holocaust-denial stance in his later years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vho.org/GB/Books/tmotsm/A5.html |title=Harry Elmer Barnes: Zionist Fraud |publisher=Vho.org |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] Between World War I and World War II, Barnes became an anti-war writer and a leader in the historical revisionism movement. Starting in 1924, the American worked closely with the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War, a German government-funded think tank whose sole purpose was to disseminate the official government position that Germany was the victim of Allied aggression in 1914 and that the Versailles Treaty was morally invalid.Herwig, Holger "Clio Deceived" pp. 5-44 from International Security, Volume 12, Issue 2, Fall 1987, pp. 22-23 & 26 Headed by Major Alfred von Wegerer, a völkisch activist, the organization portrayed itself as a scholarly society, but historians later described it as a "a clearinghouse for officially desirable views on the outbreak of the war."Herwig, Holger "Clio Deceived" pp. 5–44 from International Security, Volume 12, Issue 2, Fall 1987, pp. 21–23 & 26
Following World War II, Barnes became convinced that allegations made against Germany and Japan, including the Holocaust, were wartime propaganda used to justify the United States' involvement in World War II. Barnes claimed there were two false claims made about World War II, namely that Germany started the war in 1939, and the Holocaust, which Barnes claimed did not happen.Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust (New York: Free Press, 1993) p. 75.
In his 1962 pamphlet, Revisionism and Brainwashing, Barnes claimed that there was a "lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct".Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust, Free Press: New York, 1993, pp. 73–74. Barnes argued that there was "a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans".Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust (New York: Free Press, 1993) p. 74. He claimed that in order to justify the "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the "scapegoat" for their own misdeeds.
Barnes cited the French Holocaust denier Paul Rassinier, whom Barnes called a "distinguished French historian" who had exposed the "exaggerations of the atrocity stories". In a 1964 article, "Zionist Fraud", published in the American Mercury, Barnes wrote: "The courageous author Rassinier lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner."Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust, Free Press: New York, 1993 page 74. Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939, and that reports of the Holocaust were propaganda to justify a war of aggression against Germany.

===Beginnings of the modern denial movement===

In 1961, the American historian and a leading protégé of Barnes, David Hoggan published Der Erzwungene Krieg (The Forced War) in West Germany, which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939. Though Der Erzwungene Krieg was primarily concerned with the origins of World War II, it also down-played or justified the effects of Nazi antisemitic measures in the pre-1939 period.Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, New York : Free Press ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York ; Oxford : Maxwell Macmillan International, 1993 page 71 For an example, Hoggan justified the huge one billion Reich-mark fine imposed on the entire Jewish community in Germany after the 1938 Kristallnacht as a reasonable measure to prevent what he called "Jewish profiteering" at the expense of German insurance companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the Kristallnacht (in fact, 91 German Jews were killed in the Kristallnacht). Subsequently, Hoggan wrote one of the first books denying the Holocaust in 1969 entitled The Myth of the Six Million, which was published by the Noontide Press, a small Los Angeles publisher specializing in antisemitic literature.Gottfired, Ted: Deniers Of The Holocaust: Who They Are, What They Do, Why They Do It (Twenty-First Century Books, 2001). Page 29 Hoggan became one of the early stars of the Holocaust denial movement, because he had a number of university professorships.
In 1964, French historian Paul Rassinier published The Drama of the European Jews. Rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor (imprisoned in Buchenwald for his having helped French Jews escape the Nazis), and modern-day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust. Critics argued that Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions; he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast Zionist/Allied/Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust, a theme that would be picked up in later years by other authors.Deborah E. Lipstadt, History on Trial, Harcourt:2005 ISBN 0-06-059376-8
The publication of Arthur Butz's The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The case against the presumed extermination of European Jewry in 1976; and David Irving's Hitler's War in 1977 brought other similarly inclined individuals into the fold.Deborah Lipstadt, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory 1994 In December 1978 and January 1979, Robert Faurisson, a French professor of literature at the University of Lyon, wrote two letters to Le Monde claiming that the gas chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist. A colleague of Faurisson, Jean-Claude Pressac, who initially shared Faurisson's views, later became convinced of the Holocaust's evidence while investigating documents at Auschwitz in 1979. He published his conclusions along with much of the underlying evidence in his 1989 book, Auschwitz: Technique and operation of the gas chambers.
Henry Bienen, the former president of Northwestern University, has described Arthur Butz's view of the Holocaust as an "embarrassment to Northwestern".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html|title=Message from President Bienen, Northwestern University|last=Bienen|first=Henry S.|date=February 6, 2006|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=September 20, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501100921/http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html |archivedate = May 1, 2007[/tpl] In 2006, sixty of Butz's colleagues from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a censure describing Butz's Holocaust denial as "an affront to our humanity and our standards as scholars".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://dailynorthwestern.com/2006/02/16/archive-manual/students-faculty-oppose-butz-with-petitions/|title=Students, faculty oppose Butz with petitions|last=Elizabeth|first=Campbell|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|accessdate=May 17, 2012[/tpl] The letter also called for Butz to "leave our Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic excellence".

===Institute for Historical Review===

In 1978 Willis Carto founded the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) as an organization dedicated to publicly challenging the commonly accepted history of the Holocaust.Chip Berlet & Matthew J. Lyons, Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort, New York: Guilford Press, 2000, p. 189. The IHR sought from the beginning to attempt to establish itself within the broad tradition of historical revisionism, by soliciting token supporters who were not from a neo-Nazi background such as James J. Martin and Samuel Edward Konkin III, and by promoting the writings of French socialist Paul Rassinier and American anti-war historian Harry Elmer Barnes to attempt to show that Holocaust denial had a broader base of support besides just neo-Nazis. The IHR brought most of Barnes' writings, which had been out of print since his death, back into print. While IHR included articles on other topics and sold books by mainstream historians in its catalog, the majority of material published and distributed by IHR was devoted to questioning the facts surrounding the Holocaust.Richard J. Evans, Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial, Basic Books, 2002 (ISBN 0-465-02153-0). The IHR became one of the most important organizations devoted to Holocaust denial; however, it suffered a reversal in 1981 as the result of a lawsuit brought by public interest attorney William John Cox on behalf of his client, Auschwitz survivor Mel Mermelstein. In response to Cox's motion for summary judgment, the court took "judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944". The court went on to say, "It is simply a fact." In recent years the IHR underwent an internal power struggle which ousted Willis Carto and put Mark Weber in charge. Carto went on to found the Barnes Review magazine after his ouster from IHR, a magazine which is also devoted to Holocaust denial.
In the "About the IHR" statement on their website, the IHR states, "The IHR does not 'deny' the Holocaust. Indeed, the IHR as such has no 'position' on any specific event.... The IHR does not necessarily agree with the content or outlook of posted or distributed the IHR website, and presentations given at IHR meetings and conferences."http://ihr.org/main/about.shtml One example of a Holocaust denialist's view that was published by the IHR is the transcript of the speech made by the Lutheran pastor Herman Otten at the Ninth IHR Conference (1989), in which he says [tpl]quote|There is no dispute over the fact that large numbers of Jews were deported to concentration camps and ghettos, or that many Jews died or were killed during World War II. Revisionist scholars have presented evidence, which "exterminationists" have not been able to refute, showing that there was no German program to exterminate Europe's Jews, and that the estimate of six million Jewish wartime dead is an irresponsible exaggeration. The Holocaust – the alleged extermination of some six million Jews (most of them by gassing) – is a hoax and should be recognized as such by Christians and all informed, honest and truthful men everywhere.Journal for Historical Review, 1993, 13, 5, p. 32[/tpl]
Commentators and historians have noted the misleading nature of statements by the IHR that they are not Holocaust deniers. Paul Rauber writes that: [tpl]quote|The question whether the IHR denies the Holocaust appears to turn on IHR's Humpty-Dumpty word game with the word Holocaust. According to Mark Weber, associate editor of the IHR's Journal of Historical Review Director of the IHR, "If by the 'Holocaust' you mean the political persecution of Jews, some scattered killings, if you mean a cruel thing that happened, no one denies that. But if one says that the 'Holocaust' means the systematic extermination of six to eight million Jews in concentration camps, that's what we think there's not evidence for." That is, IHR doesn't deny that the Holocaust happened; they just deny that the word 'Holocaust' means what people customarily use it for.Paul Rauber, East Bay Express, January 17, 1992, page 4.[/tpl] According to British historian of Germany Richard J. Evans:

===Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust===

In 1987, Bradley R. Smith, a former media director of the Institute for Historical Review,Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today: United States of America founded the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH)."Poisoning the Web – Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust." ADL. 2001. April 24, 2008. In the United States, CODOH has repeatedly tried to place newspaper advertisements questioning whether the Holocaust happened, especially in college campus newspapers."Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust: The New College Try". ADL. 2001. April 24, 2008. Some newspapers have accepted the advertisements, while others have rejected them."The 1999–2000 Bradley Smith Campus Newspaper Campaign". ADL. 2001. April 24, 2008. Bradley Smith has more recently sought other avenues to promote Holocaust denial – with little success. On September 8, 2009, the Harvard Crimson school paper ran a paid ad from Bradley R Smith. It was quickly criticized and an apology was issued from the editor, claiming it was a mistake.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/09/09/massachusetts.harvard.holocaust/index.html|title=Harvard Crimson says Holocaust denial ad published by accident|last=Buxbaum|first=Evan|date=September 10, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 10, 2009[/tpl]
Bradley referred to his tactics as the CODOH campus project. Bradley says, "I don't want to spend time with adults anymore, I want to go to students. They are superficial. They are empty vessels to be filled." "What I wanted to do was I wanted to set forth three or four ideas that students might be interested in, that might cause them to think about things or to have questions about things. And I wanted to make it as simple as possible, and to set it up in a way that could not really be debated."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/smith_codoh/words.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&xpicked=2&item=10 |title=Bradley Smith, Holocaust Denial, Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] Holocaust deniers have placed ...

===James Keegstra===

In 1984, James Keegstra, a Canadian high-school teacher, was charged with denying the Holocaust and making antisemitic claims in his classroom as part of the course material. Keegstra and his lawyer, Doug Christie, argued that the section of the Criminal Code of Canada (now section 319{2}), is an infringement of the Charter of Rights (section 9{b}). The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, where it was decided that the law he was convicted under did infringe on his freedom of expression, but it was a justified infringement. Keegstra was convicted, and fired from his job.[ref]

===Zündel trials===

The Toronto-based photo retoucher Ernst Zündel operated a small-press publishing house called Samisdat Publishing, which published and distributed Holocaust-denial material such as Did Six Million Really Die? by Richard Harwood (a.k.a. Richard Verrall – a British neo-Nazi leader). In 1985, he was tried in R. v. Zundel and convicted under a "false news" law and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an Ontario court for "disseminating and publishing material denying the Holocaust".[tpl]cite court|litigants=R. v. Zundel |vol=|reporter=|opinion=|pinpoint=|court=|date=August 27, 1992|url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992rcs2-731/1992rcs2-731.html[/tpl] The Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg was a notable witness for the prosecution at the 1985 trial. Zündel gained considerable notoriety after this conviction, and a number of free-speech activists stepped forward to defend his right to publish his opinions. After his conviction in 1985, Zündel was able to have it overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. The 1988 trial was notable for the appearance of Fred A. Leuchter, David Irving and Robert Faurisson as defense witnesses for Zündel, and for the presentation of the pseudo-scientific Leuchter report as a defense document. The Leuchter report was published in Canada in 1988 by Samisdat Publishers and in Britain in 1989 by Irving's Focal Point Publishing. In both of his trials, Zündel was defended by Douglas Christie and Barbara Kulaszka. His conviction was overturned in 1992 when the Supreme Court of Canada declared the "false news" law unconstitutional.
Zündel has a website, web-mastered by his wife Ingrid, which publicises his viewpoints.Zundelsite Accessed June 27, 2007 In January 2002, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal delivered a ruling in a complaint involving his website, in which it was found to be contravening the Canadian Human Rights Act. The court ordered Zündel to cease communicating hate messages. In February 2003, the American INS arrested him in Tennessee, USA, on an immigration violations matter, and few days later, Zündel was sent back to Canada, where he tried to gain refugee status. Zündel remained in prison until March 1, 2005, when he was deported to Germany and prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda. On February 15, 2007, Zündel was convicted on 14 counts of incitement under Germany's Volksverhetzung law, which bans the incitement of hatred against a portion of the population, and given the maximum sentence of five years in prison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=c61ce061-50b2-42a5-bb2f-a7bbaecccceb&k=32537 | title = German court sentences Ernst Zundel to 5 years in prison for Holocaust denial | agency=The Canadian Press | publisher=canada.com | date= February 15, 2007 | accessdate =February 15, 2007[/tpl]

===Ernst Nolte===

The German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte, starting in the 1980s, advanced a set of theories, which though not denying the Holocaust appeared to flirt with Holocaust denial as a serious historical argument.Evans, Richard J. In Hitler's Shadow New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 83. In a letter to the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka of December 8, 1986 Nolte criticized the work of the French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson on the ground that the Holocaust did occur, but went on to argue that Faurisson’s work was motivated by what Nolte claimed were the admirable motives of sympathy towards the Palestinians and opposition to Israel.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988 page 190. In his 1987 book Der europäische Bürgerkrieg (The European Civil War), Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are "often honourable", and that some of their claims are "not obviously without foundation".Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust, New York: Free Press, 1993 page 214 Nolte himself, though he has never denied the occurrence of the Holocaust, has claimed that the Wannsee Conference of 1942 never happened, and that the minutes of the conference were post-war forgeries done by "biased" Jewish historians designed to discredit Germany.
The British historian Ian Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the "negative myth" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by "biased" Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress are not exclusively Germans or fascists.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretations, London: Arnold, 1989 page 176 In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something. In a 1990 interview, Nolte implied that there was something to the Leuchter report: "If the revisionists deniers and Leuchter among them have made it clear to the public that even 'Auschwitz' must be an object of scientific inquiry and controversy then they should be given credit for this. Even if it finally turned out that the number of victims was even greater and the procedures were even more horrific than has been assumed until now."Brinks, Jan Hermann Children of a New Fatherland, London: I.B. Tauris, 2000 page 108. In his 1993 book Streitpunkte (Points of Contention), Nolte praised the work of Holocaust deniers as superior to "mainstream scholars".Wistrich, Robert S. "Holocaust Denial" pages 293–301 from The Holocaust Encyclopedia edited by Walter Laqueur, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 299 Nolte wrote that "radical revisionists have presented research which, if one is familiar with the source material and the critique of the sources, is probably superior to that of the established historians of Germany".Lukacs, John The Hitler of History New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 233. In a 1994 interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Nolte stated "I cannot rule out the importance of the investigation of the gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of the process engendered by Zyklon B", and that "'Of course, I am against revisionists, but Fred Leuchter's 'study' of the Nazi gas ovens has to be given attention, because one has to stay open to 'other' ideas."[ref]
</ref>
The British historian Richard J. Evans in his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadow expressed the view that Nolte’s reputation as a scholar was in ruins as a result of these and other controversial statements on his part.Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow, New York, NY: Pantheon, 1989 page 123 The American historian Deborah Lipstadt in a 2003 interview stated: 

===Mayer controversy===

In 1988, the American historian Arno J. Mayer published a book entitled Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?, which did not deny the Holocaust, but appeared to lend support to Holocaust denial by stating that the majority of people who died at Auschwitz were the victims of diseases rather than gassing.Dawidowicz, Lucy What Is The Use of Jewish History?, New York: Schocken Books, 1992 pages 129–130 In addition, critics of Mayer such as Lucy Dawidowicz assailed him for listing the works of Arthur Butz and Paul Rassinier in his bibliography, and charged his statements about Auschwitz were factually incorrect.Dawidowicz, Lucy What Is The Use of Jewish History?, New York: Schocken Books, 1992 page 130 Holocaust expert Robert Jan van Pelt has noted that Mayer's book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial.Pelt, Robert Jan van The Case for Auschwitz, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002 pages 47–48 Holocaust deniers such as David Irving have often cited Mayer’s book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial. Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his book does not deny the Holocaust as Holocaust deniers often claim.[ref]
</ref>
Holocaust deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer's sentence in Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? that "Sources for the study of the gas chambers at once rare and unreliable"Shermer, Michael & Grobman, Alex Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 page 126. as the authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have noted that the paragraph from which the sentence is taken states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable".Shermer, Michael & Grobman, Alex Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 pages 126–127.
The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that Mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial".Baurer, Yehuda "A Past That Will Not Away" pages 12–22 from The Holocaust and History edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abrahm Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 page 15.

===Ken McVay and alt.revisionism===

Ken McVay, an American resident in Canada, was disturbed by the efforts of organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center to suppress the speech of the Holocaust deniers, feeling that it was better to confront them openly than to try to censor them. On the Usenet newsgroup alt.revisionism he began a campaign of "truth, fact, and evidence", working with other participants on the newsgroup to uncover factual information about the Holocaust and counter the arguments of the deniers by proving them to be based upon misleading evidence, false statements, and outright lies. He founded the Nizkor Project to expose the activities of the Holocaust deniers, who responded to McVay with personal attacks, slander, and death threats.O.B.C Biography – Kenneth McVay

===David Irving and the Lipstadt libel case===

Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book Denying the Holocaust was sharply critical of questionable analytical methods used by various Holocaust deniers, in particular British author David Irving, whom she accused of deliberately misrepresenting evidence to justify his preconceived conclusions. In 1996 Irving filed a libel suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books. American historian Christopher Browning, an expert witness for the defense, wrote a comprehensive essay for the court summarizing the voluminous evidence for the reality of the Holocaust, and under cross-examination, effectively countered all of Irving's principal arguments to the contrary.[tpl]cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J. Evans | title = Telling Lies about Hitler | publisher=Verso | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-85984-417-0 | page = 35 [/tpl] Cambridge historian Richard J. Evans, another defense expert witness, spent two years examining Irving's writings, and confirmed his misrepresentations, including evidence that he had knowingly used forged documents as source material. The judge, Justice Charles Gray, ultimately delivered a long and decisive verdict in favor of Lipstadt that referred to Irving as a "Holocaust denier" and "right-wing pro-Nazi polemicist."Lipstadt, History on Trial
In February 2006 Irving was arrested in Austria, where Holocaust denial is illegal, for a speech he had made in 1989 in which he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz. Irving was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant, but chose to go to Austria anyway "to give a lecture to a far-right student fraternity"."Holocaust denier to be released" (December 20, 2006): BBC News Retrieved January 13, 2011. Although he pleaded guilty to the charge, Irving said he had been "mistaken", and had changed his opinions on the Holocaust. "I said that then, based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews."BBC Report Holocaust Denier is Jailed, February 20, 2006. Irving served 13 months of a 3-year sentence in an Austrian prison, and was deported in early 2007. The episode sparked intense international debate over the limits of freedom of speech. Upon hearing of Irving's sentence, Lipstadt said, "I am not happy when censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via censorship.... The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth."
According to CNN, upon Irving's return to the UK, he "vowed to repeat views denying the Holocaust that led to his conviction" stating he felt "no need any longer to show remorse" for his Holocaust views.[tpl]wayback|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html|title=Holocaust denier: 'No need to show remorse'|date=20070116221731[/tpl]

==Recent developments and trends==

In February 1995 a Japanese magazine named Marco Polo, a 250,000-circulation monthly, ran a Holocaust denial article by physician Masanori Nishioka which stated:
The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center instigated a boycott of Bungei Shunju advertisers, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Cartier. Within days, Bungei Shunju shut down Marco Polo and its editor, Kazuyoshi Hanada, quit, as did the president of Bungei Shunju, Kengo Tanaka."The IHR Denounces Campaign Against Japanese Publishing Company," The Journal of Historical Review, March/April 1995 (Vol. 15, No. 2), page 9.
In Turkey, in 1996, the Islamic preacher Harun Yahya distributed thousands of copies of a book which was originally published the previous year, entitled Soykırım Yalanı ("The Holocaust Lie") and mailed unsolicited texts to American and European schools and colleges.Michael Hopkins, "Harun Yahya and Holocaust Revisionism", The TalkOrigins Archive draft: December 7, 2003. The publication of Soykırım Yalanı sparked much public debate.AXT 1996 report on antisemitism in Turkey This book claims, "what is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans."The Holocaust Deception In March 1996, a Turkish painter and intellectual, Bedri Baykam, published a strongly worded critique of the book in the Ankara daily newspaper Siyah-Beyaz ("Black and White"). A legal suit for slander was brought against him. During the trial in September, Baykam exposed the real author of the book as Adnan Oktar.

In France, Holocaust denial became more prominent in the 1990s as négationnisme, though the movement has existed in ultra-left French politics since at least the 1960s, led by figures such as Pierre Guillaume (who was involved in the bookshop La Vieille Taupe during the 1960s). Recently, elements of the extreme far right in France have begun to build on each other's negationist arguments, which often span beyond the Holocaust to cover a range of antisemitic views, incorporating attempts to tie the Holocaust to the Biblical massacre of the Canaanites, critiques of Zionism, and other material fanning what has been called a "conspiratorial Judeo-phobia" designed to legitimize and "banalize" antisemitism.Richard Joseph Golsan, Vichy's Afterlife, University of Nevada Press, 2003, p. 130.
In Belgium in 2001, Roeland Raes, the ideologue and vice-president of one of the country's largest political parties, the Vlaams Belang (formerly named Vlaams Blok, Flemish Bloc), gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of Anne Frank's diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.Belgium's far right party in Holocaust controversy, The Guardian, Friday, March 9, 2001. Three years later, the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband. Immediately afterwards, it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) with the same leaders and the same membership.Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist, BBC News, November 9, 2004.

===Holocaust denial in the Arab world===

Denials of the Holocaust have been occasionally promoted by various Middle Eastern figures and media. According to Associated Press reports, Arab world attitudes towards the Holocaust vary considerably.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/palestinian-children-sing-for-holocaust-survivors-1.272879 |title= Palestinian children sing for Holocaust survivors  |date=March 25, 2009 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090908/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_palestinians_un_holocaust|title=UN caught in Gaza dispute over study of Holocaust|last=Laub|first=Karin|date=September 8, 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 8, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090915182155/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090908/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_palestinians_un_holocaust |archivedate=September 15, 2009[/tpl]ADL on Holocaust Denial, MEMRI In 2009, a University of Haifa survey revealed that 40.5 percent of Israeli Arabs claim the Holocaust never happened.[tpl]cite news |author=Fadi Eyadat |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/survey-finds-nearly-half-of-israeli-arabs-deny-holocaust-1.276206 |title=Survey finds nearly half of Israeli Arabs deny Holocaust |newspaper=Haaretz |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2014[/tpl] Prominent Arab figures from the Middle East have rarely made publicized visits to Auschwitz—but Israel's Arab community is an exception.

According to civil liberties and human rights lawyer Michael Ratner, the use of the Holocaust as a narrative to justify victimizing the Palestinians is likely the main culprit of the presence of Holocaust denial among Palestinians:
School of Oriental and African Studies professor Gilbert Achcar has argued that "Holocaust denial in Arab countries ... finds its roots in Israel's exploitation of the Holocaust for political purposes. It also serves as a simplistic explanation for Western support of the Zionist state and as an outlet for frustrations created by Israel's oppressive supremacy.http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/14340/1/AssessingHolocaustDenial_Achcar.pdf On a similar vein, prominent French historian and opponent of Holocaust Denial Pierre Vidal-Naquet opined, "Those who, in Israel or elsewhere, make political use of the Shoah, are running the risk of making this into not a historical truth, but a 'political truth', as the deniers' sect puts it, in other words something which can be crushed by more incisive reasoning."
Holocaust denial has also been resisted by prominent intellectual figures in the Arab world; in 2001, an outcry led by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, Lebanese writer Elias Khoury, Edward Said, and others brought about the cancellation of a conference the Holocaust denial organization Institute for Historical Review had planned to hold in Beirut.Anti-defamation League website article on Institute for Historical Review, visualised September 1, 2006 In 2007, the founder of the Islamic Movement in Israel, Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish, condemned Holocaust denial in the Muslim world (especially that by Mahmoud Ahmedinejad).[tpl]cite news |author=Amiram Barkat |date=February 12, 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/founder-of-islamic-movement-in-israel-slams-holocaust-denial-1.212724 | title=Founder of Islamic Movement in Israel slams Holocaust denial | newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=March 23, 2014[/tpl] In August 2002, the Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up, an Arab League think-tank whose Chairman, Sultan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, served as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, promoted a Holocaust denial symposium in Abu Dhabi.Arab League to participate in Holocaust-denial symposium, The Jerusalem Post, August 28, 2002 The government of the United Arab Emirates closed down the Zayed Center as a result.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

===Holocaust denial in Iran===

Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad frequently denied the Holocaust,[ref]Variously:
The remarks immediately provoked international controversy as well as swift condemnation from government officials in Israel, Europe, and the United States. All six political parties in the German parliament signed a joint resolution condemning this Holocaust denial.German parliament slams Ahmadinejad remarks, Expatica, December 16, 2005. In contrast, Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal described Ahmadinejad's comments as "courageous" and stated, "Muslim people will defend Iran because it voices what they have in their hearts, in particular the Palestinian people."Al Jazeera, "Hamas springs to Iran's defense" In the United States, the Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned Ahmadinejad's remarks.[tpl]cite news|title=MPAC Rebukes Iranian President's Comments|url=http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=231|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080617083103/http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=231|archivedate=2008-06-17|accessdate=January 31, 2012|date=December 8, 2005[/tpl] In 2005 the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Mahdi Akef, denounced what he called "the myth of the Holocaust" in defending Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust.Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust, December 23, 2005.

===Propaganda in the media===

According to James Najarian, Holocaust deniers working for the Institute for Historical Review are not trained in history and "put out sham scholarly articles in the mock-academic publication, the Journal of Historical Review".[tpl]cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=74 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&vid=4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011[/tpl] They appeal to "our objectivity, our sense of fair play, and our distrust of figurative language".[tpl]cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=76 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&vid=4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011[/tpl] Thus, they rely on facts to grab the readers' attention. These facts, however, are strung by what Najarian calls "fabricated decorum" and are re-interpreted for their use. For example, they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=80 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&vid=4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011[/tpl]
Holocaust denial propaganda in all forms has shown to influence the audiences that it reaches. In fact, even the well-educated—that is, college graduates and current university students alike—are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them. This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information, especially since Holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in number.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lasson |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Defending Truth: Legal and Psychological Aspects of Holocaust Denial |journal=Current Psychology |volume=26 |page=256 |url=http://www.schaler.net/Lasson.pdf |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] Studies centered on the psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion.

==Reactions to Holocaust denial==

===Types of reaction===

Scholarly response to Holocaust denial can be roughly divided into three categories: Some academics refuse to engage Holocaust deniers or their arguments at all, on grounds that doing so lends them unwarranted legitimacy.Wilhelm Heitmeyer and John Hagan, International Handbook of Violence Research, Springer: 2003 A second group of scholars, typified by the American historian Deborah Lipstadt, have tried to raise awareness of the methods and motivations of Holocaust denial without legitimizing the deniers themselves. "We need not waste time or effort answering the deniers' contentions," Lipstadt wrote. "It would be never-ending.... Their commitment is to an ideology and their 'findings' are shaped to support it."Deborah Lipstadt, 1992 interview with Ken Stern of the American Jewish Committee A third group, typified by the Nizkor Project, responds to arguments and claims made by Holocaust denial groups by pointing out inaccuracies and errors in their evidence.Robert L. Hilliard & Michael C. Keith. Waves of Rancor: tuning in the radical right, M.E. Sharpe, 1999, ISBN 0-7656-0131-1, p. 250Daniel Wolfish & Gordon S. Smith. Who Is Afraid of the State?: Canada in a World of Multiple Centres of Power, University of Toronto Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8020-8388-9, p. 108.
Even scholarly responses, however, can trigger vigorous rebuttals. In 1996, the British historian David Irving brought a civil defamation suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, stemming from Lipstadt's book Denying the Holocaust, in which she named Irving as "one of the more dangerous" Holocaust deniers, because he was a published author, and was viewed by some as a legitimate military historian. He was "familiar with historical evidence", she wrote, and "bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda". Irving, who appeared as a defense witness in Ernst Zündel's trial in Canada, and once declared at a rally of Holocaust deniers that "more women died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car than ever died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz,"Holocaust Denial on Trial HDOT.org. Retrieved September 29, 2010. claimed that Lipstadt's allegation damaged his reputation.

International Institute for Holocaust Studies, Yad Vashem. Retrieved September 29, 2010.
In December 1991 the American Historical Association issued the following statement: The American Historical Association Council strongly deplores the publicly reported attempts to deny the fact of the Holocaust. No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place. This followed a strong reaction by many of its members and commentary in the press against a near-unanimous decision that the AHA had made in May 1991 that studying the significance of the Holocaust should be encouraged. The association's May 1991 statement was in response to an incident where certain of its members had questioned the reality of the Holocaust. The December 1991 declaration is a reversal of the AHA's earlier stance that the association should not set a precedent by certifying historical facts."AHA Statement on Holocaust Denial", American Historical Association website. Retrieved October 11, 2013.

===Public figures and scholars===

A number of public figures and scholars have spoken out against Holocaust denial. The American Historical Association, the oldest and largest society of historians and teachers of history in the United States, states that Holocaust denial is "at best, a form of academic fraud".[tpl]Cite book|last=Gerstenfeld|first=Phyllis B.|coauthors=Grant, Diana Ruth|title=Crimes of hate: selected readings|publisher=SAGE|location=p. 190.|year=2004|page=391|isbn=0-7619-2943-6[/tpl] Dr. William Shulman, director of the Holocaust Research Center, described the denial "as if these people the Holocaust were killed twice",[tpl]cite news |author=Sophia Chang |url=http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13569863&BRD=2676&PAG=461&dept_id=542415&rfi=6 |work=Times Ledger |date=December 16, 2004[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] a sentiment echoed by literary theorist Jean Baudrillard, who argued, "Forgetting the extermination is part of the extermination itself."Golsan, 130 In 2006, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said: "Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated. Holocaust denial is the work of bigots; we must reject their false claims whenever, wherever and by whomever they are made."BBC News, Annan condemns Holocaust denial, January 2006 Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel calls the Holocaust "the most documented tragedy in recorded history. Never before has a tragedy elicited so much witness from the killers, from the victims and even from the bystanders—millions of pieces here in the museum what you have, all other museums, archives in the thousands, in the millions."Millennium Evening with Elie Wiesel He made a similar statement on a special edition of The Oprah Winfrey Show after his final trip to Auschwitz, along with host Winfrey.
In January 2007, the United Nations General Assembly condemned "without reservation any denial of the Holocaust", though Iran disassociated itself from the resolution.UN Assembly condemns Holocaust denial by consensus; Iran disassociates itself, U.N. News Centre, January 26, 2007.

We never want to sit by side with the Nazis..They committed a crime against Jews — which is a crime against..all of humanity."Iran's Rouhani on Holocaust: 'A massacre that cannot be denied' While declining to give a specific number of Jewish victims, Iranian analysts suggested that "Rouhani pushed the envelope as far as it could go..without infuriating the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other conservatives back home."Iranian president Hassan Rouhani recognises 'reprehensible' Holocaust

===Former SS members===

Critics of Holocaust denial also include members of the Auschwitz SS. Camp physician and SS-Untersturmführer Hans Münch considered the facts of Auschwitz "so firmly determined that one cannot have any doubt at all", and described those who negate what happened at the camp as "malevolent" people who have "personal interest to want to bury in silence things that cannot be buried in silence".Frankfurter, Bernhard.

===Holocaust denial and antisemitism===

Holocaust denial is generally viewed as antisemitic. The Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, for example, defines Holocaust denial as "a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs"."Holocaust denial is a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs." Dinah Shelton, Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, Macmillan Reference, 2005, p. 45. The Anti-Defamation League has stated that "Holocaust denial is a contemporary form of the classic anti-Semitic doctrine of the evil, manipulative and threatening world Jewish conspiracy""Introduction: Denial as Anti-Semitism", Holocaust Denial: An Online Guide to Exposing and Combating Anti-Semitic Propaganda, Anti-Defamation League website. Retrieved August 27, 2009. and French historian Valérie Igounet has written that "Holocaust denial is a convenient polemical substitute for anti-semitism."Igounet, Valérie. "Holocaust denial is part of a strategy", Le Monde diplomatique, May 1998. In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now the Fundamental Rights Agency) published a "working definition" of antisemitism which gave as an example of the way that antisemitism might manifest itself, "denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust)".[tpl]PDF|Working Definition of Antisemitism|33.8 KB[/tpl], Fundamental Rights Agency, March 16, 2005.
Some have argued that not all Holocaust deniers are necessarily antisemitic. In a defense of professor of literature and Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson, and of having an essay of his included in the introduction of one of Faurisson's books, linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky stated "I see no antisemitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even denial of the holocaust."Rubinstein, William. "Chomsky and the neo-Nazis", Quadrant, October 1981. Chomsky would later elaborate:
In a defense of Holocaust denier Bishop Richard Williamson against the charge of being antisemitic, the journalist and writer Kevin Myers argued "It is not anti-Semitic to make a fool of yourself in public about a historical fact. It is anti-Semitic to preach or promote a dislike of Jews because they are Jews, which is what Bishop Williamson has not done."'Anti-Semitic imams will no more see inside a jail than a synagogue', Irish Independent, March 13, 2009.
According to Walter Reich, psychiatrist and then senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, one-time director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and now professor of international affairs at George Washington University:[tpl]quote|The primary motivation for most deniers is anti-Semitism, and for them the Holocaust is an infuriatingly inconvenient fact of history. After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened—indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media? What better way, in short, to make the world safe again for anti-Semitism than by denying the Holocaust?Reich, Walter. "Erasing the Holocaust", The New York Times, July 11, 1993.[/tpl]
The French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet described the motivation of deniers more succinctly:[tpl]quote|One revives the dead in order the better to strike the living.Vidal-Naquet, Pierre, "A Paper Eichmann (1980) – Anatomy of a Lie: On the Revisionist Method", in Assassins of Memory, Columbia University Press, 1992.[/tpl]

==Examination of claims==

The key claims which cause Holocaust denial to differ from established fact are:
Other claims include the following:
Holocaust denial is widely viewed as failing to adhere to rules for the treatment of evidence, principles that mainstream historians (as well as scholars in other fields) regard as basic to rational inquiry."(H)istory is the attempt to describe events of the past and move from description to analysis, in accordance with certain agreed rules of evidence, of analysis of language, and of logic." "Yehuda Bauer, Historian of the Holocaust – Portrait of an Historian" – Online Dimensions, a Journal of Holocaust Studies, Fall, 2004
The Holocaust was well documented by the bureaucracy of the Nazi government itself."... the German bureaucrats' collective actions are relatively well-documented for the historian...." Christopher R. Browning, The Path to Genocide: essays on launching the final solution, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-55878-6, p. 125."According to the historian Raul Hilberg, the United States alone captured forty thousand linear feet of documents on the murder of European Jews ... we can say that the Holocaust is a uniquely well-documented historical event."

According to researchers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman, there is a "convergence of evidence" that proves that the Holocaust happened. This evidence includes:Shermer & Grobman, 2002, p. 33.

Much of the controversy surrounding the claims of Holocaust deniers centers on the methods used to present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly never happened as commonly accepted. Numerous accounts have been given by Holocaust deniers (including evidence presented in court cases) of claimed facts and evidence; however, independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research, biased statements, or even deliberately falsified evidence. Opponents of Holocaust denial have documented numerous instances in which such evidence was altered or manufactured (see Nizkor Project and David Irving). According to Pierre Vidal-Naquet, "in our society of image and spectacle, extermination on paper leads to extermination in reality."Pierre Vidal-Naquet, French "une tentative d'extermination sur le papier qui relaie l'extermination réelle" in Les assassins de la mémoire, Un Eichmann de papier, Postface de Gisèle Sapiro, Nouvelle édition revue et augmentée, La Découverte, Paris, 2005, ISBN 2-7071-4545-9.

==Laws against Holocaust denial==

Holocaust denial is explicitly or implicitly illegal in 17 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Switzerland, and RomaniaLechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

The Parliament of Hungary adopted the most recent legislation, which declared denial or trivialization of the Holocaust a crime punishable by up to three years imprisonment, in February 2010.Index.hu Article (in Hungarian)
Such legislation remains controversial. In October 2007, a tribunal declared Spain's Holocaust denial law unconstitutional.By way of judgment of November 7, 2007 of the Constitutional Court of Spain, which ruled the criminalization to be unconstitutional and void. In 2007 Italy rejected a denial law proposing a prison sentence of up to four years. In 2006 the Netherlands rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of genocidal acts in general, although specifically denying the Holocaust remains a criminal offense there. The United Kingdom has twice rejected Holocaust denial laws. Denmark and Sweden have also rejected such legislation.EU adopts measure outlawing Holocaust denial. By Dan Bilefsky. The New York Times, April 19, 2007 .
A number of deniers have been prosecuted under various countries' denial laws. French literature professor Robert Faurisson, for example, was convicted and punished under the Gayssot Act in 1990. Some historians oppose such laws, among them Vidal-Naquet, an outspoken critic of Faurisson, on the grounds that denial legislation imposes "historical truth as legal truth".To live with Faurisson? Any other attitude would imply that we were imposing historical truth as legal truth, which is a dangerous attitude available to other fields of application. Pierre Vidal-Naquet: A Paper Eichmann (1980) – Anatomy of a Lie (10)  Other academics favor criminalization. Holocaust denial, they contend, is "the worst form of racism and its most respectable version because it pretends to be a research".François de Smet, Philosopher of the ULB: Le négationnisme est l’une des pires formes de racisme. Elle en est aussi sa version la plus « respectable », se parant des oripeaux de la science. C’est pour cela qu’il faut continuer à le sanctionner, in La Libre Belgique, on April 28, 2006 In the Belgian Senate the Minister of Justice Laurette Onkelinx compared laws criminalizing Holocaust denial with those condemning incitement to ethnic or racial hatred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Focus on Allied war crimes in Holocaust denial literature==

The focus on supposed Allied atrocities during the war has also been a theme in Holocaust denial literature, particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal.Stephen E. Atkins, Holocaust denial as an international movement, ABC-CLIO, 2009, pg. 105 According to historian Deborah Lipstadt, the concept of "comparable Allied wrongs" such as the post-war expulsions and alleged Allied war crimes like the bombing of Dresden,[tpl]cite web| last = Evans| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard J. Evans| title = Dresden and Holocaust Denial| work=David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition| year = 1996| url = http://hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/520e.html| accessdate =23 December 2013[/tpl] is at the center of, and a continuously repeated theme of, contemporary Holocaust denial; phenomenon she calls "immoral equivalencies".Deborah Lipstadt, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, Bt Bound, 1999, pg. 41 Pierre Vidal-Naquet pointed out the same phenomenon in the earlier version of Les Assassins de la mémoire under the title Auschwitz et le tiers monde (Les Assassins de la mémoire, Paris, 2005, pp. 170–180), and accurately about the declarations of Klaus Barbie's lawyer Jacques Vergès. In 1977, Martin Broszat in a review of David Irving's book Hitler's War maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to imply moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states with both sides equally guilty of terrible crimes, leading to Hitler's "fanatical, destructive will to annihilate" being downgraded to being "no longer an exceptional phenomenon".Broszat, Martin "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch page 395.

==Other genocide denials==

Other acts of genocide have met similar attempts to deny and minimize. Gregory H. Stanton, formerly of the US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch, lists denial as the final stage of a genocide development: "Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims."Gregory Stanton, Eight Stages of Genocide Denial, Genocide Watch
