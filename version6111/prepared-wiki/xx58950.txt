===Homeland===

The Assyrians are considered to be one of the indigenous people in the Middle East. Their homeland was thought to be located in the area around the Tigris and Euphrates. Assyrians are traditionally from Iraq, south eastern Turkey, north western Iran and north eastern Syria. There is a significant Assyrian population in Syria, where an estimated 877,000 Assyrians live.http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_country.asp?name=SY, SIL Ethnologue
In Tur Abdin, known as a homeland for Assyrians, there are only 3000 left,*SOC News report, He was documenting life in the Tur Abdin, where about 3,000 members of the Aramean minority still live. and an estimated 25,000 in all of Turkey.Statement on Assyrians/Syriacs in Turkey/Iraq After the 1915 Assyrian genocide many Assyrians/Syriacs also fled into Lebanon, Jordan, Iran, Iraq and into the Western world.
The Assyrian/Syriac people can be divided along geographic, linguistic, and denominational lines, the three main groups being:

===Persecution===

Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of Yazdegerd I, Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting Nestorian Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose Zoroastrianism continued during the reign of Yazdegerd II.This History of the Medieval World by Susan Wise Bauer, pg. 85-87A Short World History of Christianity by Robert Bruce Mullin, pp. 82-85
During the eras of Mongol rule under Genghis Khan and Timur, there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409819/Nestorian |title=Nestorian (Christian sect) - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]
More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the Massacres of Badr Khan, the Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895), the Adana Massacre, the Assyrian Genocide, the Simele Massacre, and the al-Anfal Campaign.

===Diaspora===

Since the Assyrian Genocide, many Assyrians have fled their homelands for a more safe and comfortable life in the West. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Assyrian population in the Middle East has decreased dramatically. As of today there are more Assyrians in Europe, North America, and Australia than in their former homeland.
A total of 550,000 Assyrians live in Europe.http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=70134 Large Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac diaspora communities can be found in Germany, Sweden, the USA, and Australia. The largest Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac diaspora communities are those of Södertälje, Chicago, and Detroit.

==Identity==

Assyrians are divided among several churches (see below). They speak, and many can read and write, dialects of Neo-Aramaic.Florian Coulmas, The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems  23 (1996)
In certain areas of the Assyrian homeland, identity within a community depends on a person's village of origin (see List of Assyrian villages) or Christian denomination rather than their ethnic commonality, for instance Chaldean Catholic.Note on the Modern Assyrians
Today, Assyrians and other minority ethnic groups in the Middle East, feel pressure to identify as "Arabs",Iraqi Assyrians: A Barometer of Pluralism[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/releases/20070416140021.htm |title=Arab American Institute Still Deliberately Claiming Assyrians Are Arabs |publisher=Aina.org |accessdate=2008-11-16[/tpl] "Turks" and "Kurds".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20061120133220.htm |title=In Court, Saddam Criticizes Kurdish Treatment of Assyrians |publisher=Aina.org |accessdate=2008-11-16[/tpl] Those Assyrians in Syria, who live outside of the traditionally and historically Assyrian northeastern region of the country, are pressured to identify as Arabs, due to Arab Nationalist policies of the Baathist government.
Neo-Aramaic exhibits remarkably conservative features compared with Imperial Aramaic,J.G. Browne, "The Assyrians", Journal of the Royal Society of Arts 85 (1937) and the earliest European visitors to northern Mesopotamia in modern times encountered a people called "Assyrians", "Assouri" and "Ashuriyun", and people with ancient Assyrian names such as Sargon, Sennacherib, Ashur and Semiramis .George Percy Badger, The Christians of Assyria Commonly Called Nestorians (London: W.H.

Assyrian nationalism emphatically connects Modern Assyrians to the population of ancient Mesopotamia and the Neo-Assyrian Empire. A historical basis of this sentiment was disputed by a few early historians, but receives strong support from modern Assyriologists like H.W.F. Saggs, Robert D. Biggs, Giorgi Tsereteli and Simo Parpola,Saggs, The Might That Was Assyria, pp. 290, “The destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers, and since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, descendants of the Assyrian peasants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians.”[ref]
