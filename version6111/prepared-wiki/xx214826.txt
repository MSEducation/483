Congregation Rodeph Sholom is a Reform synagogue in New York City.  Founded in 1842 by immigrants from the German lands, it is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States.

==History==

The first building constructed by Rodeph Sholom, at 8 Clinton Street on the Lower East Side in 1853, is still in use by Congregation Chasam Sopher. It is the second-oldest surviving synagogue building in New York City.
Rodeph Sholom  moved to Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street, to a new  Victorian Romanesque  building  designed by D. & J. Jardine and built in 1872-73 for Ansche Chesed. 
In 1930, Rodeph Sholom moved to its present location at 7 West 83rd Street on the Upper West Side. The Romanesque temple house and sanctuary, designed by Charles B. Meyers, were built between 1929â€“30 and dedicated on Purim in March 1930.

==Day School==

In 1970 Rodeph Sholom opened the first Reform movement Jewish day school in the United States. Its goal is to help Jews become self-aware adults in the world today. In 1972, the school expanded to move all the way through sixth grade, and since then it has expanded through eighth grade.
