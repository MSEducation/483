Germany competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. 205 competitors, 173 men and 32 women, took part in 123 events in 18 sports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/GER/summer/1952/ |title=Germany at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Games |accessdate=2010-09-19 |work=sports-reference.com[/tpl]
Germany had not been invited to the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Great Britain because of their role in World War II, and because their NOC restored in 1947 did not represent a recognized state yet, which was founded in 1949. Germany took part in the 1952 Winter Olympics, with the GDR declining to cooperate in a single team Germany as required by the IOC, joining only in 1956 and later. On the other hand, the French-occupied Saar protectorate had to send a separate team, but could join for 1956. 
While the first-ever (and only) failure to score Gold in Summer Games was disappointing, resulting in a 28th rank, the number of total medals ranked fifth.
