[[Breve]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabetic diacritics, Poetic rhythm

A breve ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|iː|v[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|brève[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-fr|ˈbʁɛv|[/tpl]; from the Latin brevis “short, brief”) is the diacritical mark ˘, shaped like the bottom half of a circle. As used in Ancient Greek, it is also called  vrachy or brachy. It resembles the caron (the wedge or háček in Czech), but is rounded, while the caron has a sharp tip. Compare Ǎ ǎ Ě ě Ǐ ǐ Ǒ ǒ Ǔ ǔ (caron) with Ă ă Ĕ ĕ Ĭ ĭ Ŏ ŏ Ŭ ŭ (breve).

==Length==

The breve sign indicates a short vowel, as opposed to the macron ¯ which indicates long vowels, in academic transcription. It is often used this way in dictionaries and textbooks of Latin, Ancient Greek, Tuareg and other languages. (However, there is a frequent convention of indicating only the long vowels: it is then understood that a vowel with no macron is short.)
In Cyrillic script, a breve is used for Й. In Belarusian, it is used for both the Cyrillic Ў (semivowel U) and in the Latin (Łacinka) Ŭ. Ў was also used in Cyrillic Uzbek under the Soviet Union. The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet uses a breve for Ӂ (the equivalent of G before E or I in the Latin script). In Chuvash, a breve is used for Cyrillic letters [tpl]unicode|Ӑ[/tpl] (A-breve) and [tpl]unicode|Ӗ[/tpl] (E-breve). Note that traditional Cyrillic breve differs in shape, being thicker on the edges of the curve and thinner in the middle, from the Latin one. In Latin types, the shape becomes “ears”-like.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fonts.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=591|title=Бреве кириллическое, "кратка"|publisher=ParaType|language=Russian|trans_title=Cyrillic breve ("kratka")[/tpl]
In Esperanto, it is used above the u to form a non-syllabic u, similar to the sound of an English w.
In the transcription of Sinhala, the breve over an m or an n indicates a prenasalized consonant; for example, n̆da is used to represent [tpl]IPA|ⁿda[/tpl].

==Other uses==

In other languages, it is used for other purposes.
Note that Pinyin uses the caron, not the breve, to indicate the third tone of Mandarin Chinese; the breve cannot be used as a substitute in computer environments.

==Encoding==

Unicode and HTML code (decimal numeric character reference) for breve characters.
In LaTeX the controls \u{o} and \breve{o} puts a breve over the letter o.
