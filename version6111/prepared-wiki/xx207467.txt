Emery Hawkins (April 30, 1912 â€“ June 1989) was an American animator who worked at various studios such as Disney, Screen Gems, Walter Lantz, Warner Bros., and UPA during the golden age of animation. His most prominent work is the Woody Woodpecker cartoons from the 1940s. Along with Art Heinemann, Hawkins helped redesign Woody and made him more streamlined. He also worked with Art Babbitt and Ken Harris on Richard Williams's unfinished animated feature The Thief and the Cobbler. Hawkins was known for the speed in which he animated, completing scenes quickly, but with perfection. Hawkins (along with Babbitt, Harris and Grim Natwick) is frequently mentioned in Richard Williams' book The Animator's Survival Kit.
Hawkins developed Alzheimer's Disease in his later years and was forced to retire. He died in 1989 at the age of 77.
