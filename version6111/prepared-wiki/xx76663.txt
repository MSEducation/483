==History==

Dark Lotus made its debut with the single "Echoside,"[tpl]cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink= |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=560–561 |chapter=Complete Discography [/tpl]  which was originally intended for the group's debut, but released on Insane Clown Posse's 1999 album The Amazing Jeckel Brothers instead, because the Dark Lotus album's production took longer than expected. It was later announced that each member "would act as a 'petal' of the lotus,"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747 |title=Dark Lotus > Biography |accessdate=2008-07-14 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Allrovi[/tpl] and that there would be six members. After speculation as to who the sixth member would be, including rumors that either Esham or Vampiro would join the group, it was announced that Marz would be a member.
Dark Lotus released their first album, Tales from the Lotus Pod, in 2001. Mike E. Clark was brought in to produce the album, but left the project after producing four songs, and Fritz the Cat produced the rest of the album.[tpl]cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=470–496 |chapter=Hatchet Rising [/tpl] The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #6 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #158 on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747 |title=Charts and awards for Dark Lotus |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Allrovi[/tpl] Marz left the group, and was replaced by James Lowery. In 2002, Tales from the Lotus Pod was reissued in a new version removing Marz's vocals.[tpl]cite news |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |title=Insane Clown Posse Axed By Label, Launching Tour |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449157/20010925/i_c_p.jhtml |publisher=MTV News |date=September 25, 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03 [/tpl] On April 6, 2004, Dark Lotus released their second studio album, Black Rain. It peaked at #3 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and at #71 on the Billboard 200.
Lowery left the group, and a third album, The Opaque Brotherhood, on April 15, 2008 was released without him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.realdetroitweekly.com/article_1954.shtml |title=The Calm Before the Storm |accessdate=2008-07-14 |last=Bonaventura |first=Andrea |date=October 25, 2006 |work= |publisher=Real Detroit Weekly[/tpl] It peaked at #4 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, #45 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and #45 on the Billboard 200. Allrovi reviewer Stewart Mason praised the album, writing "Nothing on The Opaque Brotherhood will convince anyone who isn't already a fan, but the tormented lyrics and matter-of-fact delivery remove a layer or two of distance and artifice from the band's familiar themes, and make them that much more disturbing as a result."[tpl]cite web | last=Mason | first=Stewart | title=Review of The Opaque Brotherhood | url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747 | publisher=Allrovi | accessdate=2009-04-11 [/tpl] Twiztid left Psychopathic Records on December 13, 2012,https://twitter.com/tweetmesohard but according to Violent J, Dark Lotus have not broken up and will continue to release music on Psychopathic Records as time permits.http://www.insaneclownposse.com It was announced on February 18, 2014 that all 5 members of Dark Lotus were in the studio together recording a new album. This will be the group's first album since 2008's The Opaque Brotherhood. It will be released at the 15th annual Gathering of the Juggalos. In March 2014 Faygoluvers.net posted a picture with the DL sign, with Roman numerals underneath, in numbers they read "7-29-2014" possibly meaning that the new Dark Lotus album could be in stores on that date. No update has been given yet since.

==Music and lyrics==

Kimberly Chun of the San Francisco Chronicle described Dark Lotus' musical style as a mixture of "dub, goth, metal, shock rock and hip-hop, with a WWF announcer's delivery and shuffling stoner beats thrown in for good measure."[tpl]cite news |first=Kimberly |last=Chun |title=Hip-hop on pop at Insane Clown Posse plus Paula West and Basement Jaxx |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2001/10/10/musicreviews.DTL |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 10, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-23 [/tpl] Much of Dark Lotus' lyrics revolve around the occult.
