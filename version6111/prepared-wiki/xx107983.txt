[[Intervalence charge transfer]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry, Coordination chemistry, Spectroscopy

In chemistry, intervalence charge transfer, often abbreviated IVCT or even IT, is an electron transfer (thermal or photoinduced) between two metal sites differing only in oxidation state. Quite often such electron transfer reverses the oxidation states of the sites. The term is frequently extended to the case of metal-to-metal charge transfer between non-equivalent metal centres. http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03125.html Article: intervalence charge transfer 
Typically, such a process produces a characteristic absorption in the electromagnetic spectrum of the compound involved. The phenomenon is most often observed in mixed-valence bi- and polymetallic coordination complexes. The IVCT band is usually observed in the visible or near infrared region of the spectrum and is broad.
The process can be described as follows:
where L is a ligand.

==Mixed valency and the IT band==

Since the energy states of valence tautomers affect the IVCT band, the strength of electronic interaction between the sites, known as α (the mixing coefficient), can be determined by analysis of the IVCT band.G.
