Al Jufra Air Base [tpl]Airport codes|||HL69[/tpl] is a Libyan Air Force base located near Jufra.

==Combat aircraft types==

Prior to the Libyan civil war TU-22, MiG-25, G.222 and An-26 were based at Jufra, parked on open pavement, sand berm shielded pads and in aircraft shelters.http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Al+Jufra+Air+Base,+Surt,+Libya&aq=1&sll=28.921631,16.171875&sspn=0.020171,0.042272&ie=UTF8&hq=Al+Jufra+Air+Base,+Surt,+Libya&ll=29.200498,16.003819&spn=0.040234,0.084543&t=h&z=14 Considering the positioning of many of the aircraft visible in the satellite imagery, and what is known of the maintenance record of the Libyan Air Force, the operational inventory of combat aircraft based at Jufra in 2011 can be assumed to be quite low. The G.222 is believed to have not flown for more than a decade.

==No-Fly Zone enforcement==

The airbase was bombed on 24 March 2011 by French aircraft in accordance with the UN-backed enforcement of the No-Fly Zone over Libya.http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/03/24/general-af-libya_8372740.html Over a month and a half later, on 13 June, the area was again struck by NATO forces.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0613/breaking3.html
