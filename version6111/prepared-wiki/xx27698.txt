[[Adullam]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places, Archaeological sites in Israel, Nature reserves in Israel

Adullam is an ancient ruin, built upon a hilltop overlooking the Elah Valley, south of Bet Shemesh.   The hilltop is mostly flat, with cisterns carved into the rock. The remains of stone structures which once stood there can still be seen. Sedimentary layers of ruins from the old Canaanite and Israelite eras, mostly potsherds, are noticeable everywhere, although olive groves now grow atop of this hill, enclosed within stone hedges. The villages of Aderet, Neve Michael/Roglit, and Aviezer are located nearby. Access to the site can be obtained by passing through the cooperative small holder's agricultural villages (Moshavim) of Aderet or Neve Michael (known also as Roglit). The ruin lies at a distance of ca. 2 kilometers south of Moshav Neve Michael.

==History==

Adullam was one of the royal cities of the Canaanites ([tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|12:15|HE[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|15:35|HE[/tpl]) referred to in the Hebrew Bible. It stood near the highway which later became the Roman road in the  Valley of Elah, the scene of David's victory over Goliath ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Samuel|17:2|HE[/tpl]). It was here that Judah, the son of Jacob, came when he left his fathers and brothers in Migdal Eder, and where he befriended a certain Hirah the Adullamite (Genesis 38:1). It was here also that Judah took his first wife, the daughter of Shua. It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against Egypt ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:7|HE[/tpl]). Micah calls it "the glory of Israel" ([tpl]bibleverse||Micah|1:15|HE[/tpl]).
Adullam is the place where David sought refuge after being expelled from the city of Gath by King Achish. I Samuel refers to the Cave of Adullam where he found protection while living as a renegade from King Saul. It was there that "every one that was in distress gathered together, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented" ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:2|HE[/tpl]). Certain caves, grottos and selpulchres are still to be seen on its northern and eastern slopes. 
In the 1950s there were plans to set up Adullam as a formal political/economic region, on the model of Lachish, but the plans were not carried out. Plans from the 1960s called for a Moshav called Adullam to be established, contiguous with Moshav Aderet, but this plan too did not materialize, and the preliminary legal framework for Moshav Adullam was dismantled a few years ago.

==Nature reserve and park==

The Adullam Grove Nature Reserve is a nature reserve managed by the Israel Nature and National Parks Protection Authority. It was established in 1994.[tpl]cite web|title=List of National Parks and Nature Reserves|url=http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|language=Hebrew|publisher=Israel Nature and Parks Authority|accessdate=2010-09-27[/tpl]
The Adullam Caves park is a JNF park of 50,000 dunams ([tpl]convert|12,355|acre|km2[/tpl]) of mostly pine forests, which were planted by Jewish immigrants who settled in the Lachish region in the early years of the state. The park was prepared for public use by the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Jewish National Fund.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kkl.org.il/KKL/advanced_templateNoMenu.aspx?id=21482|title=פארק עדולם|trans_title=Adullam Park|publisher=JNF website|language=Hebrew|accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl] 
Today the park sits in an area that is threatened by shale oil extraction through the CCR ground-heating process, with the Green Zionist Alliance and the grassroots group Save Adullam, among others, working to stop shale oil extraction in the region.[tpl]cite news|title=Israel: The New Saudi Arabia?|url=http://www.jewcology.com/content/view/Israel-The-New-Saudi-Arabia|publisher=Jewcology|date=1 May 2011 | first=David| last=Krantz[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Shale oil project raises hackles in Israel|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jOOtf9U8a__sHlbBkgmMSGrUPnig|publisher=AFP|date=18 Dec 2011| first=Daniella| last=Cheslow[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Saudi Turns to Solar, Israel Stuck on Shale|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2013/03/saudi-solar-israel-stuck-on-shale/|publisher=Green Prophet|date=5 March 2013 | first=Tafline| last=Laylin[/tpl]
