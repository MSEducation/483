==Skålatårnet/Kloumantårnet==

The tower at the top of the 1843 m. summit is built from rocks.  It is called Skålatårnet ("Skåla tower") or Kloumantårnet ("Klouman tower").  The construction of the tower was initiated by Doctor Hans Henrik Gerhard Klouman from the nearby village of Innvik.  It was built as a means to cure tuberculosis, which was widespread in the late 19th century. The walls in the tower are [tpl]convert|50|cm[/tpl] wide, and there are two floors. Today, the tower is accessible to the public, with 22 beds.  It is administered by Bergen Turlag, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Trekking Association.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bergen-turlag.no/cabin.php?ca_id=153&fo_id=|title=Skålatårnet (1843 moh.)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-07-23[/tpl]
