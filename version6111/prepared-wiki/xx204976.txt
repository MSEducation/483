===Ultimate Marvel===

The Ultimate Marvel Universe version of Norman Osborn was rendered by artist Mark Bagley to resemble actor Brian Dennehy, as per writer Brian Michael Bendis' instructions.Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). "Ultimate Spider-Man". Wizard Xtra!. p. 117. This version is a corrupt industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D., an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife and son Harry Osborn. In Ultimate Spider-Man #1, an OZ-injected spider bites Peter Parker on a field trip. Peter develops amazing powers, and Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA gave Parker the abilities of a spider, then if Norman were to receive OZ combined with his own DNA, he could become a heightened version of himself. He acquires a sample of Peter's blood. The experiment goes wrong and an explosion occurs, affecting Harry and Dr. Otto Octavius.Ultimate Spider-Man #3
He, however, is transformed into a muscular, grotesque, demonic-looking monster, granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. In an attempt to destroy all evidence of his existence, the Green Goblin kills Norman's wife and attempts to kill Harry who manages to escape while the house is burning down.Ultimate Spider-Man #4 The next day, he attacks Harry's school but is stopped by Spider-Man. During the fight, Green Goblin plummets off a bridge into the river, seemingly dead.[tpl]Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #1-7 |Publisher = Marvel Comics [/tpl] However, Norman survives and has "evolved" in his words. He can now control his transformations into an intelligent incarnation of the "Green Goblin" via OZ injections.  Due to overdosing on OZ, Osborn suffers from hallucinations. These include seeing everything through a blood-red filter, and creatures called "plasmids" tormenting him.[tpl]issue|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Taking Harry back, Norman moves back into the city, blaming rival Justin Hammer for the explosion.Ultimate Spider-Man #11 Under Green Goblin's spell, he reveals himself to Parker, telling him to give up being Spider-Man and work for him, or suffer the deaths of Parker's loved ones. Green Goblin tells Parker to kill Nick Fury, the Head of S.H.I.E.L.D. When Parker refuses, the Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane Watson, Peter's girlfriend, and attempts to kill her by hurling her from the top of a bridge.Ultimate Spider-Man #24 Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane, and joins S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in attacking Osborn. The battle continues at Osborn's Manhattan penthouse, where Green Goblin transforms even further after taking several more OZ injections and begins to choke the life out of Parker. Harry discovers the scene, picking up a shattered window pane and jamming it into his father's back, reverting him to his human self. Norman is taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.Ultimate Spider-Man #26
In the Ultimate Six limited series, Norman and Dr. Octavius devise a plan to escape from prison which uses Norman's new ability to transform into his demon form at will. It also seems that he is no longer under the influence of the hallucinogenic "plasmids", with Norman stating that he has been undergoing a "transitioning stage" during his last confrontation with Peter; furthermore, his speech is more coherent in his Goblin form, suggesting that he is no longer hallucinating as a result of the Oz formula. They kidnap Spider-Man, tie him to a chair, unmask him, and force him to join them. Green Goblin considers Parker to be his 'true' son and believes Parker belongs with him, so he prevents harm to Peter, but he does humiliate him. In a battle between the Ultimate Six and the Ultimates at the White House, Harry is used as a trump card by Fury against Norman.Ultimate Six #5 Harry pleads with his father to stop while Captain America convinces Peter of Osborn's lies. Norman is about to change back when Iron Man blasts him from behind, severely altering Norman's genes and causing him to lash out at the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel before being shot down to Harry's horror. He is again taken into custody. At the end of the issue, he is revealed to be in cryogenic suspension, with half of his face in Goblin form.Ultimate Six #6
In Ultimate Spider-Man #112, Norman Osborn is again in semblance of a human form, and is kept in a high-security cell with other superhuman prisoners. When contacted by Carol Danvers, Norman states that he will answer only to Fury; he then transforms into the Goblin, and breaks away from security measures, the OZ in his system having re-worked his body in a further process of what he refers to as 'Evolution'.[tpl]Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = 112 |Publisher = Marvel Comics [/tpl] In #113, the reader is given a look into his state of mind. Though no longer haunted by 'Plasmids', Green Goblin has given in to severe paranoia, believing everyone save him to be insane, and Nick Fury a tyrant, imprisoning anyone with the power to stand up to him.Ultimate Spider-Man #112-114
In his breakout, he enlists the promised help of Electro as payback for freeing him; other Supervillains that escape include Omega Red, Kraven the Hunter, and what appears to be Gwen Stacy (the new Carnage). Green Goblin's stratagem upon escape is simple; he resumes as Norman, then appears on a talk show, claiming that Fury held him in a prison against his will, just as he was on the brink of creating a drug to solve America's military problems.[tpl]issue|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In issue #117, Green Goblin goes into an explosive rage when confronted with a TV broadcast of a (staged) S.H.I.E.L.D. press conference with Harry declaring that Norman was evil and killed Harry's mother (the press conference in fact was held aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and only transmitted to the TV Norman was watching), and ended up assaulting the helicarrier; Harry transforms into a form similar to Norman's, but loses the resultant melee and is beaten to death when he returns to his human form. With both the S.H.I.E.L.D. troops and Norman horrified at what he's done, he reverts to his own human form, turns around and asks to be killed. Danvers, in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. while Fury is away, obliges him by shooting Norman in the head.[tpl]Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = 117 |Publisher = Marvel Comics [/tpl]
However, Norman Osborn was able to survive the incident much to the surprise of himself and Carol Danvers and was kept in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody, under observation. Despite there being no trace of Oz left in his body he was still able to transform into his Green Goblin form. He was then able escape, along with other Spider-Man villains, including Otto Octavius, Electro, Sandman, Kraven the Hunter and the Vulture. They escape to New York, and take shelter in a building. While S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates are preoccupied with the Avengers, Osborn informs the others that this is "God's will", telling them that God wants them to kill Peter Parker. When Octavius protests, Osborn kills him and then proceeds to Peter's house along with the remaining villains. In the resulting battle, Green Goblin is apparently killed when Spider-Man literally smashes him with a truck. At the end of the issue, Osborn is left powered-down in wreckage with a slight smile on his face suggesting he may still be alive.[tpl]Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = 156| Publisher = Marvel Comics [/tpl]
Months before his transformation and death, Norman Osborn had Dr. Conrad Markus somehow create another OZ-injected spider which later bites Miles Morales,Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #1 indirectly due to Aaron Davis being hired by Philip R. Roxxon.Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #28 - December 2013
Since Norman Osborn's powers derive from the OZ formula, his strength derives from how much he is exposed to. When the Green Goblin is created, the smaller dosage gives him green claws, horns and head, though the rest of him is human like in appearance. When he returns, he uses larger dosages of OZ to become larger and completely green, with more crests. When he overdoses on OZ, his horns, stature and muscles become larger, as does the number of crests. He later develops a way to transform without OZ into a larger, more powerful form, making injections obsolete.Ultimate Spider-Man #226Ultimate Six #1-6
