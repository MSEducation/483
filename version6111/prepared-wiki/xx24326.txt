[[Impact event]]

CATEGORIES: Climate forcing agents, Impact events, Planetary science, Doomsday scenarios, Astronomical events

An impact event is a  collision between celestial objects causing measurable effects. Impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems, though the most frequent involve asteroids, comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact. When large objects impact terrestrial planets like the Earth, there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences, though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry. Impact structures are dominant landforms on many of the System's solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale.
Impact events appear to have played a significant role in the evolution of the Solar System since its formation. Major impact events have significantly shaped Earth's history, have been implicated in the formation of the Earth–Moon system, the evolutionary history of life, the origin of water on Earth and several mass extinctions. Notable impact events include the Late Heavy Bombardment, which occurred early in history of the Earth–Moon system and the Chicxulub impact, 66 million years ago, believed to be the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
Throughout recorded history, hundreds of Earth impacts (and exploding bolides) have been reported, with some occurrences causing deaths, injuries, property damage or other significant localised consequences.[tpl]Citation|last=Lewis|first=John S.|title=Rain of Iron and Ice|publisher=Helix Books (Addison-Wesley)|year=1996|page=236|isbn=0-201-48950-3[/tpl] One of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times was the Tunguska event, which occurred in Siberia, Russia, in 1908. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event  is the only known such event to result in a large number of injuries, and the Chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have encountered the Earth since the Tunguska event. The most notable non-terrestrial event is the Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 impact, which provided the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects, when the comet broke apart and collided with Jupiter in July 1994. Impact events have been a plot and background element in science fiction since knowledge of real impacts became established in the scientific mainstream.

==Impacts and the Earth==

Major impact events have significantly shaped Earth's history, have been implicated in the formation of the Earth–Moon system, the evolutionary history of life, the origin of water on Earth and several mass extinctions. Impact structures are the result of impact events on solid objects and, as the dominant landforms on many of the System's solid objects, present the most solid evidence of prehistoric events. Notable impact events include the Late Heavy Bombardment, which occurred early in history of the Earth–Moon system and the Chicxulub impact, 66 million years ago, believed to be the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

===Frequency and risk===

Small objects frequently collide with Earth. There is an inverse relationship between the size of the object and the frequency that such objects hit Earth.  The lunar cratering record shows that the frequency of impacts decreases as approximately the cube of the resulting crater's diameter, which is on average proportional to the diameter of the impactor.[tpl]Citation|last=Crater Analysis Techniques Working Group|title=Standard Techniques for Presentation and Analysis of Crater Size-Frequency Data|journal=Icarus|year=1979|postscript=.|bibcode=1979Icar...37..467C | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(79)90009-5[/tpl] Asteroids with a [tpl]convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] diameter strike Earth every 500,000 years on average.[tpl]Citation|authorlink=Nick Bostrom|first=Nick| last=Bostrom| year=2002|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html|title=Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| volume=9| month=March[/tpl] Large collisions – with [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] objects – happen approximately once every twenty million years. The last known impact of an object of [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or more in diameter was at the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
The energy released by an impactor depends on diameter, density, velocity, and angle. The diameter of most near-Earth asteroids that have not been studied by radar or infrared can generally only be estimated within about a factor of 2 based on the asteroid brightness. The density is generally assumed because the diameter and mass are also generally estimates. The minimum impact velocity on Earth is 11 km/s with asteroid impacts averaging around 17 km/s. The most probable impact angle is 45 degrees.
Stony asteroids with a diameter of [tpl]convert|4|m|sp=us[/tpl] impact Earth approximately once per year. Asteroids with a diameter of 7 meters enter Earth's atmosphere with as much kinetic energy as Little Boy (the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, approximately 16 kilotons of TNT) about every 5 years, but the air burst only generates a much reduced 5 kilotons of TNT. These ordinarily explode in the upper atmosphere, and most or all of the solids are vaporized.[tpl]Citation|author = Clark R.

Objects with a diameter less than [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] are called meteoroids and seldom make it to the ground to become meteorites.  An estimated 500 meteorites reach the surface each year, but only 5 or 6 of these typically create a weather radar signature with a strewn field large enough to be recovered and be made known to scientists.
The late Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey estimated of the rate of Earth impacts, concluding that an event about the size of the nuclear weapon that destroyed Hiroshima occurs about once a year.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Such events would seem to be spectacularly obvious, but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons: the majority of the Earth's surface is covered by water; a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited; and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude, resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Geological significance===

Impacts have, during the history of the Earth, had a significant geologicalhttp://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/chapter1.pdf and climatichttp://phys.org/news/2013-09-prehistoric-climate-due-cosmic-canada.html influence.
The Moon is widely attributed to a huge impact early in Earth's history.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Canup | first1=R. | last2=Asphaug | first2=E. | title=Origin of the Moon in a giant impact near the end of the Earth's formation | journal=Nature | volume=412 | pages=708–712 | year=2001 | doi=10.1038/35089010 | pmid=11507633 | issue=6848 | bibcode=2001Natur.412..708C | url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/canup_Moon_Nature_01.pdf | accessdate=2011-12-10 [/tpl] Impact events earlier in the history of Earth have been credited with creative as well as destructive events; it has been proposed that impacting comets delivered the Earth's water, and some have suggested that the origins of life may have been influenced by impacting objects by bringing organic chemicals or lifeforms to the Earth's surface, a theory known as exogenesis.
These modified views of the Earth's history did not emerge until relatively recently, chiefly due to a lack of direct observations and the difficulty in recognizing the signs of an Earth impact because of erosion and weathering. Large-scale terrestrial impacts of the sort that produced the Barringer Crater, locally known as Meteor Crater, northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona, are rare. Instead, it was widely thought that cratering was the result of volcanism: the Barringer Crater, for example, was ascribed to a prehistoric volcanic explosion (not an unreasonable hypothesis, given that the volcanic San Francisco Peaks stand only [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] to the west). Similarly, the craters on the surface of the Moon were ascribed to volcanism.
It was not until 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was correctly identified as being an impact crater, and it was not until as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the solar system's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the solar system was found to be cratered, and there was no reason to believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the twentieth century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The largest of these include Vredefort Crater, Sudbury Crater, Chicxulub Crater, and Manicouagan Crater. The first observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter; to date, no such events have been observed on Earth.
Based on crater formation rates determined from the Earth's closest celestial partner, the Moon, astrogeologists have determined that during the last 600 million years, the Earth has been struck by 60 objects of a diameter of [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or more. The smallest of these impactors would release the equivalent of ten million megatons of TNT and leave a crater [tpl]convert|95|km|mi|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] across. For comparison, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, had a yield of 50 megatons.
Besides direct effect of asteroid impacts on a planet's surface topography, global climate and life, recent studies have shown that several consecutive impacts can have effect on the dynamo mechanism at a planet's core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet, and can eventually shut down the planet's magnetic field.Multiple Asteroid Strikes May Have Killed Mars’s Magnetic Field
While numerous impact craters have been confirmed on land or in the shallow seas over continental shelves, no impact craters in the deep ocean have been widely accepted by the scientific community.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dypvik|first=Henning|last2=Burchell|first2=Mark|last3=Claeys|first3=Philippe|title=Impacts into Marine and Icy Environments: A Short Review in Cratering in Marine Environments and on Ice[/tpl]  Impacts of projectiles as large as 1 km in diameter are generally thought to explode before reaching the sea floor, but it is unknown what would happen if a much larger impactor struck the deep ocean.  The lack of a crater, however, does not mean that an ocean impact would not have dangerous implications for humanity.  Some scholars have argued that an impact event in an ocean or sea may create a megatsunami (a giant wave), which can cause destruction both at sea and on land along the coast,[tpl]cite journal|last=Gault|first=D. E.|coauthors=Sonnet, C.

===Biospheric effects===

The effect of impact events on the biosphere has been the subject of scientific debate. Several theories of impact related mass extinction have been developed. In the past 500 million years there have been five generally accepted,  major mass extinctions that on average extinguished half of all species. One of the largest mass extinction to have affected life on Earth was in the Permian-Triassic, which ended the Permian period 250 million years ago and killed off 90% of all species;Permian Extinction life on Earth took 30 million years to recover.[tpl]Citation | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. |year=2008| title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | pmid=18198148 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | pmc=2596898|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 |volume=275 | issue=1636|format=PDF | pages=759–65[/tpl] The cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction is still matter of debate with the age and origin of proposed impact craters, i.e. the Bedout High structure, hypothesized to be associated with it are still controversial.Müller R.D., Goncharov A. & Kristi A. 2005. Geophysical evaluation of the enigmatic Bedout basement high, offshore northwest Australia. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 237, 265-284. The last such mass extinction led to the demise of the dinosaurs and coincided with a large meteorite impact; this is the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (also known as the K–T or K–Pg extinction event); This occurred 66 million years ago. There is no definitive evidence of impacts leading to the three other major mass extinctions.
In 1980, physicist Luis Alvarez; his son, geologist Walter Alvarez; and nuclear chemists Frank Asaro and Helen V. Michael from the University of California, Berkeley discovered unusually high concentrations of iridium in a specific layer of rock strata in the Earth's crust. Iridium is an element that is rare on Earth but relatively abundant in many meteorites. From the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65-million-year-old "iridium layer", the Alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of [tpl]convert|10|to|14|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] must have collided with the earth. This iridium layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary has been found worldwide at 100 different sites. Multidirectionally shocked quartz (coesite), which is only known to form as the result of large impacts or atomic bomb explosions, has also been found in the same layer at more than 30 sites. Soot and ash at levels tens of thousands times normal levels were found with the above.
Anomalies in chromium isotopic ratios found within the K-T boundary layer strongly support the impact theory.[tpl]Citation | last1 = Shukolyukov | first1 = A. | last2 = Lugmair | first2 = G. W. | year = 1998 | title = Isotopic Evidence for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Impactor and Its Type | url = | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5390| pages = 927–930 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5390.927 | postscript = . | pmid=9794759 | bibcode=1998Sci...282..927S[/tpl] Chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth, therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin which was also proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment. Furthermore the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the K-T boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in carbonaceous chondrites. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites.
Probably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named Chicxulub Crater. This crater is centered on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as geophysicists for the Mexican oil company PEMEX. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be [tpl]convert|180|km|mi|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter. Other researchers would later find that the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs had lasted for thousands of years instead of millions of years as had previously been thought.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] This convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extraterrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).
Recently, several proposed craters around the world have been dated to approximately the same age as Chicxulub — for example, the Silverpit crater in the United Kingdom, the Boltysh crater in Ukraine and the Shiva crater near India.  This has led to the suggestion that the Chicxulub impact was one of several that occurred almost simultaneously, perhaps due to a disrupted comet impacting the Earth in a similar manner to the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994; however, the uncertain age and provenance of these structures leaves the hypothesis without widespread support.
It was the lack of high concentrations of iridium and shocked quartz which has prevented the acceptance of the idea that the Permian extinction was also caused by an impact. During the late Permian all the continents were combined into one supercontinent named Pangaea and all the oceans formed one superocean, Panthalassa. If an impact occurred in the ocean and not on land at all, then there would be little shocked quartz released (since oceanic crust has relatively little silica) and much less material.
Although there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the Cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the K-T boundary layer, remnants have been found of other, smaller impacts, some nearing half the size of the Chicxulub crater, which did not result in any mass extinctions, and there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/earth-sci/083f/kellerkt.pdf | title=Impacts, volcanism and mass extinction: random coincidence or cause and effect? | author=Keller G. | journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences | year=2005 | volume=52 | pages=725–757 | doi=10.1080/08120090500170393|bibcode = 2001AuJES..52..725K [/tpl]
Paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski have proposed that an excess of extinction events occurs roughly every 26 million years (though many are relatively minor).  This led physicist Richard A. Muller to suggest that these extinctions could be due to a hypothetical companion star to the Sun called Nemesis periodically disrupting the orbits of comets in the Oort cloud, and leading to a large increase in the number of comets reaching the inner solar system where they might hit Earth. Physicist Adrian Melott and paleontologist Richard Bambach have more recently verified the Raup and Sepkoski finding, but argue that it is not consistent with the characteristics expected of a Nemesis-style periodicity.[tpl]Citation|author = Adrian L.

===Sociological and Cultural Effects===

An impact event is commonly seen as a scenario that would bring about the end of civilization. In 2000, Discover Magazine published a list of 20 possible sudden doomsday scenarios with an impact event listed as the most likely to occur."Twenty ways the world could end suddenly". Discover Magazine.
A joint Pew Research Center/Smithsonian survey from April 21–26, 2010 found that 31% of Americans believed that an asteroid will collide with Earth by 2050. A 61% majority disagreed.http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/625.pdf

===Early Earth impacts===

In the early history of the Earth (about four billion years ago) bolide impacts were almost certainly common since the Solar System contained far more discrete bodies than at present. Such impacts could have included strikes by asteroids hundreds of kilometers in diameter, with explosions so powerful that they vaporized all the Earth's oceans. It was not until this heavy bombardment slackened that life appears to have begun to evolve on Earth.
In April 2014, scientists reported finding evidence of the largest impact event to date in South Africa near a geological formation known as the Barberton Greenstone Belt.  They estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago and that the impactor was approximately [tpl]convert|37|-|58|km|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] wide.  The crater from this event, if it still exists, has not yet been found.“Scientists reconstruct ancient impact that dwarfs dinosaur-extinction blast”, American Geophysical Union, April 9, 2014
The leading theory of the Moon's origin is the giant impact theory, which postulates that Earth was once hit by a planetoid the size of Mars; such a theory is able to explain the size and composition of the moon, something not done by other theories of lunar formation.[tpl]cite journal | title = Dynamics of Lunar Formation | author = Canup, Robin M. | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 441–475 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ARA%26A..42..441C | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.41.082201.113457[/tpl]  Similar (but scaled down) impacts are commonly postulated as the origin of Pluto's large moon Charon, and Haumea's two large moons.

The crater is located south of the Snares Islands ([tpl]convert|120|km|mi|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Stewart Island) on the southern New Zealand shelfMahuika Crater Location Map and is approximately [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] wide. Material extracted from Siple Dome ice core melt water indicates that the impact occurred around 1443 C.E.
Presumed impact events during 533–534 ± 2 CE have been proposed by the dendrochronologist Mike Baillie as a possible cause of several brief (typically 5-10 year) climatic downturns recorded in ancient tree ring patterns. Baillie highlights four such events and suggests that these might have been caused by the dust veils thrown up by the impact of cometary debris.Baillie, Mike G L (1999) Exodus to Arthur: Catastrophic Encounters with Comets.

One of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times was the Tunguska event, which occurred in Siberia, Russia, in 1908. This incident involved an explosion that was probably caused by the airburst of an asteroid or comet [tpl]convert|5|to|10|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] above the Earth's surface, felling an estimated 80 million trees over [tpl]convert|2150|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
In 1913 a ship was reported to have been struck and damaged by a meteorite while sailing between Sydney and South America.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10270353 |title=STRUCK BY A METEORITE. |newspaper=The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)|location=Hobart, Tas. |date=8 January 1913 |accessdate=3 April 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The first known modern strike to a human was on the April 28, 1927 in Aba, Japan, to the head of the five-year-old daughter of Mrs. Kuriyama; a bean-sized stone was found resting on her headband and now resides in a museum, called the Aba stone.Yamamoto, Issei; The Aba, Japan, aerolite: a recent meteoritic fall that injured a human being, Popular Astronomy, Vol. 59, p.431, 1951 NASA abstract The girl recovered several days later.
The first known modern case of a human injured by a space rock occurred on November 30, 1954, in Sylacauga, Alabama.Meteorite Hits Page There a [tpl]convert|4|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] stone chondrite crashed through a roof and hit Ann Hodges in her living room after it bounced off her radio. She was badly bruised. Several persons have since claimed to have been struck by 'meteorites' but no verifiable meteorites have resulted.
A small number of meteor falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the Přibram meteorite, which fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1959.[tpl]Citation |last=Ceplecha |first=Z. |authorlink= |year=1961 |title=Multiple fall of Pribram meteorites photographed |journal=Bull. Astron. Inst. Czechoslovakia |volume=12 |issue= |pages=21–46 |url= |bibcode=1961BAICz..12...21C [/tpl] In this case, two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.

Following the Pribram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites. One of these was the Prairie Network, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern US. This program also observed a meteorite fall, the Lost City chondrite, allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit.[tpl]Citation |last=McCrosky |first=R.

On August 10, 1972, a meteor which became known as the 1972 Great Daylight Fireball was witnessed by many people moving north over the Rocky Mountains from the U.S. Southwest to Canada.  It was filmed by a tourist at the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming with an 8-millimeter color movie camera.[tpl]Youtube|7M8LQ7_hWtE|Grand Teton Meteor Video[/tpl] The object was in the range of size from a car to a house and could have ended its life in a Hiroshima-sized blast, but there was never any explosion. Analysis of the trajectory indicated that it never came much lower than [tpl]convert|58|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] off the ground, and the conclusion was that it had grazed Earth's atmosphere for about 100 seconds, then skipped back out of the atmosphere to return to its orbit around the Sun.
Many impact events occur without being observed by anyone on the ground. Between 1975 and 1992, American missile early warning satellites picked up 136 major explosions in the upper atmosphere.http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/astronomy/q0296.shtml In the November 21, 2002, edition of the journal Nature, Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario reported on his study of U.S. early warning satellite records for the preceding 8 years. He identified 300 flashes caused by [tpl]convert|1|to|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] sized meteors in that time period and estimated the rate of Tunguska-sized events as once in 400 years.Satellite Study Establishes Frequency of Megaton-sized Asteroid Impacts (SpaceRef November 20, 2002) Eugene Shoemaker estimated that one of such magnitude occurs about once every 300 years, though more recent analyses have suggested he exaggerated by an order of magnitude.
In the dark morning hours of January 18, 2000, a fireball exploded over the city of Whitehorse in the Canadian Yukon at an altitude of about [tpl]convert|26|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], lighting up the night like day. The meteor that produced the fireball was estimated to be about [tpl]convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and with a weight of 180 tonnes. This blast was also featured on The Science Channel series Killer Asteroids, with several witness reports from residents in Atlin, British Columbia.
Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/comet.html |title=Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 Collision with Jupiter |accessdate=2008-08-26 |work= |publisher=National Space Science Data Center |date=February 2005[/tpl] In recent years, scientists have observed more Jupiter impact events (See 2009 Jupiter impact event and 2010 Jupiter impact event).
A meteor was observed striking Reisadalen in Nordreisa municipality in Troms County, Norway, on June 7, 2006.  Although initial witness reports stated that the resultant fireball was equivalent to the Hiroshima nuclear explosion, scientific analysis places the force of the blast at anywhere from 100-500 tonnes TNT equivalent – around 3% of Hiroshima's yield.Norway Impact Gentler Than Atomic Bomb (Sky & Telescope June 16, 2006)
On September 15, 2007, a chondritic meteor crashed near the village of Carancas in southeastern Peru near Lake Titicaca, leaving a water-filled hole and spewing gases across the surrounding area. Many residents became ill, apparently from the noxious gases shortly after the impact.
On October 7, 2008, a meteroid labeled [tpl]mpl|2008 TC|3[/tpl] was tracked for 20 hours as it approached Earth and as it fell through the atmosphere and impacted in Sudan. This was the first time an object was detected before it reached the atmosphere and hundreds of pieces of the meteorite were recovered from the Nubian Desert.First-Ever Asteroid Tracked From Space to Earth, Wired, March 25, 2009
On November 21, 2009, a fireball was sighted in South Africa by police and traffic cameras. The probable meteor may have landed in a remote area on the Botswana border, and likely made little impact.Fireball lights up the sky: South African division, Discover magazine, November 30, 2009.
