==Version history==

In version 2.0 introduced true blocking of resources in Google Chrome, which means that most resources can be blocked before they are even downloaded.
Version 2.1 added internationalization. Currently, AdBlock supports over 34 languages.
Version 2.3 added a toolbar button, therefore the separate extension "Browser Button For AdBlock" was retired.

==Filters==

AdBlock uses the same filter syntax as Adblock Plus for Firefox and natively supports Adblock Plus filter subscriptions. Filter subscriptions can be added from a list of recommendations in the "Filter Lists" tab of the AdBlock options page, or by clicking on an Adblock Plus auto-subscribe link.

==CatBlock==

On April 1, 2012 the developer tweaked the code to display LOLcats instead of simply blocking ads.
Initially developed as a short-lived April Fool, the response was so positive that CatBlock is now an optional add-on supported by a monthly subscription.http://adblockforchrome.blogspot.com/2012/04/catblock-lives-on.html
