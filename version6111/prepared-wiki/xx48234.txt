Neuwied ([tpl]IPA-de|nɔʏˈviːt[/tpl]) is a town in the north of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, capital of the District of Neuwied. Neuwied lies on the right bank of the Rhine, 12 km northwest of Koblenz, on the railway from Frankfurt am Main to Cologne. The town has 13 suburban administrative districts: Heimbach-Weis, Gladbach, Engers, Oberbieber, Niederbieber, Torney, Segendorf, Altwied, Block, Irlich, Feldkirchen, Heddesdorf, and Rodenbach. The largest is Heimbach-Weis, with approximately 8000 inhabitants.
Founded by Count Frederick of Wied in 1653, Neuwied was located near the village of Langendorf, destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).  It grew rapidly due to its religious toleration. Among those who sought refuge here was a colony of Moravian Brethren.
Near Neuwied, one of the largest Roman castra on the Rhine has been excavated by archeologists.
In April 1797 the French, under General Louis Lazare Hoche, defeated the Austrians near Neuwied, this being their first decisive success in the French Revolutionary Wars.
Neuwied is the native town of paternal ancestors of John D. Rockefeller, traced to the 16th century and possible French Huguenot refugees. His father's line emigrated to the North American colonies, arriving in New York in 1710, the year of a massive immigration of nearly 2800 Palatine Germans, whose transportation of refugees from London was paid by Queen Anne's government of England.  Neuwied was also the birth town of William of Wied, who briefly held the title of King of Albania in 1914.

==Geography==

Parts of the 86,5 square kilometre area are divided into the suburban districts of:
The core of Neuwied and the former village of Heddesdorf, which belonged to the municipality before these districts were added, are not listed as districts themselves.
Since the inner city of Neuwied is situated on a former bed of the river Rhine, it is at great risk of flooding. It is one of very few towns in the region protected by anti-flood levees, a source of friction with communities downstream.
Neuwied is twinned with the London Borough of Bromley.

==Politics==

The June 2004 municipal council elections led to the following distribution of seats: CDU (22), SPD (17), FWG (4), Grüne (3), FDP (2). The mayor of Neuwied is the social democrat Nicolaus Roth.
