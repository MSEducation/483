[[Inequality (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Inequalities, Elementary algebra

In mathematics, an inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different (see also: equality).
It does not say that one is greater than the other, or even that they can be compared in size.
If the values in question are elements of an ordered set, such as the integers or the real numbers, they can be compared in size.
In either case, a is not equal to b. These relations are known as strict inequalities. The notation a In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict:
An additional use of the notation is to show that one quantity is much greater than another, normally by several orders of magnitude.

==Properties==

Inequalities are governed by the following properties. All of these properties also hold if all of the non-strict inequalities (≤ and ≥) are replaced by their corresponding strict inequalities () and (in the case of applying a function) monotonic
functions are limited to strictly monotonic functions.

===Transitivity===

The Transitive property of inequality states:

===Converse===

The relations ≤ and ≥ are each other's converse:

===Addition and subtraction===

A common constant c may be added to or subtracted from both sides of an inequality:
i.e., the real numbers are an ordered group under addition.

===Multiplication and division===

The properties that deal with multiplication and division state:
More generally, this applies for an ordered field, see below.

===Additive inverse===

The properties for the additive inverse state:

===Multiplicative inverse===

The properties for the multiplicative inverse state:
These can also be written in chained notation as:

===Applying a function to both sides===

Any monotonically increasing function may be applied to both sides of an inequality (provided they are in the domain of that function) and it will still hold. Applying a monotonically decreasing function to both sides of an inequality means the opposite inequality now holds.  The rules for additive and multiplicative inverses are both examples of applying a monotonically decreasing function.
If the inequality is strict (a  b) and the function is strictly monotonic, then the inequality remains strict.  If only one of these conditions is strict, then the resultant inequality is non-strict.  The rules for additive and multiplicative inverses are both examples of applying a strictly monotonically decreasing function.
This is true because the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function.

==Ordered fields==

If (F, +, ×) is a field and ≤ is a total order on F, then (F, +, ×, ≤) is called an ordered field if and only if:
Note that both (Q, +, ×, ≤) and (R, +, ×, ≤) are ordered fields, but ≤ cannot be defined in order to make (C, +, ×, ≤) an ordered field, because −1 is the square of i and would therefore be positive.
The non-strict inequalities ≤ and ≥ on real numbers are total orders. The strict inequalities  on real numbers are strict total orders.

==Chained notation==

The notation a'' This notation can be generalized to any number of terms: for instance, ''a''1 ≤ ''a''2 ≤ ... ≤ ''a''''n'' means that ai ≤ ai+1 for i = 1, 2, ..., n − 1.  By transitivity, this condition is equivalent to ai ≤ aj for any 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.
When solving inequalities using chained notation, it is possible and sometimes necessary to evaluate the terms independently. For instance to solve the inequality 4x Occasionally, chained notation is used with inequalities in different directions, in which case the meaning is the logical conjunction of the inequalities between adjacent terms.  For instance, a 
==Inequalities between means==

There are many inequalities between means. For example, for any positive numbers a1, a2, …, an we have [tpl]nowrap|H ≤ G ≤ A ≤ Q,[/tpl] where

==Power inequalities==

A "Power inequality" is an inequality containing ab terms, where a and b are real positive numbers or variable expressions. They often appear in mathematical olympiads exercises.

===Examples===

==Well-known inequalities==

Mathematicians often use inequalities to bound quantities for which exact formulas cannot be computed easily.  Some inequalities are used so often that they have names:

==Complex numbers and inequalities==

However, an operation ≤ can be defined so as to satisfy only the first property (namely, "if a ≤ b then a + c ≤ b + c"). Sometimes the lexicographical order definition is used:
It can easily be proven that for this definition a ≤ b implies a + c ≤ b + c.

==Vector inequalities==

==General Existence Theorems==

For a general system of polynomial inequalities. One can find a condition that a solution exists. Firstly, any system of polynomial inequalities can be reduced to a system of quadratic inequalities by increasing the number of variables and equations. (For example setting a square of a variable equal to a new variable). A single quadratic polynomial inequality in n-1 variables can be written as:
Which has a solution when:
Systems of inequalities can be written in terms of matrices A, B, C, etc. and the existence of solutions can be written as complicated conditions on these matrices. The solution for two polynomial inequalities in two variables tells us whether two conic section regions overlap or are inside each other. The general solution is not known but such a solution could be theoretically used to solve such unsolved problems such as the Kissing number problem. However the conditions would be so complicated as to require a lot of computing time or clever algorithms.
