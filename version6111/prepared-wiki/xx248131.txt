Since Kanna Arihara was on hiatus at the time of recording (before later leaving the group without ever having returned), it was the first single not to feature every current member. Maimi Yajima and Airi Suzuki are the lead vocalists. Mai Hagiwara is the minor vocalist and the center. It debuted at number 4 in the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart and remained in the chart for 4 weeks.
