The park is between the Macleay River and Hastings River valleys and includes Kemps Pinnacle and Mount Banda Banda, both over 1100 metres above sea level.
The Park is part of the Hastings-Macleay Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.
