==Powers and abilities==

Unlike most comic book magicians, Constantine rarely uses magical spells, unless he has to, especially in combat. Constantine faces most of his challenges relying primarily on his cunning, quick-thinking during fights, vast knowledge of the occult, manipulation of opponents and allies, and an extensive list of contacts. These skills are often more useful than his magical ones. He is known to have deceived many of the most powerful beings in the universe, such as The First of the Fallen and God. In the DC universe, John managed to recruit Batman and Superman through his own manipulation. He is considered by many as being the world's greatest con man.[tpl]cite book|title=Justice League Dark Anuual #1|author=Jeff Lemire|publisher=DC Comics| isbn=[/tpl] Constantine is also one of a few people knowing all the routes to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife, which he uses to escape and teleport without the danger of being chased by enemies.[tpl]cite book|title=The Devil You Know|author=Jamie Delano|publisher=DC Comics| isbn=1-40121-269-7[/tpl] In the graphic novel Pandemonium, he once allowed himself to be killed, but later resurrects himself by exiting the afterlife.
As a sorcerer, Constantine is armed with the knowledge of many magical spells, rituals, and curses, such as evocation, necromancy, illusions, invisibility,Hellblazer #258 and can even use magic to time travel.Hellblazer #273 He also has a wide range of protection magic such as sigils and magic circles that can protect him from both physicalBrightest Day Aftermath #2 and supernatural attacks. But John's most signature ability is synchronicity wave traveling, which is an instinctual supernatural ability for Constantine to make his own luck. This has led John to uncanny luck at games of chance, the ability to avoid and escape harm, meet the right kind of ally to help prevent or stop an apocalyptic event from happening, and reshape the battle he's fighting to his own accord. Constantine is also highly resistant to many psychic attacks such as telepathy, possessions, and mind control. He can even use magic to block off omnipresence, seen where he once used sigils to hide himself from The First of the Fallen.[tpl]cite book|title=Rake at the Gates of Hell|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=DC Comics| isbn= 1-40120-002-8[/tpl] By the New 52, other magical powers such as mild teleportation,Justice League Dark #23Constantine #1 counter spells, electrokineses,Justice League Dark #24 telekinesis,I Vampire #17 and immobilisation have been added.
Aside from sorcery, Constantine has also exhibited considerable mastery in "stage magic skills"—hypnosis, sleight of hand, pick pocketing, and escapology. John also carries with him arsenal of powerful magical artifacts to aid him in battle, such as The House of Mystery which also serves as his transportation to different realms of the universe, and his trademark trench coat that also possesses powerful demonic powers.[tpl]cite book|title=Hellblazer: The Devil's Trenchcoat|author=Peter Milligan|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1401237207[/tpl] Because of tricking the lords of hell into curing his lung cancer, he is perpetually in good health and physicality ever since. Constantine's blood is demonically tainted, initially by a blood transfusion from the demon Nergal, and later by sex with a succubus. His blood has been shown to have healing properties, and is noted to have an age-managing effect.  It also acted as a defense mechanism when attacked by the King of the Vampires,[tpl]cite book|title=Hellblazer: Tainted Love|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-56389-456-4[/tpl] as it is highly corrosive and poisonous. Constantine's skills in unarmed combat varies depending on the writer. Some portrays him as a poor physical fighter, while others as a capable hand-to-hand combatant. However, he has occasionally won fights, either by using magical weapons, by fighting dirty,Hellblazer issues #42, #57 and the graphic novel All His Engines published by DC Vertigo imprint or by quick-thinking.[tpl]cite book|title=Hellblazer: Scab|author=Peter Milligan|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40122-501-2[/tpl]

Alan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he told Wizard Magazine:

==Reception==

The character won the 1986 "Favourite Supporting Character" by Eagle Award, followed by winning it again in the same category a year later.1986: Won "Favourite Supporting Character" Eagle Award In addition to being ranked third in Empire magazine's 50 Greatest Comic Characters and being ranked #10 in Wizard Magazine's Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, he is also listed in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes as #29, stating that "John Constantine is pretty low on the totem pole as far as DC's magical players go. But through a combination of guile, trickery, and plain old ornery charm, Constantine battles the worst Hell has to offer and lives to tell the tale. Constantine is a byproduct of both the punk rock era and Margaret Thatcher's England. He isn't very nice, he drinks and smokes like they're both going out of style, and his friends always seem to pay for his own magical misdeeds. And yet we can't help but love this crusty old magician all the same."IGN:Top 100 Comic Book Heroes
The character also garnered some negative reception, where UGO.com listed both Constantine and Zatanna in UGO's The Dirtiest Comic Book Sex Scenes, where they comment that, "One DC heroine who often finds herself unlucky in love is the backwards magician Zatanna, who can never seem to find a quality dude. One of the most fulfilling relationships she's had to date is with that reprobate sorceror John Constantine, who is the very definition of a "love 'em and leave 'em" kind of dude. The pair hooked up a number of times but their respective worldviews were just too different, plus he's straight Vertigo and she's wiping minds in the Justice League. The commute would be hideous."UGO.com: Constantine and Zatanna During Brian Azarello's run on the series, the Ashes & Dust in the City of Angels story arc gained controversy for portraying Constantine as a homosexual.The Top Ten John Constantine: Hellblazer stories
Fandomania.com ranked the movie Constantine in #13 of their Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptations, stating that Keanu Reeves's performance "was good", although saying it might have been better if "played by the person the character was originally modeled after: Sting of The Police."Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptation TopTenz.net ranked him #5 in Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes, saying that "Just knowing John Constantine is likely to get you killed: during his comic's run just about every member of his supporting cast has either been killed, maimed, mutilated, tortured, and coerced into making deals with fiends from The Pit. And yet Constantine goes on, a supernatural warrior willing to pay almost any price to keep the darkest evil at bay. In recent times Constantine has gotten rid of the guilt and self-loathing plaguing him by magically giving it the physical form of a baby and throwing it off a cliff. What a magnificent bastard..."TopTenz.net: Top 10 Anti-Heroes
Sonia Harris from Comics Should Be Good praised Hellblazer, saying that "watching John delve into his past in order to exorcise his (and the worlds) literal and metaphorical demons is a delight. Simon Bisley does an incredible job of visually contrasting the pretty young version of Constantine with the imposing man he has become. Time and misadventure have scarred and hardened John, and the man he has become has the strength and will to transform his environment by channeling the anger that pained him so much as a young, fresh-faced, suicidal punk kid."[tpl]cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/28/committed-why-you-wish-you-read-hellblazer/ |title=WHY YOU WISH YOU READ HELLBLAZER |publisher=Comics Should Be Good |date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Movies===

====Constantine====

John Constantine appeared in the 2005 film Constantine portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The film used some elements from Garth Ennis' "Dangerous Habits" story arc (issues #41–46)[tpl]Cite web  | last = Rotten| first = Ryan| title = Update: Francis Lawrence Would Do Constantine 2 | date=November 2007 | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=3842 | accessdate=17 December 2008  | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] and others—such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite—from the "Original Sins" trade paperback.[tpl]Cite web  | title = Keanu Reeves, Djimon Hounsou and Director Francis Lawrence on "Constantine" | url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconst072904a.htm | accessdate=17 December 2008  | publisher = About.com  | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] However, the film changed several aspects of the source material, including a number of cosmetic changes to the lead character: his name is spoken as "constan-teen", and Reeves played the role with his natural accent and hair color, as well as the movie basing him in Los Angeles (although the director pointed out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either).[tpl]Cite web | title = Keanu Reeves, Djimon Hounsou and Director Francis Lawrence on "Constantine" Page 2| url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconst072904b.htm | accessdate=17 December 2008 | publisher = About.com | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Other differences to the comic were made, for example giving him a psychic ability to see "half breeds" as they truly are—a curse that caused him to attempt suicide which in turn damned him to Hell. He was also given the ability to rend invisible beings in his proximity visible by using the incantation "Into the light I command thee" and two magical glyphs (called "The Perfect Red King" from Eugenius Philalethes's "The Speculum Veritatis") on his arms to combine, which he uses to uncloak the half breed Gabriel directly after she attacked his friend Chas. Unlike the comic version, Constantine's exorcism tools are primarily based on Christian relics rather than generic supernatural items; the novelisation expanded on this by explaining that, as Constantine comes from a Christian culture, he has a greater natural understanding of the power of Christian relics that makes it easier for him to use them. Constantine's exorcisms are motivated by a desire to redeem himself for his past suicide, yet they are constantly doomed to fail as everything he has done has fundamentally been for his own benefit rather than for the selfless betterment of others. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended, with Lucifer saving the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at failing after Constantine willingly sacrificed a chance to save his own life to ask Satan to send the innocent Isabel Dodson to Heaven (Isabel having committed suicide to prevent herself being used as a host for a demonic incursion). This selfless deed allowing Constantine to regain his place in Heaven. Constantine was also restored to life and his lung cancer was removed.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Goldstein| first=Hilary| title = Constantine Vs.
