Alx Alexander Danielsson (born April 1, 1981 in Ã–stersund) is a Swedish racing driver and the 2006 champion of the Formula Renault 3.5 Series. He currently competes in the Swedish V8 Thundercar Series and part-time in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.

==Career==

Danielsson's career started in karting in 1998, where he stayed until 1999 before moving up to Formula Ford. In 2004 Danielsson progressed to Formula Renault V6 in Europe and Asia before moving onto the Formula Renault 3.5 Series in Europe.
In 2006 he was racing in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series for the British team Comtec Racing and doing exceptionally well. After suffering two hard crashes that could have ended his season at the Spa circuit in Belgium, he managed to take a double win at Donington on September 9 and 10 2006. He was then able to follow up the victories with a third straight victory at Le Mans on September 30 and a fourth victory in Barcelona on October 28. The following day he clinched the FR3.5 Series title via a fifth place in the last race of the season.
In May 2012 Danielsson Motorsport announced that they would be shutting down their race team. This allowed Alx to put full focus on his own racing career.
In 2013 he competed in the Swedish V8 Thundercar Series, and in August made his NASCAR debut in America, driving for Creation-Cope Racing in the Nationwide Series at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.creationcope.com/news/story/Alx-Danielsson-prepares-for-his-NNS-debut|title=Alx Danielsson prepares for his NNS debut!|date=July 29, 2013|publisher=Creation-Cope Racing|accessdate=2013-08-04[/tpl]
