The Colborne Cramahe Hawks are a Canadian Junior ice hockey team based in Colborne, Ontario.  The Hawks are members of the Canadian International Hockey League.  They played in the Greater Metro Junior 'A' Hockey League from 2007 until 2014.  The Hawks originated as the Douro Dukes of Douro, Ontario in 2007.  From 2008 until 2014, the team was known as the Bucks from Beaverton, Ontario and later Bobcaygeon, Ontario.

==History==

The Douro Dukes were one of six expansion teams for the 2007-08 GMHL season.
On September 6, 2007, the Douro Dukes played their first ever game at the Ennismore Arena against the Innisfil Lakers.  John Minarik made 27 saves to record the Dukes first ever win and first ever shutout by a score of 2-0.  Tony DeCarlo scored both the first and second goal in franchise history in the third period of this very close contest.
After a strong start to the season, the Dukes lost many of their key players to defections to other club; including Guy Wallace, Brad Meyers, Mike Banelopoulos, Andrew Bobas, John Minark and Mike Madgett. The Dukes won two of their first four games, beating Innisfil and the Nipissing Alouettes, but the bottom dropped out and the Dukes went on a horrid 38-game losing streak.  Despite this, the Dukes ended up facing the King Wild in the first round of the playoffs.  They kept the first game close, and games two, three, and four close until the third period, but the last year's finalists swept the series 4-games-to-none.
In April 2008, it was announced that the Dukes had moved to become the Warsaw Redmen, but a month later it was disclosed that the team would be moving to Beaverton, Ontario and would be called the Brock Bucks.
On September 14, 2008, the Brock Bucks played their first ever game since relocation.  The game was against the Minden Riverkings in Minden Hills.  The Bucks won 7-5 which snapped the longest running multi-season losing streak in the GMHL at 38 losses.  This win is the franchise's first win since September 22, 2007 in their first game as the Brock Bucks.
In the summer of 2010, it was announced that the team was moving to Bobcaygeon and becoming the Bobcaygeon Bucks.http://www.thescugogstandard.ca/sports/2010/August2010/August5-10/bucs_bobcaygeon-bound-262.html
