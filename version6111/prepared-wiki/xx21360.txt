Olympia is the capital of the State of Washington and the county seat of Thurston County.[tpl]GR|6[/tpl] It was incorporated on January 28, 1859. The population was documented as 46,478 in the 2010 census. The city borders Lacey, to the East, and Tumwater to the South. Olympia is a major cultural center of the Puget Sound region.

==History==

The site of Olympia has been home to Lushootseed-speaking peoples for thousands of years, including Squaxin, Nisqually, Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish.
The first recorded visit by Europeans was in 1792 when Peter Puget and a crew from the British Vancouver Expedition charted the site. In 1846, Edmund Sylvester and Levi Smith jointly claimed the land that now comprises downtown Olympia. In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound for Washington Territory and Olympia became the home of the customs house. Its population steadily expanded from Oregon Trail immigrants. In 1853, the town settled on the name Olympia, at the suggestion of local resident Colonel Isaac N. Ebey,[tpl]cite web|url=http://olympiawa.gov/community/about-olympia/history-of-olympia-washington.aspx|title=History of Olympia, Washington|publisher=olympiawa.gov|date=2012-07-27|accessdate=2012-09-14[/tpl] due to its view of the Olympic Mountains to the Northwest. The area began to be served by a small fleet of steamboats known as the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet.
In 1896, Olympia became the home of the Olympia Brewing Company, which brewed Olympia Beer until 2003.
A 1949 earthquake damaged many historic buildings beyond repair, and they were demolished. Parts of the city also suffered damage from earthquake tremors in 1965 and the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.
In 1967, the state legislature approved the creation of The Evergreen State College in Olympia. Since 1984, Olympia has also been home to the South Puget Sound Community College. Olympia has become a hub for artists and musicians, and has been named one of the best college towns in the nation for its vibrant downtown and access to outdoor activities.(2003) Outside Magazine.

==Geography and climate==

Olympia is located at [tpl]Coord|47|2|33|N|122|53|35|W|type:city[/tpl] (47.042418, −122.893077).[tpl]GR|1[/tpl]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|19.68|sqmi|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|17.82|sqmi|2|abbr=on[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|1.86|sqmi|2|abbr=on[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl]
The city of Olympia is located at the southern end of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet. The Deschutes River estuary was dammed in 1951 to create Capitol Lake. Much of the lower area of downtown Olympia sits on reclaimed land. The cities of Lacey and Tumwater border Olympia.
Olympia has a Marine West Coast climate (Köppen Csb), though sometimes characterized as Mediterranean. Most of western Washington's weather is brought in by weather systems that form near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It contains cold moist air, which brings western Washington cold rain, cloudiness, and fog. November through January are Olympia's rainiest months. City streets, creeks, and rivers often flood during the months of November through February. Olympia's seasonal snowfall for 1981–2011 period averaged [tpl]convert|7.6|in|cm|1[/tpl]. Olympia averages [tpl]convert|49.81|in|mm|sigfig=3[/tpl] of precipitation annually and has a year-round average of 75% cloud cover. According to one MSNBC study, Olympia had more rainy days per year on average over the past 30 years than any city in the lower 48 states.[tpl]cite web|last=Thompson|first=Andrea|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18827213|title=And the rainiest city in the U.S. is|publisher=MSNBC|date=2007-05-23|accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] With a period of record dating back to 1948, extreme temperatures have ranged from [tpl]convert|−8|°F|0[/tpl] on January 1, 1979, up to [tpl]convert|104|°F|0[/tpl], most recently on July 29, 2009; there are six days annually with temperatures reaching [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl], 1.8 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day and 78 nights where the low reaches the freezing mark.

===Parks===

Olympia has a wide array of public parks and nature conservation areas. The Woodard Bay Natural Resources Conservation Area is a [tpl]convert|600|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] parcel that preserves more than [tpl]convert|5|mi|km[/tpl] of Puget Sound waterfront along the Woodard and Chapman bays of the Henderson Inlet. Percival Landing Park includes [tpl]convert|0.9|mi|km[/tpl] of boardwalk along Budd Inlet, as well as a playground, picnic areas and a large open space. Percival Landing closed in 2010 for an extensive remodel after saltwater degradation and opened again to the public in the summer of 2011. The Watershed Park is the site of the former waterworks for the city, and today features a loop trail with a large second-growth forest. Other parks include Priest Point Park, Burfoot Park, Sunrise Park and Yauger Park, which is home to one of Olympia's public skate parks including Friendly Grove which is nestled in a small Eastside Community, and Trillium Park, which was created by the efforts of adjoining neighborhood associations with the easement of private property. The Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge is located just outside of Olympia, as is the Capitol State Forest.

===Artesian water===

Olympia was historically dependent on artesian waters. Early settlers in Swantown and Tumwater used artesian springs for their main water supply. The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) was the main community well where settlers gathered to socialize. The artesian well in the Diamond Parking lot at Fourth Avenue and Jefferson Street is active, located in the parking lot 421 4th Street. The City of Olympia is purchasing the lot, in part to maintain the well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://olympiawa.gov/documents/CouncilPackets/20100614/FA_DiamondPkgLotSTF.pdf|title=Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement for Acquisition of Diamond Parking Lot, June 2010|author=City of Olympia|accessdate=2011-02-03[/tpl] Another still flows at the corner of Olympia Avenue and Washington Street in the Bigelow Neighborhood. The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an artesian well until the construction of a new park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, the main water source for Olympia, is fed by artesian wells, and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells.
Recent efforts to protect and preserve the free flowing artesian well on 4th Ave in downtown Olympia began in 1991 when Jim Ingersoll, a local psychologist, called on the city council to acquire the well and develop it as a community park.  Ingersoll’s interest in the well started in a conversation with Dick Batdorf, co-founder of Batdorf and Bronson coffee roasting.  Batdorf told Ingersoll that the secret to great coffee was great water – specifically artesian water.  Subsequently Ingersoll met at the Spar restaurant with Herb Legg  and John Robinson  both of whom had worked in the 1950s and 60s to protect the artesian wells in Watershed Park. Legg and Robinson worked behind the scenes to get an article published in the Olympian on February 24, 1992 calling for community support of the well.  Ingersoll was flooded with phone calls offering time, talent, resources and money following the publication.  Herb Legg and friends sponsored a public meeting at the Library where more than 50 people each donated $50.  And a single $3000 donation followed the next day.
With hundreds of people using the well every day, community support grew to become “The Friends of Artesians,” an informal organization of advocates who over the course of 20 years mapped and researched the history of artesian wells in Olympia, raised money to test water quality and make improvements to the site and kept the vision of a free flowing community well alive.  In the fall of 2008, The Friends announced they would stop testing the water quality after February 2009.  These actions renewed interest in protecting the well and lead to the creation of H2Olympia, a non-profit organization.   
sources: In downtown Olympia, efforts to preserve the use of artesian water at the one remaining public well has been the mission of H2Olympia: Artesian Well Advocates. In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 towards improvements of an artesian well, located in a parking lot that was recently purchased by the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/01/13/1504565/city-will-protect-improve-well.html#storylink=mirelated|title=City of Olympia Will Protect, Improve Artesian Well.|author=Matt Batcheldor|accessdate=2011-02-08[/tpl] Renovations at the artesian well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In Spring of 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was also installed at the site of the well.
