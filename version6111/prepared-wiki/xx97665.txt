NEdit, the Nirvana editor, is a text editor and source code editor for the X Window System. It has an interface similar to text editors on Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, rather than to older UNIX editors like Emacs. It was initially developed by Mark Edel for Fermilab and released under a very restrictive licence, but today it is distributed under the less restrictive GNU General Public License (plus Motif clause ยน), and developed as an independent open source project by a team of developers. Nedit was also distributed with the IRIX operating system.
NEdit is extensible through a C-like macro language, and features automatic indentation and syntax highlighting for a wide variety of computer languages. NEdit can also process tags files generated using the Unix ctags command or the Exuberant Ctags program.
Its user interface is built using the Motif toolkit, which made it an immediate success with a wide range of proprietary Unix platforms whose user interfaces use the toolkit. For a fully open source version, the alternative LessTif library can be used instead.
There has not been a release since v5.5 in 2004 and major development on SourceForge stopped in 2010,http://sourceforge.net/projects/nedit/stats/scm?repo=CVSRepository&dates=2010-01-01+to+2012-07-31 with minor updates being made as recently as October 2012.http://sourceforge.net/projects/nedit/stats/scm?repo=CVSRepository&dates=2012-10-01+to+2012-11-01
