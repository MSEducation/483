[[Postage stamps and postal history of Sharjah]]

CATEGORIES: Sharjah (emirate), Philately of the United Arab Emirates

Civil mail from Sharjah went through the post office in Dubai until 1963.[tpl]cite book |authorlink=Stuart Rossiter |last=Rossiter |first=Stuart |first2=John |last2=Flower |title=The Stamp Atlas |location=London |publisher=Macdonald |year=1986 |page=100 |isbn=0-356-10862-7 [/tpl] Military mail from the British Forces stationed in the area went through the RAF airport in Sharjah. 
On 10 July 1963, Sharjah opened its own post office and began to issue its stamps and postal stationery under the name of Sharjah & Dependencies (which included Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Dibbah). There were also unauthorized overprints using Himriyyah, a name of a village in the sheikhdom. Sharjah and its dependencies joined the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, but it continued to issue its own stamps. On 31 July 1972, the UAE assumed full postal responsibilities. Nevertheless, Sharjah continued to use its own stamps until the issuance of the first UAE definitive series on 1 January 1973. Covers with mixed UAE and Sharjah frankings are known.
Many of the Sharjah stamps feature subjects that are unrelated to the emirate, therefore many popular catalogues do not list them.[tpl]cite book |last=Carlton |first=R.
