The Jackson Senators was the name of at least two minor league baseball teams that played in Jackson, Mississippi.

==First team==

The first known Jackson Senators club competed in the Cotton States League before 1953. This was a class C minor-league club, and was the last team to represent the city of Jackson before the arrival of the class AA Jackson Mets for the 1975 season.

==Second Team==

The second Jackson Senators team was a member of the independent Central Baseball League from 2002 to 2005, a league that was not affiliated with Major League Baseball.  The Senators won the CBL title in 2003. After the CBL disbanded, Jackson was left without a league for the 2006 season.
On January 24, 2006, officials with the team's ownership group, Mississippi Baseball Club LLC, announced that they would not be operating a professional independent team in Jackson for the 2006 season. Instead, the Greenville (South Carolina) Braves relocated to suburban Pearl as the Mississippi Braves.
The team played at Smith-Wills Stadium.
