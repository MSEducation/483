"All For Me Grog" is a traditional folk song that was originally popular with sailors and later adopted by folk music performers and pub singers. [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.irishmusicdaily.com/all-for-me-grog| title = All For Me Grog – a sailor’s downfall | [/tpl] It tells the tale of a man who sells all his possessions, and even his wife, to pay for drink and tobacco. Although the song is effectively about a man's ruin through drink, it is upbeat and celebratory rather than regretful. It is usually performed as a raucous chorus song. Grog originally referred to a daily ration of rum that used to be given to sailors in the British Navy. It later came to refer to all types of drink. 
There is an Australian version of the song called Across the Western Plains. 
The song was recorded as a single by The Dubliners which charted at No.10 in Ireland in July 1967.http://irishcharts.ie/search/placementhttp://www.discogs.com/Dubliners-All-For-Me-Grog/release/3549956
