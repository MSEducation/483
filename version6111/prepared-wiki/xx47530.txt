CATEGORIES: Weezer albums, 2001 albums, Geffen Records albums, Albums produced by Ric Ocasek, Albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America

Weezer, also known as "The Green Album" due to the lime-green cover, is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Weezer, released on May 15, 2001. Produced by Ric Ocasek, it was released on Geffen Records, as were its two predecessors. This is the first, and only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh, who replaced long-time member Matt Sharp. The musical style of Weezer is grounded in the power pop genre, featuring strong melodies, crisp vocal harmonies, and prominent guitar riffs. It is also Weezer's quickest selling album.
Weezer received generally favourable reviews. The album is often recognized as a rebirth for the band after a long hiatus following their 1996 album, Pinkerton. The album attained chart success by debuting at number four in the US and number two in Canada. The album also charted within the top ten in Norway and Sweden. Since its release in 2001, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States.
Three singles were released from the album including "Hash Pipe", "Island in the Sun", and "Photograph". The first single, "Hash Pipe", was a worldwide modern rock hit, charting on seven different charts, despite their record label's reluctance to release it as the first single.

==Background and development==

Following the commercial and critical failure of Pinkerton (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University in an attempt to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting.Luerssen (2004), p. 241. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in a band called Homie, which was based in Boston.Luerssen (2004), p. 242. One of the members of Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.Luerssen (2004), p. 243.
By February 1998, Cuomo had quietly disbanded Homie and headed to Los Angeles to begin work on Weezer demos with Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson.Luerssen (2004), p. 245. At this point, bassist Matt Sharp was absent from numerous Weezer rehearsals and was becoming estranged from the band.Luerssen (2004), p. 255.Luerssen (2004), p. 256. On April 8, 1998, Sharp announced his official exit from Weezer to devote all his energies to his band, The Rentals.Luerssen (2004), p. 257. It was quickly announced that former Homie member Welsh would take over on bass for Weezer.265">Luerssen (2004), p. 265.[/ref]Luerssen (2004), p. 259. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and, in the latter half of 1998, drummer Patrick Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo,Luerssen (2004), p. 266. who went into a period of admitted depression,Luerssen (2004), p. 267. during which he painted the walls of his home black and put "fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets of fiberglass so that no light could get through."
By the beginning of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield.Luerssen (2004), p. 269. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from contact with the outside world.Luerssen (2004), p. 270.Luerssen (2004), p. 272. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem.Luerssen (2004), p. 280. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.
Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was connecting and growing on the internet,Luerssen (2004), p. 307. which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton.Luerssen (2004), p. 281. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, in the years following the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various web pages.[tpl]cite web | last =Ramirez | first =Ramon | url = http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/06/14/LifeArts/5.More.College.Rock.Albums.For.Your.Inner.Indie.Snob-2915124.shtml | title = 5 more college rock albums for your inner indie snob| work = The Daily Texan | accessdate = 2007-10-01|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023222341/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/06/14/LifeArts/5.More.College.Rock.Albums.For.Your.Inner.Indie.Snob-2915124.shtml |archivedate = October 23, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] This expanding internet activity would later set the stage for the band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered an extremely lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival.Luerssen (2004), p. 285. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album.Luerssen (2004), p. 286. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.
Eventually, the band started performing at higher profile gigs such as the Warped Tour.Luerssen (2004), p. 292. Cuomo later remarked, "We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed."Luerssen (2004), p. 293. The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled.Luerssen (2004), p. 295.Luerssen (2004), p. 304. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were often referred to as Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated as SS2K).

==Recording==

On October 23, Cuomo announced that the band would start recording material "with or without" a producer.Luerssen (2004), p. 308. However, the band's record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self-produced album Pinkerton. The band began rehearsing and arranging both the Summer Songs of 2000 and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford. The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasek—who had also produced their debut album—as producer,Luerssen (2004), p. 310. and began sending demos to Ocasek during the summer of 2000.Luerssen (2004), p. 309. There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in Los Angeles or Ocasek's New York home, with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios. The band continued to demo new music daily and started to weed through more than seventy-five demos, eventually homing in on twenty-five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek's arrival.Luerssen (2004), p. 311. Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs.Luerssen (2004), p. 313.
Recording sessions for the album began in early December, with Ocasek providing creative feedback to the band by telephone. On December 27, the band embarked on what would be close to six weeks of studio work by playing songs repetitively in order to track the bass and drums parts. They also did "scratch takes" of the vocals and guitar, designed to get accurate rhythm tracks before being redone more efficiently later in the recording process. While recording the album, the band continued to perform gigs under the pseudonym Goat Punishment.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 314Luerssen (2004), p. 312.
During the recording sessions, an executive at the band's label, Geffen Records, visited to observe the band's progress and expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. This feedback eventually forced the band to discard a few of the album's possible songs.Luerssen (2004), p. 315. The band then relocated for three weeks to a smaller studio in another part of Cello Studios where Cuomo and Bell worked on guitar takes while the entire band recorded vocal tracks.Luerssen (2004), p. 316. Ocasek remarked, "Rivers always does his guitar parts in one take."
Mixing for the album began on January 31 by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios.Luerssen (2004), p. 318.Luerssen (2004), p. 321. Bell was absent from the mixing process.Luerssen (2004), p. 319.

==Packaging==

The art direction of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch.[tpl]cite AV media notes| title = Weezer| others= Weezer| year = 2001| type = liner| publisher = Geffen Records[/tpl] The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh, Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to right in front of a plain, lime-green backdrop in a manner similar to the band's debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album,Luerssen (2004), p. 326. and also to symbolize the band's back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: "Torniamo all'antico e sarà un progresso",[tpl]cite web | last =Field | first =Thalia | url = http://www.theharvardcrimson.com/article/2002/2/22/the-grass-is-always-greener-for/ | title = The Grass Is Always Greener For Rivers Cuomo | work = | publisher =Harvard Crimson | accessdate = 2008-02-12[/tpl]Luerssen (2004), p. 343. from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means "Let us return to old times and that will be progress."[tpl]cite web  | last = Songfacts staff  | title = Hash Pipe by Weezer Songfacts  | publisher = Songfacts  | url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1405  | accessdate = 2010-09-19[/tpl]
The picture inside of the CD booklet is a photo of Weezer playing live, featuring (in the lower right hand corner) an overlay of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T.

This was Weezer's first album to feature a transparent CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word "No" can be found on the back of the spine.[tpl]cite AV media notes| title= Weezer| others= Weezer| year = 2001| type = tray insert| publisher = Geffen Records[/tpl] Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead's album OK Computer which contains the text "I like you.

The album contains the dedication "In loving memory of Mykel and Carli."

==Release and promotion==

The album was met with enthusiasm from the record label.Luerssen (2004), p. 324. "They had nothing but supportive and excited things to say about it," remarked Karl Koch. However, the album's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo's choice of "Hash Pipe" as the first single. Citing the song's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that "Don't Let Go" be chosen as the first single.Luerssen (2004), p. 325. However, Cuomo continued to fight and "Hash Pipe" eventually became the album's first single. The label again tried to postpone the release date further until June, but the band convinced them to adhere to the original May 15 release date.Luerssen (2004), p. 335.

===Singles===

The first single from the album was "Hash Pipe". The video for "Hash Pipe" was directed by Marcos Siega and was the first of many Weezer videos that Siega would direct.[tpl]cite DVD notes |title=Weezer – Video Capture Device |titlelink=Weezer – Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991–2002 |origyear=2004 |others=Karl Koch |type=liner |publisher=Geffen Records[/tpl] In the video, Weezer performs in an arena while a group of sumo wrestlers are fighting in the background. The song title was often censored as "H*** Pipe" (the title employed on the music video's title card) or "Half Pipe."Luerssen (2004), p. 338. The song became a huge hit on the MTV show Total Request Live,Luerssen (2004), p. 339. and also received heavy rotation on radio, eventually peaking at number two on the US Modern Rock Charts.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=weezer|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Hash Pipe – Weezer|accessdate=2010-08-16|work=Billboard[/tpl] The song even landed the band a nomination for High Times magazine's "Pot Song of the Year".[tpl]cite web | last = Weiss | first = Neal | url = http://new.music.yahoo.com/weezer/news/artist-name-weezer-id-1028852-staind-afroman-spark-the-doobies--12062863 | title = Weezer, Staind, Afroman Spark The 'Doobies' | work = | publisher =Yahoo!

The next single, "Island in the Sun", was a successful radio hit and became one of the band's biggest oversea hits.[tpl]cite web | last = Koch | first = Karl | url = http://www.weezer.com/news/greenalbum/greenalbumBIGPAGE.html#islandl#island | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030323221459/http://www.weezer.com/news/greenalbum/greenalbumBIGPAGE.html#islandl#island | archivedate = 2003-03-23 | title = Weezer The Green Album – Island in the Sun | publisher =Weezer.com | accessdate = 2010-09-18[/tpl] It peaked at number 11 on the US Modern Rock Charts[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=weezer|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Island in the Sun – Weezer|accessdate=2010-08-16|work=Billboard[/tpl] and at number 31 on the UK Top 40.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/weezer/|title=Weezer – Artist Chart History|accessdate=2011-01-07|publisher=The Official Charts[/tpl] Two music videos were created for the song: the first video, directed by Marcos Siega, shows Weezer playing the song at a Mexican couple's wedding reception and features all four band members.Luerssen (2004), p. 356. This version remains the more obscure of the two, receiving less airplay than the second. The executives at MTV disliked Siega's video, prompting the band to film a second video.Luerssen (2004), p. 363. This second version was directed by Spike Jonze and featured the band playing with various wild animals on a supposedly remote hill (although it was actually filmed a short distance outside of Los Angeles, possibly near Simi Valley).Luerssen (2004), p. 362.Luerssen (2004), p. 365. Only Brian Bell, Rivers Cuomo and Patrick Wilson appear in this video, as then bassist Mikey Welsh had left the band shortly before shooting.Luerssen (2004), p. 364.Luerssen (2004), p. 366. It is also rumored that original bassist Matt Sharp was approached to be in the video, though it is unclear if the offer was ever actually made.Luerssen (2004), p. 523. Scott Shriner, who was filling in for Welsh and would later become a permanent member of Weezer, stated in the commentary for "Video Capture Device" that he almost asked the band to let him appear in the video.[tpl]cite DVD notes |title=Weezer – Video Capture Device |titlelink=Weezer – Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991–2002 |origyear=2004 |others=Karl Koch |type=commentary |publisher=Geffen Records[/tpl] The second video received much wider airplay than the original and has become the standard video for the song.
The third and final single from the album was "Photograph", which was released to radio in early November.Luerssen (2004), p. 388. The single peaked at number 17 on the US Modern Rock Charts. In Japan it was released as the first single instead of "Hash Pipe."[tpl]cite web | last = Koch | first = Karl | url = http://www.weezer.com/info/tunes/index03.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215201959/http://www.weezer.com/info/tunes/index03.html | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | title = Tunes: The Weezer Discography – Page 3 | publisher =Weezer.com | accessdate = 2010-09-18[/tpl] The band felt the song didn't have the staying power of the previous singles,Luerssen (2004), p. 392. and thus decided to pass on a big-name director for the music video, opting instead to have Karl Koch shoot and edit a video from on-the-road footage.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Weezer received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/weezer-2001 | title = Weezer: Weezer (2001): Reviews | work = | publisher =Metacritic | accessdate = 2007-09-10[/tpl] Allmusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave the album a  rating of four and a half stars, stated that "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [tpl]sic[/tpl] so well, no matter how many bands try."[tpl]Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r532380 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |accessdate=2007-11-24[/tpl] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board was one of the best ideas the band had, as The Green Album is certainly water tight all around."[tpl]cite web | last = Thompson | first = Jason | url = http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/w/weezer-st.shtml | title = Weezer: Weezer ("The Green Album") – PopMatters Music Review | work = | publisher =Popmatters | accessdate = 2007-12-10[/tpl] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to The Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. ... Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action.[tpl]cite web|url = http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/2910-dis-album-of-the-year-you-must-be-joking-the-best-of-2001 | title = DiS Album of the year? you must be joking! - The Best of 2001 | work = | publisher =Drowned In Sound | accessdate = 2012-11-03[/tpl] Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.[tpl]cite news|title=The Best 50 Albums of 2001|magazine=Q|date=December 2001|pages=60–65[/tpl]
Not all the reviews were complimentary.
