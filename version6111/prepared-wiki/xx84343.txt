[[Kate Greenaway Medal]]

CATEGORIES: Kate Greenaway Medal, Awards established in 1955, 1955 establishments in the United Kingdom

The Kate Greenaway Medal is a British literary award that annually recognises "distinguished illustration in a book for children". It is conferred upon the illustrator by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) which inherited it from the Library Association.
The Medal is named after the 19th-century English illustrator of children's books Kate Greenaway (1846–1901). It was established in 1955 and inaugurated next year for 1955 publications, but no work was considered suitable. The first Medal was awarded in 1957 to Edward Ardizzone for Tim All Alone (Oxford, 1956), which he also wrote. That first Medal was dated 1956. Only since 2007 the Medal is dated by its presentation during the year following publication. The Greenaway is a companion to the Carnegie Medal which recognises one outstanding work of writing for children and young adults (conferred upon the author).
Nominated books must be first published in the U.K. during the preceding school year (September to August), with English-language text if any.
The award by CILIP is a gold Medal and £500 worth of books donated to the illustrator's chosen library. Since 2000 there is also a £5000 cash prize from a bequest by the children's book collector Colin Mears.

==Latest rendition==

Levi Pinfold won the 2013 Greenaway Medal for his illustration of Black Dog (Templar Publishing), which he also wrote.
There were seven books on the 2014 shortlist announced 18 March, each published September 2012 to August 2013. The official website provides bibliographic data, front cover images, capsules, annotations for the public by the judging panel, and reader ages (given here) that range from 3+ to 9+.  The winner will be announced 23 June 2014. 
Recommended ages have ranged from 0+ to 11+ for books on the shortlist since 2001.
Five of the shortlist works were created with other writers (see far below). Birgitta Sif both wrote and illustrated Oliver, as Jon Klassen did This Is Not My Hat. Klassen, a Canadian, won the 2013 Caldecott Medal for This Is Not My Hat, recognising the previous year's "most distinguished American picture book for children".

==Rules==

Library and information professionals (CILIP) nominate books in September and October, after the close of the publication year. A panel of 12 children's librarians in CILIP's youth interest group (YLG) judges both the Carnegie and Greenaway books.
Currently the shortlist is announced in March and the winner in June, between nine and 21 months after first U.K. publication. 
Candidates must be published in the U.K. during the preceding year (September to August). They must be published for young people, and published in the U.K. originally or within three months in case of co-publication. English must be the language of any text, or one of dual languages.
"All categories of illustrated books for children and young people are eligible."
CILIP specifies numerous points of artistic style, format, and visual experience, and also "synergy of illustration and text" that should be  considered "where applicable". Furthermore, "The whole work should provide pleasure from a stimulating and satisfying visual experience which leaves a lasting impression. Illustrated work needs to be considered primarily in terms of its graphic elements, and where text exists particular attention should be paid to the synergy between the two."

==Winners==

[tpl]update after|2014|06[/tpl]Through 2013 there have been 56 Greenaway Medals awarded in 58 years, covering 1955 to 2012 publications approximately. No eligible book published in 1955 or 1958 was considered suitable.
From 2007 the medals are dated by the year of presentation; previously by the calendar year of British publication, which then defined the eligible works.

==Winners of multiple awards==

Fourteen different illustrators have won two of the 55 Greenaway Medals awarded through 2012. The first winner of two Medals was John Burningham, 1963 and 1970.
Only A Monster Calls (Walker Books, 2011), by Patrick Ness and Jim Kay, has won both the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals for writing and illustration (2012).
No book has won both the Greenaway Medal and the American Caldecott Medal, which recognises a picture book illustrated by a U.S. citizen or resident. The recently common practice of co-publication makes a double win possible.
Gail E. Haley is the only illustrator to win both: the 1971 Caldecott for A Story a Story (1970) and the 1976 Greenaway for The Post Office Cat. She also wrote both books.
Helen Oxenbury, who won the 1969 and 1999 medals, was also a "Highly Commended" runner-up four times from 1989 to 1994; the distinction was used 31 times in 29 years to 2002 and no other illustrator was highly commended more than twice.
Michael Foreman, who won the 1982 and 1989 medals, was highly commended once and four times a "Commended" runner-up, a distinction used 68 times in 44 years to 2002. 

==50-year Greenaway of Greenaways (2007)==

For the 50th anniversary,[tpl]efn|name=50th[/tpl] CILIP posted online information about all of the winning works (1955–2005) and conducted a poll to identify the nation's favourite Kate Greenaway Medalist. The winner was announced 21 June 2007 at the British Library. By less than one percentage point Dogger, illustrated and written by Shirley Hughes (1977), outpolled Each Peach Pear Plum illustrated by Janet Ahlberg and written by Allan Ahlberg (1978).Eccleshare, Julia (21 June 2007).

==Shortlists==

Headings give the official award dates: years of publication before 2006; years of presentation after 2006.
Illustrator Harold Jones received a Special Commendation for the 1954 Carnegie Medal, for his part in Lavender's Blue: A Book of Nursery Rhymes, compiled by Kathleen Lines (Oxford) — a 180-page collection named for "Lavender's Blue", which Oxford University Press has reprinted many times.  It was "a major reason" for the Library Association to establish the Kate Greenaway Medal that year. No 1955 work was judged worthy in 1956, so the Greenaway was actually inaugurated one year later, recognising a 1956 publication.
