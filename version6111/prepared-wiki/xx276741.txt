[[Pedro Seguin]]

CATEGORIES: 1069 deaths, Bishops of Ourense, Year of birth unknown

Pedro Seguin ([tpl]lang-la|Petrus Seguini[/tpl]) was the fifth bishop of the restored diocese of Ourense from 1157 until his death in 1069. He possibly hailed from Poitou or perhaps the Poitevin colony in El Bierzo.The surname Seguini (perhaps a patronymic, meaning "son of Seguin") is known to have been held by some members of the Poitevin colony of El Bierzo in the latter half of the 12th century.
Pedro is probably the magister (teacher) associated with the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela from about the same time. He was on good terms with the kings during his episcopate: Alfonso VII "rejoiced" to learn of his election and Ferdinand II may have employed him as a confessor.Richard A.
