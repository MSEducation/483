==Overview==

Tin City Airport is a United States Air Force military airstrip.  Its mission is to provide contractor access to the Tin City Long Range Radar Station for equipment servicing and other requirements.
The airstrip was conducted in 1951 during the construction of the Tin City Air Force Station.   During the station's operational use as a manned radar station, it provided transportation for station personnel and for supplies and equipment to be airlifted to the station.     With the manned radar station's closure in 1983, the airstrip now provides access to the unattended site for maintenance personnel and other requirements.
It is not staffed by any support personnel, and is not open to the public.   During the winter months, it may be inaccessible due to the extreme weather conditions at the location.
