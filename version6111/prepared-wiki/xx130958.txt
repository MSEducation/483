Dennis M. DeTurck (born July 15, 1954) is an American mathematician known for his work in partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry, in particular contributions to the theory of the Ricci flow and the prescribed Ricci curvature problem.  He first used the DeTurck trick to give an alternative proof of the short time existence of the Ricci flow and has found other uses since then.  
He received a B.S. (1976) from Drexel University where he stood out as an extraordinarily brilliant mathematician.  DeTurck was known for readily solving homework problems and then taking the issue a step furtherâ€”wherever his creative mind led him.  DeTurck also was an accomplished flute player and lead the flute sections in a variety of music ensembles.  As a result of his energy and drive, he finished the 5-year program at Drexel in 4 years.
He received an M.A. (1978) and Ph.D. (1980) in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania.  His Ph.D. supervisor was Jerry Kazdan.[tpl]MathGenealogy|id=23121[/tpl]
He is currently Evan C Thompson Professor for Excellence in Teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, where he has been the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences since 2004 and Faculty Master of Riepe College House.[tpl]cite web|url=http://riepe.house.upenn.edu/house_staff[/tpl]  In 2002 DeTurck won the Haimo Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his teaching. Despite being recognized for excellence in teaching, he has been criticized for his belief that fractions are "as obsolete as Roman numerals" and suggesting that they not be taught to younger students.
In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-10.
