Digital hardcore is a music genre that melds hardcore punk with electronic music such as hardcore techno, industrial and drum and bass. The style developed in Germany during the early 1990s, and often has sociological or left-extremist lyrical themes.

==Characteristics==

Digital hardcore music is typically fast and abrasive; combining the speed, heaviness and attitude of hardcore punk, thrash metal, and partly of riot grrrl"I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock."

Some bands, like Atari Teenage Riot, incorporate elements of hip-hop music, such as freestyle rap.
The electric guitar (either real or sampled and usually heavily distorted) is used alongside samplers, synthesizers and drum machines. While the use of electronic instruments is a must, bass guitars, electric guitars, and drum kits are optional. Vocals are more often shouted than sung by more than one member of the group. Typically, the lyrics are highly politicized and espouse left-wing or anarchist ideals.

===1990s===

The music was first defined by the band Atari Teenage Riot, who formed in Berlin, Germany in 1992. The band's frontman, Alec Empire, coined the term "digital hardcore", setting up the independent record label Digital Hardcore Recordings in 1994.Interview with J.

Retrieved on 2008-05-28. German bands with a similar style began signing to the label and its underground popularity grew, with small digital hardcore festivals being held in several German cities. By the mid-1990s, a number of new record labels specializing in the genre were formed around the world. These included Gangster Toons Industries (Paris), Praxis (London), Cross Fade Enter Tainment (Hamburg), Drop Bass Network (U.S.), and Bloody Fist (Australia). DHR also had some kinship with the Frankfurt labels Mille Plateaux and Riot Beats.
