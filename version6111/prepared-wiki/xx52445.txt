===Bus===

Several city bus lines link LGA to the New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road, with free transfers provided for MetroCard users making subway connections. The buses are wheelchair accessible and are operated by MTA New York City Transit and MTA Bus Company:
There are also many private bus lines operating express buses to Manhattan, the Hudson Valley, and Long Island. The Port Authority runs two free shuttle bus routes, which operate at all times except overnight hours, within the airport connecting all terminals and parking lots.

===Taxi===

Taxicabs serving the airport are licensed by New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYCTLC). The fares within New York City are metered. Uniformed Taxi Dispatchers are available to assist passengers before they start the rides.[tpl]cite web |title=Taxi, Car and Van Service - Ground Transportation|url=http://www.panynj.gov/airports/lga-taxi-car-van-service.html|work=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|accessdate=March 5, 2010[/tpl] The airport accessible directly from Grand Central Parkway.[tpl]cite web |last=Hanseder|first=Tony|title=LaGuardia LGA Airport Overview|url=http://www.ifly.com/la-guardia-airport|work=ifly.com|accessdate=May 2, 2012[/tpl]
