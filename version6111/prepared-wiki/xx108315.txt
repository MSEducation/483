The Lightning Express was a professional wrestling tag team, composed of Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner.

==History==

Armstrong and Horner first teamed under the moniker The Lightning Express in 1984, in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions. The name came from Horner's nickname, "White Lightning", and the remarkable speed of both wrestlers.
A babyface team, they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship from The Hollywood Blonds. The Lightning Express split up soon after, and each went his separate way, until they reformed in Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986. Here they feuded with The Midnight Express and the team of Ivan Koloff and Krusher Khruschev, over the NWA United States Tag Team Championship.
They left Crockett for the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1987, where they won the UWF Tag Team Championship from Sting and Rick Steiner and feuded with The Sheepherders. When Jim Crockett, Jr. bought the UWF in 1987, the team returned to his promotion and wrestled until 1988, when they split up again. In January 1991, The Lightning Express wrestled on WCW Power Hour; they had a handful of further appearances under that name for WCW. They teamed again a few times in 1994 for WCW; only wrestling as jobbers, the team name was rarely mentioned on-air.
