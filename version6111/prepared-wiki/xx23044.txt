Samuel Jones Tilden  (February 9, 1814 – August 4, 1886) was the 25th Governor of New York and the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Presidency in the disputed election of 1876, winning a popular vote majority, but ultimately being denied victory by the electoral college. A political reformer, he was a Bourbon Democrat who worked closely with the New York City business community and led the fight against the corruption of Tammany Hall.

==Early life and career==

Tilden was born in New Lebanon in New York State. He was descended from Nathaniel Tilden, an early English settler who came to America in 1634. His father and other family members were the makers of Tilden's Extract, a popular patent medicine of the 1800s and early 1900s derived from cannabis.William Lee Richter, Historical Dictionary of the Civil War and Reconstruction, 2004, page 610The Pharmaceutical Era magazine, Obituary, Samuel J. Tilden (nephew of New York Governor, March, 1914, page 117
He studied at Yale University,Yale University, The Report of the President, 1909, page 60 then studied law at New York University.[tpl]cite book|title=The life and public services of Hon. Samuel J. Tilden: Democratic nominee ...|author=Theodore Pease Cook|page=9[/tpl] He was admitted to the bar in 1841, becoming a skilled corporate lawyer, with many railroad companies as clients in the shaky railroad boom decade of the 1850s. His legal practice,Maynard v Tilden, 28 F1 688, August 28, 1886 combined with shrewd investments, made him rich.  Tilden's success at money management and investing caused many of Tilden's friends, relatives and political allies, including Martin Van Buren, to allow Tilden to manage their finances.[tpl]cite book |first=Bill |last=Severn |title=Samuel J.

From 1843 to 1844 he served as New York City's Corporation Counsel.Rpy Morris, Jr., Fraud of the Century: Rutherford B. Hayes, Samuel Tilden and the Stolen Election of 1876, 2007, page 89
He was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co.) in 1846, and a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1846. In 1848, largely on account of his personal attachment to Martin Van Buren, he participated in the revolt of the “Barnburners” or Free-Soil faction of the New York Democrats. He was among the few such who did not join the Republican Party and, in 1855, was the candidate of the Soft faction for New York State Attorney General.
Tilden became chairman of the Democratic State Committee after the Civil War. After having good relations with William M. Tweed and working closely together with him in the Democratic Party,[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50A13FD3F5B177B93C5A9178CD85F428784F9 | work=The New York Times | title=Tilden And Tweed.; The Twin Leaders Of The Newyork Democracy.The Story Of Their Connection Unwillingly Told--The Governor's "Dear Friend" Of Ten Years Ago--$5,000 For The Campaign Of 1868 From A Man Of "Moderate Means"--How Tilden Helped To Build Up The Influence Of Tweed | date=July 7, 1876[/tpl] Tilden came into conflict with the Tweed Ring of New York City.
In 1867 Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from New York University.New York University, General Alumni Catalogue of New York University, 1833-1905, 1906, page 170
Tilden led the reform movement in the Democratic Party, and played a key role in the Tweed Ring's demise. He was again a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 18th D.) in 1872, and took a leading part in the impeachment of Judge George G. Barnard. By analyzing the bank accounts of certain members of the Tweed Ring, he obtained legal proof of the principle on which the spoils had been divided.Weed, Parsons and Company, Charges Against Justice George G. Barnard, and Testimony Thereunder, Before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly, 1872, page 2United States Senate Judiciary Committee, Judicial Fitness, Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery, 1966, page 78
In 1874 Tilden was the successful Democratic nominee for Governor, receiving 52 percent of the vote against incumbent Republican John Adams Dix and Prohibition Party nominee Myron H. Clark.New York Tribune, The Tribune Almanac and Political Register, 1875, page 52  As a reform-spirited Governor in 1875 and 1876, he turned his attention to a second set of plunderers, the “Canal Ring”, made up of members of both parties who had been systematically robbing New York State by overcharging of the canal works. Tilden succeeded in breaking them up, and his successful service as Governor gained him the presidential nomination.Peter R. Eisenstadt, Laura-Eve Moss, The Encyclopedia of New York State, 2005, page 256
In 1875 he received an LL.D. from Yale University.Yale University, Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University 1701-1915, 1916, page 474  At the same time Yale conferred the LL.D., he was also enrolled as a graduate of Yale's Class of 1837 and received his Bachelor of Arts degree.John Bigelow, The Life of Samuel J. Tilden, Volume 1, 1895, page 273

==Presidential election of 1876==

During the 1876 presidential election, Tilden won the popular vote over his Republican opponent, Rutherford B. Hayes, proving that the Democrats were once again competitive in the American political process following the Civil War. But the result in the Electoral College was in question because the states of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina each sent two sets of Electoral Votes to Congress.  (There was separately a conflict over one elector from Oregon, who was disqualified on a technicality.)
Republicans had taken over the state governments in the South during Reconstruction, but were unpopular with the overwhelmingly Democratic white southerners, many of whom resented what they perceived as interference from the North and blamed the Republicans for the Civil War. However Republicans were almost universally preferred by the South's newly enfranchised blacks.  By 1876 white southerners had regained control of most southern states, but in one state with a black majority (South Carolina) and two with very large black minorities (Louisiana and Florida) Republicans still held power.  Democrats used violence and intimidation to keep blacks from the polls, while Democrats claimed that Republicans weren't simply disallowing votes tainted by violence but also legitimate returns that favored the Democratic party.  Both sides claimed victory though the Democratic claim was tainted by violence and the Republican by fraud.  As a result, one set of Electoral Votes from each of these three states had cast their ballots for the Republican Hayes, and another set had cast their ballot for the Democrat Tilden. Without these three states, Tilden had won 184 Electoral Votes, but needed 185 to win the Presidency. If he had taken even one state, he would have become President. However, if Hayes were to win all the contested votes, he would receive 185 Electoral Votes and win the election.
While the Republicans boldly claimed the election, Tilden mystified and disappointed his supporters by not fighting for the prize or giving any leadership to his advocates. Instead he devoted more than a month to the preparation of a complete history of the electoral counts over the previous century to show it was the unbroken usage of Congress, not of the President of the Senate, to count the electoral votes.Bigelow v 2:60
Congressional leaders tried to resolve the crisis by creating a 15-member Electoral Commission that would determine which set of votes were valid. The Commission consisted of five members from the Republican-controlled Senate (three Republicans and two Democrats), and five from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives (three Democrats, two Republicans). The remaining five members were chosen from the Supreme Court– originally two Republicans, two Democrats, and independent Justice David Davis. Davis, however, was elected to the US Senate from Illinois, resigned from the Court and turned down the commission appointment. (Ironically, the election of Davis was the brainchild of Tilden's nephew who assumed it would secure his commission vote for the Democratic side.)Michael A. Bellesiles, 1877: America's Year of Living Violently, 2010, page 41D. Grier Stephenson, The Waite Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy, 2003, page 232 Justice Joseph P. Bradley, a Republican, was named to replace Davis. The Commission voted 8-7 along party lines to award all the votes to Hayes. The dispute, however, did not end, as some Democrats threatened to filibuster in the Senate. Eventually, enough were dissuaded from this action.  Some say this was the result of a political deal, the so-called Compromise of 1877 whereby the Democrats agreed to Hayes's election and he agreed to withdraw all federal troops in the South, bringing an end to Republican Reconstruction in the South. In fact, Hayes had long before, in his letter accepting the Republican nomination, indicated his desire that the South enjoy "the blessings of honest and capable local government"  (but only with guarantees that the states would guard the civil rights of the freedmen).Letter of Acceptance of the Nomination for the Presidency
Upon his defeat, Tilden said, "I can retire to public life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares and responsibilities of the office."

==The Cipher Dispatches==

Tilden was considered the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880.  His chances of obtaining it suffered a blow in October 1878 at the hands of the Republican New York Tribune. The Tribune claimed to have unearthed and decoded secret "cipher" telegrams sent by Tilden's agents at the height of the 1876 electoral dispute, apparently offering bribes to vote-counters in the contested states: $50,000 for Florida, $80,000 for South Carolina, and $5,000 for the single vote from Oregon.
Tilden denied all knowledge of such dispatches, and appeared voluntarily before a Congressional sub-committee in New York City to clear himself of the charge. The attempts to implicate him in corrupt transactions were not successful and he was cleared of any personal wrongdoing. However, his political opponents endeavored to make capital out of the 'Cipher Dispatches' in subsequent campaigns. The controversy somewhat damaged Tilden's reputation for honesty, and he did not run.[tpl]cite book|publisher=Carroll & Graf|title=Boss Tweed: the rise and fall of the corrupt pol who conceived the soul of ...|author=Kenneth D.

In 1884 Tilden was again considered likely to become a candidate for the Democratic nomination, but his health began to fail and he declined to run.Steven O'Brien, Paula McGuire, James M. McPherson, Gary Gerstle, editors, American Political Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present, 1991, page 396David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, David J.

==Later life==

Tilden retired in the early 1880s, living as a near-recluse at his [tpl]convert|110|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] estate, Graystone (Greystone), near Yonkers, New York. He died a bachelor at Graystone on August 4, 1886 at 8 a.m. He is buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101677|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Gov. Samuel J. Tilden Monument|date=December 2005|accessdate=2010-07-03 |author=Kristin Gibbons and William E. Krattinger|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl] In reference to the 1876 election, Tilden's gravestone bears the words, "I Still Trust in The People".
Of his fortune, estimated at $7 million (over $176 million in 2014), $4 million (over $100 million in 2014) was bequeathed for the establishment and maintenance of a free public library and reading-room in the City of New York; but, as the will was successfully contested by relatives, only about $3 million (over $75 million in 2014) was applied to its original purpose.  In 1895, the Tilden Trust was combined with the Astor and Lenox libraries to found the New York Public Library, whose building bears his name on its front.
The Samuel J. Tilden House at 15 Gramercy Park South, which he owned from 1860 until his death, is now used by the National Arts Club.
The Gov. Samuel J. Tilden Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[tpl]NRISref|2009a[/tpl]  The Graystone property is now known as Untermyer Park and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
