Azadirachta indica, also known as Neem, Nimtree, and Indian Lilac is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh growing in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem tree is the official tree of the Sindh Province and is very common in all cities of Sindh, there are projects underway for planting this tree in all over Sindh Province. Neem trees also grow in islands in the southern part of Iran. Its fruits and seeds are the source of neem oil.

==Description==

Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of [tpl]convert|15|–|20|m|ft[/tpl], rarely to [tpl]convert|35|–|40|m|ft[/tpl]. It is evergreen, but in severe drought it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of [tpl]convert|15|–|20|m|ft[/tpl] in old, free-standing specimens. The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative, the Chinaberry (Melia azedarach).
The opposite, pinnate leaves are [tpl]convert|20|-|40|cm|in[/tpl] long, with 20 to 31 medium to dark green leaflets about [tpl]convert|3|–|8|cm|in[/tpl] long. The terminal leaflet is often missing. The petioles are short.
The (white and fragrant) flowers are arranged in more-or-less drooping axillary panicles which are up to [tpl]convert|25|cm|in[/tpl] long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 150 to 250 flowers. An individual flower is [tpl]convert|5|–|6|mm|in[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|8|–|11|mm|in[/tpl] wide. Protandrous, bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.
The fruit is a smooth (glabrous) olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe is [tpl]convert|1.4|-|2.8|cm|in[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|1.0|-|1.5|cm|in[/tpl]. The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is [tpl]convert|0.3|-|0.5|cm|in[/tpl] thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two or three, elongated seeds (kernels) having a brown seed coat.

==Ecology==

The neem tree is noted for its drought resistance. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall [tpl]convert|400|-|1200|mm|in[/tpl]. It can grow in regions with an annual rainfall below 400 mm, but in such cases it depends largely on ground water levels. Neem can grow in many different types of soil, but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils. It is a typical tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures between [tpl]convert|21|-|32|C|F[/tpl]. It can tolerate high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below [tpl]convert|4|C|F[/tpl]. Neem is one of a very few shade-giving trees that thrive in drought-prone areas e.g. the dry coastal, southern districts of India and Pakistan. The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle of water, whatever the quality. In India and tropical countries where the Indian diaspora has reached, it is very common to see neem trees used for shade lining streets, around temples, schools & other such public buildings or in most people's back yards. In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of land.

===Weed status===

Neem is considered a weed in many areas, including some parts of the Middle East, and most of Sub-Saharan Africa including West Africa and Indian Ocean states.  Ecologically, it survives well in similar environments to its own, but its weed potential has not been fully assessed.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/63168/IPA-Neem-Tree-Risk-Assessment.pdf |title=Plant Risk Assessment, Neem Tree, Azadirachta indica | year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |publisher=Biosecurity Queensland[/tpl]

==Uses==

Neem leaves are dried in India, Pakistan and placed in cupboards to prevent insects eating the clothes and also while storing rice in tins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4916044.stm|title=Neem: India's tree of life|author=Anna Horsbrugh Porter|date=17 April 2006|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Neem leaves are dried and burnt in the tropical regions of Pakistan to keep away mosquitoes.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] These leaves are also used in many Indian festivals like Ugadi. See below: #Association with Hindu festivals in India. Neem is also used to give baths to the Muslim dead.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] 

===As a vegetable===

The tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India. A souplike dish called Veppampoo charu (Tamil) (translated as "neem flower rasam") made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu. In West Bengal, young neem leaves are fried in oil with tiny pieces of eggplant (brinjal). The dish is called nim begun and is the first item during a Bengali meal that acts as an appetizer.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jiva.com/ayurveda/about-ayurveda/367.html|title=Neem Baigan|publisher=Jiva Ayruveda[/tpl] It is eaten with rice.
Neem is used in parts of mainland Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia, Laos (where it is called kadao),  Thailand (where it is known as sadao or sdao), Myanmar (where it is known as tamar) and Vietnam (where it is known as sầu đâu and is used to cook the salad gỏi sầu đâu). Even lightly cooked, the flavour is quite bitter and the food is not enjoyed by all inhabitants of these nations, though it is believed to be good for one's health. Neem gum is a rich source of protein. In Myanmar, young neem leaves and flower buds are boiled with tamarind fruit to soften its bitterness and eaten as a vegetable. Pickled neem leaves are also eaten with tomato and fish paste sauce in Myanmar.

===Traditional medicinal use===

Products made from neem trees have been used in India for over two millennia for their medicinal properties. Neem products are believed by Ayurvedic practitioners to be anthelmintic, antifungal, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antiviral, contraceptive and sedative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_agraw_neem.htm|title=Medicinal properties of Neem: New Findings|author=D.P. Agrawal|date=undated[/tpl] It is considered a major component in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine and is particularly prescribed for skin diseases.S. Zillur Rahman and M. Shamim Jairajpuri. Neem in Unani Medicine. Neem Research and Development Society of Pesticide Science, India, New Delhi, February 1993, p. 208-219. Edited by N.S. Randhawa and B.S. Parmar. 2nd revised edition (chapter 21), 1996 Neem oil is also used for healthy hair, to improve liver function, detoxify the blood, and balance blood sugar levels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/herbs/neem.html |title=Neem|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=6 December 2012[/tpl] Neem leaves have also been used to treat skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, etc."bbc.co.uk"
However, insufficient research has been done to assess the purported benefits of neem.Neem, WebMD. In adults, short-term use of neem is safe, while long-term use may harm the kidneys or liver; in small children, neem oil is toxic and can lead to death. Neem may also cause miscarriages, infertility, and low blood sugar.

===Safety issues===

Neem oil can cause some forms of toxic encephalopathy and ophthalmopathy if consumed in large quantities.[tpl]cite journal|author1=M.V. Bhaskara |author2=S.J. Pramoda |author3=M.U.

===Pest and disease control===

Neem is a key ingredient in non-pesticidal management (NPM), providing a natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. Neem seeds are ground into a powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop. To be effective, it is necessary to apply repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem does not directly kill insects on the crop. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent, protecting the crop from damage. The insects starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs. Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer.Material Fact Sheets — Neem[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Other uses===

==Association with Hindu festivals in India==

Neem leaf or bark is considered an effective pitta pacifier due to its bitter taste. Hence, it is traditionally recommended during early summer in Ayurveda (that is, the month of Chaitra as per the Hindu Calendar which usually falls in the month of March – April).
In the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, Neem flowers are very popular for their use in 'Ugadi Pachhadi' (soup-like pickle), which is made on Ugadi day.
In Karnataka, a small amount of Neem and Jaggery (Bevu-Bella) is consumed on Ugadi day, the Kannada new year, indicating that one should take both bitter and sweet things in life, joy and sorrow.
During Gudi Padva, which is the New Year in the state of Maharashtra, the ancient practice of drinking a small quantity of neem juice or paste on that day, before starting festivities, is found. As in many Hindu festivals and their association with some food to avoid negative side-effects of the season or change of seasons, neem juice is associated with Gudi Padva to remind people to use it during that particular month or season to pacify summer pitta.
In Tamilnadu during the summer months of April to June, the Mariamman temple festival is a thousand year old tradition. The Neem leaves and flowers are the most important part of the Mariamman festival. The goddess Mariamman statue will be garlanded with Neem leaves and flowers. During most occasions of celebrations and weddings the people of Tamilnadu adorn their surroundings with the Neem leaves and flowers as a form of decoration and also to ward off evil spirits and infections.
In the eastern coastal state of Odisha the famous Jagannath temple deities are made up of Neem heart wood along with some other essential oils and powders.

==Chemical compounds==

Salimuzzaman Siddiqui was the first scientist to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the Neem tree to the attention of natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively.Ganguli (2002). p. 1304[tpl]full|date=November 2013[/tpl] The process involved extracting the water insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205 °C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192 °C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100 °C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil.Siddiqui (1942). pp. 278–279[tpl]full|date=November 2013[/tpl] These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.Sidhu et al. (2004), pp. 69-75.[tpl]full|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Patent controversy==

In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from neem to the US Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace and Company. The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had actually been in use in India for over 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=India wins landmark patent battle | date=9 March 2005 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/4333627.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2 October 2009 | language = [/tpl]
