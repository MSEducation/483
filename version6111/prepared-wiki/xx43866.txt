The Daily Telegraph is a conservative, Australian tabloid newspaper published in Sydney, New South Wales, by Nationwide News, part of News Corp. The Tele, as it is also known, was founded in 1879. From 1936 to 1972, it was owned by Frank Packer's Australian Consolidated Press. That year it was sold to News Limited (now News Corp Australia). In 1990, it merged with its afternoon sister paper The Daily Mirror to form The Daily Telegraph-Mirror with morning and afternoon editions although the afternoon editions were later discontinued.
The new paper continued in this vein until January 1996 when reader pressure for a shorter title caused the name of the paper to revert to The Daily Telegraph, despite staff concerns that former Mirror readers would now feel disenfranchised. The circulation of the newspaper during the June quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/08/16/newspaper-circulation-results-shocker-the-contagion-edition/?wpmp_switcher=desktop |title=Newspaper circulation results shocker: the contagion edition |last1=Knott |first1=Matthew |date=16 August 2013 |website=Crikey |publisher=Private Media |accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl] the largest of a Sydney newspaper.

==Politics==

The Telegraph's most high-profile columnists, among them Piers Akerman, are politically conservative.
A Roy Morgan media credibility survey found that 40 per cent of journalists viewed News Limited newspapers as Australia's most partisan media outlet, ahead of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 25 per cent. The survey found that readers took a generally dim view of journalists. In response to the question "Which newspapers do you believe do not accurately and fairly report the news?", the Daily Telegraph came third (9%) behind the Herald Sun (11%) and "All of them" (16%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20040903.pdf |title=10,13_tr66_media |format=PDF [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Controversy==

===John Brogden allegations===

The Telegraph was widely criticised for its coverage of former New South Wales Liberal leader John Brogden. After Brogden resigned in 2005, the newspaper ran a front-page headline, "Brogden's Sordid Past: Disgraced Liberal leader damned by secret shame file," detailing past allegations of misconduct by Brogden. The following day, Brogden attempted suicide at his electoral office.
Rodney Tiffen, an academic at the University of Sydney, described the newspaper's coverage as an example of "hyena journalism", judging Brogden's personal life to be off limits following his withdrawal from public life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=189 |title=The Daily Telegraph, John Brogden and hyena journalism |publisher=Onlineopinion.com.au [/tpl]
Editor David Penberthy claimed that his source was from inside the Liberal Party and that none of the events would have happened if no one leaked from inside the party.Editor rejects attack over Brogden coverage. 31/08/2005. ABC News Online[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Mount Druitt High School===

On 8 January 1997, the Telegraph published the headline, "The class we failed" concerning was the Year 12 class at Mount Druitt High School in outer Western Sydney in which no student scored a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) above 50 (the maximum possible mark is 100). Although the article made clear that the newspaper believed that the state had failed the students, many accused the Telegraph of branding the students themselves as failures and showing a full year photo identifying students.
The story led to a renewed focus on the quality of public schools in Western Sydney and precipitated several reviews of schooling in the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pub-ed-inquiry.org/reports/final_reports/03/Ch4_22.html |title=New South Wales Public Education Inquiry: Final Reports: Second Report: 22: Chapter 4: Impact of the Restructuring of Public Education in NSW since 1988 |publisher=Pub-ed-inquiry.org [/tpl] But for many, the headline highlighted problems with interpreting Higher School Certificate results and the accompanying TER.Policy Spring (Sept–Nov) 1998[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The students successfully sued the newspaper in the Supreme Court for defamation. The Telegraph subsequently apologised and settled for damages out of court.NSW Teachers Federation: Education Online: November 2000: Telegraph apologises to Mt Druitt students[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] The published apology stated:

===Call centres in India===

In October 2006, The Telegraph claimed in a front page article that ANZ were using call centres in Bangalore, India. The paper even sent a journalist to Bangalore, Luke McIlveen, and a photographer to verify this claim.Media Watch: Front Page — Bad Line For Bangalore (16 October 2006) ANZ strongly denied the claim, stating that they do not employ overseas call centre staff in India.http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/ep36anz2.pdf Subsequently, ANZ pulled all of its advertising from News Limited, including Foxtel and News websites.

===Press Council complaint regarding Greens article===

In May 2011, The Telegraph published an article making an assertion about the Australian Greens which subsequently prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council. The article asserted that the Greens had managed to "force" the Government to divert money from flood relief, to fund various Green programs. The Press Council upheld the complaint and published the following statement (extract only): [tpl]cquote|The assertion was inaccurate and remains uncorrected. The complaint is therefore upheld.[tpl]cite web | title = Adjudication No. 1506: The Australian Greens/The Daily Telegraph (September 2011) | publisher = Australian Press Council | date = 23 Sep 2011 | url = http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-no-1506-the-greens-daily-telegraph-sept-2011/?LocatorFormID=677&FromSearch=1[/tpl][/tpl]

===Press Council complaint regarding series of misleading NBN articles===

In June and July 2011, The Telegraph published a series of articles about the National Broadband Network. These articles triggered a complaint to the Australian Press Council, alleging that they were factually incorrect, unbalanced and misleading. In December 2011, the Press Council upheld the complaints on all three articles, forcing The Telegraph to publish the adjudication.[tpl]cite web | last = Winterford | first = Brett | title = Press Council finds News Limited misled over NBN | publisher = IT News Australia | date = 23 December 2011 | url = http://www.itnews.com.au/News/285272,press-council-finds-news-limited-misled-over-nbn.aspx | accessdate = 29 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Nayantara | first = Mallya | title = Daily Telegraph repeatedly wrong in NBN reports | publisher = Delimiter | date = 24 December 2011 | url = http://delimiter.com.au/2011/12/24/daily-telegraph-repeatedly-wrong-in-nbn-reports/ | accessdate = 29 December 2011[/tpl] The Council also published the following statement in regards to the issue:
[tpl]cquote|The Council expressed concern that within a short period of time three articles on the same theme contained inaccurate or misleading assertions. It considers that this sequence of errors should not have occurred and that they should have been corrected promptly and adequately when brought to the newspaper's attention.[tpl]cite web | title = Adjudiciation No. 1515: Jamie Benaud/The Daily Telegraph (December 2011) | publisher = Australian Press Council | date = 22 December 2011 | url = http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj1515-benaud-daily-telegraph-dec-2011/?LocatorGroupID=662&LocatorFormID=677&FromSearch=1 | accessdate = 29 December 2011[/tpl][/tpl]

===Press Council complaint regarding Mark Latham article (Sunday Telegraph)===

In December 2011, The Sunday Telegraph published two articles regarding former Labor leader Mark Latham and an alleged argument he had with his child's swimming teacher. Mr Latham complained to the Australian Press Council that there was a conflict of interest which should have been disclosed as the reporter was the daughter of one of the swim teachers at the school. Mr Latham also complained that the articles breached the privacy of his family, especially his young children, and were not in the public interest. The Press Council upheld the complaint and published the following statement (extract only): [tpl]cquote|The Council emphasises that in accordance with generally recognised principles a conflict of interest exists where there is a reasonable possibility that the conflict will affect a reporter's impartiality, irrespective of whether it actually does so. Accordingly, this aspect of the complaint is upheld.[/tpl]
The Council also found that there had been an "unreasonable intrusion on the children's privacy" and upheld that aspect of the complaint.[tpl]cite web | title = Adjudication No. 1531: Mark Latham/The Sunday Telegraph (May 2012) | publisher = Australian Press Council | date = 21 May 2012 | url = http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1531-latham-sunday-telegraph-may-2012/?LocatorGroupID=662&LocatorFormID=677&FromSearch=1 | accessdate = 29 December 2011[/tpl]

===Press Council complaint regarding asylum seeker article===

In November 2011, The Telegraph published an article regarding asylum seekers with the front-page heading 'OPEN THE FLOODGATES – Exclusive: Thousands of boat people to invade NSW'. Another headline stated 'Detainee Deluge for Sydney'. This prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council, which was upheld. The Press Council published the following statement (extract only): [tpl]cquote|The Press Council has concluded that use of the word "invade" was gravely inaccurate, unfair and offensive because of its clear connotations of forceful occupation. Accordingly, the complaint is upheld on this ground for what the Council regards as an especially serious breach of its principles. The Council has concluded that use of the words "open the floodgates" and "deluge" were inaccurate and unfair. Even the intake levels claimed in the article could not reasonably be described as having such an extreme impact on suburban Sydney, and nothing quoted from the briefing note asserted government fears of inability to cope.[tpl]cite web | title = Adjudication No. 1536: Anna Krjatian/The Daily Telegraph (May 2012) |publisher=Australian Press Council | date = 5 June 2012 | url = http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1536/?LocatorGroupID=662&LocatorFormID=677&FromSearch=1[/tpl][/tpl]

===Press Council complaint regarding series of Clover Moore articles===

Throughout 2011, The Telegraph published 17 articles regarding Sydney Lord Mayor and MP Clover Moore. The articles prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council. The complainant argued that the articles provided unbalanced coverage and that many of the headlines and phrases were opinion rather than fact. The Press Council upheld the complaint in part and published the following statement (extract only): [tpl]cquote|The Council has concluded that the headlines mentioned above breached Council's principles because they expressed the newspaper's opinions rather than being a summary of facts reported in the accompanying news story. The inclusion in a news story of words such as "crazy council policies", "junket" and "diva-like list of demands" which were not attributed to any sources also failed to separate fact from opinion. Accordingly, the complaint is upheld on these grounds.[tpl]cite web | title = Adjudication No. 1537: Stephen Pate/The Daily Telegraph (June 2012) | publisher = Australian Press Council| date = 6 June 2012 | url = http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1537/?LocatorGroupID=662&LocatorFormID=677&FromSearch=1[/tpl][/tpl]
