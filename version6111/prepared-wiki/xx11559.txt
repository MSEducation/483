Compare with the US and UK pronunciations of the flower called viola. is a bowed string instrument. It is slightly larger than a violin in size and has a deeper sound. Since the 18th century it has been the middle voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above it) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below it).Until the end of the 17th century there was the tenor violin, tuned a perfect fourth below the viola.
Music that is written for the viola differs from that of most other instruments, in that it primarily uses the alto clef, which is otherwise rarely used. Viola music employs the treble clef when there are substantial sections of music written in a higher register.
The viola occasionally has a major role in orchestral music. In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis. Englishmen Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote chamber and concert works for Tertis. William Walton, Bohuslav Martinů and Béla Bartók wrote well-known viola concertos. Paul Hindemith wrote a substantial amount of music for viola. In the latter part of the 20th century a substantial repertoire was produced for the viola.
The "MacDonald" Stradivarius viola, one of only 10 surviving violas made by Antonio Stradivari, and which was once played by Peter Schidlof, will have an initial asking price of $45 million when it is put up for sale at Sotheby's in spring 2014. This is the most expensive price tag for any instrument sold at auction, eclipsing the sale of the Lady Blunt Stradivarius violin in 2011.For Sale, Playing a Heady Tune.

The viola is similar in material and construction to the violin. A full-size viola's body is between [tpl]convert|25|mm[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|100|mm[/tpl] longer than the body of a full-size violin (i.e., between [tpl]convert|38|and|46|cm|in[/tpl]), with an average length of [tpl]convert|41|cm|in[/tpl]. Small violas for children typically start at [tpl]convert|30|cm|in[/tpl], which is equivalent to a half-size violin. For a child who needs a smaller size, a fractional-sized violin is often strung with the strings of a viola.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Violin and Viola | work = | publisher = Oakville Suzuki Association | year = 2009 | url = https://oakvillesuzuki.org/osa/content/violin-viola |accessdate = 2013-07-13[/tpl] Unlike the violin, the viola does not have a standard full size. The body of a viola would need to measure about [tpl]convert|51|cm|in[/tpl] long to match the acoustics of a violin, making it impractical to play in the same manner as the violin.[ref]
