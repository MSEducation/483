[[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science, Mineralogy, Hardness tests

The Mohs scale of mineral hardness characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. It was created in 1812 by the German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science.Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009.

The method of comparing hardness by seeing which minerals can scratch others, however, is of great antiquity, having been mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise On Stones, c. 300 BC, followed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, c. 77 AD.Theophrastus on Stones.

The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on the ability of one natural sample of matter to scratch another mineral. The samples of matter used by Mohs are all different minerals. Minerals are pure substances found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals.Learn science, Intermediate p. 42 As the hardest known naturally occurring substance when the scale was designed, diamonds are at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, and/or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale would fall between 4 and 5.American Federation of Mineralogical Societies.

The Mohs scale is a purely ordinal scale. For example, corundum (9) is twice as hard as topaz (8), but diamond (10) is four times as hard as corundum.

On the Mohs scale, graphite (a principal constituent of pencil "lead") has a hardness of 1.5; a fingernail, 2.2–2.5; a copper penny, 3.2–3.5; a pocketknife 5.1; a knife blade, 5.5[tpl]clarify|date=April 2012[/tpl]; window glass plate, 5.5; and a steel nail, 5.5.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gemcutters.org/LDA/hardness.htm|year= 1998 |accessdate=2007-08-19|title= The Hardness of Minerals and Rocks|author= William S.

Using these ordinary materials of known hardness can be a simple way to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.
