The Labour Representation League, organised in 1869, was a forerunner of the British Labour Party.  Its original purpose was to register the working class to vote, and get workers into Parliament.  It had limited power and was never intended to become a full political party, but played a role in supporting the election of Lib-Lab MPs.  The first secretary was Cooperative Society activist and trade unionist, Lloyd Jones.

In 1874, they won two parliamentary seats.
In 1886 the TUC created the Labour Electoral Association to replace the League, which in turn lead to the creation of the Labour Party.
