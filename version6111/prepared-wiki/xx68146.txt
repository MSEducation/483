NOAA Weather Radio (NWR; also known as NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards) is a network of radio stations in the United States that broadcast continuous weather information directly from a nearby Weather Forecast Office of the service's operator, National Weather Service (NWS), an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the United States Department of Commerce. NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts National Weather Service warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information 24 hours a day. It also broadcasts alerts of non-weather emergencies such as national security, natural, environmental and public safety (see: AMBER Alert) through the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System.

==Operations==

Known as "The Voice of NOAA's National Weather Service", NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) is provided as a public service by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As of 2014, NWR has about 1032 transmittersNOAA Weather Radio - Station listings serving 95% of the United States' population, covering all 50 U.S. states, adjacent coastal waters, and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and Saipan. NOAA Weather Radio requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of receiving the signal.
The radio service continuously transmits weather and marine forecasts (where applicable) and other related information. In addition, NWR works in cooperation with the FCC's Emergency Alert System (EAS), providing comprehensive severe weather alerts and civil emergency information. In conjunction with federal, state and local emergency managers and other public officials, NWR can broadcast alerts and post-event information for all types of hazards, including natural (such as earthquakes or avalanches), man-made (such as chemical releases or oil spills), technological (such as nuclear power plant emergencies) and public safety (such as "AMBER alerts" or 911 telephone outages).
Many television stations which have the capability (both commercial and public) may simulcast a local NWR station's audio content on their second audio program channel if they are not carrying a program which features either a Spanish language translation or a Descriptive Video Service track for the visually impaired. Some digital subchannels which carry weather information may also have a NWR audio feed airing in the background, while regular television stations carry the audio during times they are off-the-air and transmitting a test pattern, in lieu of a reference tone. Many cable TV systems and some commercial television and radio stations will, during EAS activation, rebroadcast the audio of a warning message first heard on their local NWR station, to alert viewers of a severe weather event or civil emergency, usually with the issuance of a tornado warning or tornado emergency, especially in tornado-prone areas of the country.
Listening to NWR requires a radio capable of receiving at least one of seven specific channels within the frequency range 162.4 MHz through 162.55 MHz, collectively known as "weather band". For example, a receiver that only tunes in standard FM or AM broadcast stations will not suffice. The seven FM channels, reserved by the U.S. Government for NWR broadcasts, are located within the larger "public service band", a VHF frequency band generally used by licensed government and public agencies and authorities for non-commercial, official two-way radio communications. The original frequency was 162.550 MHz, with 162.400 MHz added in 1970, and 162.475 MHz introduced in 1975 (the use of 162.475 for several years was limited only to special cases where required to avoid channel interference, and transmitter power output was restricted to 300 watts). Station KBA99 in Honolulu used a frequency of 169.075 MHz for twelve years until being changed to 162.550 in 1975. 
It should be noted that from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, many (if not most) basic weather band receivers manufactured and sold during that time period were configured to only receive the three "main" weather channels. However, for many of those years, four additional "intermediate" channels (162.425, 162.450, 162.500 and 162.525 MHz) existed to accommodate anticipated expansion but went mostly unused."NOAA Weather Radio" pamphlet: NOAA/PA 76015, rev. April 1985.. Over the years, a proliferation of stations meant to ensure near-complete geographical coverage and "weather-readiness" has pushed that number solidly from three to seven. According to NOAA, as of April 1985, the NWS operated "about 392 stations" with "approximately 90 percent of the nation's population...within listening range""Ibid".; as of April 2014, the figure was "1032 stations" with a goal to "increase coverage to at least 95 percent"."NOAA Weather Radio" brochure: NOAA/PA 94062, rev. April 2014.
All NWR channels are available on stand-alone "weather radio" receivers that are currently sold online and in retail stores (available for prices ranging from US$20 and up), as well as on most marine VHF radio transceivers, amateur radios, and digital scanners. In addition, more mainstream consumer electronics, such as clock radios, portable multi-band receivers and two-way radios (examples: FRS, GMRS and CB radio), are now featuring the ability to also receive NWR channels. Many of the devices mentioned also feature alerting capability.  With the American digital television transition making most existing portable televisions obsolete and unusable and the current infant and development stage of mobile digital television, along with the need to provide a public service to their viewers and encourage the use of the system, many American television station weather operations cooperate with radio manufacturers and local retail outlets to offer weather radios at discounted pricing to viewers (especially in highly tornado-prone areas), where the service is often marketed as an essential warning device on par with a smoke detector for home fires.
There are two different channel numbering systems used by various weather radio manufacturers. The first is the chronological sequence that the radio frequencies were allocated to the service: 1=162.550, 2=162.400, 3=162.475, 4=162.425, 5=162.450, 6=162.500, 7=162.525. The second is in simple increasing radio frequency sequence: 1=162.400, 2=162.425, 3=162.450, 4=162.475, 5=162.500, 6=162.525, 7=162.550. In addition, it may be possible to receive weather broadcasts on more than one of the seven channels at a given location. The NWS suggests that users determine which frequency (as opposed to channel) is intended for their specific location so that they are assured of receiving correct information.
NOAA also provides secondary weather information, usually limited to marine storm warnings for sea vessels navigating the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to shortwave radio / HF "time stations" WWV and WWVH, which continuously broadcast time signals and disseminate the "official" U.S. Government time, and are operated by Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

==Alerting==

Whenever a weather alert is issued for any part of a NWR station's coverage area, certain weather radios are designed to sound an alarm (and/or turn on) upon detection of a 1050 Hz tone, issued for ten seconds immediately before the alert message. The specification calls for the NWS transmitter to send the 1050 Hz tone for 10 seconds, and the receiver to react to it within five seconds (any extra tone time over and above the reaction time is considered as part of the alerting mechanism). This system simply triggers the alarm (and/or turns on the radio) of every muted receiver within the radio horizon of the transmitter (in other words, any receiver within the transmitter's "footprint"). Additional external devices such as a strobe light which attaches via an accessory port are also available to provide a more immediate and visible warning.
Newer radios can instead detect a digital-over-audio protocol called Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), which allows the users to program their radios for specific geographical areas of interest and concern, rather than for an entire regional broadcast area. The newer radios also have lit LEDs which indicate whether the message sent out is a warning, watch or advisory/statement in the color order of red for a warning, amber for a watch, and either yellow or green for an advisory or statement, mainly both to give quick visual reference for those who may not have time to hear the whole alert, and to give those who are hearing impaired some way to be alerted to the oncoming event. The SAME code data burst is broadcast first, followed by the 1050 Hz tone. This has the advantage of eliminating the numerous "false alarms" for the 1050 Hz weather alerts that may apply to an area 100 or [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] distant. Broadcast areas are generally divided into SAME locations by county (or marine zone, where applicable) using the standard U.S. Government FIPS county codes. Most modern SAME-equipped radios can be programmed to receive alerts for more than one FIPS code - a useful feature for listeners located along or near county lines.
Once the SAME receivers are programmed they will limit alarms to only certain alert types, and only to the actual section of the broadcast area which the listener is located prior to the broadcast of the 1050 Hz tone. Some receivers allow users to program in several codes in order to include the areas surrounding a person's location. For example, if an area has frequent storm warnings, and the storms usually come from the west, a receiver can be programmed with the code for its own area, plus the code for the area to the west (this notification system was later adopted by the Emergency Alert System – the replacement for the earlier Emergency Broadcast System and even earlier CONELRAD now required by the FCC for broadcast stations).
In September 2008, Walgreens announced that it would utilize the SAME/NOAA system to deliver local weather alerts via its system of LED billboards located outside of the drugstore chain's locations built or remodeled since 2000 to provide an additional avenue of weather information.http://news.walgreens.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5055 Many national billboard companies (such as CBS Outdoor, Clear Channel Outdoor and Lamar, among others) also use their color LED billboard networks to display weather warnings to drivers, while state-owned freeway notification boards, which utilize the EAS/NOAA infrastructure for AMBER Alert warnings, also display weather warnings.

===Routine forecast products===

The NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards network has a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of weather. Actual products vary by the area that the transmitter serves. The main public forecast products typically played during the day's program cycle are:

====Hourly observations====

A typical hourly observation report, which is updated twice hourly at the top of the hour and at 11 minutes past the hour, heard over NOAA Weather Radio stations features the following:
If the main reporting station's observations are unavailable, conditions for the nearest reporting station to that area are typically played first instead, in which case that weather station's observations will not be repeated at the end of the observation product. In some locales, in the event the main reporting weather station or a weather station located 50–75 miles of the Weather Forecast Office and main reporting station (or depending on the programming, any other weather station with conditions broadcast) had missing data, or no data available, the following message would thus be played (example from KWO37 Los Angeles):
"The report from Downtown Los Angeles was not available".
A roundup of sky conditions for some cities may occur if temperatures in all reporting stations were within five degrees of each other. An example: "skies ranged from sunny to mostly sunny, and temperatures were between 57 and 62 degrees". Sky conditions and/or temperatures for individual weather reporting stations may only be mentioned if weather conditions differ between multiple locations.
In some areas, a major city would always provide weather conditions; if unavailable, the message "the weather conditions were not available" would precede the city.
(Note: Occasionally, the previous hour's observations may last as long as 15 minutes into the next hour, which in most cases when this occurs, the product may not be played at all after 15 minutes and will not play until the information is updated.)

====Hazardous Weather Outlook====

A Hazardous Weather Outlook is issued daily (usually twice each day at around 7 a.m. and noon local time) addressing potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur in the Weather Forecast Office's area of responsibility over the next seven days. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, or other conditions that may be a hazard to travel, life and/or property. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, along with a call for action for trained weather spotters to be prepared to report their local weather conditions and/or damage reports back to the local NWS office. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Severe Weather Outlook. Occasionally, the NWS WFO may update the Hazardous Weather Outlook while an event is ongoing or if forecast models denote changes from previous forecasts.
Depending on the Weather Forecast Office, the Hazardous Weather Outlook may either roundup all weather hazards for the seven-day period or in areas prone to severe weather, are prefaced by a thunderstorm outlook followed by a roundup of any other hazardous weather separated by the current day and days two through seven in the forecast period.

====Zone Forecast Product (ZFP)====

A Zone Forecast Product is a text product issued by all WFOs to explicitly state expected weather conditions within each zone in their area of forecast responsibility through day seven. The product describes the expected sky condition (along with the chance of precipitation and precipitation type if liquid and/or frozen precipitation is forecast), the temperature range for the county zone (typically written out as for example: "Lows in the lower 50s", though sometimes if temperatures in the county zone are forecast to be around a specific temperature it may be written as "Low around 55") and the forecast winds; the wind forecast only appears within the first 72 hours of the seven-day period in the product.
For many federal holidays such as Memorial Day and Independence Day, those days are denoted and read within the forecast itself instead of the day of the week. If forecasted high and/or low temperatures are predicted to be within less than a 10 degree range and/or weather conditions are forecast to have little change over some or all of the final five days of the forecast period, the conditions may be rounded up, for example: "Tuesday through Friday: Partly cloudy, lows in the lower 70s and highs in the upper 90s".

====Regional Weather Synopsis====

Also known as the Regional Weather Summary (the terminology varies depending on the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office), this product gives a brief recap of weather events from yesterday or today within the region, followed by a glimpse on what is expected to occur from the current time to the next few days. This product is shown and updated twice daily: first in the late morning hours and again in the late evening hours.

=====Sample RWS=====

The following example of a Regional Weather Synopsis was issued by the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth/Dallas, Texas on April 2, 2010:

TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. THE WEEKEND
WILL BE PLEASANT AND WARM WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES
NEAR 80.

====Daily Climate Summary====

This is a general information product comprising three separate products:

===Specialty Forecast Products===

The following are forecast products that are not available in all NOAA Weather Radio stations or are only played as conditions warrant (in most WFO programming forecast products of any kind, with the exception of short term forecasts, will be preempted during the occurrence of severe weather):

====Short Term Forecast (NOW)====

A Short Term Forecast (sometimes referred to by some stations as a "Regional Weather Discussion" or the "NOW-Cast" depending on the region, and as a "Local Update" when used by The Weather Channel during their local forecasts on cable systems using the WeatherStar 4000 system in the mid to late 1990s), is a localized, event-driven product used to provide the public with detailed weather information during significant and/or rapidly-changing hydrometeorological conditions during the next six hours. This product when broadcast will often mention the position of precipitation as detected by NEXRAD radar. In most areas, this is the only forecast product that is permitted to air both during active severe weather warnings affecting the listening area and during routine forecast program cycles.

====Special Weather Statement (SPS)====

A Special Weather Statement is a regional event-driven product is used to provide the public with details of the upcoming significant weather event, such as a major winter storm, a heat wave, or potential flooding.
The following example of a Special Weather Statement was issued by the National Weather Service office in San Angelo, Texas on September 6, 2010:

TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

====Tabular State Forecast Product (SFT)====

A Tabular State Forecast Product is is a general seven-day public forecast of hydrometeorological conditions for the entire WFO area of responsibility. This forecast is not part of the regular program cycle, and will only be played on all stations within the WFOs area of responsibility in the event the Console Replacement System (CRS) is not operational due to technical difficulties or system maintenance.

====Record Information Announcement (RER)====

A Record Information Announcement is is a product which announces information on tied or newly set records for coldest/warmest maximum and/or minimum temperature and maximum precipitation. This forecast product is routinely updated when such events occur.

====Surf Zone Forecast (SRF)====

A Surf Zone Forecast is is a text forecast for local beaches issued by coastal WFOs, including coastal hazard information such as that pertaining to rip currents. These products are issued year-round at the Los Angeles/Oxnard, San Diego and New York City offices, and seasonally at most other coastal offices.

====River Forecast====

Daily river forecasts are issued by the 13 River Forecast Centers (RFC) using hydrologic models based on rainfall, soil characteristics, precipitation forecasts, and several other variables. Some RFCs, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts.

====Lake Forecast====

Lake Forecasts are text products issued by most WFOs in the Great Lakes region to explicitly state expected weather conditions within their marine forecast area of responsibility through day five. Also addresses expect wave heights and small-craft advisories.

====Coastal Waters Forecast (CWF)====

A Coastal Waters Forecast is a text product issued by all coastal WFOs to explicitly state expected weather conditions within their marine forecast area of responsibility through day five. This product also addresses expected wave heights.

====Offshore Waters Forecast (OFF)====

An Offshore Waters Forecast is is a text product that provides forecast and warning information to mariners who travel on the oceanic waters adjacent to the U.S. coastal waters through day five. This product is issued by the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC).

====Tropical Weather Summary====

Tropical Weather Summaries are an event-driven product that summarizes the latest information on one or multiple active tropical cyclones and is updated every three hours. Weather radio stations that are in states located near the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic Ocean would be given the information of activity in the Atlantic Basin, while stations along the West Coast would be given the information of activity in the Pacific Ocean. Depending on the station and associated Weather Forecast Office, listeners can hear this product at the top and bottom of every hour.

===Emergency Alert Test Procedure===

NOAA Weather Radio performs weekly tests of the Emergency Alert System on a predetermined day and time. The National Weather Service conducts a weekly warning/watch tone alert test every Wednesday between 10:00 a.m. and noon (some NWS offices conduct a second test in the evening hours, usually at 7:00 p.m.; the Birmingham, Alabama Weather Forecast Office conducts a second test each Saturday morning between 10:00 a.m. and noon). If there is a threat of severe weather that day in the NOAA Weather Radio listening area, the test will be postponed until the next available scheduled test day (barring that severe weather is not forecast to occur then). The weekly test will replace regular NOAA Weather Radio programming. During the test, a SAME header is sent, followed by a 1050 Hz tone, the test message and a SAME end of message (EOM) burst. The text of the test message used by most NWS offices, with variations depending on the office, is as follows:
"This is the National Weather Service office in (city). The preceding signal was a test of the warning alarm system of National Weather Service radio station (call sign of station) in (location). During potential or actual dangerous weather situations, specially built receivers are automatically activated by this signal to warn of the impending hazard. Tests of this signal and receivers' performance are usually conducted by this Weather Service office on Wednesdays at (times). When there is a threat of severe weather, or existing severe weather is in the area on Wednesday, the test will be postponed until the next available good-weather day. (Alt. the test will be cancelled, and a short message stating the reason for the cancellation will be broadcast.) Reception of this broadcast, and especially the warning alarm signal, will vary at any given location. The variability, normally more noticeable at greater distances from the transmitter, will occur even though you are using a good quality receiver in perfect working order. To provide the most consistent warning service possible, the warning alarm will be activated only for selected watches and warnings affecting the following counties: (list of counties. N.B. When more than one state is involved, the name of the state comes before the list of counties; for example, on KID-77 in Kansas City, it runs: "in Missouri: Cass, Clay, Jackson, Johnson, Lafayette, Platte, and Ray; and in Kansas: Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, Wyandotte, and Douglas.") This concludes the test of the warning alarm system of NOAA Weather Radio (call sign). We now return to normal programming."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/nwr/nwrtest.htm|work=National Weather Service|title=NOAA Weather Radio Test Schedule[/tpl]

==Voices==

Before 1997, the bulk of NWR programming was conducted by a meteorologist recording each message and setting up a looping broadcast cycle. As the NWS added more transmitters to provide better radio coverage, WFO staff had difficulty keeping broadcast cycles updated in a timely fashion, especially during major severe weather outbreaks. The NWS then installed a Console Replacement System (CRS) in every forecast office, which introduced a synthesized voice to read text announcements. Because of the large number of geographic terms routinely used in NWR broadcasts, concatenative synthesis was not suitable. Instead, an unlimited-vocabulary phonetic synthesizer was employed. This male voice was named "NOAA's Perfect Paul" or simply "Paul", although it quickly acquired several nicknames for its mechanically awkward pronunciation and intonation, including "Imperfect Paul", "Igor", "Sven", "Arnold" and Mr. Roboto. Other National Weather Service offices, including Seattle, Oxnard, Fort Worth, and Las Vegas, used a low-tone version of Paul, known as "Harry".
In 2002, the National Weather Service contracted with Siemens Information and Communication and SpeechWorks to introduce improved, more natural voices.http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa081501a.htm?terms=weather The Voice Improvement Plan (VIP) was implemented, involving a separate computer processor linked into CRS that fed digitized sound files to the broadcast suite.A page on the NWS Web site titled Voices Used on NOAA Weather Radio documents the VIP. The improvements involved one male voice ("Craig"), and one female voice ("Donna"). Additional upgrades in 2003 produced a greatly improved male voice nicknamed "Tom", which can change intonation based on the urgency of a product; "Donna" was altered as well. Due to the superior quality of the "Tom" voice, most NWS offices use it for the majority of broadcast products. Occasionally, "Donna" can be heard voicing a few products, and the original "Paul" or "Harry" voice usually announces the current local time, some river warnings and in some WFOs, the station identification as required by the FCC (example: "Station KEC55, serving the Dallas/Fort Worth listening area"). Full statements will occasionally be heard in the "Paul" voice if the VIP processor gets overloaded with products or a failure occurs.
A few WFOs have staged contests whereby their listeners can choose a name for their synthesized voices. The WFO in Wichita, Kansas, for example, gave the "Paul" voice the name "Chance Storm"; when the VIP voices came along, they chose the "Donna" voice to broadcast routine products and gave her the name "Misty Dawn." Incidentally, they have never had such a contest for "Craig" or "Tom", whom they use for urgent products.
Human voices are still heard on occasion, but sparingly, mainly during station identifications, public forecasts, National Marine Fisheries Service messages, public information statements, public service announcements, required weekly tests, and severe weather events. The capability exists for a meteorologist to broadcast live on any transmitter if computer problems occur or added emphasis is desired, or to notify listeners who are concerned about a silent station on another frequency whether that station is dark due to technical errors, prolonged power outage, or a weather event has forced it off the air.
Three forecast offices broadcast weather entirely in Spanish on a separate station from English broadcasts: San Diego (WNG712 in Coachella/Riverside), El Paso, Texas (WNG652), and Miami (WZ2531 in Hialeah, since 2012) use a male Spanish synthesized voice, "Javier", for all broadcasts. The Albuquerque Weather Forecast Office uses "Javier" for repeating weather alerts in Spanish after first being disseminated in English. WXJ69 in San Juan, Puerto Rico broadcasts all information, including forecasts, in the same manner.
