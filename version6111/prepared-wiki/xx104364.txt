Two Yanks in England is an album by The Everly Brothers, released in 1966.
The backing band on most of the recordings is actually The Hollies and eight of the twelve songs featured are credited to L. Ransford, The Hollies' Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks, and Graham Nash songwriting pseudonym. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones are also purported to play on the record as session musicians. Also, in a recent interview with Graham Nash on David Dye's "World Cafe", Reggie Dwight (aka Elton John) played on the album. Two singles were released from the album; "Somebody Help Me" b/w "Hard Hard Year" in late 1966 and "Fifi the Flea" b/w "Like Every Time Before" in early 1967. Both singles failed to chart.
