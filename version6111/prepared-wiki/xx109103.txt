Taeniidae [tpl]IPAc-en|t|ɨ|ˈ|n|aɪ|.|ɨ|d|iː[/tpl] is a family of flatworms.  It is the largest family representing the order Cyclophyllidea. It includes many tapeworms of medical and veterinary importance, as Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Echinococcus granulosus. The family Taeniidae are parasites of mammals and include many which are infectious to humans.  
Taeniidae parasites are distinguished by their terrestrial life cycles, which include a dormant stage called a metacestode. These develop in the intermediate host's tissue when eggs are consumed.  The eggs hatch into a oncosphere, which pass through the intestinal walls and form the metacestode.  An example is either cysticercoid, cysticercus, or a hydatid cyst.  The definitive host is infected when the metacestode is consumed.
