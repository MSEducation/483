Péres was involved in a popular movement to nationalize the oil industry in Brazil in the 1950s. 
He opposed the reconstruction of the BR-319 highway through Brazil's rain forest. He called for the replacement of the "wholly artificial" Manaus industrial park (which exists in part because of tax incentives) with production of goods from local raw materials.[ref]
