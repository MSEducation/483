[[Holm, Inverness]]

CATEGORIES: Areas of Inverness

Holm is a small residential area in the south of the city of Inverness, Scotland. The area lies East of the River Ness. 
The most prominent structure in the vicinity is the Holm Mills. The mill is known for its contribution to the Caledonian Canal, by weaving a cloth to prevent the embankments from leaking. Until recently, tartan was still being woven in the original building. The premises are now a shop and visitor centre.http://www.lochnessview.com/html/facts/1005.html
A building occupied by Dick Precast Concrete is situated slightly South of Holm Mills.  Additionally a large electrical substation is sited on Dores Road and this facility serves most of Inverness.

==Local Services, Public Transport and Upcoming Developments==

On Dores Road there is a small convenience shop which includes Royal Mail Post Office facilities.  
As is the case in the rest of the City, a bus service is provided by Stagecoach.  Buses to & from the City centre run approximately every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday and hourly on Sundays.  Dores Road at Holm will soon be the site of the City's 4th Tesco store along with associated facilities.  Building work began on Monday the 7th of March 2011.  The company forecasts a construction period of 4 months, with the new superstore opening in July.  As well as the main shop the site will include a filling station & car wash, GP surgery, community centre, 4 smaller retail units and a public square.  There will be over 250 car parking spaces and the development is to be landscaped to include trees and green spaces, with a view to maintaining the current appearance of the area.

Two Early Bronze Age short cists and several outlying undated features have been excavated at Holm MainsBrown, G (2003)'Holm Mains Farm, Inverness (Inverness & Bona parish), short cists',Discovery and Excavation in Scotland, 4, p. 87 located to the south-west of Inverness http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/184924/details/drumdevan/. The larger cist contained a crouched male inhumation lying on his left side. Accompanying this burial were two barbed and tanged arrowheads, ten other lithics and the fragments of a finely decorated beaker pot. 
The other cist also contained an adult male, in a much poorer state of preservation, accompanied by a beaker pot.
