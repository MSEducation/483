CATEGORIES: Lego themes, Fictional secret agents and spies

Lego Agents is a series of Lego toy sets introduced in 2008 and is based on the secret agent genre. Each set features a mission that pits the Lego Agents team against the nefarious Dr. Inferno and his sinister cronies.

==Background==

A crazed doctor, Dr. Inferno, often sends his henchman and cyborgs on missions to steal treasure or terrorise the city. Formerly helping the agents, Inferno lost his arm to an explosion and blamed it on the agents. He established a base at a volcano and hired men as his henchmen. 
The agents are always included in a set, along with a special vehicle. The sets serve as story starters, allowing children to link them all together to form a "Master Plan." There are four agents, but two more appear in Agents 2.0. Agent Chase is the most common and comes in most every set. Agent Fuse is hard to find seeing he only comes in three sets. Agent Charge is also hard to find, since he also only comes in four sets. Agent Trace is very rare, since most sets she comes in are very expensive. Agent Swift and Swipe are exclusive to the sets they come in, which are Ariel Defense Unit and Gold Tooth's Getaway. There are many henchmen of Dr. Inferno, mostly they are deformed or robots. Dr. Inferno is part robot himself, since his right arm is a metal hand. The Agents have an undercover truck as their base, and Dr. Inferno's is a large volcano. The Agent scheme color is navy blue, lime green and light grey,  Dr. Inferno's is orange and black.
