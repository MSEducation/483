[tpl]nihongo|Paradise Cafe|パラダイス・カフェ|Paradaisu Kafe[/tpl]" is the 23rd studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyuki Nakajima, released in October 1996. The album includes a new recording of her 1995 chart-topping hit "Wanderer's Song", and also features her own interpretation of "Lie to Me Eternally" which was originally written for Long Time No See album recorded by Takuro Yoshida.
Following massive success of a single "Wanderer's Song" which sold over 1 million units, Paradise Cafe immediately gained Platinum award by the RIAJ for shipments of over 400,000 copies. However, the album itself apparently sold beneath expectations, staying briefly on charts and selling approximately 200,000 units in total.
