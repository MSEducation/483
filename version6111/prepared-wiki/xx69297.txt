This article is about the college football game. For the stadium in which it is held, see Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium.
The Capital One Bowl is an annual college football bowl game played in Orlando, Florida at the Citrus Bowl.  It was previously known as the Tangerine Bowl (1947–1982) and the Florida Citrus Bowl (1983–2002). Financial services company Capital One has been the title sponsor of the bowl since 2001 when it was the Capital One Florida Citrus Bowl but with the exclusive Capital One Bowl moniker since 2003. The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group which also organizes the Russell Athletic Bowl and Florida Classic.
Since becoming one of the premier bowls, the Capital One Bowl is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on January 1, New Year's Day, immediately before the Rose Bowl, both of which have been televised on ESPN since 2011. (In years when New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2 to avoid conflicting with the National Football League schedule.) In 2004, the Capital One Bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. On July 26, 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted 5–2 in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build a new arena for the Orlando Magic, a performing arts center, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl.
Currently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the BCS for both conferences. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl] at $4.55 million per team,Bowl payouts projected around $281 million – College Gridiron 365 Blog – Orlando Sentinel it has the largest payout  of all the non-BCS bowls. In nearly every year since 1985, the game has featured both teams ranked in the Top 25.

==History==

The game, which began play in 1947, is one of the oldest of the non-BCS bowls, along with the Gator Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic, and Sun Bowl. The first game played before an estimated crowd of 9,000. By 1952, the game was dubbed the "Little Bowl with the Big Heart," because all the proceeds from the game went to charity. Before 1968 the game featured matchups between schools throughout the South, often featuring the Ohio Valley Conference champion or other small colleges (though a few major colleges did play in the bowl during this early era as well). After becoming a major college bowl game, from 1968 through 1975 the bowl featured the Mid-American Conference champion against an opponent from the Southern Conference (through 1972), the SEC (1972–1973) or an at-large opponent (1975). As the major football conferences relaxed restrictions on post-season play in the mid-1970s, the game went to a matchup between two at-large teams from major conferences, with one school typically (but not always) from the South. From 1987 to 1991, it featured the ACC champion against an at-large opponent. Since 1992, the game has featured one of the top teams from both the Big Ten and the SEC.
In 1986, it was one of the bowl games considered for the site of the "winner take all" national championship game between Penn State and Miami before the Fiesta Bowl was eventually chosen.
The 1991 game featured National Championship implications. Georgia Tech won the Florida Citrus Bowl, finished 11–0–1, and were voted the 1990 UPI national champion.
The 1998 game, which featured nearby Florida beating Penn State, holds the game's attendance record at 72,940. During the 1990s, the second-place finisher in the SEC (but not necessarily the loser of the SEC Championship Game) typically went to this bowl. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, speaking to the fact Tennessee occupied that spot three of four years as Florida finished first, famously quipped "You can't spell 'Citrus' without U-T!"  In 1997, the Volunteers played for the last Bowl Alliance national championship in the Orange Bowl, and the Gators went to the Citrus Bowl, where it defeated Penn State 21-6. Florida defeated Tennessee 33-20 in the regular season, but  were knocked out of the SEC East title race by losing to LSU and Georgia.

===Racial integration===

In 1956, the Hillsdale College Chargers team under head coach Muddy Waters refused to play in the game despite their 9–0 record because game officials prohibited the team's black players from participating in the game.http://www.hillsdalesites.org/collegian/129/129_01/opinions/openforum.html [tpl]Dead link|[tpl]subst:DATE[/tpl] |date=December 2012[/tpl]
The University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to the Tangerine Bowl in 1958. The team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because the team's two black players would not have been allowed on the field. Buffalo would not be bowl eligible for another 50 years. During the 2008 season, when the Bulls were on the verge of bowl eligibility, the 1958 team was profiled on ESPN's Outside the Lines.Eric Neel, "All or Nothing", ESPN.com, retrieved November 20, 2008. The 2008 team went on to win the Mid-American Conference title, and lost to University of Connecticut 38–20 in the International Bowl.
In 1966, Morgan State, of Baltimore, Maryland under head coach Earl C. Banks, a member of the NCAA College Football Hall of Fame, became the first historically black college (HBCU) to play in and win the Tangerine Bowl game by defeating West Chester State (Pa.), finishing the season undefeated for the second straight year.

===Gainesville===

In early 1973, construction improvements were planned for the then 17,000-seat Tangerine Bowl stadium to expand to over 51,000 seats. In early summer 1973, however, construction was stalled due to legal concerns, and the improvements were delayed. Late in the 1973 college football season, Tangerine Bowl President Will Gieger and other officials planned to invite the Miami University Redskins and the East Carolina Pirates to Orlando for the game. On November 19, 1973, East Carolina withdrew its interests, and the bowl was left with one at-large bid. In an unexpected and unprecedented move, game officials decided to invite the Florida Gators, and move the game to Florida Field in Gainesville, the Gators' home stadium. The larger stadium would be needed to accommodate the large crowd expected. The move required special permission from the NCAA, and special accommodations were made. Both teams would be headquartered in Orlando, Florida for the week, and spend most of their time there, including practices, and would be bused up to Gainesville.
The participants were greeted with an unexpected event – a near-record low temperature of −4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit). Despite the home-field advantage, in the game nicknamed the "Transplant Bowl," Miami (OH), who found the cold much more to its liking, defeated the Gators 16–7. One of the players on the victorious Redskins squad was future Gators coach Ron Zook.
The one-time moving of the game, and the fears of a permanent relocation, rejuvenated the stalled stadium renovations in Orlando. The game returned to Orlando for 1974, and within a couple of years, the expansion project was complete.

===Mascot Challenge===

The "Capital One Mascot Challenge" (formerly known as the "Capital One National Mascot of the Year") is a contest where fans vote for their favorite college mascot. The contest began in 2002 with the winner being named during the halftime of the Capital One Bowl. Monte of the University of Montana was the first winner in the inaugural contest. The most recent winner is Rocky the Bull of University of South Florida.
Since 2010, 16 mascots have competed annually in the Mascot Challenge (only 12 mascots competed annually in 2002–2009). The mascot with the best record is declared the winner and is honored at halftime on the game telecast. The winning school is awarded $20,000 towards their mascot program.
