[[Baron Arlington]]

CATEGORIES: Baronies in the Peerage of England

Baron Arlington is a title in the Peerage of England. In 1664, it was created for Sir Henry Bennet, younger brother of John Bennet, 1st Baron Ossulston, with a special remainder allowing it to descend to male and female heirs, rather than only male heirs, as was customary with most peerages. In 1672, he was made Earl of Arlington and Viscount Thetford, and was regranted the title of Baron Arlington, with the same special remainder.  Its territorial designation is the birthplace of its first holder Harlington, London, which was also known as Arlington.
The first Earl died as anticipated without male heirs so the titles went to his daughter Isabella.  At age four, Isabella was engaged to be married off to the nine-year old Duke of Grafton-to-be.  

==Co-descent with the Duchy of Grafton==

As this boy Charles was an illegitimate son of King Charles II he therefore took the Norman-style surname Fitzroy. Upon the death of his parents Charles FitzRoy inherited the Arlington and Grafton substantive titles. 
The two titles continued united until the death of the 9th Duke in a high speed racecar accident in 1936. 

==Separation from Dukedom==

The Grafton dukedom passed to a cousin yet the three Arlington/Thetford titles fell into abeyance under the principle of moieties between his two sisters, neither of whom petitioned the Sovereign to terminate this.  After the death of the elder sister, her eldest child Jennifer petitioned the Sovereign, and the abeyance of the barony of Arlington was terminated in her favour, restoring it upon her, rather than her aunt's descendants.  The earldom of Arlington, however, remains abeyant, along with the viscountcy of Thetford.  

==Abeyance of senior title==

In the Peerage of the United Kingdom the earldom (including the viscountcy as a courtesy title) presents a rare example of a peerage more senior than a barony falling into abeyance, another case being that of the earldom of Cromartie in 1893.

==Barons Arlington (1664)==

The heir apparent is the present holder's elder son Hon. Patrick John Dudley Forwood (b. 1967). 
The heir apparent's heir presumptive is his younger brother Hon. James Roland Nelson Forwood (b. 1969).
