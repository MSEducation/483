==Re-emergence==

Hazelton Lanes has re-emerged as a 'neighbourhood shopping centre', albeit with some luxury brands still in place. Stores such as Hugo Nicholson, Nanni, and Contrasta carry luxury brands, some of which are exclusive to Toronto and even Canada. Carolina Herrera, Cole Haan, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Hugo Boss, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta, Roberto Cavalli, Salvatore Ferragamo, Stuart Weitzman, Valentino, and Versace are all international brands that can be found inside retailers at the mall. Hazelton Lanes is also home to a fitness spa and the first (and one of only three) Whole Foods Market natural foods grocers in the Greater Toronto Area. All in all there are more than 64 high-end boutiques and services spanning fashion, beauty, jewellery, home decor, and restaurants.
The mall is located in the Bloor-Yorkville shopping and entertainment district.
