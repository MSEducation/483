Matochkin Strait or Matochkin Shar ([tpl]lang-ru|Ма́точкин Шар[/tpl]) is a [tpl]convert|323|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] strait between the Severny and Yuzhny Islands of Novaya Zemlya. It connects the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea. The banks along the strait are high and steep. Its length is approximately [tpl]convert|100|km[/tpl] and its width in its narrowest part is approximately [tpl]convert|600|m|mi[/tpl]. The strait is covered with ice for the most of the year. There are fishing settlements along the strait (Matochkin Shar, Stolbovoy).
It is also the site where, from 1963 to 1990, about 39 underground nuclear tests took place in a vast array of tunnels and shafts. After 2000, Russia started to reactivate the test site by enlarging old tunnels and starting construction work. Each summer since then various subcritical hydronuclear experiments have taken place. In 2004, Rosatom reportedly performed a series of subcritical hydronuclear experiments with up to [tpl]convert|100|g|oz[/tpl] of weapon-grade plutonium each.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/weafacl/othernuc/novayaze.htm |title=Russia: Central Test Site, Novaya Zemlya |date=2003-07-30 |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |accessdate = 2006-10-14[/tpl]
