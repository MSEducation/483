Where White Men Fear to Tread is the autobiography of Oglala Lakota activist Russell Means. Published in 1996 and written in collaboration with Marvin J. Wolf, the book examines his childhood, his activism for the rights of Native American people, including his role in the famous standoff with the FBI at Wounded Knee in 1973, and his later forays into politics and film.

==Reception==

The book received mixed reviews. Publisher's Weekly called the book a blunt and "absorbing epic" which demonstrates his "resourceful activism", while making no attempt to whitewash the messier aspects of Means' life, such as his drinking, failed marriages, and anger issues.[tpl]cite news | title = Where White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Means|work=Publishers Weekly| date = October 2, 1995| url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-13621-5| accessdate = 2013-08-10[/tpl] The Los Angeles Times called it a self-congratulatory "exercise in propaganda and polemic" which grinds an axe against a white-dominated society.[tpl]cite news | author=Olds, Bruce | title = 'Irreconcilable Differences' : WHERE WHITE MEN FEAR TO TREAD: The Autobiography of Russell Means|work=Los Angeles Times| date = January 21, 1996| url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-13621-5| accessdate = 2013-08-10[/tpl]
