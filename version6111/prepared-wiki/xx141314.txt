==Tradition==

The temple is in the Pure Land tradition of Ling Yen Shan near Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. It is an offshoot of Ling Yen Shan monastery near Puli, Nantou, Taiwan, which was founded by Master Miao Lien in 1984.

==Location==

Located on No. 5 Road in Richmond near Williams Road, the Ling Yen Mountain Temple is located within a 20-minute drive from Vancouver, parts of Richmond and other Metro Vancouver municipalities with a significant Buddhist population.
The temple is on a stretch of Richmond's No. 5 Road that is thick with regional temples, churches, mosques, and associated schools,
which has been dubbed Richmond's "Highway to Heaven". The area is within British Columbia's Agricultural Land Reserve. The temple is one of few religious establishments there to have complied with the city's requirement that a certain portion of the properties be actively farmed.  They have established an orchard of apple and pear trees.

==Plans for expansion==

With 10,000 worshippers and over 8,000 community and school group visits over the years, the Temple is proposing an expansion of the temple on its land in addition to the current facilities. The new facilities are to better serve visitors, worshippers and practitioners as an all-encompassing international Buddhist centre. The new facility is envisioned to provide multi-purpose space and comprehensive services to allow the general public to delve deeply into Buddhism.
The new buildings would include more dormitories for the lay practitioners, and a [tpl]convert|140|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] high hall to house a dining hall, prayer space and a gilded Buddha statue.  The statue in the current hall is [tpl]convert|15|ft|m[/tpl] tall. The new proposed main temple would require a variance to height restrictions currently in place on Assembly Use and Agriculturally designated land.
Though never completed, in 2005 an initial development application was submitted to the City of Richmond. There has been opposition from area residents, primarily due to concerns about height of the main temple and increased traffic from visitors.  On 2005-09-06, at the temple's request, the city deferred a special public hearing of their land use application, to allow them to address all public concerns in their planning for the proposed expansion.  The neighbouring Richmond Bethel Mennonite Church, which has both English and Chinese congregations, and four ideally situated acres, had rejected the temple's proposal to purchase their property and relocate them.
In 2010 new expansion plans where submitted to the City of Richmond the revised plan was 76% larger than the plan in 2005. Richmond residents opposed the plans  and submitted to the City  Binders in support of their opposition which included exhibits and a brief to explain their opposition, the primary reason was the residents felt the 99,000 sq ft, 145 ' tall main temple and 98' tall twin monks dormitories where just too big for the  single family neighborhood. A group was formed by the neighbors called C.A.L.E. Committee Against Lingyen Expansion  their purpose was to organize an opposition to the plan and convince the City of Richmond to deny the application. C.A.L.E. also requested  meetings with the temple directors to ask for a meeting to work out a compromise for a smaller expansion that would be in harmony with the neighborhood.
As of December 2010 the expansion plans have been withdrawn  so that the City of Richmond can review  the No. 5 Road back lands policy and better understand the needs of the community and the tolerances of the neighborhood. The review is slated to be completed in spring 2012 after consultation with all stakeholders.

==Celebrations==

The temple has regular celebrations of events during different seasons. During the celebration of Buddha's birthday and Chinese New Year, the building is surrounded with 1000 special lanterns. Paramita Ball prayers are also set out on occasion.
