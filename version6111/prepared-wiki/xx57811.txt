Scott-Lee said: "Times have changed, but we are in a recession and Steps' music was very light-hearted and fun, so there could be a place for that in today's society ... What else is interesting is that there aren't any boy/girl pop groups out there at the moment".Ryan Love, Steps talk reunion and chart success: 'There's definitely a gap for us', 20 September 2011, Digital Spy
