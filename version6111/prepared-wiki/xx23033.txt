The landmark includes the base camp, where the scientists and support group lived; ground zero, where the bomb was placed for the explosion; and the Schmidt/McDonald ranch house, where the plutonium core to the bomb was assembled. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house are allowed to see the ground zero and ranch house areas. In addition, one of the old instrumentation bunkers is visible beside the road just west of ground zero.
In September 1953, about 650 people attended the first Trinity Site open house.  In 1967, the inner oblong fence was added.  In 1972, the corridor barbed wire fence that connects the outer fence to the inner one was completed. Jumbo was moved to the parking lot in 1979; it is missing its ends from an attempt to destroy it in 1946 using eight [tpl]convert|500|lb|adj=on[/tpl] bombs.[tpl]cite web | title=Trinity Atomic Website: Jumbo | publisher=Virginia Tech Center for Digital Discourse and Culture | url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity50_7.html | accessdate=2013-02-07[/tpl]
More than sixty years after the test, residual radiation at the site measured about ten times higher than normal.Brian Greene (2003), Nova: The Elegant Universe: Einstein's Dream.  PBS Nova transcript Regarding residual radiation. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is about half of the total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.WSMR article on Trinity nuclear test site The Trinity monument, a rough-sided, lava-rock obelisk around [tpl]convert|12|ft[/tpl] high, marks the explosion's hypocenter, and Jumbo is still kept nearby.
On July 16, 1995, a special tour of the site was conducted to mark the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test, and about 5,000 visitors arrived to commemorate the occasion, the largest crowd for any open house. Since that large crowd, the open houses usually average two to three thousand visitors. The site is still a popular destination for those interested in atomic tourism, though it is only open to the public once a year during the Trinity Site Open House on the first Saturday in April.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/Trinity/Pages/default.aspx | title=Trinity Site | publisher=White Sands Missile Range, Public Affairs Office | accessdate=July 7, 2013[/tpl]
