In geometry, a dihedral or torsion angle is the angle between two planes.
In higher dimension, a dihedral angle represents the angle between two hyperplanes.[tpl]GlossaryForHyperspace | anchor=Dihedral | title=Dihedral angle [/tpl]

==Alternative definitions==

Since a plane can be defined in several ways (e.g., by vectors or points in them, or by their normal vectors), there are several equivalent definitions of a dihedral angle.
Any plane can be defined by two non-collinear vectors lying in that plane; taking their cross product and normalizing yields the normal unit vector to the plane.  Thus, a dihedral angle can be defined by four, pairwise non-collinear vectors.

==Dihedral angles in polyhedra==

Every polyhedron, regular and irregular, convex and concave, has a dihedral angle at every edge.
A dihedral angle (also called the face angle) is the internal angle at which two adjacent faces meet. An angle of zero degrees means the face normal vectors are antiparallel and the faces overlap each other (Implying part of a degenerate polyhedron). An angle of 180 degrees means the faces are parallel (like a tiling). An angle greater than 180 exists on concave portions of a polyhedron.
Every dihedral angle in an edge-transitive polyhedron has the same value. This includes the 5 Platonic solids, the 4 Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra, the two quasiregular solids, and two quasiregular dual solids.

==Dihedral angles of biological molecules==

The backbone dihedral angles of proteins are called φ (phi, involving the backbone atoms C'-N-Cα-C'), ψ (psi, involving the backbone atoms N-Cα-C'-N) and ω (omega, involving the backbone atoms Cα-C'-N-Cα).  Thus, φ controls the C'-C' distance, ψ controls the N-N distance and ω controls the Cα-Cα distance.
The planarity of the peptide bond usually restricts ω to be 180° (the typical trans case) or 0° (the rare cis case).  The distance between the Cα atoms in the trans and cis isomers is approximately 3.8 and 2.9 Å, respectively.  The cis isomer is mainly observed in Xaa-Pro peptide bonds (where Xaa is any amino acid).
The sidechain dihedral angles of proteins are denoted as χ1-χ5, depending on the distance up the sidechain.  The χ1 dihedral angle is defined by atoms N-Cα-Cβ-Cγ, the χ2 dihedral angle is defined by atoms Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ, and so on.
The sidechain dihedral angles tend to cluster near 180°, 60°, and −60°, which are called the trans, gauche+, and gauche− conformations.  The choice of sidechain dihedral angles is affected by the neighbouring backbone and sidechain dihedrals; for example, the gauche+ conformation is rarely followed by the gauche+ conformation (and vice versa) because of the increased likelihood of atomic collisions.
Dihedral angles have also been defined by the IUPAC for other molecules, such as the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and for polysaccharides.

==Methods of computation==

The dihedral angle between two planes relies on being able to efficiently generate a normal vector to each of the planes.  One approach is to use the cross product.  If A1, A2, and A3 are three non-collinear points on plane A, and B1, B2, and B3 are three non-collinear points on plane B, then [tpl]nowrap|1=UA = (A2−A1) × (A3−A1)[/tpl] is orthogonal to plane A and [tpl]nowrap|1=UB = (B2−B1) × (B3−B1)[/tpl] is orthogonal to plane B.  The (unsigned) dihedral angle can therefore be computed with either
Another approach to computing the dihedral angle is first to pick an arbitrary vector V that is not tangent to either of the two planes.  Then applying the Gram–Schmidt process to the three vectors (A2−A1, A3−A1, V) produces an orthonormal basis of space, the third vector of which will be normal to plane A.  Doing the same with the vectors (B2−B1, B3−B1, V) yields a vector normal to plane B.  The angle between the two normal vectors can then be computed by any method desired. This approach generalizes to higher dimensions, but does not work with flats that have a codimension greater than 1.
To compute the dihedral angle between two flats, it is additionally necessary to ensure that each of the two normal vectors is selected to have a minimal projection onto the other flat. The Gram–Schmidt process does not guarantee this property, but it can be guaranteed with a simple eigenvector technique. If
