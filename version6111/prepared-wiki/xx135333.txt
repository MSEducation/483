LMMS (originally Linux MultiMedia Studio) is a free software digital audio workstation. Music can be produced by synthesizing sounds, arranging samples, and playing on a MIDI keyboard by combining the features of trackers, sequencers and synthesizers. It supports LADSPA and VST plugins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lmms.sourceforge.net/|title=LMMS — Linux MultiMedia Studio|accessdate=17 May 2011 | publisher = SourceForge[/tpl]
