==How to Shit in the Woods==

How to Shit in the Woods was published by Ten Speed Press in 1989. This first book by Meyer does, indeed, revolve around the many strategies she has noticed for defecating where there is no modern toilet and running water. As one reads the book, it quickly becomes obvious that Meyer's concern is not so much for the comfort of the camper or hiker, but for the impact that human waste leaves on pristine natural ecosystems. She talks about digging "environmentally sound" holes, locating the high water line, so as not to inadvertently pollute a stream or ground water source, and what types of soil facilitate quickest decomposition without risk of environmental contamination. The damage to humans and wildlife from carelessly disposed human waste comes in many forms including giardia, diarrhea, and intestinal diseases.[tpl]cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1989|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-89815-319-0[/tpl] A second edition of the book was issued in 1994 and a third edition in 2011.[tpl]cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1994|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-0-89815-627-0|edition=2nd ed. rev.[/tpl] Meyer holds humans uniquely responsible for the spread of giardia in the wilderness areas of the United States: "Until 1970, there were no reports in the United States of waterborne outbreaks of giardia. The first .  .  .  occurred in Aspen, Colorado, in 1970. Over the next four years, many cases were documented in travelers returning from .  .  .  Leningrad  .  .  . The Soviet Union became more open to visitation by Westerners at about this time and Leningrad's municipal water supply was full of Giardia cysts."[tpl]cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1989|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-89815-319-0|pages=21[/tpl]

In 2006 Meyer wrote the introduction to a volume by Jane Wilson-Howarth on a parallel topic which also dares to use the S word.[tpl]Cite book| author=Jane Wilson-Howarth| title=How to Shit Around the World: the art of staying clean and healthy while traveling | publisher=Travelers Tales, Calif | year=2006 | pages = 165 | ISBN= 978-1-932361-32-2[/tpl]

==Barefoot-Hearted==

In Barefoot-Hearted, published by Random House in 2001, Meyer writes about renovating a dilapidated barn in which to live with her new boyfriend. Her book explores the many adversities of trying to live in a barn, not the least of which is how the smell of resident skunks under the floor permeates and resides in her clothes and hair and how the barn is infested with flies and mice. In the manner of nature writers who often use a small animal or plant as a symbol of an ecological principle, Meyer explains that she doesn't feel guilty about trapping and killing mice, because they are abundant and their population ever growing. By contrast, she notes the comparative frailty of bears who often stumble upon human habitations looking for food. When the humans get scared, the bear is often removed and killed. In the same book, Meyer also chronicles her adventure riding a horse and buggy across a large region of northwest America. Barefoot Hearted was widely reviewed, though not always with great affection. Kirkus Reviews found it an "annoying saga about a house full of pests."[tpl]cite web|title=Barefoot Hearted|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/kathleen-meyer/barefoot-hearted/#review|work=website|publisher=Kirkus Reviews.|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] The book got good reviews, however, from Booklist, Library Journal and Publishers Weekly.[tpl]cite web|title=Editorial Reviews|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/B000FUO0H4|work=website|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] A BookPage review describes Barefoot Hearted favorably compares the book to the writings of Edward Abbey, noting "You might think of flies, mice and bats as vermin, but through close observations of these intruders and much scientific and anecdotal research, Meyer turns her life with these critters into a complex treatise on man's often unconscious inhumanity to wildlife. 'Who is the real intruder here?' Meyer frequently asks.[tpl]cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Lynn|title=Review, Barefoot Hearted|url=http://bookpage.com/review/barefoot-hearted%3A-a-wild-life-among-wildlife/review|work=on-line magazine|publisher=BookPage|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl]
