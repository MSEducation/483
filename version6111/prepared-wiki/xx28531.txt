He had also been seriously injured in a car crash in 1975 which had been said to have affected him badly. Stein rebuilt the squad and achieved a [[Double (association football)|double]] in [[1976–77 Celtic F.C. season|1976–77]].<ref name="76-77">
</ref> However, the next season went poorly and the ability and commitment of many of these players was called into question.<ref>
</ref> The board decided to replace Stein in 1978. The recently appointed Chairman, Desmond White, and Stein had a poor relationship and Stein left the club in a bad manner. Celtic's official history was released at that time and Stein was criticised in the book for losing the 1970 European Cup. White and the directors had contributed to the book and Stein was unhappy with this criticism. Stein was offered a place on the Celtic board after he left, however, they wanted him to revive the ticket sales at the club. Stein felt this demeaning and he said was; "a football man, not a ticket salesman". He declined this offer and decided to stay in management.<ref name="TimesPictureGoogle" /><ref>

McNeill, the European Cup winning captain under Stein, was brought in to replace him. After five seasons he asked for a contract with a wage rise as he felt he needed greater security; his predecessor had had informal "gentleman's agreements" with the club. During his tenure McNeill had been the most successful manager in Scotland yet it was revealed that he earned less than his counterparts at Aberdeen, Dundee United and Rangers. McNeill also publicly asked the board for more money to invest in the playing squad. The following day the board announced they had unanimously rejected his requests and McNeill moved on to manage Manchester City stating that to remain at Celtic would have been humiliating.

===McCann takeover and transition to plc===

Throughout the 1960s and 70s Celtic had been one of the strongest clubs in Europe. However, the directors failed to accompany the wave of economic development facing football in the 1980s. In 1989, the club's annual budget was £6.4 million, about a third as much as Barcelona, with a debt of around 40% and on-field success deteriorating.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/sf-review/99-00/00article5.html | title = If You Know The History ...

They strongly supported a takeover bid fronted by Fergus McCann and Brian Dempsey. Football writer Jim Traynor likened McCann's attempt to buy the club from the board as being like "good against evil".[ref]

On 4 March 1994, McCann bought Celtic for £9 million.[ref]
