Masatomo Sumitomo.Company History Sumitomo Electric Considered its spiritual founder, even today management of the group is guided by his "Founder's Precepts", written in the 17th century.
It was copper that made the company famous, however. When Riemon Soga, Masatomo Sumitomo's brother-in-law, learned Western methods of copper refining, he established a smelting business in 1590. This he named Izumiya, literally meaning "spring shop". The advanced techniques Riemon perfected allowed extraction of silver from copper ore, something which Japanese technology had as yet been unable to accomplish.
