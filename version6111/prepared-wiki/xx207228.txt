Jedok geom or Admiral sword or Commander sword is the name of sword-skill introduced by the Chinese commander Li Rusong who fought during the Imjin waeran on Korea's side against the Japanese. Li Rusong was from Hebei province, China.

The techniques required the use of both a sharp sword and a waist sword. Li used straight-bladed swords (jikdo) with a single edge for slashing and a double-edged sword (geom) for stabbing. The techniques, with 14 basic stances, were first published in the Muyesinbo, a martial arts manual from the Joseon Dynasty.
