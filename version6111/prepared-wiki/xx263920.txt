She has made the rights of senior citizens a hallmark of her tenure and has successfully fought to keep senior centers in Brooklyn and Staten Island from being closed.
Another priority of Assemblywoman Malliotakis has been the restoration of MTA bus service in her district.  She also held a series of forums with regard to the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax and its negative impact on small businesses, non-profit organizations, and private schools.  The Legislature and Governor Andrew Cuomo subsequently enacted significant repeals.
She has been at the forefront of the fight for relief from the September 2011 toll increase on Port Authority bridges, calling for divestment of costly non-essential real estate holdings and highlighting mismanaged contributions to community organizations.  In October 2011 she submitted an amicus brief in support of the American Automobile Association lawsuit against the Port Authority in federal court, arguing that the toll increases were illegal, and is currently engaged in an Article 78 proceeding to compel the Port Authority to disclose the results of an economic impact study regarding the effect the toll increases have had on business at New York Container Terminal.
