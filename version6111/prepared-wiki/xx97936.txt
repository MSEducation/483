[[Projective Hilbert space]]

CATEGORIES: Hilbert space

This freedom means that projective representations of quantum states are important in quantum theory. For example, a density matrix of a pure quantum state is represented by a projective ray; it is impossible to recover the phase from a density matrix. The same is true for its generalisation, pure states in a representation[tpl]clarification needed|reason=There must be some conditions on it…|date=January 2014[/tpl] of a C*-algebra.
The same construction can be applied also to real Hilbert spaces.
Complex projective Hilbert space may be given a natural metric, the Fubini–Study metric, derived from the Hilbert space's norm.

==Product==

The Cartesian products of projective Hilbert spaces is not a projective space. Their categorical product is equivalent to the tensor product of respective (vector) Hilbert spaces and, in quantum physics, describes states of a composite quantum system. Segre mapping is an embedding of the Cartesian product of two projective spaces into their categorical product. It describes how to make states of the composite system from states of its constituents. It is only an embedding not a surjection; most of the categorical product space does not lie in its range and represents entangled states.
