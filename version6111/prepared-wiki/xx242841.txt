In October 2009, Beast held their debut showcase at the MTV GongGae Hall and made their live performance debut on KBS Music Bank with their debut single, "Bad Girl".[tpl]ko icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://newsen.com/news_view.php?news_uid=384857 |title=BEAST : "After the Showcase on the 15th, we cannot hide our tears" |work=Newsen |date=2009-10-17 |accessdate=2009-12-24[/tpl]  A documentary recording the story of the group's debut titled MTV B2ST was filmed during this time, showing the members as they filmed their first music video and bonded with each other.[tpl]ko icon[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?type=2&aid=200908252225c&nid=910&sid=83 |title=‘AJ & Eliminated Big Bang Member Joins Together to Form the 6 Member Boy Band B2ST’|work=Korea Economic Daily |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl]  Their debut mini-album, Beast Is the B2ST featured five songs, including the intro track "Beast Is the B2ST", "Mystery" and "Oasis".
