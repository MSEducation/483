The Remarkables are a mountain range and skifield in Otago, South Island of New Zealand. Located on the southeastern shore of Lake Wakatipu, the range lives up to its name by rising sharply to create an impressive backdrop for the waters. The range is clearly visible from the nearby town of Queenstown.
The highest point in the range is Double Cone (2319 metres) with Ben Nevis (2234 metres, named after the Scottish mountain of the same name) further south in the Hector mountains.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] 
There are a number of small lakes on the mountains including Lake Alta which forms part of the Remarkables Skifield.
The mountains were named The Remarkables by Alexander Garvie in 1857-58,Miller. F.W.G. (1949) Golden Days of Lake County. Whitcomb and Toombs. Pg 352. allegedly  because they are one of only two mountain ranges in the world which run directly north to south.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] An alternate explanation for the name given by locals is that early Queenstown settlers, upon seeing the mountain range during sunset one evening, named them the Remarkables to describe the sight.
