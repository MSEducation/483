The Peene ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈpeːnə[/tpl]) is a river in Germany. The Westpeene, Kleine Peene and Ostpeene flow into the Kummerower See, and from there as Peene proper to Anklam and into the Oder Lagoon.
The Peene Valley is the largest contiguous fen region in Europe.Peenetal / Peene-Haff-Moor at www.bfn.de. Thanks to its wilderness and intact nature, the river Peene and its valley is often referred to as "the Amazon of the North".Peene: Paddeln auf dem Amazonas des Nordens (Spiegel Online)
The western branch of the Oder River, which separates the island of Usedom from the German mainland, is often also called Peene, but actually is considered a part of the Baltic Sea called Peenestrom. It is one of three channels connecting the Oder Lagoon with the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea (the other channels being the Świna and the Dziwna).
Major towns at the Peene river are Wolgast, Teterow, Demmin and Anklam.
