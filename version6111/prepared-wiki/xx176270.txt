Cynoglossum occidentale is a species of flowering plant in the borage family known by the common name western hound's tongue. It is native to Oregon and northern California, where it is a resident of the coniferous understory in the mountains. This is a perennial plant with hairy stems which may approach half a meter in height. It has rough, hairy leaves up to 15 centimeters long and four wide with winged petioles. From the top of the leafy stem appears an inflorescence of tube-shaped reddish-purple flowers, each about a centimeter long. The fruits are bumpy, bristly nutlets attached to each other in clusters of four.
