CATEGORIES: Ships of the British East India Company, Shipwrecks of England, Maritime incidents in 1803, 1796 ships

Hindostan was an East Indiaman of the East India Company. She was a large vessel of 1,463 tons (bm), launched in 1796 to replace a previous Hindostan that the Royal Navy had bought and turned into a Fourth Rate ship of the line. Her owner was Robert Williams, M.P., who had been the owner of the previous Hindostan.
She made three complete voyages.Hardy and Hardy (1811).  She was lost on her fourth voyage, wrecking at Margate in January 1803.

==Voyages==

As was typical for East Indiamen during wartime, Hindostan made her voyages under a letter of marque, which authorized her to capture enemy vessels should the opportunity arise.
Under Captain William Mackintosh she sailed to Bombay and China. Before leaving, she had the misfortune to run over the Thomas and Alice in Blackwell Reach, sinking the smaller ship.Lloyd's List,http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1797/01-24-1797.jpg - accessed 12 January 2014. Hindostan left for the Far East on 18 March 1797, via Bombay, Cochin, and Malacca, before arriving at Whampoa on 8 January 1798. For the return voyage she crossed Second Bar on 3 March, reached Saint Helena on 5 August, and the Downs on 18 October, finally anchoring on 22 October 1798. 
Mackintosh had made five earlier voyages for the East India Company, including three as captain of Indiamen. In 1792-94 he was captain of a different Hindostan when he took George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney on Britain's first embassy to China. Mackintosh's letter of marque was dated 7 February 1797.
Under Captain George Millett she sailed to China, leaving Portsmouth on 18 June 1799. On the way out she reached Penang on 28 October and Whampoa on 16 January 1800. On her return trip, she reached Anger on 3 May, Saint Helena on 15 July, and the Downs on 23 September. 
Because her captain had changed, Hindostan required a new letter of marque; Millett's was dated 15 April 1799. It would remain valid for his subsequent voyages as well.
For her third voyage Hindostan was again under Captain George Millet. This was his eighth voyage for the East India Company, and his fifth as a captain. She sailed to the Coast and China, leaving Portsmouth on 31 March 1801. She reached Madras on 26 July, Penang on 28 August, and Whampoa on 29 September. For her return trip she crossed Second Bar on 7 December. She reached Saint Helena on 12 aApril 1802 and the Downs on 10 June, before finally anchoring on 13 June.

==Wreck==

Hondostan[tpl]'[/tpl]s fourth voyage was for the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, the Coast and China. She carried mostly woolens and 45,000 ounces of silver bullion in 13 cases for private ventures, not the East India Company. For this voyage her captain was Edward Balston. Hindostan left London just after the turn of the new year. Unfortunately a severe gale caught her just off Margate on 11 January 1803 and wrecked her on the Wedge Sand. She had about 120 persons aboard, of whom about 20 or 25 lost their lives.Lloyd's List,http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1803/01-14-1803.jpg - accessed 12 January 2014.Loss of the HINDOSTAN, Liverpool Mercury, 1913 On the morning of the 12th, a Margate hoy, the Lord Nelson, and the pilot sloop Liberty saved 80.
