James Benson Dudley High School is located in the Southeastern quadrant of Guilford County in the city of Greensboro, North Carolina. Dudley High School was founded in 1929 as the first black high school in Guilford County, in a school system segregated by law. The school was named for James Benson Dudley.
The school was central to the 1969 Greensboro uprising when school officials refused to recognize the validity of a write-in candidate for student council, allegedly due to his activism in the Black Power movement.[tpl]cite book|last=North Carolina Advisory Committee on Civil Rights|title=Trouble in Greensboro: A Report of an Open Meeting Concerning Disturbances at Dudley High School and North Carolina A&T State University|date=March 1970|url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/item.aspx?i=38|ref=CITEREFNC Advisory Committee1970[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.library.ncat.edu/resources/archives/grimes.html | last=Bluford Library|title=Willie Grimes | publisher = North Carolina A&T University | accessdate = September 2, 2012|ref=harv[/tpl] In 1971 through desegregation, Dudleyâ€™s student population integrated.
