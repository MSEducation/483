[[Corson (demon)]]

CATEGORIES: Goetic demons, Demons in Christianity

In demonology Corson is one of the four principal kings that have power on the seventy-two demons supposedly constrained by King Solomon (according to the Lesser Key of Solomon), and is not to be conjured except on great occasions.
He is the king of the west according to some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon and king of the south according to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum. The other three kings are Amaymon, Ziminiar and Gaap (although some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai and Gaap to be the kings of different cardinal directions, not giving detail on the cardinal point they rule).
