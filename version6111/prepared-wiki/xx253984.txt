Victor Howard ("Vic") Dudman (1935â€“2009) was an Australian logician and teacher of logic.
He was greatly influenced by Willard Van Orman Quine on whose work he based his undergraduate logic courses.
He is particularly noted for his views on the interpretation of the material conditional. David Lewis, a frequent visitor to Australian departments of logic, once noted "If Dudman's view is correct, and I cannot at the moment see what is wrong with it, then almost everything I have written on conditionals is mistaken".http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/manifesto/if.htm#intro
Jean Curthoys saw through the press and wrote an introduction to Victor Dudman's Grammar and Semantics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).
