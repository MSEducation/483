[[SR E1/R class]]

CATEGORIES: Southern Railway locomotives

The Southern Railway E1/R is a class of 0-6-2T (0-6-2) tank steam locomotive designed for light passenger and freight duties. They were rebuilt from earlier LBSCR E1 class locomotives initially to be used on the North Devon and Cornwall Junction line.
Some balancing issues were addressed by Bulleid for main line workings while other locomotives that weren't balanced ended up restricted to local and shunting/banking duties.
Their withdrawal commenced in 1955 and they were finally all replaced by Ivatt tanks by 1959.
