==History==

===Early History===

Before the Portuguese name of Lagos had been adopted, Lagos' initial name was Eko which referred mainly to the island. The first to settle in Eko were the Aworis. The Awori hunters und fishermen had originally come frome Ife-Ife to the coast. The name Eko comes either from the Yoruba "Oko" (cassava farm) oder "Eko" (war camp). Over 650 years ago, the Oba of Bini sent warriors to Eko who were received in a welcoming manner by the residing Awori fishermen. The Bini Prince, Ado, who led the war party, was asked to become their leader. From that point on, Eko belonged to the kingdom of the Oba of Bini.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lagosstate.gov.ng/pagelinks.php?p=8 |title=History of Lagos State |format= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]

===Postcolonial Era===

Lagos State was created on May 27, 1967 by virtue of State (Creation and Transitional Provisions) Decree No. 14 of 1967, which restructured Nigeria’s Federation into 12 states.
Prior to this, Lagos Municipality had been administered by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs as the regional authority, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the City of Lagos. Equally, the metropolitan areas (Colony Province) of Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry were administered by the Western Region.
The State took off as an administrative entity on April 11, 1968 with Lagos Island serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital.
However, with the creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja in 1976, Lagos Island ceased to be the capital of the State which was moved to Ikeja. Equally, with the formal relocation of the seat of the Federal Government to Abuja on 12 December 1991, Lagos Island ceased to be Nigeria’s political capital.
Nevertheless, Lagos remains the center of commerce for the country.

==Government==

Since its creation in 1967, the state has been administered either by a governor and a House of Assembly in civilian or quasi-civilian (under Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida's administration) federal administrations, or by Sole-Administrators or Military Administrators in military dispensations . Since December 2007, Yoruba has been the second official language of debate and discussion for the House of Assembly after English.

===Administrative Divisions and Local Government Areas===

Lagos State is divided into five Administrative Divisions, which are further divided into 20 Local Government Areas, or LGAs:
