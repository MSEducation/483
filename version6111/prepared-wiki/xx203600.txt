The Córdoba Metro is a project that will, according to its proponents, serve the Argentine city of Córdoba. The metro system would become the second metro system in Argentina, after the Buenos Aires Underground. The project is currently in the planning and design phase. 

==Background==

On December 10, 2007, the Secretary of Transport and Traffic of the Argentine Municipality announced an initiative of the Iecsa/Gela companies to build an underground system in the City of Córdoba.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/12/15/secciones/grancordoba/nota.asp?nota_id=144390 |title=El municipio empieza a estudiar la factibilidad de un subte en Córdoba |newspaper=LaVoz.com.ar |language=Spanish |trans_title=The municipality begins to study the feasibility of a subway in Cordoba |date=15 December 2007 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl] The announcement was made after a meeting with the Argentine Secretary of Transport, Ricardo Jaime[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&numexp=5647-D-2006 |title=PROYECTO DE LEY.

===First proposal===

Finally on April 10, 2008, President Cristina Kirchner in a meeting with the mayor of the city of Córdoba, Daniel Giacomino confirmed the construction of the metro system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=192984&ID_Seccion=42 |title=Córdoba: La presidenta le prometió fondos a Giacomino para hacer el subte |publisher=DERF Agencia de Noticias |language=Spanish |trans_title=Córdoba: The president promised to fund the subway to Giacomino |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/cordoba-private-metro-proposed.html |title=Córdoba private metro proposed |journal=Railway Gazette |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl]  In the meeting, the Argentine president also announced granting the adjudication of the high-speed rail to the French engineering giant, Alstom. This original proposal was for a two line metro network comprising [tpl]convert|15.8|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] of route.
Depending on which vehicles would be selected and other factors, the total planned cost of the system is of nearly US$1.1 billion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/08/03/16/secciones/grancordoba/nota.asp?nota_id=171733 |title=Sigue en análisis técnico el subte Córdoba |newspaper=LaVoz.com.ar |language=Spanish |trans_title=Technical analysis on the Córdoba subway continues |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl] The preliminary design of the original project foresaw two principal lines. The first line would cross the city from west to south, over Colón and Duarte Quirós Avenues, up to Perón Boulevard, where it would reach the vicinity of the Mitre Railroad, near the bus terminal. The second line would run from north to south near the Ciudad Universitaria area, and under the Suquía river, continuing northwards to the Belgrano railway, near the Alta Córdoba train station. Plans were initially for the construction of 17 stations, 11 on the west-south line, and six in the south-north line. 
However, an updated plan was announced in November 2010, with 29 stations on a [tpl]convert|18.5|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] network built by China Railway International, costing US$1.8 billion.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/urban-rail-news-in-brief-8.html |title=Urban Rail News in Brief |journal=Railway Gazette |date=14 November 2010 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl]

===Second proposal===

The project was redesigned again in 2012.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/cordoba-metro-redesigned.html |title=Córdoba metro redesigned |journal=Railway Gazette |date=19 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl] The redesigned project proposes a three line metro network consisting of [tpl]convert|32.9|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] of route and 26 stations to be built by China Railway International and financed by a US$1.8 billion loan from China. Line A would run [tpl]convert|10.7|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] from Colón Avenue in the west to Bajada de Piedra and serve 11 stations. An interchange would be provided at Maipú with the proposed [tpl]convert|6.5|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] north-south Line B, which would run from Alta Córdoba near the Belgrano Railway station to Rontonda las Flores, and would serve 8 stations. Shortest of the three routes, Line C would run [tpl]convert|5.6|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] east-west from Fuerza Aérea Avenue to Sabattini Avenue, paralleling Line A but further south, serving 7 stations.

==Construction features==

Tunnel boring machines will be used for the construction. According to experts of the Lecsa company, since the construction work won't be done on the surface, the disadvantages of traffic complications would be avoided from the very beginning. The tunnels will be covered in [tpl]convert|40|cm|in|sp=us[/tpl] thick prefabricated assembled units of concrete. The trains will have safety systems along the entire metro network.
