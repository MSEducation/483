==Etymology==

===West Bank===

The name West Bank is a translation of the Arabic term ad-Daffa al-gharbiya, given to the territory west of the Jordan River, conquered by Jordan's Arab Legion in 1948, and annexed to Jordan in 1950.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.jcpa.org/art/knesset6.htm| title= The Constituent Assembly First Knesset 1949-1951| publisher= Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs| accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl] The term was chosen to differentiate the west bank of the River Jordan from the "East Bank" of this river.

===Cisjordan===

The neo-Latin name Cisjordan or Cis-Jordan (literally "on this side of the River Jordan") is the usual name for the territory in the Romance languages and Hungarian. The name West Bank, however, is standard usage for this geo-political entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages.
In English, the name Cisjordan is occasionally used to designate the entire region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, particularly in the historical context of the British Mandate and earlier times. The analogous Transjordan (literally "on the other side of the River Jordan") has historically been used to designate the region now comprising the state of Jordan, which lies to the east of the Jordan River.

==History==

From 1517 through 1917, the area now known as the West Bank was under Ottoman rule as part of the provinces of Syria.

===20th century===

At the 1920 San Remo conference, the victorious Allied powers (France, UK, USA, etc.) allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–47). It was designated as part of a proposed Arab state by the United Nations (UN) partition plan for Palestine in 1947. The plan recommended partition of the British Mandate into a Jewish State, an Arab State, and an internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem,[tpl]cite web |url= http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |first= |last= |work=domino.un.org |year=1947 |accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl] a more broad region of the modern-day West Bank was assigned to the Arab State.
In fact, following the Second World War, the United Nations passed the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) Future Government of Palestine, which aimed to establish two states within Mandate Palestine. The Resolution designated the territory described as "the hill country of Samaria and Judea" (including what is now known as the "West Bank") as part of the proposed Arab state, but following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War this area was captured by Transjordan (renamed Jordan two years after independence in 1946). "West Bank" or "Cisjordan" became the name for the area west of the Jordan River, as "East Bank" or "Transjordan" designated the area east of the river.
In the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the West Bank was declared part of Jordanian territory and defined the interim boundary between Israel and Jordan. Jordan ruled over the West Bank from 1948 until 1967, annexing it in 1950. Jordan's claim was never formally recognized by the international community, with the exception of the United Kingdom.Joseph Massad said that the members of the Arab League granted de facto recognition and that the United States had formally recognized the annexation, except for Jerusalem. See Joseph A. Massad, Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001),ISBN 0-231-12323-X, page 229. Records show that the United States de facto accepted the annexation without formally recognizing it. United States Department of State / Foreign relations of the United States, 1950. The Near East, South Asia, and Africa pg. 921It is often stated that Pakistan recognized it as well, but that seems to be incorrect; see S. R. Silverburg, Pakistan and the West Bank: A research note, Middle Eastern Studies, 19:2 (1983) 261–263.
The idea of an independent Palestinian state was not raised by the Arab populations there at the time. King Abdullah of Jordan was crowned King of Jerusalem and granted Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and East Jerusalem Jordanian citizenship.Armstrong, Karen. Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths.  New York: Ballantine Books, 1996.  p. 387.
During the 1950s, there was a significant influx of Palestinian refugees and violence together with Israeli reprisal raids across the "Green Line".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Israeli occupation===

In June 1967, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured by Israel as a result of the Six-Day War. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli-Jordanian no man's land, the West Bank was not annexed by Israel but has remained under Israeli military control and is referred to as Judea and Samaria Area by Israel. Although the 1974 Arab League summit resolution at Rabat designated the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as the “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people”, Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until 1988,[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DWhgIe3Hq98C&pg=PA247&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| title= The Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987-1988| editor= Anis F. Kassim| year= 1988| page= 247[/tpl] when it severed all administrative and legal ties with the West Bank and eventually stripped West Bank Palestinians of Jordanian citizenship.[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=asQryfnCVsEC&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q&f=false| title= Israel, the Hashemites, and the Palestinians: The fateful triangle| editors=Efraim Karsh, P. R. Kumaraswamy| year=2003| page=196[/tpl]
Until 1974, Jordan demanded the restoration of its control over the West Bank.Religious human rights in global perspective: legal perspectives By J. D. Van der Vyver, John Witte. pg. 388. In 1988, Jordan's King Hussein announced "full legal and administrative disengagement from the West Bank".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/88_july31.html |title=Address to the Nation |publisher=Kinghussein.gov.jo |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] On 28 July 1988, King Hussein announced the cessation of a $1.3 billion development program for the West Bank. Over the next few days, he formally dissolved Parliament, ending West Bank representation in the legislature, and severed all administrative and legal ties with the West Bank.Disengagement from the West Bank
Since the 1993 Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority officially controls a geographically non-contiguous territory comprising approx. 11% of the West Bank (known as Area A) which remains subject to Israeli incursions. Area B (approx. 28%) is subject to both Israeli military and Palestinian civil control. Area C (approx. 61%) is under full Israeli control.

===Legal status===

From 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey, successor state to the Ottoman Empire, renounced its territorial claims in 1923 signing the Treaty of Lausanne and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the British Mandate for Palestine. During the Mandate period Britain had no right of sovereignty, which was held by the people under the mandate.[tpl]cite book|last=Quigley|first=John|title=The Case for Palestine An International Law Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|page=15[/tpl]  In 1947 the UN General Assembly recommended that the area that became the West Bank become part of a future Arab state, but this proposal was opposed by the Arab states at the time. In 1949 Jordan occupied the West Bank and subsequently annexed it. However its claim was never recognized by the international community. In 1967 Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the Six-Day War. UN Security Council Resolution 242 that followed called for withdrawal from territories occupied in the conflict. Since 1979 the United Nations Security Council,Resolution 446, Resolution 465, Resolution 484, among others the United Nations General Assembly,[tpl]cite web| title = Applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories| publisher = United Nations| date=  17 December 2003| url = http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/97360ee7a29e68a085256df900723485/d6f5d7049734efff85256e1200677754| accessdate=27 September 2006[/tpl] the United States,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/nea/8262.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |publisher=State.gov |date=4 March 2002 |accessdate=3 October 2010[/tpl] the EU,Occupied Palestinian Territory - EU the International Court of Justice,[tpl]cite web| title = Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory| publisher = International Court of Justice| date= 9 July 2004| url = http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/85255e950050831085255e95004fa9c3/3740e39487a5428a85256ecc005e157a| accessdate=27 September 2006[/tpl] and the International Committee of the Red Cross[tpl]cite web| title = Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention: Statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross| publisher = International Committee of the Red Cross| date= 5 December 2001| url = http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5fldpj.htm| accessdate=27 September 2006[/tpl] refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as occupied Palestinian territory.

The executive branch of the Israeli government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has defined the West Bank as disputed territory, whose status can only be determined through negotiations. The Ministry says that occupied territories are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign, and that since the West Bank wasn't under the legitimate and recognized sovereignty of any state prior to the Six-Day War, it shouldn't be considered an occupied territory.
The International Court of Justice ruling of 9 July 2004 however found that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is territory held by Israel under military occupation, regardless of its status prior to it coming under Israeli occupation and the Fourth Geneva convention applies de jure.Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, see paragraphs 90-101 and p.5 The international community regards the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) as territories occupied by Israel.Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability Amnesty International. 19 January 2009.

===Political status===

The future status of the West Bank, together with the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean shore, has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, although the current Road Map for Peace, proposed by the "Quartet" comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel (see also proposals for a Palestinian state).  However, the "Road Map" states that in the first phase, Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel, whereas Israel must dismantle outposts.  Since neither condition has been met since the Road Map was "accepted",  by all sides, final negotiations have not yet begun on major political differences.
The Palestinian Authority believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation, and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule. The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip Israeli-occupied territories. The United States State Department also refers to the territories as occupied.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3464.htm |title=Jordan (03/08) |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/t/pm/64711.htm |title=Israel |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90212.htm#OT |title=Israel and the Occupied Territories |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] Many Israelis and their supporters prefer the term disputed territories, because they claim part of the territory for themselves, and state the land has not, in 2000  years, been sovereign.

Retrieved 14 October 2012. The area of West Bank is landlocked; highlands are main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers.
There are few natural resources in the area except the highly arable land, which comprises 27% of the land area of the region. It is mostly used as permanent pastures (32% of arable land) and seasonal agricultural uses (40%). Forests and woodland comprise just 1%, with no permanent crops.

===Climate===

The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes the Judean Desert and the shoreline of the Dead Sea - both with dry and hot climate.

===Political Geography===

====Palestinian administration====

The 1993 Oslo Accords declared the final status of the West Bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership. Following these interim accords, Israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the West Bank, which was divided into three administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords:
Area A, 2.7%, full civil control of the Palestinian Authority, comprises Palestinian towns, and some rural areas away from Israeli settlements in the north (between Jenin, Nablus, Tubas, and Tulkarm), the south (around Hebron), and one in the center south of Salfit.[tpl]cite web | last = Gvirtzman  | first = Haim  | title = Maps of Israeli Interests in Judea and Samaria Determining the Extent of the Additional Withdrawals | date = 8 February 1998  | url = http://www.biu.ac.il/Besa/books/maps.htm  | accessdate =1 September 2008[/tpl] Area B, 25.2%, adds other populated rural areas, many closer to the center of the West Bank. Area C contains all the Israeli settlements, roads used to access the settlements, buffer zones (near settlements, roads, strategic areas, and Israel), and almost all of the Jordan Valley and the Judean Desert.
Areas A and B are themselves divided among 227 separate areas (199 of which are smaller than [tpl]convert|2|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us[/tpl]) that are separated from one another by Israeli-controlled Area C.

This was never done.Ron Pundak 'Decoding Bibi's West Bank agenda,' at Haaretz, 3 August 2012.
According to B'tselem, while the vast majority of the Palestinian population lives in areas A and B, the vacant land available for construction in dozens of villages and towns across the West Bank is situated on the margins of the communities and defined as area C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Publications/Summaries/200205_Land_Grab.asp |title=B'Tselem – Publications – Land Grab: Israel's Settlement Policy in the West Bank, May 2002 |publisher=Btselem.org |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl]
Less than 1% of area C is designated for use by Palestinians, who are also unable to build in their own existing villages in area C due to Israeli authorities' restrictions.
An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2007 found that approximately 40% of the West Bank was taken up by Israeli infrastructure. The infrastructure, consisting of settlements, the barrier, military bases and closed military areas, Israeli declared nature reserves and the roads that accompany them is off-limits or tightly controlled to Palestinians.
In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights published a report that found that Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an “almost systematic campaign” of human rights abuse by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces of the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.[tpl]cite web|last=Mcquaid |first=Elwood |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224143 |title='PA bans journalists from reporting human rights abuses' |work=Jerusalem Post  |accessdate=31 July 2011[/tpl]

====Areas annexed by Israel====

Through the Jerusalem Law, Israel extended its administrative control over East Jerusalem. This has often been interpreted as tantamount to an official annexation, though Ian Lustick, in reviewing the legal status of Israeli measures, has argued that no such annexation ever took place. The Palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status. Rejecting the Jerusalem Law, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 478, declaring that the law was "null and void". Although permanent residents are permitted, if they wish, to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship, most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons. There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed to Israel after its capture in 1967. The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason; however, historians and analysts have established a variety of such, most of them demographic. Among those most commonly cited have been:

====Israeli settlements====

As of December 2010, 327,750 Israelis live in the 121 settlements in the West Bank officially recognised by the Israeli government, 192,000 Israelis live in settlements in East Jerusalem. There are approximately 100 further settlement outposts which are not officially recognized by the Israeli government and are illegal under Israeli law, but have been provided with infrastructure, water, sewage, and other services by the authorities.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2DF163CF93AA35750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Israeli Report Condemns Support for Settlement Outposts |first=Steve |last=Erlanger |date=9 March 2005 |work=New York Times [/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Brulliard|first=Karin|title=Israel legalizes three West Bank outposts|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-legalizes-three-settlement-outposts/2012/04/24/gIQAbpfieT_story.html|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=24 April 2012[/tpl]

The UN Security Council has issued several non-binding resolutions addressing the issue of the settlements.  Typical of these is UN Security Council resolution 446 which states the practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity, and it calls on Israel as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/ba123cded3ea84a5852560e50077c2dc |title=UNSC Resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 May 2011[/tpl]

====Palestinian outposts====

The Haaretz published on December 2005 about demolition of Palestinian outposts in Bil'in,IDF completes evacuation of Bil'in 'outpost' Some 150 troops break into caravan built near West Bank village to protest construction of separation fence.  the demolitions sparked a political debate as according to PeaceNow it was a double standard ("After what happened today in Bil'in, there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction" credited to Michael Sfard).
In January 2012, the European Union approved the "Area C and Palestinian state building" report. The report said Palestinian presence in Area C has been continuously undermined by Israel and that state building efforts in Area C of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the EU were of "utmost importance in order to support the creation of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state".

====West Bank barrier====

The barrier generally runs along or near the 1949 Jordanian-Israeli armistice/Green Line, but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Jewish settlements in the West Bank such as East Jerusalem, Ariel, Gush Etzion, Immanuel, Karnei Shomron, Givat Ze'ev, Oranit, and Maale Adumim.

====Administrative divisions====

=====Palestinian Governorates=====

After the signing of the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into 11 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority. Since 2007 there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority, one based in the West Bank and one based in the Gaza Strip.

=====Israeli administrative districts=====

The West Bank is further divided into 8 administrative regions: Menashe (Jenin area), HaBik'a (Jordan Valley), Shomron (Shechem area, known in Arabic as Nablus), Efrayim (Tulkarm area), Binyamin (Ramallah/al-Bireh area), Maccabim (Maccabim area), Etzion (Bethlehem area) and Yehuda (Hebron area).

==Economy==

The economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed, with unemployment rates constantly over 20% since 2000 (19% in the West Bank in first half of 2013).[tpl]cite web |url= http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18836847/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy |title= West Bank and Gaza - Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy|author=World Bank |website= |publisher=World Bank, Washington DC |accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2013|quote=Consequently, unemployment rates have remained very high in the Palestinian territories...After initial post-Oslo rates of about 9 percent in the mid-1990s, unemployment rose to 28 percent of the labor force in 2000 with the onset of the second intifada and the imposition of severe movement and access restrictions; it has remained high ever since and is currently about 22 percent. What is more, almost 24 percent of the workforce is employed by the PA, an uncommonly high proportion that reflects the lack of dynamism in the private sector.[/tpl]

===Consequences of occupation===

The main reason for economic depression is the Israeli occupation.
According to a 2007 World Bank report, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank has destroyed the Palestinian economy, in violation of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access. All major roads (with a total length of 700 km) are basically off-limits to Palestinians, making it impossible to do normal business. Economic recovery would reduce Palestinian dependence on international aid by one billion dollars per year.Movement and access restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and inefficiency in the Palestinian economy. World Bank Technical Team. 9 May 2007.
A more comprehensive 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce USD 2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some USD 800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35%.

==Demographics==

In December 2007, an official Census conducted by the Palestinian Authority found that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank (including  East Jerusalem) was 2,345,000.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/we.html#People CIA Factbook| West Bank| People However, the World Bank and American-Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a 32% discrepancy between first-grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)’ 2007 projections,THE PALESTINIAN CENSUS – SMOKE & MIRRORS, Independent Media Review Analysis, 11 February 2008 with questions also raised about the PCBS’ growth assumptions for the period 1997–2003.The Million Person Gap: The Arab Population in the West Bank and Gaza, Mideast Security and Policy Studies No. 65, February 2006

There are also small ethnic groups, such as the Samaritans living in and around Nablus, numbering in the hundreds.
As of October 2007, around 23,000 Palestinians in the West Bank work in Israel every day with another 9,200 working in Israeli settlements. In addition, around 10,000 Palestinian traders from the West Bank are allowed to travel every day into Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g7NNG7m5AEfoCjIspXI7lya2LTFg |title=Israel labour laws apply to Palestinian workers |publisher=Google |date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=3 October 2010[/tpl]
In 2008, approximately 30% of Palestinians or 754,263 persons living in the West Bank were refugees or descendants of refugees from villages and towns located in what became Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, according to UNRWA statistics. A 2011 EU report noted that between 200,000 and 320,000 Palestinians used to live in the Jordan Valley, most of which is in Area C, in 1967, but demolition of Palestinian homes and prevention of new buildings has seen the number drop to 56,000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/24/114879 |title=EU ministers look to Israeli grab of Palestinian farmland |author=Andrew Rettman |date=13 January 2012 |newspaper=EUobserver |accessdate=29 January 2012[/tpl] In a similar period, the Jewish population in Area C has grown from 1,200 to 310,000.

===Major population centers===

The most densely populated part of the region is a mountainous spine, running north-south, where the cities of Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, al-Bireh, Jenin, Bethlehem, Hebron and Yattah are located as well as the Israeli settlements of Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim and Beitar Illit. Ramallah, although relatively mid in population compared to other major cities as Hebron, Nablus and Jenin, serves as an economic and political center for the Palestinians. Near Ramallah the new city of Rawabi is under construction.Palestinian city of Rawabi to serve 'nation in the making'. Jerusalem Post, 11 May 2011UN chief says time running out for peace deal.

Modi'in Illit, Qalqilyah and Tulkarm are in the low foothills adjacent to the Israeli Coastal Plain, and  Jericho and  Tubas are situated in the Jordan Valley, north of the Dead Sea.

===Religion===

The population of the West Bank is 75% Muslim while 17% is Jewish. The remaining 8% are Christians and others.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/we.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=22 May 2011[/tpl]

==Transportation and communication==

===Roads===

The West Bank has [tpl]convert|5147|km|mi|-0|abbr=on[/tpl] of roads, all of which are paved.
Transportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted, and travel times can be inordinate; the Palestinian

Israeli restrictions were tightened in 2007.
[tpl]As of|2007|8[/tpl], a divided highway is currently under construction that will pass through the West Bank. The highway has a concrete wall dividing the two sides, one designated for Israeli vehicles, the other for Palestinian. The wall is designed to allow Palestinians to pass north-south through Israeli-held land and facilitate the building of additional Jewish settlements in the Jerusalem neighborhood.Erlanger, Steven.

[tpl]As of|2012|2[/tpl], a plan for 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry. The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron. Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She'an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction. The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-draws-plan-for-475-kilometer-rail-network-in-west-bank-1.414976|title=Israel draws plan for 475-kilometer rail network in West Bank|publisher=haaretz|date= February 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012[/tpl]

===Airports===

The only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah, but it has been closed since 2001.

===Telecom===

The Palestinian Paltel telecommunication companies provide communication services such as landline, cellular network and Internet in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Dialling code +970 is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories. Until 2007, the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by Jawwal. A new mobile operator for the territories launched in 2009 under the name of Wataniya Telecom. The number of Internet users increased from 35,000 in 2000 to 356,000 in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/me/ps.htm |title=Palestine Internet Usage and Telecommunications Report |publisher=Internetworldstats.com|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl]

===Radio and television===

The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on 675 kHz; numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation. Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV, and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread. Recently, PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses. Israel's cable television company HOT, satellite television provider (DBS) Yes, AM and FM radio broadcast stations and public television broadcast stations all operate. Broadband internet service by Bezeq's ADSL and by the cable company are available as well.
The Al-Aqsa Voice broadcasts from Dabas Mall in Tulkarem at 106.7 FM. The Al-Aqsa TV station shares these offices.

==Higher education==

Seven universities are operating in the West Bank:
Most universities in the West Bank have politically active student bodies, and elections of student council officers are normally along party affiliations. Although the establishment of the universities was initially allowed by the Israeli authorities, some were sporadically ordered closed by the Israeli Civil Administration during the 1970s and 1980s to prevent political activities and violence against the IDF. Some universities remained closed by military order for extended periods during years immediately preceding and following the first Palestinian Intifada, but have largely remained open since the signing of the Oslo Accords despite the advent of the Al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada) in 2000.
The founding of Palestinian universities has greatly increased education levels among the population in the West Bank. According to a Birzeit University study, the percentage of Palestinians choosing local universities as opposed to foreign institutions has been steadily increasing; as of 1997, 41% of Palestinians with bachelor degrees had obtained them from Palestinian institutions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.birzeit.edu/dsp/research/publications/2002/49e.pdf | title=Education and Human Development| publisher=Birzeit University|year= 2002|format=PDF |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] According to UNESCO, Palestinians are one of the most highly educated groups in the Middle East "despite often difficult circumstances".[tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17238&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO | Education – Palestinian Authority |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] The literacy rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) is 94,6% for 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Illiteracy_2010E.pdf|title=On the Eve of the International Illiteracy day, 8th of September|publisher=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics| date=7 September 2010|accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl]
