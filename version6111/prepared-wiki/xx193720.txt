==Structure==

Benzamil is a benzyl group-containing analog of amiloride. Like amiloride, it is a guanidinium group-containing pyrazine derivative.

==Mechanism of action==

Benzamil is closely related to amiloride. By adding the benzyl group to the nitrogen of the guanidinium group the activity is increased several hundredfold.[ref]

Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) thereby inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys (this mechanism is the same for triamterene). This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium.
