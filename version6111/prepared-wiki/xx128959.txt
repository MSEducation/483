==Managerial career==

Cunningham moved to Newcastle United in 1928, becoming the then oldest player to make his debut in the English football League at the age of thirty-eight. He began his Newcastle career as player/manager and then went on to become full-time manager of the club after retiring from playing. Technically, he was the first true manager of the club, as his predecessor Frank Watt had no control over team selection.
He guided the club to FA Cup success in 1932 after beating Arsenal 2–1 in the final. However the club was also relegated to the Second Division whilst he was at the helm. Cunningham eventually left the club in 1935. He is remembered as a moderately successful manager of the club, having won 105 games out of 251.
After his time with Newcastle, he returned to Scotland where he managed Dundee between 1937–1940 before becoming a sports writer after World War II.
