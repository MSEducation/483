Iraq borders Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.  Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring [tpl]convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] on the northern Persian Gulf. The capital city, Baghdad is in the center-east of the country. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run through the center of Iraq, flowing from northwest to southeast. These provide Iraq with agriculturally capable land and contrast with the steppe and desert landscape that covers most of Western Asia.
Iraq has been known by the Greek toponym 'Mesopotamia' (Land between the rivers) and has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/top10_iraq_battles.html |title=Top 10 Battles for the Control of Iraq |publisher=Livescience.com |accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] Iraq is home to two of the world's holiest places among Shias: Najaf and Karbala.On Point: The United States Army In Operation Iraqi Freedom – Page 265, Gregory Fontenot – 2004
Iraq's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of Sèvres. Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction) from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion led by the United States of America including multinational forces, the Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held. The American presence in Iraq ended in 2011.[tpl]cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/17/world/meast/iraq-troops-leave/index.html|title=Deadly Iraq war ends with exit of last U.S. troops |last=Basu |first=Moni |date=2011-12-18 |work=CNN.com |accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl]

==Name==

The Arabic name [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]big| العراق [/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|al-ʿIrāq[/tpl] has been in use since before the 6th century. There are several suggested origins for the name. One dates to the Sumerian city of Uruk (Biblical Hebrew Erech) and is thus ultimately of Sumerian origin, as Uruk was the Akkadian name for the Sumerian city of [tpl]lang|sux-Latn|Urug[/tpl], containing the Sumerian word for "city", UR.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=iraq |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=1979-12-10 |accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Halloran|first=John A.|title=Sumerian Lexicon|url=http://sumerian.org/sumerlex.htm|year=2000|quote=The name of the very ancient city of URUK- City of Gilgamesh is made up from the UR-city and UK- thought to mean existence (a-ku, a-Ki & a-ko.

==History==

===Ancient Iraq===

The "Cradle of Civilization", is a common term for the area comprising modern Iraq as it was home to the earliest known civilization, the Sumerian civilization, which arose in the fertile Tigris-Euphrates river valley of southern Iraq in the Chalcolithic (Ubaid period). It was here in the late 4th millennium BC, that the world's first writing system and recorded history itself were born. The Sumerian civilization flourished for over 3,000 years[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] and was succeeded by the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC. Over two centuries of Akkadian dominance was followed by a Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC. An Elamite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Third Dynasty of Ur to an end. By the 21st century BC, a new Akkadian civilization, Assyria, had risen to dominance in northern Iraq, and by the 19th century BC a contemporaneous Amorite state, Babylonia, had formed in southern Iraq.
Iraq was to be dominated by the Assyrians and Babylonians for the next 14 centuries, and under the respective Assyrian and Babylonian empire of Shamshi-Adad I and Hammurabi in the 19th and 18th centuries BC, the Middle Assyrian Empire of 1365–1053 BC and the Neo Assyrian Empire of 911–605 BC, and the final Babylonian empire of 620–539 BC Iraq became a center of world power. The Neo Assyrian Empire in particular put Iraq at the heart of a massive empire stretching from the Caucasus to Egypt and Arabia, and from Cyprus to Persia.
In the 6th century BC, Cyrus the Great of neighbouring Persia defeated the Neo-Babylonian Empire at the Battle of Opis and Iraq was subsumed into the Achaemenid Empire for nearly two centuries. In the late 4th century BC, Alexander the Great conquered the region, putting it under Hellenistic Seleucid rule for over two centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html |title=Seleucia on the Tigris |publisher=Umich.edu |date=1927-12-29 |accessdate=2011-06-19[/tpl] The Parthians (247 BC – 224 AD) from Persia conquered the region during the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia (r. 171–138 BC). From Syria, the Romans invaded western parts of the region several times. Christianity began to take hold in Iraq (particularly in Assyria) between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and Assyria became a center of the Church of the East. The Sassanids of Persia under Ardashir I destroyed the Parthian Empire and conquered the region in 224 AD. The region was thus a province of the Sassanid Empire for over four centuries, until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the mid-7th century, although a number of indigenous Neo Assyrian states evolved during the Parthian era, such as Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra.

===Middle Ages===

The Arab Islamic conquest in the mid 7th century AD established Islam in Iraq, and saw a large influx of Arabs and also Kurds. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, the prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali moved his capital to Kufa when he became the fourth caliph. The Umayyad Caliphate ruled the province of Iraq from Damascus in the 7th century. (However, eventually there was a separate, independent Caliphate of Córdoba.)
The Abbasid Caliphate built the city of Baghdad in the 8th century as their capital, and it became the leading metropolis of the Arab and Muslim world for five centuries. Baghdad was the largest multicultural city of the Middle Ages, peaking at a population of more than a million,[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2011-06-19[/tpl] and was the centre of learning during the Islamic Golden Age. The Mongols destroyed the city during the siege of Baghdad in the 13th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/learning/conclusion.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600: The Arts, Learning, and Knowledge (Conclusion) |publisher=Acs.ucalgary.ca [/tpl]
In 1257, Hulagu Khan amassed an unusually large army, a significant portion of the Mongol Empire's forces, for the purpose of conquering Baghdad. When they arrived at the Islamic capital, Hulagu Khan demanded surrender but the last Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'sim refused. This angered Hulagu, and, consistent with Mongol strategy of discouraging resistance, Baghdad was decimated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html |title=Battuta's Travels: Part Three – Persia and Iraq |publisher=Sfusd.k12.ca.us |accessdate=2010-04-21| archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html| archivedate = April 23, 2008[/tpl] Estimates of the number of dead range from 200,000 to a million.[tpl]cite web|last=Frazier |first=Ian |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/25/050425fa_fact4?currentPage=4 |title=Annals of history: Invaders: Destroying Baghdad |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2005-04-25 |page=4 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]
The Mongols destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate and Baghdad's House of Wisdom, which contained countless precious and historical documents. The city has never regained its status as a major center of culture and influence. Some historians believe that the Mongol invasion destroyed much of the irrigation infrastructure that had sustained Mesopotamia for millennia.

===Ottoman Iraq===

During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Black Sheep Turkmen ruled the area now known as Iraq. In 1466, the White Sheep Turkmen defeated the Black Sheep and took control. In the 16th century, most of the territory of present-day Iraq came under the control of Ottoman Empire as the eyalet of Baghdad. Throughout most of the period of Ottoman rule (1533–1918) the territory of present-day Iraq was a battle zone between the rival regional empires and tribal alliances. The Safavid dynasty of Iran briefly asserted their hegemony over Iraq in the periods of 1508–1533 and 1622–1638.
By the 17th century, the frequent conflicts with the Safavids had sapped the strength of the Ottoman Empire and had weakened its control over its provinces. The nomadic population swelled with the influx of bedouins from Najd, in the Arabian Peninsula. Bedouin raids on settled areas became impossible to curb.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/iraq/18.htm |title=Iraq – The Ottoman Period, 1534–1918 |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2011-06-19[/tpl]

In 1831, the Ottomans managed to overthrow the Mamluk regime and imposed their direct control over Iraq. The population of Iraq decreased from around 30 millions around 800 AD to under 5 million by the early 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.valerieyule.com.au/poprus.htm |title=Population crises and cycles in history A review of the book Population Crises and Population cycles by Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell. ISBN 0-9504066-5-1 |publisher=valerieyule.com.au[/tpl]
During World War I, the Ottomans sided with Germany and the Central Powers. In the Mesopotamian campaign against the Central Powers, British forces invaded the country and initially suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Turkish army during the Siege of Kut (1915–1916). However, subsequent to this the British began to gain the upper hand, and were further aided by the support of local Arabs and Assyrians. In 1916, the British and French made a plan for the post-war division of Western Asia under the Sykes-Picot Agreement.p.8[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] British forces regrouped and captured Baghdad in 1917, and defeated the Ottomans. An armistice was signed in 1918.
During World War I the Ottomans were defeated and driven from much of the area by the United Kingdom during the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The British lost 92,000 soldiers in the Mesopotamian campaign. Ottoman losses are unknown but the British captured a total of 45,000 prisoners of war. By the end of 1918 the British had deployed 410,000 men in the area, of which 112,000 were combat troops.

===British Mandate and Kingdom===

On 11 November 1920 Iraq became a League of Nations mandate under British control with the name "State of Iraq". The British established the Hashemite king, Faisal, who had been forced out of Syria by the French, as their client ruler. Likewise, British authorities selected Sunni Arab elites from the region for appointments to government and ministry offices.[tpl]Specify|date=April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Tripp|first=Charles|title=A History of Iraq|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WR-Cnw1UCJEC|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52900-6[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Faced with spiralling costs and influenced by the public protestations of war hero T. E. Lawrence in The Times, Britain replaced Arnold Wilson in October 1920 with new Civil Commissioner Sir Percy Cox. Cox managed to quell the rebellion, yet was also responsible for implementing the fateful policy of close cooperation with Iraq's Sunni minority.[tpl]cite book|author1=Liam Anderson|author2=Gareth Stansfield|title=The Future of Iraq: Dictatorship, Democracy, Or Division?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4JMHAI1C91gC&pg=PA6|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-7144-9|page=6|quote=Sunni control over the levels of power and the distribution of the spoils of office has had predictable consequences- a simmering resentment on the part of the Shi'a...[/tpl] The institution of slavery was abolished in the 1920s.
Britain granted independence to the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, on the urging of King Faisal, though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. King Ghazi ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. Ghazi was followed by his underage son, Faisal II. 'Abd al-Ilah served as Regent during Faisal's minority.
On 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and members of the Golden Square staged a coup d'état and overthrew the government of 'Abd al-Ilah. During the subsequent Anglo-Iraqi War, the United Kingdom invaded Iraq for fear that the Rashid Ali government might cut oil supplies to Western nations because of his links to the Axis powers. The war started on 2 May and an armistice was signed 31 May.
A military occupation followed the restoration of the pre-coup government of the Hashemite monarchy. The occupation ended on 26 October 1947. The rulers during the occupation and the remainder of the Hashemite monarchy were Nuri as-Said, the autocratic Prime Minister, who also ruled from 1930–1932, and 'Abd al-Ilah, the former Regent who now served as an adviser to King Faisal II.

===Republic and Ba'athist Iraq===

In 1958 a coup d'etat known as the 14 July Revolution led to the end of the monarchy. Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim assumed power, but he was overthrown by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in a February 1963 coup. After his death in 1966 he was succeeded by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, who was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in 1968. Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr became the first Ba'ath President of Iraq but then the movement gradually came under the control of General Saddam Hussein, who acceded to the presidency and control of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), then Iraq's supreme executive body, in July 1979.
After the success of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, President Saddam Hussein invaded Iran a year and a half later, initiating the Iran–Iraq War (or First Persian Gulf War). The war ended in stalemate in 1988, largely due to foreign support for Iraq

===US-led invasion and aftermath===

On March 20, 2003, a United States-organized coalition invaded Iraq, with the stated reason that Iraq had failed to abandon its nuclear and chemical weapons development program in violation of U.N. Resolution 687. These claims were based on documents that were provided by the CIA and the government of the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/bushs_16_words_on_iraq_uranium.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100305071446/http://www.factcheck.org/bushs_16_words_on_iraq_uranium.html |archivedate=2010-03-05 |title=Bush's "16 Words" on Iraq & Uranium: He May Have Been Wrong But He Wasn't Lying |publisher=FactCheck.org |date=July 26, 2004[/tpl] However, no weapons of mass destruction have been found,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/07/usa.iraq1 | title=There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq | accessdate=2008-04-28 | last=Borger | first=Julian | date=2004-10-07 | publisher=Guardian Media Group | work=guardian.co.uk | location=London[/tpl] and the 2004 Duelfer Report found that all nuclear and chemical weapons research had ended by the mid-1990s.[tpl]cite news|title=John Simpson: 'The Iraq memories I can't rid myself of'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21829269|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2013-03-19[/tpl]

==Geography==

Iraq lies between latitudes 29° and 38° N, and longitudes 39° and 49° E (a small area lies west of 39°). Spanning [tpl]convert|437072|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it is the 58th-largest country in the world. It is comparable in size to the US state of California, and somewhat larger than Paraguay.
Iraq mainly consists of desert, but near the two major rivers (Euphrates and Tigris) are fertile alluvial plains, as the rivers carry about [tpl]convert|60000000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of silt annually to the delta. The north of the country is mostly composed of mountains; the highest point being at [tpl]convert|3611|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] point, unnamed on the map opposite, but known locally as Cheekah Dar (black tent). Iraq has a small coastline measuring [tpl]convert|58|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] along the Persian Gulf. Close to the coast and along the Shatt al-Arab (known as arvandrūd: اروندرود among Iranians) there used to be marshlands, but many were drained in the 1990s.

===Climate===

Most of Iraq has a hot arid climate with subtropical influence. Summer temperatures average above [tpl]convert|40|°C[/tpl] for most of the country and frequently exceed [tpl]convert|48|°C|1[/tpl]. Winter temperatures infrequently exceed [tpl]convert|21|°C|1[/tpl] with maxima roughly [tpl]convert|15|to|19|°C|°F|1[/tpl] and night-time lows [tpl]convert|2|to|5|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. Typically precipitation is low; most places receive less than [tpl]convert|250|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] annually, with maximum rainfall occurring during the winter months. Rainfall during the summer is extremely rare, except in the far north of the country. The northern mountainous regions have cold winters with occasional heavy snows, sometimes causing extensive flooding.

==Government and politics==

The federal government of Iraq is defined under the current Constitution as a democratic, federal parliamentary Islamic republic. The federal government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as numerous independent commissions. Aside from the federal government, there are regions (made of one or more governorates), governorates, and districts within Iraq with jurisdiction over various matters as defined by law.
The National Alliance is the main Shia parliamentary bloc, and was established as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law Coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance. The Iraqi National Movement is led by Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis. The party has a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of its rivals. The Kurdistan List is dominated by two parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Masood Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Jalal Talabani. Both parties are secular and enjoy close ties with the West.[tpl]cite news|title=Guide to political groups in Iraq|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11730332|publisher=BBC News|date=11 November 2010[/tpl]

===Human rights===

Relations between Iraq and its Kurdish population have been sour in recent history, especially with Saddam Hussein's genocidal campaign against them in the 1980s. After uprisings during the early 90s, many Kurds fled their homeland and no-fly zones were established in northern Iraq to prevent more conflicts. Despite historically poor relations, some progress has been made, and Iraq elected its first Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, in 2005. Furthermore, Kurdish is now an official language of Iraq alongside Arabic according to Article 4 of the constitution.[tpl]sfn|Iraqi Constitution|loc=Article 4[/tpl]
LGBT rights in Iraq remain limited. Although decriminalized, homosexuality remains stigmatized in Iraqi society. Targeting people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation is not uncommon and is usually carried out in the name of family honor. People who dress in emo style are mistakenly associated with homosexuality and may suffer the same fate.[tpl]cite news|last=Graff |first=Peter |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/12/us-iraq-gays-emo-idUSBRE82B0VZ20120312 |title=Fear as death squads hunt Iraq's gays and emos |publisher=Reuters |date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] A BBC article published in 2009, which includes interviews of homosexual and transgendered Iraqis, suggests that LGBT people were less subject to violence under Hussein's regime.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8133639.stm |title=Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Iraq is composed of eighteen governorates (or provinces) (Arabic: muhafadhat (singular muhafadhah); Kurdish: پارێزگا Pârizgah). The governorates are subdivided into districts (or qadhas). Iraqi Kurdistan (Erbil, Duhok, Sulaymaniyah and Halabja) is the only legally defined region within Iraq, with its own government and quasi-official army Peshmerga.

==Economy==

Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. The lack of development in other sectors has resulted in 18%–30% unemployed and a depressed per capita GDP of $4,000. Public sector employment accounted for nearly 60% of full-time employment in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Unemployment Threatens Democracy in Iraq|url=https://www.inma-iraq.com/sites/default/files/10_unemployment_threatens_democracy_2011jan00.pdf|publisher=USAID Iraq|date=January 2011[/tpl] The oil export industry, which dominates the Iraqi economy, generates very little employment. Currently only a modest percentage of women (the highest estimate for 2011 was 22%) participate in the labour force.
Prior to US occupation, Iraq's centrally planned economy prohibited foreign ownership of Iraqi businesses, ran most large industries as state-owned enterprises, and imposed large tariffs to keep out foreign goods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraqs-economy-past-present-future |title=Iraq's economy: Past, present, future |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2003-06-03 |accessdate=2013-01-07[/tpl] After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority quickly began issuing many binding orders privatizing Iraq's economy and opening it up to foreign investment.
On November 20, 2004, the Paris Club of creditor nations agreed to write off 80% ($33 billion) of Iraq's $42 billion debt to Club members. Iraq's total external debt was around $120 billion at the time of the 2003 invasion, and had grown another $5 billion by 2004. The debt relief will be implemented in three stages: two of 30% each and one of 20%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&storyID=6874713 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20041121210518/http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&storyID=6874713 |archivedate=2004-11-21 |title=G7, Paris Club Agree on Iraq Debt Relief |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-11-21 |accessdate=2011-06-19[/tpl]

According to the Overseas Development Institute, international NGOs face challenges in carrying out their mission, leaving their assistance "piecemeal and largely conducted undercover, hindered by insecurity, a lack of coordinated funding, limited operational capacity and patchy information". International NGOs have been targeted and during the first 5 years, 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted.

==Culture==

Public holidays in Iraq include Republic Day on July 14 and the National Day on October 3.

===Music===

Iraq is known primarily for its rich maqam heritage which has been passed down orally by the masters of the maqam in an unbroken chain of transmission leading up to the present. The maqam al-Iraqi is considered to be the most noble and perfect form of maqam. Al-maqam al-Iraqi is the collection of sung poems written either in one of the sixteen meters of classical Arabic or in Iraqi dialect (Zuhayri).[tpl]cite book |last=Touma |first=Habib Hassan |authorlink=Habib Hassan Touma |title=The Music of the Arabs |isbn=1574670816 |year=1996 |publisher=Amadeus Press[/tpl] This form of art is recognized by UNESCO as “an intangible heritage of humanity”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00076 |title=The Iraqi Maqam[/tpl]
Early in the 20th century, many of the most prominent musicians in Iraq were Jewish.[tpl]cite web |title=Jewish Role in Iraqi Music |last=Kojaman |url=http://www.dangoor.com/72page42.html |accessdate=2007-09-09[/tpl] In 1936, Iraq Radio was established with an ensemble made up entirely of Jews, with the exception of the percussion player. At the nightclubs of Baghdad, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists, while the same format with a ney and cello were used on the radio.
The most famous singer of the 1930s–1940s was perhaps the Jew Salima Pasha (later Salima Murad).[tpl]cite news |last=Manasseh |first=Sara |publication-date=February 2004 |title=An Iraqi samai of Salim Al-Nur |periodical=Newsletter |publication-place=London |publisher=Arts and Humanities Research Board Research Centre for Cross-Cultural Music and Dance Performance |issue=3 |page=7 |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-09 |format=PDF |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20051202084829/http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf| archivedate = December 2, 2005[/tpl] The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time since public performance by women was considered shameful, and most female singers were recruited from brothels.
The most famous early composer from Iraq was Ezra Aharon, an oud player, while the most prominent instrumentalist was Daoud Al-Kuwaiti. Daoud and his brother Saleh formed the official ensemble for the Iraqi radio station and were responsible for introducing the cello and ney into the traditional ensemble.

===Art and architecture===

Important cultural institutions in the capital include the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra – rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the Occupation of Iraq but have since returned to normal. The National Theatre of Iraq was looted during the 2003 invasion, but efforts are underway to restore it. The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions.
Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the Academy of Music, Institute of Fine Arts and the Music and Ballet school Baghdad. Baghdad also features a number of museums including the National Museum of Iraq – which houses the world's largest and finest collection of artifacts and relics of Ancient Iraqi civilizations; some of which were stolen during the Occupation of Iraq.
The capital, Ninus or Nineveh, was taken by the Medes under Cyaxares, and some 200 years after Xenophon passed over its site, then mere mounds of earth. It remained buried until 1845, when Botta and Layard discovered the ruins of the Assyrian cities. The principal remains are those of Khorsabad, [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] N.E. of Mosul; of Nimroud, supposed to be the ancient Calah; and of Kouyunjik, in all probability the ancient Nineveh. In these cities are found fragments of several great buildings which seem to have been palace-temples. They were constructed chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and all that remains of them is the lower part of the walls, decorated with sculpture and paintings, portions of the pavements, a few indications of the elevation, and some interesting works connected with the drainage.

===Media===

After the end of the full state control in 2003, there were a period of significant growth in the broadcast media in Iraq. Immediately, and the ban on satellite dishes is no longer in place, and by mid-2003, according to a BBC report, there were 20 radio stations from 0.15 to 17 television stations owned by Iraqis, and 200 Iraqi newspapers owned and operated. Significantly, there have been many of these newspapers in numbers disproportionate to the population of their locations. For example, in Najaf, which has a population of 300,000, is being published more than 30 newspapers and distributed.
Iraqi media expert and author of a number of reports on this subject, Ibrahim Al Marashi, identifies four stages of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 where they had been taking the steps that have significant effects on the way for the later of the Iraqi media since then. Stages are: pre-invasion preparation, and the war and the actual choice of targets, the first post-war period, and a growing insurgency and hand over power to the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.[tpl]cite journal|last=Al-Marashi|first=Ibrahim|title=Toward an Understanding of Media Policy and Media Systems in Iraq|year=2007|series=Center for Global Communications Studies, Occasional Paper Series|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=asc_papers[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

Iraqi cuisine has a long history going back some 10,000 years – to the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians and Ancient Persians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/3592 |title=Foods of Iraq: Enshrined With A Long History |publisher=ThingsAsian |accessdate=2011-06-19[/tpl] Tablets found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals – the first cookbooks in the world. Ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia, was home to many sophisticated and highly advanced civilizations, in all fields of knowledge – including the culinary arts. However, it was in the medieval era when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith. Today the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Turkey, Iran and the Greater Syria area.
Some characteristic ingredients of Iraqi cuisine include – vegetables such as aubergine, tomato, okra, onion, potato, courgette, garlic, peppers and chilli, cereals such as rice, bulgur wheat and barley, pulses and legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and cannellini, fruits such as dates, raisins, apricots, figs, grapes, melon, pomegranate and citrus fruits, especially lemon and lime.
Similarly with other countries of Western Asia, chicken and especially lamb are the favourite meats. Most dishes are served with rice – usually Basmati, grown in the marshes of southern Iraq. Bulgur wheat is used in many dishes – having been a staple in the country since the days of the Ancient Assyrians.

===Sport===

Football is the most popular sport in Iraq. Football is a considerable uniting factor in Iraq following years of war and unrest. Basketball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding, boxing, kick boxing and tennis are also popular sports.
The Iraqi Football Association is the governing body of football in Iraq, controlling the Iraqi National Team and the Iraqi Premier League (also known as Dawri Al-Nokba). It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of FIFA since 1950 and the Asian Football Confederation since 1971. The Iraqi National Football Team were the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Champions after defeating Saudi Arabia in the final.

===Mobile phones===

Despite having mobile phones in the middle east since 1995, Iraqis were only able to use mobile phones in 2003. Mobile phones were banned under Saddam's rule and the punishment of owning or using a mobile phone could be death.

==Health==

In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 6.84% of the country's GDP. In 2008, there were 6.96 physicians and 13.92 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|title=Health|url=http://www.sesrtcic.org/oic-member-countries-infigures.php?c_code=24&cat_code=8|publisher=SESRIC[/tpl] The life expectancy at birth was 68.49 years in 2010, or 65.13 years for males and 72.01 years for females.[tpl]cite web|title=Demography|url=http://www.sesrtcic.org/oic-member-countries-infigures.php?c_code=24&cat_code=7|publisher=SESRIC[/tpl] This is down from a peak life expectancy of 71.31 years in 1996.[tpl]cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth, total (Iraq)|url=http://www.sesrtcic.org/oic-member-countries-linecharts.php?ind_code=12&c_code=24|publisher=SESRIC[/tpl]
Iraq had developed a centralized free health care system in the 1970s using a hospital based, capital-intensive model of curative care. The country depended on large-scale imports of medicines, medical equipment and even nurses, paid for with oil export income, according to a “Watching Brief” report issued jointly by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in July 2003.
Unlike other poorer countries, which focused on mass health care using primary care practitioners, Iraq developed a Westernized system of sophisticated hospitals with advanced medical procedures, provided by specialist physicians. The UNICEF/WHO report noted that prior to 1990, 97% of the urban dwellers and 71% of the rural population had access to free primary health care; just 2% of hospital beds were privately managed.

==Education==

The CIA World Factbook estimates that in 2000 the adult literacy rate was 84% for males and 64% for females, with UN figures suggesting a small fall in literacy of Iraqis aged 15–24 between 2000 and 2008, from 84.8% to 82.4%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656|work=Millennium Development Goals Indicators|title=Literacy rates of 15–24 years old, both sexes, percentage|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 January 2011[/tpl] The Coalition Provisional Authority undertook a complete reform of Iraq’s education system: Baathist ideology was removed from curricula and there were substantial increases in teacher salaries and training programs, which the Hussein regime neglected in the 1990s. In 2003 an estimated 80% of Iraq’s 15,000 school buildings needed rehabilitation and lacked basic sanitary facilities, and most schools lacked libraries and laboratories.
Education is mandatory only through the sixth grade, after which a national examination determines the possibility of continuing into the upper grades. Although a vocational track is available to those who do not pass the exam, few students elect that option because of its poor quality. Boys and girls generally attend separate schools beginning with seventh grade. In 2005 obstacles to further reform were poor security conditions in many areas, a centralized system that lacked accountability for teachers and administrators, and the isolation in which the system functioned for the previous 30 years. Few private schools exist. Prior to the occupation of 2003, some 240,000 persons were enrolled in institutions of higher education.
According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are the University of Dohuk (1717th worldwide), the University of Baghdad (3160th) and Babylon University (3946th).[tpl]cite web|title=Iraq|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw/Iraq|publisher=Ranking Web of Universities|accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl]
