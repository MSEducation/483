Such ochres were also used to paint their bodies for ceremonial purposes.
Modern Aboriginal artists continue the tradition, using modern materials in their artworks. Several styles of Aboriginal art have developed in modern times, including the watercolour paintings of the Hermannsburg School, and the acrylic Papunya Tula "dot art" movement. William Barak (c.1824–1903) was one of the last traditionally educated of the Wurundjeri-willam, people who come from the district now incorporating the city of Melbourne. He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the Ian Potter Centre of the National Gallery of Victoria and at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery. Margaret Preston (1875–1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. Albert Namatjira (1902–1959) is one of the most famous Australian artists and an Arrernte man. His landscapes inspired the Hermannsburg School of art. The works of Elizabeth Durack are notable for their fusion of Western and indigenous influences. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints – with styles such as that of the Western Desert Art Movement becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements.
The National Gallery of Australia exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the Torres Strait Islands who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/ATSIArt/Index.cfm |title=National Gallery of Australia |publisher=Nga.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]

===Literature===

By 1788, Indigenous Australians had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of Aborigines come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly. Early accounts by Dutch explorers and the English buccaneer William Dampier wrote of the "natives of New Holland" as being "barbarous savages", but by the time of Captain James Cook and First Fleet marine Watkin Tench (the era of Jean-Jacques Rousseau), accounts of Aborigines were more sympathetic and romantic: "these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans", wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.
Letters written by early Aboriginal leaders like Bennelong and Sir Douglas Nicholls are retained as treasures of Australian literature, as is the historic Yirrkala bark petitions of 1963 which is the first traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the Australian Parliament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=104 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl] David Unaipon (1872–1967) is credited as providing the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: Legendary Tales of the Aborigines; he is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: We Are Going (1964).[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/poetry/index.htm |title=Modern Australian poetry |publisher=Ministère de la culture [/tpl] Sally Morgan's novel My Place was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008) and Noel Pearson ("Up From the Mission", 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature.
The voices of Indigenous Australians are being increasingly noticed and include the playwright Jack Davis and Kevin Gilbert. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include Alexis Wright, Kim Scott, twice winner of the Miles Franklin award, Tara June Winch, in poetry Yvette Holt and in popular fiction Anita Heiss. Australian Aboriginal poetry – ranging from sacred to everyday – is found throughout the continent.Ronald M. Berndt has published traditional Aboriginal song-poetry in his book "Three Faces of Love", Nelson 1976. R.M.W. Dixon and M. Duwell have published two books dealing with sacred and everyday poetry: "The Honey Ant Men's Love Song" and "Little Eva at Moonlight Creek", University of Queensland Press, 1994.
Many notable works have been written by non-indigenous Australians on Aboriginal themes. Examples include the poems of Judith Wright; The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith by Thomas Keneally and the short story by David Malouf: "The Only Speaker of his Tongue".[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-contents.aspx?ID=12252 |title=Contents , The Literature of Australia , W.

Histories covering Indigenous themes include The Native Tribes of Central Australia by Spencer and Gillen, 1899; the diaries of Donald Thompson on the subject of the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land (c.1935–1943); Geoffrey Blainey (Triumph of the Nomads, 1975); Henry Reynolds (The Other Side of the Frontier, 1981); and Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008). Differing interpretations of Aboriginal history are also the subject of contemporary debate in Australia, notably between the essayists Robert Manne and Keith Windshuttle.

===Film===

Australian cinema has a long history and the ceremonies of Indigenous Australians were among the first subjects to be filmed in Australia – notably a film of Aboriginal dancers in Central Australia, shot by the anthropologist Baldwin Spencer in 1900.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120043b.htm |title=Spencer, Sir Walter Baldwin (1860–1929) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date=14 July 1929 |accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl]

In 2006, Rolf de Heer's Ten Canoes became the first major feature film to be shot in an indigenous language and the film was recognised at Cannes and elsewhere.

===Traditional recreation===

Though lost to history, many traditional forms of recreation were played and while these varied from tribe to tribe, there were often similarities.  It is an area of much recent research and interest.
Ball games were quite popular and played by tribes across Australia, as were games based on use of weapons.
There is extensive documented evidence of traditional football games being played.  Perhaps the most documented is a game popularly played by tribes in western Victorian regions of the Wimmera, Mallee and Millewa by the Djab wurrung, Jardwadjali and Jarijari people.  Known as Marn Grook, it was a type of kick and catch football game played with a ball made of possum hide, the existence of which was corroborated in accounts from European eyewitnesses and depicted in illustration.Kids play "kick to kick" −1850s style from abc.net.au  According to some accounts, it was played as far away as the Yarra Valley by the Wurundjeri people,Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp45 People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days, Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 ISBN 0-9577728-0-7 Gippsland by the Gunai people, and the Riverina in south-western New South Wales.

Recent research by Queensland human movements academics Ken Edwards and Sharon Louth points to a wide range of games including similar football games being played in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory.

==Population==

===Definition===

Over time Australia has used various means to determine membership of ethnic groups such as lineage, blood quantum, birth and self-determination. From 1869 until well into the 1970s, Indigenous children under 12 years of age, with 25% or less Aboriginal blood were considered "white" and were often removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments in order that they would have "a reasonable chance of absorption into the white community to which they rightly belong".[tpl]Cite book|title = The Aboriginals and Half-Castes of Central Australia and North Australia.|last = Bleakley|first = John William|publisher = Government Printer.|year = 1929|location = Melbourne|pages = 17|url = http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-vn4969615-p.pdf[/tpl] Grey areas in determination of ethnicity led to people of mixed ancestry being caught in the middle of divisive policies which often led to absurd situations:[tpl]cite book | last = Spencer | first = Stephen | year = 2006 | title = Race And Ethnicity: Culture, identity and representation | publisher = Routledge | location = Pg 33–34| isbn = 1-134-26639-1 [/tpl] In 1935, an Australian of part Indigenous descent left his home on a reserve to visit a nearby hotel where he was ejected for being Aboriginal. He returned home but was refused entry to the reserve because he was not Aboriginal. He attempted to remove his children from the reserve but was told he could not because they were Aboriginal. He then walked to the next town where he was arrested for being an Aboriginal vagrant and sent to the reserve there. During World War II he tried to enlist but was rejected because he was an Aborigine so he moved to another state where he enlisted as a non-Aborigine. After the end of the war he applied for a passport but was rejected as he was an Aborigine, he obtained an exemption under the Aborigines Protection Act but was now told he could no longer visit his relatives as he was not an Aborigine. He was later told he could not join the Returned Servicemens Club because he was an Aborigine. 
In 1983 the High Court of Australia[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/21.html?query=title(Commonwealth%20%20and%20.%20Tasmania%201983) Commonwealth v Tasmania HCA 21; (1983) 158 CLR 1 (1 July 1983). defined an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander as "a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives".
The ruling was a three-part definition comprising descent, self-identification and community identification. The first part – descent – was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where a lack of records to prove ancestry excluded some. Self- and community identification were more problematic as they meant that an Indigenous person separated from her or his community due to a family dispute could no longer identify as Aboriginal.
As a result there arose court cases throughout the 1990s where excluded people demanded that their Aboriginality be recognised. In 1995, Justice Drummond ruled "..either genuine self-identification as Aboriginal alone or Aboriginal communal recognition as such by itself may suffice, according to the circumstances." This contributed to an increase of 31% in the number of people identifying as Indigenous Australians in the 1996 census when compared to the 1991 census.[tpl]cite web | last = Greg Gardiner | first = Eleanor Bourke: | year = 2002 | title = Indigenous Populations, Mixed Discourses and Identities pdf | work=People and Place Volume 8 No 2 Monash University | url = http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv8n2/v8n2_5gardiner.pdf | accessdate =16 December 2009 [/tpl]
Judge Merkel in 1998 defined Aboriginal descent as technical rather than real – thereby eliminating a genetic requirement. This decision established that anyone can classify him or herself legally as an Aboriginal, provided he or she is accepted as such by his or her community.Kinship and Identity: Legal definitions of Aboriginality Australian Law Reform Commission

===Inclusion in the National Census===

As there is no formal procedure for any community to record acceptance, the primary method of determining Indigenous population is from self-identification on census forms.
Until 1967, official Australian population statistics excluded "full-blood aboriginal natives" in accordance with section 127 of the Australian Constitution, even though many such people were actually counted. The size of the excluded population was generally separately estimated. "Half-caste aboriginal natives" were shown separately up to the 1966 census, but since 1971 there has been no provision on the forms to differentiate 'full' from 'part' Indigenous or to identify non-Indigenous persons who are accepted by Indigenous communities but have no genetic descent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/LIBRARY/pubs/rn/2000-01/01RN18.htm |title=The Definition of Aboriginality |accessdate=5 February 2008 |author=John Gardiner-Garden |publisher=Parliament of Australia |work=Parliamentary Library |date=5 October 2000 [/tpl]
In the recent 2011 Census, there was 20% rise in people who identify as Aboriginal. One explanation for this is: "the definition being the way it is, it's quite elastic. You can find out that your great-great grandmother was Aboriginal and therefore under that definition you can identify. It's that person's right to identify so".."that's what explains the large increase."http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/episode/transcript/490/Aboriginal-or-not

===Demographics===

====State distribution and identification growth rate====

The Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005 census of Australian demographics showed that the Indigenous population had grown at twice the rate of the overall population since 1996 when the Indigenous population stood at 283,000. As of June 2001, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the total resident Indigenous population to be 458,520 (2.4% of Australia's total), 90% of whom identified as Aboriginal, 6% Torres Strait Islander and the remaining 4% being of dual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parentage. Much of the increase since 1996 can be attributed to greater numbers of people identifying themselves as Aboriginal or of Aboriginal descent. Changed definitions of aboriginality and positive discrimination via material benefits have been cited as contributing to a movement to indigenous identification.[tpl]cite web | last = Hughes | first = Helen | date = November 2008 | title = Who Are Indigenous Australians? | work=Quadrant | url = https://www.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2008/451/who-are-indigenous-australians | accessdate =16 December 2009 [/tpl]
In the 2006 Census, 407,700 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 29,512 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 17,811 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/a0dbf953e41d83d3ca257306000d514b!OpenDocument |title=2914.0.55.002–2006 Census of Population and Housing: Media Releases and Fact Sheets, 2006 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl] After adjustments for undercount, the indigenous population as of end June 2006 was estimated to be 517,200, representing about 2.5% of the population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/68AE74ED632E17A6CA2573D200110075?opendocument|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009[/tpl]
Based on Census data at 30 June 2006, the preliminary estimate of Indigenous resident population of Australia  was 517,200, broken down as follows:
The state with the largest total Indigenous population is New South Wales. Indigenous Australians constitute 2.2% of the overall population of the State. The Northern Territory has the largest Indigenous population in percentage terms for a State or Territory, with 31.6% of the population being Indigenous.
In all of the other states and territories, less than 4% of their total population identifies as Indigenous; Victoria has the lowest percentage at 0.6%.

====Urbanisation rate====

As of 2006 about 31% of the Indigenous population was living in 'major cities' (as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics/Australian Standard Geographical Classification) and another 45% in 'regional Australia', with the remaining 24% in remote areas. The populations in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales are more likely to be urbanised.Population Distribution, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006.

====Intermarriage rate====

The proportion of Aboriginal adults married (de facto or de jure) to non-Aboriginal spouses has increased to 74% according to the 2011 census,http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/Lookup/2077.0main+features72006-2011 up from 71% in 2006, 64% in 1996, 51% in 1991 and 46% in 1986. The census figures show there were more intermixed Aboriginal couples in capital cities: 87% in 2001 compared to 60% in rural and regional Australia.[tpl]cite journal|author=Birrell, R and J Hirst|year= 2002|title= Aboriginal Couples at the 2001 Census|journal= People and Place|volume= 10|issue=3|page=27[/tpl] It is reported that up to 88% of the offspring of mixed marriages subsequently self identify as Indigenous Australians.

==Groups and communities==

Throughout the history of the continent, there have been many different Aboriginal groups, each with its own individual language, culture, and belief structure.
At the time of British settlement, there were over 200 distinct languages.Australian Aboriginal languages. Encyclopædia Britannica Online
There are an indeterminate number of Indigenous communities, comprising several hundred groupings. Some communities, cultures or groups may be inclusive of others and alter or overlap; significant changes have occurred in the generations after colonisation.
The word 'community' is often used to describe groups identifying by kinship, language or belonging to a particular place or 'country'. A community may draw on separate cultural values and individuals can conceivably belong to a number of communities within Australia; identification within them may be adopted or rejected.
An individual community may identify itself by many names, each of which can have alternate English spellings. The largest Aboriginal communities – the Pitjantjatjara, the Arrernte, the Luritja and the Warlpiri – are all from Central Australia.
Indigenous 'communities' in remote Australia are typically small, isolated towns with basic facilities, on traditionally owned land. These communities have between 20 – 300 inhabitants and are often closed to outsiders for cultural reasons. The long term viability and resilience of Indigenous communities has been debated by scholars [tpl]cite journal|last1=Stafford Smith|first1=Mark|author2=Mark Morgan, Kurt Seemann|title=The 'viability' and resilience of communities and settlements in desert Australia|journal=Rangeland Journal |date=4 July 2007|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=RJ07048 |doi=10.1071/RJ07048 |pages=123 |deadurl=no |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] and continues to be a political issue receiving fluctuating media attention.
Tasmania
The Tasmanian Aboriginal population are thought to have first crossed into Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago via a land bridge between the island and the rest of mainland Australia during the last glacial period.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1086/203909 | last = Pardoe | first = Colin | year = 1991 | title = Isolation and Evolution in Tasmania | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27[/tpl] Estimates of the population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival, are in the range of 3,000 to 15,000 people although genetic studies have suggested significantly higher figures which is supported by Indigenous oral traditions that indicates a reduction in population from diseases introduced by British and American sealers before settlement.From Terror to Genocide: Britain’s Tasmanian Penal Colony and Australia’s History Wars.

A woman named Trugernanner (often rendered as Truganini) who died in 1876, was, and still is, widely believed to be the very last of the full blooded Aborigines. However, in 1889 Parliament recognized Fanny Cochrane Smith (d:1905) as the last surviving full blooded Tasmanian Aborigine.For discussion of the Truganini claim, and the other candidates, Suke and Fanny Cochrane Smith, see Rebe Taylor, Unearthed: the Aboriginal Tasmanians of Kangaroo Island,Wakefield Press, 2004 pp.140ff.Lyndall Ryan, The Aboriginal Tasmanians, Allen & Unwin, 1996 p.220, denies Truganini was the last 'full-blood', and makes a case for Suke (d.circa 1888) The 2006 census showed that there were nearly 17,000 Indigenous Australians in the State.

==Contemporary issues==

The Indigenous Australian population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number (27% as of 2002[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/00000000000000000000000000000000/294322bc5648ead8ca256f7200833040!OpenDocument |title=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=9 August 2009[/tpl]) live in remote settlements often located on the site of former church missions. The health and economic difficulties facing both groups are substantial. Both the remote and urban populations have adverse ratings on a number of social indicators, including health, education, unemployment, poverty and crime.Australian Bureau of Statistics. Year Book Australia 2005
In 2004, Prime Minister John Howard initiated contracts with Aboriginal communities, where substantial financial benefits are available in return for commitments such as ensuring children attend school. These contracts are known as Shared Responsibility Agreements. This saw a political shift from 'self determination' for Aboriginal communities to 'mutual obligation',Mutual obligation, shared responsibility agreements & Indigenous health strategy, Ian PS Anderson NIH.gov which has been criticised as a "paternalistic and dictatorial arrangement".Nothing mutual about denying Aborigines a voice, Larissa Behrendt, The Age newspaper, 8 December 2004 SMH.com.au

===Political representation===

Under Section 41 of the Australian Constitution, Aboriginal Australians always had the legal right to vote in Australian Commonwealth elections if their State granted them that right. This meant that all Aboriginal peoples outside Queensland and Western Australia had a legal right to vote. The right of Indigenous ex-servicemen to vote was affirmed in 1949 and all Indigenous Australians gained the unqualified right to vote in Federal elections in 1962.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] Unlike other Australians, however, voting was not made compulsory for Indigenous people.
It was not until the repeal of Section 127 of the Australian Constitution in 1967 that Indigenous Australians were counted in the population for the purposes of distribution of electoral seats. Only two Indigenous Australians have been elected to the Australian Senate: Neville Bonner (Liberal, 1971–1983) and Aden Ridgeway (Democrat, 1999–2005). Following the 2010 Australian Federal Election, Ken Wyatt of the Liberal Party won the Western Australian seat of Hasluck, becoming the first Indigenous person elected to the Australian House of Representatives.The West Australian.

A number of Indigenous people represent electorates at State and Territorial level, and South Australia has had an Aboriginal Governor, Sir Douglas Nicholls. The first Indigenous Australian to serve as a minister in any government was Ernie Bridge, who entered the Western Australian Parliament in 1980. Carol Martin was the first Aboriginal woman elected to an Australian parliament (the Western Australian Legislative Assembly) in 2001, and the first woman minister was Marion Scrymgour, who was appointed to the Northern Territory ministry in 2002 (she became Deputy Chief Minister in 2008).  Representation in the Northern Territory has been relatively high, reflecting the high proportion of Aboriginal voters. The 2012 Territory election saw large swings to the conservative Country Liberal Party achieved in remote Territory electorates and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly (along with one Labor candidate) in a chamber of 25 members. Among those elected for the CLP were high profile activists Bess Price and Alison Anderson.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 | work=The Australian | title=Indigenous vote decided outcome in the Territory | date=22 September 2012[/tpl]
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), a representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, was set up in 1990 under the Hawke government. In 2004, the Howard government disbanded ATSIC and replaced it with an appointed network of 30 Indigenous Coordination Centres that administer Shared Responsibility Agreements and Regional Partnership Agreements with Aboriginal communities at a local level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oipc.gov.au/About_OIPC/Indigenous_Affairs_Arrangements/4Administration.asp|title=Coordination and engagement at regional and national levels|accessdate=17 May 2006|publisher=Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination |year=2006|work=Administration[/tpl]
In October 2007, just prior to the calling of a federal election, the then Prime Minister, John Howard, revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution (his government first sought to include recognition of Aboriginal peoples in the Preamble to the Constitution in a 1999 referendum). His 2007 announcement was seen by some as a surprising adoption of the importance of the symbolic aspects of the reconciliation process, and reaction was mixed. The ALP initially supported the idea, however Kevin Rudd withdrew this support just prior to the election – earning stern rebuke from activist Noel Pearson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22809264-601,00.html |title=Noel Pearson's statement on Kevin Rudd , The Australian |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl] Critical sections of the Australian public and media[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=3581 |title=Eurekastreet.com.au |publisher=Eurekastreet.com.au |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] meanwhile suggested that Howard's raising of the issue was a "cynical" attempt in the lead-up to an election to "whitewash" his handling of this issue during his term in office.

====Australian politicians of Indigenous ancestry====

Only 28 people recognised to be of Indigenous Australian ancestry have been members of the ten Australian legislatures.
Four have been members of the Parliament of Australia, since its inception in 1901. All of these have been of Aboriginal descent and the first was in 1971.  Three have been members of the Senate:  Neville Bonner (Queensland, Liberal, 1971-1983), Aden Ridgeway (New South Wales, Australian Democrats, 1999-2005) and Nova Peris (Northern Territory, Labor, elected 2013).  One is a member of the House of Representatives: Ken Wyatt (Hasluck, WA;  Liberal;  elected 2010).  Among these, Peris is the only woman.Peris selection highlights Indigenous underrepresentation - ABC
Six have been members of State parliaments:  three in Western Australia and one each in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. There have been no Indigenous members in the parliaments of the other States:  South Australia and Victoria.
18 have been members of Territory assemblies:  17 in the Northern Territory, one in the Australian Capital Territory and none in Norfolk Island.
The difference for the Northern Territory lies in the exceptionally high Indigenous proportion, about one third, of its population. Adam Giles, who became Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in 2013, is the first Indigenous head of government in Australia.

===Age characteristics===

The Indigenous population of Australia is much younger than the non-Indigenous population, with an estimated median age of 21 years (37 years for non-Indigenous), due to higher rates of birth and death. For this reason, age standardisation is often used when comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous statistics.

===Life expectancy===

The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is difficult to quantify accurately. Indigenous deaths are poorly identified, and the official figures for the size of the population at risk include large adjustment factors. Two estimates of Indigenous life expectancy in 2008 differed by as much as five years.'Death forms undermine promises', NIT 157, 10 July 2008
In some regions the median age at death was identified in 1973 to be as low as 47 years and the life expectancy gap between Aboriginals and the rest of the Australian population as a whole, to be 25 years.
From 1996 to 2001, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) used indirect methods for its calculations, because census results were deemed to be unreliable.,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] and figures published in 2005 (59.4 years for males and 64.8 years for females) indicated a widely quoted gap of 17 years between indigenous and non-indigenous life expectancy, though the ABS does not now consider the 2005 figures to be reliable.
Using a new method based on tracing the deaths of people identified as Indigenous at the 2006 census, in 2009 the ABS estimated life expectancy at 67.2 years for Indigenous men (11.5 years less than for non-Indigenous) and 72.9 years for Indigenous women (9.7 years less than for non-Indigenous). Estimated life expectancy of Indigenous men ranges from 61.5 years for those living in the Northern Territory to a high of 69.9 years for those living in New South Wales, and for Indigenous women, 69.2 years for those living in the Northern Territory to a high of 75.0 years for those living in New South Wales.[tpl]cite web|title=3302.0.55.003 – Experimental Life Tables for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2005–2007|url=http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/C65F4C150DD0497ACA2575BE002656BC?Opendocument|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=25 May 2009|accessdate=28 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24708205-601,00.html|title=Life gap figures not black and white|author=Stephen Lunn|work=The Australian |date=26 November 2008|accessdate=24 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/indigenous-health-gap-closes-by-five-years-20090409-a27x.html|title=Indigenous health gap closes by five years|author=Joel Gibson|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=10 April 2009|accessdate=24 September 2010[/tpl]Australian Indigenous Health Vol 9 No 2, April 2009 – June 2009 Australian Bureau of Statistics

===Education===

Aboriginal students generally leave school earlier—and live with a lower standard of education—than their cohorts, although the situation is improving, with significant gains between 1994 and 2002.
The performance of indigenous students in national literacy and numeracy tests conducted in school years three, five, and seven is also inferior to that of their cohorts. The following table displays the performance of indigenous students against the general Australian student population as reported in the National Report on Schooling in Australia 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cms.curriculum.edu.au/anr2004/ch10_literacy.htm |title=Chapter 10: Indigenous education |publisher=Cms.curriculum.edu.au |accessdate=9 August 2009[/tpl]
In response to this problem, the Commonwealth Government formulated a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. A number of government initiatives have resulted, some of which are listed at the Commonwealth Government's website.Indigenous Education.
The Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts was established as a training centre by the State and Federal Governments in 1997.

===Employment===

Indigenous Australians as a group generally experience high unemployment compared to the national average. This can be correlated to lower educational outcomes (ABS 2010).
As of 2002, the average household income for Indigenous Australian adults (adjusted for household size and composition) was 60% of the non-Indigenous average.

===Health===

Indigenous Australians were twice as likely to report their health as fair/poor and 1.5 times more likely to have a disability or long-term health condition (after adjusting for demographic structures).Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Health problems with the highest disparity (compared with the non-Indigenous population) in incidenceAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare. are outlined in the table below:
Each of these indicators is expected to underestimate the true prevalence of disease in the population due to reduced levels of diagnosis.
In addition, the following factors have been at least partially implicated in the inequality in life expectancy:Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Successive Federal Governments have responded to these issues by implementing programs such as the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH).

===Crime and imprisonment===

===Substance abuse===

Many Indigenous communities suffer from a range of health, social and legal problems associated with substance abuse of both legal and illegal drugs.
The 2004–05 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) by the ABS found that the proportion of the Indigenous adult population engaged in 'risky' and 'high-risk' alcohol consumption (15%) was comparable with that of the non-Indigenous population (14%), based on age-standardised data.[tpl]cite journal|author=Australian Statistician |title=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, 2004–05 (ABS Cat. 4715.0), Table 6 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |year=2006 |version=pdf |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/B1BCF4E6DD320A0BCA25714C001822BC/$File/47150_2004-05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=1 June 2006[/tpl] The definition of "risky" and "high-risk" consumption used is four or more standard drinks per day average for males, two or more for females.

These NDSHS comparisons are non-age-standardised; the paper notes that Indigenous figures are based on a sample of 372 people and care should be exercised when using Indigenous figures.
NATSIHS 2004/5 also found that, after adjusting for age differences between the two populations, Indigenous adults were more than twice as likely as non-Indigenous adults to be current daily smokers of tobacco.[tpl]cite journal|author=Australian Statistician |title=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, 2004–05 (ABS Cat. 4715.0), Table 1 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |year=2006 |version=pdf |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/B1BCF4E6DD320A0BCA25714C001822BC/$File/47150_2004-05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=23 June 2008[/tpl]
To combat the problem, a number of programs to prevent or mitigate alcohol abuse have been attempted in different regions, many initiated from within the communities themselves. These strategies include such actions as the declaration of "Dry Zones" within indigenous communities, prohibition and restriction on point-of-sale access, and community policing and licensing.
Some communities (particularly in the Northern Territory) introduced kava as a safer alternative to alcohol, as over-indulgence in kava produces sleepiness, in contrast to the violence that can result from over-indulgence in alcohol. These and other measures met with variable success, and while a number of communities have seen decreases in associated social problems caused by excessive drinking, others continue to struggle with the issue and it remains an ongoing concern.
The ANCD study notes that in order to be effective, programs in general need also to address "...the underlying structural determinants that have a significant impact on alcohol and drug misuse" (Op. cit., p. 26). In 2007, Kava was banned in the Northern Territory.Australian Broadcasting Commission (2007) Kava Ban 'Sparks Black Market Boom', ABC Darwin 23 August 2007. Retrieved 18 October 2007.
Petrol sniffing is also a problem among some remote Indigenous communities. Petrol vapour produces euphoria and dulling effect in those who inhale it, and due to its previously low price and widespread availability, is an increasingly popular substance of abuse.
Proposed solutions to the problem are a topic of heated debate among politicians and the community at large.Effects of sniffing petrol Northern Territory Government Health DepartmentPetrol Sniffing in Remote Northern Territory Communities Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. In 2005 this problem among remote indigenous communities was considered so serious that a new, low aromatic petrol Opal was distributed across the Northern Territory to combat it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2006-ta-abb010.htm?OpenDocument&yr=2006&mth=2 |title=Australian Health Ministry |publisher=Health.gov.au |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=9 August 2009[/tpl]

==Prominent Indigenous Australians==

After the arrival of European settlers in New South Wales, some Indigenous Australians became translators and go-betweens; the best-known was Bennelong, who eventually adopted European dress and customs and travelled to England where he was presented to King George III. Others, such as Pemulwuy, Yagan, and Windradyne, became famous for armed resistance to the European settlers.
During the twentieth century, as social attitudes shifted and interest in Indigenous culture increased, there were more opportunities for Indigenous Australians to gain recognition. Albert Namatjira became a painter, and actors such as David Gulpilil, Ernie Dingo, and Deborah Mailman became well known. Bands such as Yothu Yindi, and singers Christine Anu, Jessica Mauboy and Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, have combined Indigenous musical styles and instruments with pop/rock, gaining appreciation amongst non-Indigenous audiences. Polymath David Unaipon is commemorated on the Australian $50 note.
Indigenous Australians have also featured in sport. Lionel Rose earned a world title in boxing. Evonne Goolagong became the world number-one ranked female tennis player with 14 Grand Slam titles. Arthur Beetson, Laurie Daley and Gorden Tallis captained Australia in Rugby League. Mark Ella captained Australia in Rugby Union. Notable Aboriginal athletes include Cathy Freeman who earned gold medals in the Olympics, World Championships, and Commonwealth Games. In Australian football, an increasing number of Indigenous Australians are playing at the highest level, the Australian Football League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://footy.lisaj.id.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33&Itemid=1 |title=Influence of Aboriginal players |publisher=Footy.lisaj.id.au |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] Graham Farmer is said to have revolutionised the game in the ruck and handball areas, and Brownlow Medallists and Indigenous Team of the Century members Gavin Wanganeen and Adam Goodes. Two Indigenous Australian basketball players, Nathan Jawai and Patty Mills, have played in the sport's most prominent professional league, the NBA.
While relatively few Indigenous Australians have been elected to political office (Neville Bonner, Aden Ridgeway and Ken Wyatt remain the only ATSI people to have been elected to the Australian Federal Parliament), Aboriginal rights campaigner Sir Douglas Nicholls was appointed Governor of the State of South Australia in 1976, and many others have become famous through political activism – for instance, Charles Perkins' involvement in the Freedom Ride of 1965 and subsequent work; or Torres Strait Islander Eddie Mabo's part in the landmark native title decision that bears his name. The voices of Cape York activist Noel Pearson, Jean Little OAM and academics Marcia Langton and Mick Dodson today loom large in national debates. Some Indigenous people who initially became famous in other spheres – for instance, poet Oodgeroo Noonuccal – have used their celebrity to draw attention to Indigenous issues.

==Representative sporting teams==

Aboriginal Australia has been represented in various sporting teams. Notable teams include the Indigenous All-Stars, Flying Boomerangs and Indigenous Team of the Century (Australian rules football) and the Indigenous All Stars (rugby league) . The first organised trip of Australian cricketers to travel overseas was principally made up of Aboriginal members embarked on a tour of England in 1868. Tom Wills coached the team in a language that he learnt as a child growing up amongst aborigines in Victoria. Charles Lawrence accompanied them to England as captain and coach.
