CATEGORIES: Scottish Premier League seasons, 2000–01 in Scottish football leagues

The 2000–01 Scottish Premier League was the third season of the Scottish Premier League. It began in on 29 July 2000.
Celtic finished the season as league champions by a 15-point margin over neighbouring Rangers, also winning both of the domestic cups in their first season under the management of Martin O'Neill.

==Overview==

2000–01 saw the Scottish Premier League expanded from 10 to 12 clubs, with the league 'split' introduced. After 33 rounds of matches, by which time all clubs had played each other three times, the league split into a 'top six' and 'bottom six' with clubs only competing against teams within their own section for the final five fixtures. The new format received widespread criticism from SPL managers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63528579.html|publisher=The Mirror|title=YOU'RE TOO LATE NOW; Dick blast at SPL bosses|date=7 February 2001|accessdate=24 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-71131570.html|publisher=BBC Sport|title=SPL split will Pitt us in a right fix; SAYS EBBE SKOVDAHL|date=7 February 2001|accessdate=24 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/825790.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Fear factor worries McLeish|date=9 July 2000|accessdate=24 April 2008[/tpl]
The 2000–01 title was won by Celtic - their first SPL title, won in Martin O'Neill's first season as manager of the club. Rangers finished second, 15 points behind their Old Firm-rivals. St. Mirren were relegated in what was their debut season in the SPL and their first appearance in Scotland's top division since 1991–92. As champions, Celtic qualified for the Champions League, as did second-placed Rangers, with Scotland gaining two Champions League berths for the first time. Third-placed Hibernian and fourth-placed Kilmarnock qualified for the UEFA Cup, while Dundee became the first SPL club - and the first Scottish club since Partick Thistle in 1995 - to qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup.
