Along with the neighboring Barbaroi (Berbers) of Barbara, the Habash are recorded in the 1st century Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as engaging in extensive commercial trade with Egypt, among other areas. The document also relates a strong connection with the "Frankincense Country" in the Mahra region of modern Yemen and a symbiotic relationship with the ancient Sabaeans, with whom the Habash were allied.Wilfred Harvey Schoff, The Periplus of the Erythr√¶an sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean, (Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912) p.62
