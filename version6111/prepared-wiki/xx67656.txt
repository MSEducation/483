==Rocketry records and attempts==

In addition to the flat surface, distance from populated areas and uncontrolled airspace over the area also attract experimentation with rockets.  The following are highlights of amateur rocketry records[ref]

Other rocket launches attempting various altitude records or space flights have occurred at Black Rock.  In May 1999, JP Aerospace used a rockoon (balloon-launched rocket) in an unsuccessful suborbital space flight attempt covered by CNN.  The rocket reached [tpl]convert|75000|ft|m[/tpl], which was far less than the intended Karman Line to reach space.[ref]
</ref> CSXT made unsuccessful space launch attempts in 2000 and 2002 before the successful 2004 space flight.<ref>
