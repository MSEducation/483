===Prisoner of war===

On October 23, 2006, Altaie violated military regulations and left his military base in Iraq without telling anyone. It is believed that he was in the Karrada neighborhood in central Baghdad, Iraq to visit the family of his wife, Israa Abdul-Satar, a student at al-Mustansiriya University. He was captured by armed men and forced into a waiting vehicle outside.
On November 2, 2006, a ransom demand for Altaie was relayed to his uncle Entifadh Qanbar, a former spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress and recently an official in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. Qanbar made contact with an intermediary trusted by the kidnappers. In a secret location in Baghdad, the mediator met with members of the group who showed Qanbar a grainy video on a cell phone screen of a man they claimed was Altaie, beaten up and bloody and demanded $250,000 from the soldier's family to secure his release.
Qanbar stated that he wouldn't talk about a price until he had seen for himself some proof that Altaie was still breathing. Qanbar suggested they have his nephew describe the inside of his home in Ann Arbor or that the kidnappers photograph the soldier holding a current newspaper by November 4, 2006 at 12:00pm.
The U.S. government said on November 11, 2006, that it was offering a US $50,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of Altaie's body.
On February 14, 2007, a proof of life video of Altaie was posted on a militant Shiite website. A previously unknown group called the "Ahel al-Beit Brigades" claimed responsibility for Altaie's abduction. The eight second video showed Altaie reading from a paper but no audio was heard. He appeared thin but in good health. His uncle identified him as the man in the video.
Altaie was the last American serviceman to be accounted for in Iraq. He was captured when he was the rank of Specialist and was promoted to Staff Sergeant.[tpl]cite news|last=Arwa Damon, Yousif Bassel, Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq|title=Uncle: Abducted U.S. soldier appears in video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/02/14/abducted.soldier/index.html|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=February 14, 2007[/tpl]
On February 26, 2012, U.S. officers knocked on the door of the family home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with news that Army Staff Sgt. Ahmed Altaie was confirmed dead. The remains of Altaie were turned over as part of an amnesty exchange agreement between the Iraqi government and the militant group Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Altaie's captors acknowledged killing him within a year of his capture.[tpl]cite web|last=Allam |first=Hannah |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/26/2661934/us-military-receives-remains-of.html |title=U.S. military receives remains of last soldier missing in Iraq – World Wires |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl]Army IDs remains of last missing U.S. soldier in Iraq[tpl]cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE81Q11N20120227 | work=Reuters | title=Michigan burial for last U.S. soldier missing in Iraq | date=February 27, 2012[/tpl]Phillips, Michael M., "Last Missing Soldier In Iraq: Family Finally Learns Fate", Wall Street Journal, 27 February 2012, p. 1.
