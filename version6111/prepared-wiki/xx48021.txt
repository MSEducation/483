[[Carbon audit regime]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change policy

A carbon audit regime is a means of accounting for quantifiable greenhouse gas control efforts.  It establishes that the claimed reductions in emissions or enhancements of carbon sinks, has actually occurred and is stable.
The UK is the only nation in the world that presently has such a regime.
