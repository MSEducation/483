It takes advantage of the new graphical user interface (GUI) of Windows Vista, and includes features such as tile set and background choices. (In Windows Vista build 5219, the game was known as Shanghai Solitaire.[tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/product-review/microsoft-windows-vista-build-5219-community-technical-preview-1-review | title=Microsoft Windows Vista Build 5219 (Community Technical Preview 1) Review | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | date=2010-10-06 | accessdate=29 July 2013 | first=Paul | last=Thurrott | authorlink=Paul Thurrott[/tpl]) The game did not make it to Windows 8; however, a standalone version, developed Arkadium and published by Microsoft Studios, can be downloaded from the Windows Store free of charge.
An older version of the game was known as Taipei and was bundled in Microsoft Entertainment Pack 1 and Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack. That version included 32767 possible configurations.

==Features==

The player has a choice of six tile layouts[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/a-look-at-windows-vista-installed-games-6154558/?page=3 | title=A Look at Windows Vista Installed Games, Page 3 | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=29 July 2013 | page=3[/tpl] - Cat, Turtle, Crab, Dragon, Fortress and Spider, each a stylized portrayal of the respective object or animal. The background image can be chosen from five different options and there are four tile sets, including traditional Mahjong tiles, variations with fuller coloring or larger print, and an alternative pastel tile set with an entirely different picture theme.
Games are not totally random. There is always at least one pair within five tiles of the topmost five tiles in the turtle layout and often two pairs. The algorithm for tile organization positions tiles such that they can mostly be paired on the same level, or otherwise a matching tile is available in an accessible position one level down. It does not check to ensure that the matching tile is not positioned beneath its partner. Thus, there are some games that are impossible to solve.
