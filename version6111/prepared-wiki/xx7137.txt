A loya jirga ([tpl]lang-ps|لويه جرګه[/tpl]) is a type of jirga regarded as "grand assembly," a phrase in the Pashto language meaning "grand council." A loya jirga is a mass meeting usually prepared for major events such as choosing a new king, adopting a constitution, or discussing important national political or emergency matters. It is also used for resolving disputes in Afghanistan, but also in the Pashtun areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA in Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/12296/section/1 |title=Killing You is a Very Easy Thing For Us |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2003-07-29 |accessdate=2013-04-15[/tpl] In Afghanistan, the loya jirga was originally attended by the Pashtuns, but later included other ethnic groups. It is a forum unique among the Pashtun tribes in which, traditionally, tribal elders meet together.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1782079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: What is a loya jirga? | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

The ancient Aryan tribes, who are hypothesized to have spoken Proto-Indo-Iranian, came down in intermittent waves from Central Asia and Afghanistan and then moved to ancient India (in the early 2nd millennium BC). They practiced a sort of jirga-system with two types of councils – simite and sabhā. The simite (the summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the simite. Sabhā was a sort of rural council.http://khyberwatch.com/nandara/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=382[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
It was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler Kanishka to the 1970s, there were sixteen national loya jirgas and hundreds of smaller ones.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic "shura", or consultative assembly.
In the Afghan society, the loya jirga is still maintained and very strongly practiced, mostly in front of tribal chiefs or with them to solve internal and external tribal problems or disputes with other tribes.
When the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a Jirga. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the Jirgas, later other ethnic groups like Tajiks and Hazaras were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the Jirgas were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal chiefs of the Afghans. King Amanullah Khan institutionalized the Jirga. From Amanullah until the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah (1933–1973) and Mohammed Daoud Khan (1973–1978) the Jirga was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.
The meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise.
There is no time limit for a Loya Jirga to conclude, and the meetings often take a long time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Many different problems are addressed, like foreign policy, declarations of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.
