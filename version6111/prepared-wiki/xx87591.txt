The Choson Sinbo (Chosun Shinbo) is a newspaper based in Japan, published in both Korean and Japanese. The name literally means 'Chosun (Korea) Newspaper'. It is published by the General Association of Korean Residents, a pro-North Korea representative body for Zainichi Koreans, who also run The People's Korea (PK), an English language news site. Although it has an anti-Japan position, it published an article that showed sympathy towards both the Korean residents and the Japanese citizens who were affected from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[tpl]cite news | first = Yun-seok (윤석) | last = Ahn (안) | title = 조선신보 "평양시민들 재일동포, 일본인 걱정" | date = 2011-03-15 | url = http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/show.asp?idx=1746213 | work = NoCut News | accessdate = 2011-04-17 | language = Korean[/tpl]
