XLR8R (pronounced "accelerator") is a magazine and website that covers music, culture, style, and technology. It was founded as a newsprint ‘zine in 1993 by publisher Andrew Smith in Seattle; the magazine currently has offices in San Francisco and New York. While XLR8R’s initial focus was on electronic music, it has over the years widened its scope to include indie rock, hip-hop, and reggae/dancehall music as well as related trends in style, art, fashion, and technology.[tpl]cite news|last=Pescovitz|first=David|title=XLR8R: 100th anniversary issue|url=http://boingboing.net/2006/09/18/xlr8r-100th-annivers.html|work=Boing Boing|accessdate=1 February 2013|authorlink=David Pescovitz[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Nagy|first=Colin|title=Taking Stock: XLR8R Goes GRN|url=http://www.psfk.com/2007/10/taking-stock-xlr8r-goes-grn.html|work=PSFK|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
