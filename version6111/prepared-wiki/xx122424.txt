Chyuhn first learned Lama Pai under the direction of Wong Lum Hoi. Such an accomplished martial artist was Chyuhn that he learned all of Wong Lum Hoi’s Lama Pai hand and weapon sets in under 7 years.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] Towards the end of his training he sought out the teachings of Wong Yan Lum upon his return to Guangdong.
