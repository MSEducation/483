Mathematica is a computational software program used in many scientific, engineering, mathematical and computing fields, based on symbolic mathematics. It was conceived by Stephen Wolfram and is developed by Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois.Stephen Wolfram: Simple Solutions; The iconoclastic physicist's Mathematica software nails complex puzzles, BusinessWeek, October 3, 2005.Wolfram Research Contact Info

==Features==

Features of Mathematica include:Mathematica documentation

==Interface==

Mathematica is split into two parts, the kernel and the front end. The kernel interprets expressions (Mathematica code) and returns result expressions.
The front end, designed by Theodore Gray, provides a GUI, which allows the creation and editing of Notebook documents containing program code with prettyprinting, formatted text together with results including typeset mathematics, graphics, GUI components, tables, and sounds. All contents and formatting can be generated algorithmically or interactively edited. Most standard word processing capabilities are supported, but there is only one level of "undo." It includes a spell-checker but does not spell check automatically as you type.
Documents can be structured using a hierarchy of cells, which allow for outlining and sectioning of a document and support automatic numbering index creation. Documents can be presented in a slideshow environment for presentations. Notebooks and their contents are represented as Mathematica expressions that can be created, modified or analysed by Mathematica programs. This allows conversion to other formats such as TeX or XML.
The front end includes development tools such as a debugger, input completion and automatic syntax coloring.  
Among the alternative front ends is the Wolfram Workbench, an Eclipse based IDE, introduced in 2006. It provides project-based code development tools for Mathematica, including revision management, debugging, profiling, and testing.MacWorld review of Wolfram Workbench The Mathematica Kernel also includes a command line front end.Using a Text-Based Interface documentation at wolfram.com Other interfaces include JMath,JMath website based on GNU readline and MASHMASH website which runs self-contained Mathematica programs (with arguments) from the UNIX command line.

==High-performance computing==

In recent years, the capabilities for high-performance computing have been extended with the introduction of packed arrays (version 4, 1999)Math software packs new power; new programs automate such tedious processes as solving nonlinear differential equations and converting units by Agnes Shanley, Chemical Engineering, March 1, 2002. and sparse matrices (version 5, 2003),Mathematica 5.1: additional features make software well-suited for operations research professionals by ManMohan S. Sodhi, OR/MS Today, December 1, 2004. and by adopting the GNU Multi-Precision Library to evaluate high-precision arithmetic.
Version 5.2 (2005) added automatic multi-threading when computations are performed on multi-core computers.The 21st annual Editors' Choice Awards, Macworld, February 1, 2006. This release included CPU specific optimized libraries. In addition Mathematica is supported by third party specialist acceleration hardware such as ClearSpeed.ClearSpeed Advance(TM) Accelerator Boards Certified by Wolfram Research; Math Coprocessors Enable Mathematica Users to Quadruple Performance.
In 2002, gridMathematica was introduced to allow user level parallel programming on heterogeneous clusters and multiprocessor systems gridMathematica offers parallel computing solution by Dennis Sellers, MacWorld, November 20, 2002. and in 2008 parallel computing technology was included in all Mathematica licenses including support for grid technology such as Windows HPC Server 2008, Microsoft Compute Cluster Server and Sun Grid.
Support for CUDA and OpenCL GPU hardware was added in 2010. Also, since version 8 it can generate C code, which is automatically compiled by a system C compiler, such as the Intel C++ Compiler or Visual Studio 2010.

==Deployment==

There are several ways to deploy applications written in Mathematica:

==Connections with other applications==

Communication with other applications occurs through a protocol called MathLink. It allows communication between the Mathematica kernel and front-end, and also provides a general interface between the kernel and other applications. Wolfram Research freely distributes a developer kit for linking applications written in the C programming language to the Mathematica kernel through MathLink.New Mathematica: faster, leaner, linkable and QuickTime-compatible: MathLink kit allows ties to other apps. (Wolfram Research Inc. ships Mathematica 2.1, new QuickTime-compatible version of Mathematica software) by Daniel Todd, MacWeek, June 15, 1992. Using J/Link.,Mathematica 4.2 by Charles Seiter, Macworld, November 1, 2002. a Java program can ask Mathematica to perform computations; likewise, a Mathematica program can load Java classes, manipulate Java objects and perform method calls. Similar functionality is achieved with .NET /Link,.NET/Link: .NET/Link is a toolkit that integrates Mathematica and the Microsoft .NET Framework. but with .NET programs instead of Java programs.

==Computable data==

Mathematica includes collections of curated data provided for use in computations. Mathematica is also integrated with Wolfram Alpha, an online service which provides additional data, some of which is kept updated in real time. Some of the data sets include astronomical, chemical, geopolitical, language, biomedical and weather data, in addition to mathematical data (such as knots and polyhedra).[tpl]citation|chapter=Scientific and Technical Data|title=Mathematic Guide|url=http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/ScientificAndTechnicalData.html|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]

==Design==

Wolfram Research provides documents listing the algorithms used to implement the functions in Mathematica.

==Version history==

Mathematica built on the ideas in Cole and Wolfram's earlier Symbolic Manipulation Program (SMP).Math, the universe, and Stephen: the author of Mathematica created a whirlwind of scientific controversy this year when, after more than 10 years of research, he published his treatise on the ability of simple structures to create unpredictable complex patterns. (2002 Scientist Of The Year).(Stephen Wolfram) by Tim Studt, R&D, November 1 , 2002.A Top Scientist's Latest: Math Software by Andrew Pollack, The New York Times, June 24, 1988.

==Trivia==

The name of the program “Mathematica” was suggested to Stephen Wolfram by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs although Stephen Wolfram had thought about it earlier and rejected it.[tpl]citation|first=Stephen|last=Wolfram|title=STEVE JOBS: A FEW MEMORIES|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-a-few-memories/#more-15338|publisher=Wolfram Alpha|date=6 Oct 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]
