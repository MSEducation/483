==Controversy==

==="Celebrate Singapore"===

In 2014 "Celebrate Singapore", a large two-day Songkran-style water festival, was planned for Singapore and the event was promoted as the "largest water festival party in Singapore". However, controversy emerged when the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) Deputy Governor for Tourism Products, Vilaiwan Twichasri, claimed that Thailand holds exclusive rights to celebrate Songkran and planned to consult with officials at the Department of Intellectual Property, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Culture to discuss a potential lawsuit; the Deputy Governer's view was supported by numerous Thai citizens on social media websites.[tpl]cite news|title=Suit eyed for Singapore Songkran|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/400518/tat-considers-legal-action-over-singapore-songkran|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=18 March 2014[/tpl] Chai Nakhonchai, Cultural Promotion Department chief, pointed out that Songkran is a traditional festival shared by many countries throughout Southeast Asia, while historian Charnvit Kasetsiri stated that no single nation can claim ownership of the tradition.[tpl]cite news|title=Songkran in Singapore|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/400635/songkran-in-singapore|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=19 March 2014[/tpl] On 25 March 2014, the Bangkok Post reported that the Singaporean government had intervened in the festival's content and there would be no water-throwing, no water pistols and no public drinking; the festival was also reduced to a one-day event.[tpl]cite news|title=Only in Singapore: No Songkran|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/401685/only-in-singapore-no-songkran|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=25 March 2014[/tpl]

===Public nudity===

Two Thai people were arrested during the 2014 celebration, as they had revealed their breasts in public in Pitsanulok province. Images of the nudity were disseminated on the Internet and condemnation was expressed in response. The pair was charged with indecent exposure, fined THB500 each and were taken to a local shrine to seek forgiveness from spirits. As of 15 April, a third person was being traced for exposing his penis in public in the same province.[tpl]cite web|title=Ladyboys Arrested For Songkran Breast Exposure|url=http://en.khaosod.co.th/detail.php?newsid=1397553133|work=Khaosod English|publisher=Khaosod Public Co.,Ltd|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=15 April 2014[/tpl]

==In other calendars==

Songkran occurs at the same time as that given by Bede for festivals of Eostre—and Easter weekend occasionally coincides with Songkran (most recently 1979, 1990, and 2001, but not again until 2085.)

===Accidents===

[tpl]quote box | width=25em|align=right|qalign=right|quote= Thai people should think about what we want and how we want to promote the image of our country. Do we want to be known as the hub of the water party with booze and a high death toll? Or do we want to be known for having a beautiful culture that no one else has" —Prommin Kantiya, director of the Accident Prevention Network (APN) [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/404724/lawless-culture-takes-its-toll |title=Lawless culture takes its toll|publisher=Bangkok Post |date=11 Apr 2014 |accessdate=11 Apr 2014[/tpl]   |[/tpl]
Police statistics show that the death toll from road accidents doubles during the annual Songkran holiday. According to the figures, between 2009 and 2013 there were about 27 road deaths per day during non-holiday periods and an average of 52 road deaths per day during Songkran. Thailand has the second-highest traffic fatality rate in the world, with 44 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to researchers at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Approximately 70% of the accidents that occurred during the long holiday period were motorcycle accidents. About 10,000 people per year die in motorcycle accidents—both the drivers and passengers.
During the 2014 Songkran festivities, 204 deaths and 2,142 injuries occurred by the end of the third day. Drunk driving and speeding were the most significant causes of accidents, in which motorcycles and pickup trucks were mostly involved.[tpl]cite news|title=Forty three more die on third day|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/forty-three-die-third-day/|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=15 April 2014[/tpl]
