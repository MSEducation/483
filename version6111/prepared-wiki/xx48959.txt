==History==

Originally constructed by the U.S. Navy as Naval Air Station Isla Grande just prior to World War II,http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/buildbaseswwii/bbwwii2.htm the facility also served as Puerto Rico's main international airport until 1954, when Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport was built. Until that year, international airlines such as Deutsche Luft Hansa, Iberia Airlines, Pan Am and other majors flew to Isla Grande. However, since Isla Grande airport was not built to accept jets, all international airlines then moved their operations in Puerto Rico to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, then named Isla Verde International Airport.
Until 1971, the airport also hosted Coast Guard Air Station San Juan.  That year, the Coast Guard relocated its air station to Ramey Air Force Base on Puerto Rico's northwest coast.
Isla Grande was renamed in honor of United States Air Force Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci, an F-111 pilot who was killed in action during Operation El Dorado Canyon; the 1986 airstrike of Libya.
A controversy regarding Isla Grande and Dorado Airport surfaced in 2003. Dorado Airport wanted to expand and attract the private aviation sector that has been Isla Grande's main business for so long. Dorado airport eventually became a victim of urban development in Dorado and no longer exists.
On October 26, 2003, the airport made history by becoming the first Puerto Rican site of a SCCA Grand Prix race.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
In 2006, after a detailed impact study and many rumors about the future of the airport, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced that Isla Grande airport would remain open for the foreseeable future, mostly because of its key function as the primary reliever for the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?contentBlockId=6dc889af-bb34-43bf-80dd-75f0408c4018 | title = Historic Puerto Rico GA Airport Saved! Isla Grande Economic Analysis Sways Politicos | publisher = Aero-News Network | date = July 18, 2006[/tpl]
On August 4, 2011 the FAA announced that they were planning to close the airport's control tower due to budget cuts, since they operate it instead of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
On July 8, 2012 airport officials denied via written communication to a local newspaper of "any plans to eliminate or privatize the airport, since the airport is one of the most important airports for general aviation on Puerto Rico, taking into account that its operation approximates around 300 daily operations." On that same newspaper it was published that Seaborne Airlines would transition its operations to the neighboring Luis Muñoz Marin Intl Airport with complete pullout on January 16, 2013."Niegan el cierre del Aeropuerto de Isla Grande, Vocero de Puerto Rico July 8, 2012.
