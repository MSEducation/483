"Long Night" is a single by The Corrs, released in 2004, taken from their fourth studio album Borrowed Heaven. The song was written by Sharon Corr. Even though it was not a very successful single around Europe or the U.S., it reached #4 in Brazil and remained on Top 10 for weeks, after its use on a famous prime time national soap opera Senhora do Destino.

==Video==

The video for "Long Night" only features Andrea and, very shortly, Sharon during her violin solo. Apart from that, we see different versions of Andrea moving backwards through a love affair with a young man. It was shot on October 29, 2004.
The location for the video shooting was Chicheley Hall in Buckinghamshire (north of London), which was built in the 18th century and is still open for public today. You can spot a picture of the entrance hall here.
