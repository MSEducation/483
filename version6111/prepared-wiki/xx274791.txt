The band was established by rapper Ali Bla Bla after meeting lead singer Danny Wilder at a Busta Rhymes concert at London's Wembley Arena. Ali turned to old school friends Richie 2 Pun, Memari Man and Koken as well as brother 8bit (who introduced drummer Royal to Ali) and formed the band.  Their debut single, "I Try", was released on 31 August 2010, gaining support from BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. They have gone onto achieve further cult success through singles "Listen To The Old Man" (released 1 November 2010) and "Darkness" (featuring Klashnekoff) released on 11 March 2011, with remix's from Nutty P. The band went onto release their biggest underground hit to date "Make Me Worse" on 13 July 2012 and went onto BBC Radio 1xtra to perform live on Charlie Sloth's Fire In The Booth. Quite a lot of their popularity has come from the Monstercat DJ/producer/business entrepreneur, Muzzy, when he remixed "Make Me Worse" and it went on to reach over a million views.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
