==Offseason==

===Spring training===

The Athletics considered using the Bader Field ballpark in Atlantic City for their 1944 spring training site. On November 17, 1943, Connie Mack examined Bader Field and the National Guard Armory as one possibility. But he knew the New York Yankees were already considering it. The A's went to McCurdy Field in Frederick, Maryland when the Yankees chose Atlantic City.[tpl]cite news |first=Bob|last=Warrington|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Spring Training 1944|url=http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/springtraining1944.htm |work= |publisher=Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society |date=|accessdate=June 10, 2009[/tpl]
