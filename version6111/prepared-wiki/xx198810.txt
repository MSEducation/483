Har Adar is ranked high on the Israeli socio-economic scales, at 9/10.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

==History==

The location of Har Adar was named Radar Hill ([tpl]lang-he-n|גִּבְעַת הָרָדָאר[/tpl], Giv'at HaRadar), for the World War II British military installation there which had an anti-air radar for the protection of Jerusalem. The installation was handed over to the Jordanian Arab Legion on May 10, 1948, prior to the second phase of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. 23 attempts by the Palmach's Harel Brigade to conquer it failed, although the Jewish force held the position for four days starting May 22, 1948. It was finally captured in the Six-Day War by the Harel Brigade. A monument for the fallen soldiers of the brigade stands at the top of the town.
The current settlement was founded in 1982 by the Radar Hill Organization. Har Adar (lit. Mount Adar) was a similar-sounding Hebrew name given to the hill and the settlement.

==Status under international law==

Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Har Adar is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Some 600 Palestinians work as day laborers in Har Adar.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel sees this as a form of racism.
