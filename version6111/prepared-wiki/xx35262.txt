==Overview==

This album saw the beginning of the band's stylistic shift from the metal & funk of previous albums into a more melodic, groove-oriented alternative rock approach. This is apparent in the lack of slap bass and guitar palm muting, which can only slightly be found in "Out From Under".  The drums are also quieter as just a single pedal is used, this is again heard on later releases. 
There is also a tour edition for the album, with a second disc containing three acoustic tracks and one live track. The album is the first to be recorded with new turntablist Chris Kilmore, who replaced DJ Lyfe.
The song "Stellar" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero. It also was included as a part of a 3-song pack via Xbox Live for the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II on April 11, 2007. The song is also again featured in Guitar Hero Smash Hits. The song "Drive" was released as downloadable content for Guitar Hero World Tour, as being released as a part of the Acoustic Pack. The song "Privilege" is featured in the video game MTV Sports: Pure Ride for the PlayStation.
The song "Crowded Elevator" was featured on Scream 3: The Album.
The album is listed on the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
The song "I Miss You" was featured on Rocksmith.
The songs "Pardon Me" and "Drive" were released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3.
