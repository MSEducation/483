==Ethnography==

In his 1990 study of Paleo-Eskimo people (who preceded the Inuit), Helmer describes three occupation periods in the McDougall Sound region: Transitional Period Dorset (ca. 3000 BP), Early Dorset (2500—2200 BP), and Late Dorset (ca. 1500—1000 BP), demonstrating abrupt ends to three sets of occupations by Palaeo-Eskimo hunters.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic44-4-301.pdf|title=The Palaeo-Eskimo Prehistory of the North Devon Lowlands |last=Helmer |first=James W. |date=1990-06-05 |publisher=Arctic |volume=44 |pages=301–317 |oclc= |issue=4[/tpl] The University of Calgary's McDougall Sound Arctic Research Project continued this work.[tpl]cite web |url=http://arky.ucalgary.ca/show/showintro.html |title=McDougall Sound Arctic Research Project |last=Helmer |first=James |coauthors=LeMoine, Genevieve |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=ucalgary.ca |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307223531/http://arky.ucalgary.ca/show/showintro.html  |archivedate = 2008-03-07[/tpl]
