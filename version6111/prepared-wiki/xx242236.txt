==History==

===3G + Wi-Fi version===

This version made its debut on November 22, 2009, at a retail price of $259 and comes with built-in 3G + Wi-Fi connectivity for free access to Barnes and Noble online store. The price was reduced to $199 on June 21, 2010, upon the release of the new Nook Wi-Fi. The latest price drop was made on May 25, 2011, to a closeout price of $169 in accord with the announcement of the new Nook, named the Nook Simple Touch Reader.

===Wi-Fi version===

This version made its debut on June 21, 2010, at a retail price of $149. It is a version of the Nook 1st Edition that supports Wi-Fi only and not 3G Wireless, and it was launched with Firmware Version 1.4 already. It is physically easily distinguishable from the 3G + Wi-fi gray-backed version, due to its white back color.  Price reduction was made on May 25, 2011, dropping to a closeout price of $119 in accord with the announcement of the new Nook, named the Nook Simple Touch Reader.

==Features==

The original Nook provides a black-and-white electronic ink (e ink) display for viewing digital content with most navigation and additional content provided through a color touchscreen. Pages are turned using arrow buttons on each side of the Nook or by making swipe gesture on touch screen. The original Nook connects to Barnes and Noble's digital store through a free connection to AT&T's 3G network or through available Wi-Fi connections. Users can read books without a wireless connection; disconnecting the wireless connection can extend the battery's charge to up to ten days.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/features/techspecs/?cds2Pid=30195|title=nook features and technical specs|accessdate=April 23, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100418004054/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/features/techspecs/?cds2Pid=30195| archivedate= April 18, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The device has a MicroSD expansion slot for extra storage[tpl]cite web |author= David Carnoy|title= Is Barnes & Noble's Nook a Kindle killer?|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10379125-1.html|publisher= cnet news|date= October 20, 2009|accessdate=October 20, 2009[/tpl] and a user-replaceable rechargeable battery.

The device also includes a web browser, a built-in dictionary, Chess and Sudoku, an audio player, speakers, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.
Supported ebook file-formats with DRM include:
The EPUB with eReader DRM combination is a new format created for the Nook. Adobe has undertaken to include support for that combination in future releases of Adobe Acrobat mobile software, to allow other reader devices to support that format.[tpl]cite web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |title=Adobe and Barnes & Noble Join Forces to Standardize eBook Technology |url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200910/AdobeandBarnesNobleJoinForcestoStandardizeeBookTechnology.html |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100525020544/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200910/AdobeandBarnesNobleJoinForcestoStandardizeeBookTechnology.html| archivedate= May 25, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Supported ebook file formats without DRM include:
Supported sound file formats for music and audiobooks include MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, but not WMA. Only the original Nook and the Nook Color support sound files.
Nook supports image file formats JPG, GIF, PNG, and BMP, used for book cover thumbnails, wallpapers, and screen savers.
The Nook provides a "LendMe" feature allowing users to share some books with other people, depending on licensing by the book's publisher.  The buyer is permitted to share a book once with one other user for up to two weeks.[tpl]cite web| url=http://consumerist.com/5388178/bn-ebook-reader-lets-you-loan-a-book-just-once| title= B&N Ebook Reader Lets You Loan a Book Just Once | publisher= The Consumerist | author=Chris Walters | date=October 22, 2009 | accessdate=October 23, 2009[/tpl]  Users will be able to share purchased books with others who are using Barnes & Noble's reader application software for Android, BlackBerry, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac OS X, and Windows and others.[tpl]cite web |author= Chad Berndtson |title= Barnes & Noble's Nook Has The Hooks To Take Down Kindle|url= http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/220700426/barnes-nobles-nook-has-the-hooks-to-take-down-kindle.htm |work=CRN |publisher=UBM ChannelWeb |date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=October 20, 2009[/tpl]
The Nook system recognizes physical Barnes & Noble stores. Customers using the Nook in Barnes & Noble stores receive access to special content and offers while the device is connected to the store's Wi-Fi. Further, most e-Books in the catalog can be read for up to an hour while connected to the store Wi-Fi network with the 1.3 software update.http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/23/nook-update-adds-read-in-store-functionality/
Because Barnes & Noble does not make the Nook available outside the United States, if it is taken overseas it will neither be possible to access a 3G connection nor capable of buying books on the Barnes & Noble Nook Book Store.  The Nook is still capable of accessing the same Book Store through Wi-Fi and downloading free books from it outside of the U.S.

==Hacking==

Some Nook users have loaded Android applications on the Nook, such as Pandora, a web browser, a Twitter client called Tweet, Google Reader and a Facebook application.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/nook-run-apps/ |title=Nook E-Reader Gets Hacked to Run Apps, Browser |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |work=Wired  |date=December 16, 2009 |first=Priya |last=Ganapati| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091227032234/http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/nook-run-apps/| archivedate= December 27, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Many general Android applications running on the Nook present interactive areas of their interface on the E Ink display, making such applications difficult to manipulate on the device. However, Android applications optimized for the Nook screen are also available, including app launchers, browsers, library managers, and an online book catalog browser and feed reader.
Although gaining superuser (root) access to install software on the Nook initially required physical disassembly of the device, [tpl]as of|2010|lc = on[/tpl] users can gain root access using software alone.Softroot – nookdevs.com (Retrieved January 2010).
A new hardware revision introduced in August 2010, identifiable by a serial number starting with 1003, running firmware 1.4.1, requires different software than the older models. Attempting to gain root access using software designed for older models renders the unit unusable.New nook says: no root for you! – hackaday.com (Retrieved August 2010).
As of October 2010, a new method involving spoofing a DNS entry has been found to root 1.4.1 Nooks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nookdevs.com/Rooting_New_Hardware|title=Rooting New Hardware|accessdate=November 4, 2010|work=nookDevs| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101021223305/http://nookdevs.com/Rooting_New_Hardware| archivedate= October 21, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Availability==

Barnes & Noble made the Nook available for pre-order in the United States for [tpl]US$|259[/tpl] following its launch on October 20, 2009 and began shipping on November 30, 2009.  The device was available for demonstration and display in Barnes and Noble retail stores in early December. Barnes & Noble began selling the Nook in-store in February 2010.
Due to the large number of pre-orders, the initial launch of the product involved multiple shipment dates depending on when customers ordered the Nook. The first shipment occurred as planned on November 30, but delays occurred with subsequent shipments as demand for the product exceeded production. Further shipments occurred December 7, December 18, January 4, January 11, January 15, February 1, and February 12.
Barnes & Noble sent a $100 gift certificate via email to customers who had been promised a delivery by December 24, 2009, but whose shipment was delayed past December 25.Marco Tabini, Barnes & Noble offers $100 gift certificates for Nook delays, Macworld (December 21, 2009).

==Reception==

The Nook initially received mixed reviews, ranging from favorable reviews from Time, Money, and PC Magazine to more critical reviews in Engadget and the New York Times. PC Magazine noted the color touchscreen, Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity, and large ebook library as advantages over the Nook's competitors, with a lack of support for HTML and Microsoft's .doc file format seen as negatives.[ref]

Critics pointed to the Nook's "sluggish" performance[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/07/barnes-and-noble-nook-review/ |author=Topolsky, Joshua |title=Barnes & Noble Nook review |publisher=Engadget[/tpl]
and user interface design, with New York Times reviewer David Pogue writing that the Nook suffered from "half-baked software."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/technology/personaltech/10pogue.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1 |author=Pogue, David |title=Not Yet the Season for a Nook |work=The New York Times | date=December 10, 2009 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl] Pogue later demonstrated using a postal scale that the Nook's weight differed from the product specifications advertised by Barnes & Noble (12.1 ounces rather than 11.2 ounces as the company had advertised).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/technology/personaltech/21pogue-email.html |author=Pogue, David |title=Bogus Tech Measurements  |work=The New York Times | date=January 21, 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl] Engadget reviewer Joshua Topolsky argued that menu responsiveness and organization was not optimal but commented that "many of the problems seem like they could be fixed with firmware tweaks." PC Magazine wrote that the 1.3 firmware update, released after most reviews of the Nook, improved the device's responsiveness: "On the original Nook, page turning took twice as long as page turning on the Kindle – two seconds compared to one second. With the 1.3 firmware update, it's about a tenth of a second slower than the Kindle, but the difference is negligible."
In early January 2010, the Nook was presented with the TechCrunch Best New Gadget Crunchie award for 2009.http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/08/crunchies-winner/
