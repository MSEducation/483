As Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in the early-1930s, Matsuhita is credited with devising the Gosei or "Five Reflections".Smith, Peter C. (2006). [tpl]Google books|ma1teOqjMNQC|Fist from the Sky: Japan's Dive-Bomber Ace of World War II, p. 63.|page=63[/tpl]  These words became traditional precepts of cadets at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. Every evening cadets were expected to meditate on these inter-related questions.Kennedy, Maxwell T. (2009).
