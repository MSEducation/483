Cesar Chavez (born César Estrada Chávez, [tpl]IPA-es|ˈsesaɾ esˈtɾaða ˈtʃaβes|local[/tpl]; March 31, 1927[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]April 23, 1993) was an American farm worker, labor leader and civil rights activist, who, with Dolores Huerta, co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers union, UFW).The Extra Mile – Points of Light Volunteer Pathway
A Mexican American, Chavez became the best known Latino American civil rights activist, and was strongly promoted by the American labor movement, which was eager to enroll Hispanic members. His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support. By the late 1970s, his tactics had forced growers to recognize the UFW as the bargaining agent for 50,000 field workers in California and Florida. However, by the mid-1980s membership in the UFW had dwindled to around 15,000.http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/june-22-2012/united-farm-workers-50th-anniversary/11407/
During his lifetime, Colegio Cesar Chavez was one of the few institutions named in his honor, but after his death he became a major historical icon for the Latino community, with many schools, streets, and parks being named after him. He has since become an icon for organized labor and leftist politics, symbolizing support for workers and for Hispanic empowerment based on grass roots organizing. He is also famous for popularizing the slogan "Sí, se puede" (Spanish for "Yes, one can" or, roughly, "Yes, it can be done"), which was adopted as the 2008 campaign slogan of Barack Obama. His supporters say his work led to numerous improvements for union laborers. His birthday, March 31, has become Cesar Chavez Day, a state holiday in California, Colorado, and Texas.

==Early life and education==

Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Arizona, in a Mexican-American family of six children.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/aa/chavez/aa_chavez_growup_1.html |title=Cesar Chavez Grows Up |publisher=America's Library |accessdate=February 8, 2010[/tpl] He was the son of Juana Estrada and Librado Chávez. He had two brothers, Richard (1929–2011) and Librado, and two sisters, Rita and Vicki.[tpl]cite news |first=Sam |last=Quinones |title=Richard Chavez dies at 81; brother of Cesar Chavez |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-richard-chavez-20110728,0,3713759.story |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=|date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2011-07-30[/tpl] He was named after his grandfather, Cesario.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ufw.org/_page.php?inc=history/07.html&menu=research |title=The Story of Cesar Chavez |publisher=United Farm Workers |accessdate=February 8, 2010[/tpl] Chavez grew up in a small adobe home, the same home in which he was born. His family owned a grocery store and a ranch, but their land was lost during the Great Depression. The family's home was taken away after his father had agreed to clear eighty acres of land in exchange for the deed to the house, an agreement which was subsequently broken. Later, when Chavez's father attempted to purchase the house, he could not pay the interest on the loan and the house was sold back to its original owner. His family then moved to California to become migrant farm workers.
The Chavez family faced many hardships in California. The family would pick peas and lettuce in the winter, cherries and beans in the spring, corn and grapes in the summer, and cotton in the fall.  When Chavez was a teenager, he and his older sister Rita would help other farm workers and neighbors by driving those unable to drive to the hospital to see a doctor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://chavez.cde.ca.gov/ModelCurriculum/Teachers/Lessons/Resources/Biographies/K-2_Bio.aspx |title=An American Hero – The Biography of César E. Chávez |publisher=California Department of Education |accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl]
In 1942, Chavez quit school in the seventh grade.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ch-Co/Ch-vez-C-sar.html |title=CÉsar ChÁvez Biography |publisher=Advameg Inc |accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] It would be his final year of formal schooling, because he did not want his mother to have to work in the fields. Chavez dropped out to become a full-time migrant farm worker.  In 1944 he joined the United States Navy at the age of seventeen and served for two years. Chavez had hoped that he would learn skills in the Navy that would help him later when he returned to civilian life.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EUC3UzoltS4C&lpg=PA30&ots=voFv7le6PX&dq=%22cesar%20chavez%22%20%22worst%20years%22%20navy&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Cesar Chavez: Crusader for Social Change |last=Haugen |first=Brenda |publisher=Compass Point Books |accessdate=May 18, 2011[/tpl] Later, Chavez described his experience in the military as “the two worst years of my life”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/itvs/fightfields/cesarchavez.html |title=The Fight in the Fields – Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Struggle |last=Tejada-Flores |first=Rick |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=December 7, 2010[/tpl]  When Chavez returned home from his service in the military, he married his high school sweetheart, Helen Fabela. The couple moved to San Jose, California, where they would have eight children.

==Activism==

Chavez worked in the fields until 1952, when he became an organizer for the Community Service Organization (CSO), a Latino civil rights group. He was hired and trained by Fred Ross as an organizer targeting police brutality. Chavez urged Mexican Americans to register and vote, and he traveled throughout California and made speeches in support of workers' rights. He later became CSO's national director in 1958.U.S. Department of Labor – Labor Hall of Fame – Cesar Chavez

===Worker's rights===

In 1962, Chavez left the CSO and co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) with Dolores Huerta. It was later called the United Farm Workers (UFW).
When Filipino American farm workers initiated the Delano grape strike on September 8, 1965, to protest for higher wages, Chavez eagerly supported them. Six months later, Chavez and the NFWA led a strike of California grape pickers on the historic farmworkers march from Delano to the California state capitol in Sacramento for similar goals. The UFW encouraged all Americans to boycott table grapes as a show of support. The strike lasted five years and attracted national attention. In March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held hearings in California on the strike. During the hearings, subcommittee member Robert F. Kennedy expressed his support for the striking workers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rfk/peopleevents/p_chavez.html |title=People & Events: Cesar Chavez (1927–1993) |date=July 1, 2004 |work=American Experience, RFK |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=March 31, 2009[/tpl]
These activities led to similar movements in Southern Texas in 1966, where the UFW supported fruit workers in Starr County, Texas, and led a march to Austin, in support of UFW farm workers' rights. In the Midwest, Chavez's movement inspired the founding of two midwestern independent unions: Obreros Unidos in Wisconsin in 1966, and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) in Ohio in 1967. Former UFW organizers would also found the Texas Farm Workers Union in 1975.
In the early 1970s, the UFW organized strikes and boycotts—including the Salad Bowl strike, the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history—to protest for, and later win, higher wages for those farm workers who were working for grape and lettuce growers. The union also won passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which gave collective bargaining rights to farm workers. During the 1980s, Chavez led a boycott to protest the use of toxic pesticides on grapes. Bumper stickers reading "NO GRAPES" and "UVAS NO" (the translation in Spanish) were widespread.http://www.ufwstore.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=IS0005&Product_Code=CB02&Category_Code=BTNS Original UFW Button He again fasted to draw public attention. UFW organizers believed that a reduction in produce sales by 15% was sufficient to wipe out the profit margin of the boycotted product.
Chavez undertook a number of "spiritual fasts", regarding the act as “a personal spiritual transformation”.Espinosa, G. and Garcia, M. Mexican American Religions:Spirituality activism and culture(2008) Duke University Press, p 108 In 1968, he fasted for 25 days, promoting the principle of nonviolence.Garcia, M. (2007) The Gospel of Cesar Chavez: My Faith in Action Sheed & Ward Publishing p. 103 In 1970, Chavez began a fast of "thanksgiving and hope" to prepare for pre-arranged civil disobedience by farm workers.Shaw, R. (2008) Beyond the Fields: Cesar Chavez, the UFW, and the struggle for justice in the 21st century University of California Press, p. 92. Also in 1972, he fasted in response to Arizona’s passage of legislation that prohibited boycotts and strikes by farm workers during the harvest seasons. These fasts were influenced by the Catholic tradition of penance and by Gandhi’s fasts and emphasis of nonviolence.

===Animal rights===

Chavez was a vegan both because he believed in animal rights and for his health.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/food_and_drink/271795/can_you_read_this_and_not_become_a_vegan.html |title=Can you read this and not become a vegan? |author=Sophie Morris |work=The Ecologist |location=London |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ozCagN5Y7xMJ:www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/food_and_drink/271795/can_you_read_this_and_not_become_a_vegan.html+%22he+remembers+C%C3%A9sar+Ch%C3%A1vez,+the+Mexican+farm+workers+activist+and+a+vegan%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |quote=...he remembers Cesar Chavez, the Mexican farm workers activist and a vegan[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://in-dios.blogspot.com/2008/03/soy-vegetariano.html |title=Vegetarians Add Some Cultural Flare to Meals |first=Gabriel |last=Ramirez |work=Más Magazine |publisher= |location=Bakersfield, California |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |archiveurl= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:G6lnbtj7KJIJ:in-dios.blogspot.com/2008/03/soy-vegetariano.html+%22Cesar+was+a+vegan.+He+didn%E2%80%99t+eat+any+animal+products.+He+was+a+vegan+because+he+believed+in+animal+rights+but+also+for+his+health%22&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com |archivedate=February 12, 2011 |quote=Cesar was a vegan.

==Controversies==

===Ferdinand Marcos===

In a failed attempt to reach out to Filipino-American farmworkers, Chavez met with then-President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos in Manila. There he endorsed the regime, which was seen by human rights advocates and religious leaders as a vicious dictatorship. This caused a rift within the UFW, which lead to Philip Vera Cruz's resignation from the organization.[tpl]cite news |title=Philip Vera Cruz: Visionary Labor Leader |author=Rodel Rodis |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/mindfeeds/mindfeeds/view/20070130-46474/Philip_Vera_Cruz%3A_Visionary_Labor_Leader |newspaper=Inquirer |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |quote=In one chapter of this book, Philip provides an account of his conflict with César Chávez over Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos.

===Immigration===

The UFW during Chavez's tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring undocumented immigrants. Later during the 1980s, while Chavez was still working alongside Huerta, he was key in getting the amnesty provisions into the 1986 federal immigration act."Debunking Falsehoods about the UFW’s Stand on Immigration"
On a few occasions, concerns that undocumented migrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the Imperial and Coachella Valleys to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of undocumented immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend Ralph Abernathy and U.S. Senator Walter Mondale.http://boxer.senate.gov/chavez/timeline.cfm[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] Official Website of Barbara Boxer "César Chávez Day Timeline" In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report undocumented immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520202198&id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&ots=X9eCyCQtaq&dq=UFW+report+undocumented&sig=I-BkkeqB84_UYgjh2Fs1affaln0#PPA197,M1 Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity By David Gregory Gutiérrez at p.197-98http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/A402_0_2_0_C/[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] Accuracy in the Media "Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration" By Reed Irvine and Cliff Kincaidhttp://books.google.com/books?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&pg=PA89&ots=3bsbckEtw7&dq=ufw+undocumented&sig=5j3oluULLZo4AfXwTVqrmvMhyAQ#PPA90,M1 Strawberry Fields: politics, class, and work in California agriculture By Miriam J.

In 1973, college professors in Mount Angel, Oregon, established the first four-year Mexican-American college in the United States. They chose Chavez as their symbolic figurehead, naming the college Colegio Cesar Chavez. In the book Colegio Cesar Chavez, 1973-1983: A Chicano Struggle for Educational Self-Determination, author Carlos Maldonado writes that Chavez visited the campus twice, joining in public demonstrations in support of the college. Though the college closed in 1983, it remains a recognized part of Oregon history. On its website, the Oregon Historical Society writes: "Structured as a 'college-without-walls', more than 100 students took classes in Chicano Studies, early childhood development, and adult education. Significant financial and administrative problems caused Colegio to close in 1983. Its history represents the success of a grassroots movement".Oregon Historical Society[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] "Colegio César Chávez" was established in 1973 on the site of the former Mt. Angel College and was the only degree-granting institution for Latinos in the nation.

===Cesar Chavez Day===

Cesar Chavez's birthday, March 31, is a state holiday in California, Colorado, and Texas. It is intended to promote community service in honor of Chavez's life and work. Many, but not all, state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed. Many public schools in the three states are also closed. Chavez Day is an optional holiday in Arizona. Although not a federal holiday, President Barack H. Obama proclaimed March 31 "Cesar Chavez Day" in the United States, with Americans being urged to "observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor César Chávez's enduring legacy".[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/30/presidential-proclamation-cesar-chavez-day |title=Presidential Proclamation: César Chávez Day |publisher=The White House |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2013[/tpl]
