McGowan and Ancona first met at a comedy club, and later started dating. They worked together on a number of projects, with their first television series being The Staggering Stories of Ferdinand de Bargos in 1989. After performing in his own show in Edinburgh in 1998, McGowan was approached by a BBC executive about working on a series, which he wanted Ancona to be involved in. Alistair McGowan's Big Impression first aired on BBC One in 2000, with the couple splitting up just before filming began. Speaking with The Independent, Ancona said working on the series was "exciting but it was tricky and there were some very low points. ... But, if anything, the tension added a little frisson to some of the sketches and it made the show better."[tpl]Cite news|last=Usborne|first=Simon|title=How We Met: Ronni Ancona & Alistair McGowan|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/how-we-met-ronni-ancona--alistair-mcgowan-870519.html|accessdate=12 September 2010|newspaper=The Independent on Sunday|date=20 July 2008[/tpl]
For the fourth series in 2003, McGowan's name was dropped from the show's title.
Speaking to the Daily Mail about the ending of the series, McGowan said: "We were just getting into our stride when suddenly it felt that there were five other shows all saying: "We'll do that as well." It felt like there were lots of people fishing in a small pool." The BBC wanted the series to continue, but he found his "enthusiasm had gone and without that, the show wouldn't have happened".[tpl]Cite news|last=Petty|first=Moira|title=After imitating the stars, Alistair McGowan's now making a bigger impression in a controversial play|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1024560/After-imitating-stars-Alistair-McGowans-making-bigger-impression-controversial-play.html|accessdate=12 September 2010|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=5 June 2008[/tpl]
