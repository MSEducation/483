[[Winter]]

CATEGORIES: Winter

Winter ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|t|ər[/tpl]) is the coldest season of the year in temperate climates, between autumn and spring. It is caused by the axis of the Earth in the respective hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather, but when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures.  At the winter solstice, the days are shortest and the nights are longest, with days lengthening as the season progresses after the solstice.

==Cause==

The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a big role in the weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, and this causes different latitudes on the Earth to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. It is this variation that primarily brings about the seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.
During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle. In regions experiencing winter, the same amount of solar radiation is spread out over a larger area. This effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat.  Compared with these effects, the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible.

==Meteorological reckoning==

Meteorological winter is the method of measuring the winter season used by meteorologists based on "sensible weather patterns" for record keeping purposes,[tpl]cite web|last=Huttner |first=Paul |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/2007/12/instant_meteorological_winter.shtml |title=Instant meteorological winter |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] so the start of meteorological winter can change depending on how far north one lives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2003/s2143.htm |title=Winter's Been Here Despite What the Calendar Says |publisher=NOAA Magazine |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere. The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern hemisphere and in June or July in the Southern hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching [tpl]convert|-40|F|C[/tpl] due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=diamond+dust&submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|title=Diamond Dust|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2010-01-21[/tpl]  They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape.[tpl]cite journal|publisher=California Institute of Technology|url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/Libbrecht%20Feature.pdf|page=12|year=2001|author=Kenneth G.

Accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the large land masses there. In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40°S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly Patagonia region of South America. Snow occurs year-round in Antarctica.

==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning==

In the Northern Hemisphere, some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the sun), regardless of weather conditions. In one version of this definition, winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the vernal equinox.http://answers.usa.gov/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&ARTICLE_ID=10512. In Standards: The Seasons. Retrieved 20 Dec 2012, from Answers.USA.gov
These dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter – usually considered to span the entirety of December, January, and February in the Northern Hemisphere and June, July, and August in the Southern.http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/when-does-autumn-start/.

Astronomically, the winter solstice, being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight, ought to be the middle of the season,[tpl]cite book|last=Ball|first=Sir Robert S|title=Elements of Astronomy|year=1900|publisher=The MacMillan Company|location=London|page=52|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sNSHRDu98k0C&pg=PA52&dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=snippet&q=midwinter&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Heck|first=Andre|title=Organizations and strategies in Astronomy Volume 7|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-5300-2|page=14|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YSsaxkeixH0C&pg=PA14&dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=onepage&q=astronomy%20%2Bmidwinter&f=false[/tpl] but seasonal lag means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks.

In the UK, meteorologists consider winter to be the three coldest months of December, January and February.[tpl]Cite book|title= Meteorological Glossary |edition= Sixth |year= 1991 |publisher= HMSO|location= London |isbn= 0-11-400363-7|page= 260[/tpl]

In Celtic nations such as Ireland (using the Irish calendar) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on All Hallows, or Samhain. Winter ends and spring begins on Imbolc, or Candlemas, which is 1 or 2 February . This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the Southern Hemisphere.)
Also, many mainland European countries tend to recognize Martinmas or St. Martin's Day (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] The day falls at midpoint between the old Julian equinox and solstice dates. Also, Valentine's Day (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.
In Chinese astronomy and other East Asian calendars, winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the Jiéqì (known as 立冬 lì dōng—literally, "establishment of winter").
The three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This "thermological winter" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on seasonal lag, this period will vary between climatic regions.
Cultural influences such as Christmas creep may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.

==Ecological reckoning and activity==

Ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based methods by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).[tpl]cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30[/tpl]  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.
To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering:
Some annual plants never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle, this is known as vernalization. As for perennials, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly deciduous trees, usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the flowering plum, which flowers in time for Chinese New Year. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called hardening.

==Exceptionally cold winters==

==Other historically significant winters==

==Humans and winter==

Humans evolved in tropical climates, and met cold weather as they migrated into Eurasia, although earlier populations certainly encountered Southern Hemisphere winters in Southern Africa. Micro-evolution in Caucasian, Asiatic and Inuit people show some adaptation to the climate.

===Winter and human health===

Humans are sensitive to cold, see hypothermia. Snowblindness, norovirus, seasonal depression, slipping on black ice and falling icicles are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter.

==Festivals==

==Mythology==

===In various cultures===

In Persian culture the winter solstice is called Yaldā (meaning: birth) and it has been celebrated for thousands of years. It is referred to as the eve of the birth of Mithra, who symbolised light, goodness and strength on earth.
In Greek mythology, Hades kidnapped Persephone to be his wife. Zeus ordered Hades to return her to Demeter, the goddess of the Earth and her mother. However, Hades tricked Persephone into eating the food of the dead, so Zeus decreed that Persephone would spend six months with Demeter and six months with Hades. During the time her daughter is with Hades, Demeter became depressed and caused winter.
In Welsh mythology, Gwyn ap Nudd abducted a maiden named Creiddylad. On May Day, her lover, Gwythr ap Greidawl, fought Gwyn to win her back. The battle between them represented the contest between summer and winter.

===Personifications===

In Bengali the advent of winter is often expressed by the sentence "Sheeter buri ashchhe dheye" which means "the winter old woman is coming fast". This is used especially when it is said to a child.
