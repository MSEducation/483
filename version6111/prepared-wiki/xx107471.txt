==Cash-for-votes scandal whistle blowers==

On 10 May 2011, Anton Sealey, the President of the Bahamas Football Association was attending an event in the run-up to the 61st FIFA Congress in Zurich, Switzerland, as such, he was unable to attended a meeting in the Hyatt Regency hotel, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad organised by Asian Football Confederation President and FIFA President candidate Mohammed bin Hammam and CONCACAF President and FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner.
Bahamas FA's Vice President, Fred Lunn, attended the meeting, there Lunn was given brown envelope with the word "Bahamas" on it, containing $40,000 USD. Believing it to be a bribe in a cash-for-votes scandal, funded by bin Hammam, Lunn reported the incident to Sealey who in turn reported it to CONCACAF General Secretary Chuck Blazer. Lunn took a photograph of the money and the envelope before returning them. He later gave journalists a digital copy of the photograph for publication.[tpl]cite web|title=FIFA cash bribe revealed Bahamas FA|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1392559/FIFA-cash-bribe-revealed-Bahamas-FA.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=31 May 2011[/tpl] 
As a result FIFA suspended both Warner and bin Hammam and launched an investigation.[tpl]cite web|title=Bin Hammam denied access to Fifa congress|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13590264.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=1 June 2011[/tpl] 
Bahamas-based newspaper The Tribune praised Sealey and Lunn for not accepting the loan: "The attempted bribe was an insult to the whole Caribbean. Those seeking the Caribbean Football Federation's vote obviously saw its members as coming from poor island nations who would never have seen so much money as fell from the brown envelope that was offered them. Many proved to their tempters that poor they might be, but they had pride, they had integrity and although they might never see so much money again, under such tainted conditions they would never stoop so low as to pick it up. As was pointed out, $40,000 for the Caribbean's smaller islands would be the equivalent of several years' salary."
