PEAQX is a competitive antagonist at the NMDA receptor. Although originally described as 100-fold selective for GluN1/GluN2A receptors vs. GluN1/GluN2B receptors, more detailed studiesFrizelle PA, Chen PE, Wyllie DJ Equilibrium constants for (R)-(S)-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid (NVP-AAM077) acting at recombinant NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors: Implications for studies of synaptic transmission. Molecular Pharmacology 2006 Sep;70(3):1022-32. PMID 16778008 of the Ki of PEAQX revealed it only shows a 5 fold difference in affinity for GluN1/GluN2A vs. GluN1/GluN2B receptors. It is also a potent anticonvulsant in animal tests.Auberson YP, Allgeier H, Bischoff S, Lingenhoehl K, Moretti R, Schmutz M. 5-Phosphonomethylquinoxalinediones as competitive NMDA receptor antagonists with a preference for the human 1A/2A, rather than 1A/2B receptor composition.
