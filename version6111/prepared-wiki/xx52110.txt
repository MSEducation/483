phpBB is an Internet forum package written in the PHP scripting language. The name "phpBB" is an abbreviation of PHP Bulletin Board. Available under the GNU General Public License, phpBB is free and open source software.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.phpbb.com/about/ | title = About phpBB | accessdate = 2010-08-22 [/tpl]
Features of phpBB include support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server), flat message structure (as opposed to threaded), hierarchical subforums, topic split/merge/lock, user groups, multiple attachments per post, full-text search, plugins and various notification options (e-mail, Jabber instant messaging, ATOM feeds).[tpl]cite web|title=phpBB Features|url=http://www.phpbb.com/about/features/?from=submenu|accessdate=2011-06-05[/tpl]

==History==

phpBB was started by James Atkinson as a simple UBB-like forum for his own website on June 17, 2000. Nathan Codding and John Abela joined the development team after phpBB's CVS repository was moved to SourceForge.net, and work on version 1.0.0 began. A fully functional, pre-release version of phpBB was made available in July.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forums.devshed.com/showthread.php?threadid=4914 |title=First phpBB 1.0 beta release |publisher=Forums.devshed.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
phpBB 1.0.0 was released on December 16, 2000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?p=135543#p135543|title=History of phpBB|accessdate=2011-09-24|date=June 7, 2002|publisher=phpBB.com[/tpl] with subsequent improvements to the 1.x codebase coming in two more major installments. The final release in the 1.x line was phpBB 1.4.4, released on November 6, 2001. During the lifetime of the 1.x series, Bart van Bragt, Paul S. Owen (former co-manager of the project), Jonathan Haase and Frank Feingold joined the team. phpBB 1.x is no longer supported and virtually no websites continue to use it.
In February 2001, phpBB 2.0.x began development entirely from scratch; the developer's ambitions for phpBB had outgrown the original codebase. Doug Kelly joined the team shortly afterwards. After a year of development and extensive testing, phpBB 2.0.0, dubbed the "Super Furry" version, was released on April 4, 2002, three days later than intended.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?p=135543#135543 |title=phpBB • View topic - what is the history of phpbb? |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
Work on phpBB 3.0.x began in late 2002. It was originally intended to be released as phpBB 2.2, and the first planned feature list was announced on May 25, 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=104463 |title=phpBB • View topic - 2.2 Feature List 25 May  |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=May 25, 2003 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] However, as development progressed, the developers realised that phpBB 2.1.x (the development release cycle for 2.2) had eliminated virtually all compatibility with the 2.0.x line, so the version number for release was changed to 3.0.0, in keeping with the Linux kernel versioning scheme, which phpBB followed at the time.[tpl]cite web|author=psoTFX |date=January 14, 2005 |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=256072 |title=phpBB • View topic - phpBB 2.2 is no more ... meet Olympus |publisher=Phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] In September 2005, Paul Owen resigned as the Development Team Leader and Meik Sievertsen was promoted to the role.
In March 2007, the phpBB team launched their new website, powered by phpBB3 with the new prosilver style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=526970 |title=New website launch announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=March 18, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] The prosilver style was originally not intended to be revealed until the final release of phpBB 3.0.0.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
On April 30, 2007, phpBB founder and co-Project Manager James Atkinson officially resigned from his duties towards phpBB, citing personal circumstances. With the announcement also came the announcement that phpBB was now newly independent, and that the team leaders would be collectively taking charge of the decisions in the future of the project. At the end of May, an announcement was made that Jonathan "SHS`" Stanley, the other co-Project Manager, was stepping down as well for personal reasons.
On July 7, 2007, the teams announced that phpBB had been nominated as a finalist for the SourceForge.net Community Choice Awards in the category of "Best Project for Communications".[tpl]cite web|last=Burn |first=Acyd |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=563023 |title=phpBB has made the Sourceforge CCA Finalist list! |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=July 7, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] At the end of the month, SourceForge.net announced that phpBB had won the award for "Best Project for Communications", and in honour of the award, SourceForge.net donated $1000 in phpBB's name to Marie Curie Cancer Care.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/landing-pages/cca07/ |title=Community Choice Awards 2007 Winners |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/community/cca-winners/ |title=CCA Winners Blog Post on |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] phpBB also won a "Thingamagoop" from Bleep Labs, and "bragging rights for a full year."[tpl]cite web|last=Burn |first=Acyd |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=572273 |title=phpBB's post on winning the Community Choice Award |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
The first beta of phpBB3 was released in June 2006,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=400283 |title=phpBB 3.0 Beta1 Release Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] and the first release candidate was released in May 2007.[tpl]cite web|last=Burn |first=Acyd |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=543015 |title=phpBB3 RC1 Release Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=May 20, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] The phpBB3 codebase received an external security audit in September, which was done by SektionEins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=584826 |title=phpBB3 Release Candidate 6 (release made after the security audit) |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] Finally, phpBB 3.0.0 "Olympus" (also dubbed the Gold release) was published on December 13, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/about/press/ |title=Press Release: phpBB Launches Next Wave of Social Networking and Forum Features |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=December 13, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=615945 |title=phpBB3 Gold Released |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=December 13, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
In September 2007, the teams launched an official phpBB podcast. It was recorded by a rotating group of phpBB team members with occasional guests, and discussed a number of phpBB-related topics, as well as answering questions e-mailed in from listeners.[tpl]cite web|author=Techie-Micheal |date=September 14, 2007|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=579959 |title=Official phpBB Podcast Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] However, the podcast only lasted for a few episodes and production ceased the following spring. Its successor is generally considered to be the new phpBB weblog, which launched in July 2008. The blog is written by phpBB team members (with occasional guest posts by community members) on various topics related to phpBB and provide users with a unique inside look at the activities of the phpBB teams.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1063915 |title=phpBB Blog Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
The phpBB teams held their first-ever phpBB users conference in London on July 20, 2008, which was titled "Londonvasion 2008."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1058455 |title=Londonvasion 2008 Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] Londonvasion featured presentations by phpBB team members on various topics important to the phpBB community, MOD authors, and developers. Londonvasion provided a unique opportunity to socialise with members of the phpBB teams. The event also represented the first time that most members of the teams had a chance to meet each other in person.
The phpBB teams underwent numerous changes in 2009. On January 1, the teams formally ended support for phpBB2.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1385785 |title=Support for phpBB 2.0.x has ended |publisher=phpBB.com |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] Many of the non-development teams released betas and release candidates of side projects during this time. The first beta of AutoMOD, an automatic installer of phpBB MODifications, was released by the MOD Team on December 22, 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1370895 |title=AutoMOD 1.0.0 Beta 1 released |publisher=phpBB.com |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] The first release candidate of the Unified MOD Install Library (UMIL), a framework for allowing MOD authors to design simple database installation scripts, was released by the MOD Team on January 12, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1405425 |title=Unified MOD Install Library (UMIL) 1.0.0 RC1 Released |publisher=phpBB.com |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] The first release candidate of the Support Toolkit, a package of tools to diagnose and fix common support-related issues with phpBB, was released by the Support Team on June 24.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1665575 |title=Support Toolkit RC1 |publisher=phpBB.com |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl]
On June 10, 2009 the phpBB Development Team broke with their precedent of keeping future development plans under wraps and publicly previewed a series of new features that would be coming in phpBB 3.0.6.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.phpbb.com/2009/06/10/phpbb-306-plans/ |title=phpBB 3.0.6 plans |publisher=phpBB.com |date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] After four RC releases, phpBB 3.0.6 was released on November 17.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1859035 |title=phpBB 3.0.6 released |publisher=phpBB.com |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] The most notable new features included a bare-bones quick reply editor (a feature which the teams had historically been firmly opposed to), support for ACM (cache) plugins, ATOM feed support, and a plugin-based CAPTCHA system, including built-in support for reCAPTCHA among others. The modularization of phpBB's CAPTCHA also provided an API for MOD authors to write CAPTCHA plugins, allowing for greater diversification of the CAPTCHAs used in phpBB installations. The MOD Team also ran a competition to encourage CAPTCHA plugin development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1705955 |title=Best Captcha Plugin Competition |publisher=phpBB.com |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl]
On July 29, 2009, the Development Team announced "significant changes" to the phpBB's development process and release cycle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1715935 |title=Significant phpBB (development) changes |publisher=phpBB.com |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] Chief among these was the decision to abandon the former Linux kernel versioning scheme, meaning that whether part of the version number was even or odd no longer was significant. As such, Ascraeus (the successor to 3.0.0 Olympus) is to become phpBB 3.1.0. (The original versioning scheme dictated that 3.1.x would be a development branch, meaning that Ascraeus would have been released as 3.2.0.) Subsequent feature releases of phpBB3 will be versioned as 3.2.0, 3.3.0, etc. phpBB 4.0.0 will represent a fundamentally redesigned version of phpBB. The strategy also committed the teams to continue supporting an older "stable" branch for at least 6–9 months after a newer "feature" branch was released. However, an exception was made for 3.0.6 which was already in development. Although it contained enough significant new features that it could have been considered a 3.1.0 release, it remained a part of the 3.0.x branch, which also meant that the teams did not have to simultaneously continue supporting 3.0.5 after 3.0.6's release.
In January 2010, Meik Sievertsen stepped down as Lead Developer, instead taking on the roles of developer and "Server Manager". Nils Adermann was then promoted to Lead Developer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1941725 |title=A Change in Development Leadership |publisher=phpBB.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-02[/tpl]

==phpBB2==

phpBB2 was the predecessor of the present-day phpBB3. Developed during 2001-2002, the source code was written primarily to run on PHP 3.0 and 4.0 (version 2.0.13 upped the minimum requirement to PHP 4.0.3 due to a necessary security fix), and by the time that phpBB3 was released in late 2007, the developers and other team members felt that it no longer met their quality coding standards, and announced plans for the retirement/end of support of 2.0.x within a few months of 3.0.0's release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=900655 |title=phpBB • View topic - Retirement/End of Support for phpBB 2.0.x |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] phpBB2 was never officially supported under PHP 5. Although many users had no problems running it after making a few changes to PHP 5's default configuration settings, the teams chose not to offer support for this configuration.[tpl]cite web|last=Koopmanschap |first=Stefan |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=211009 |title=phpBB statement regarding PHP5 |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=July 17, 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
Official support for phpBB2 ended on January 1, 2009,[tpl]cite web|author=Marshalrusty |date=January 1, 2009 |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1385785 |title=Support for phpBB 2.0.x has ended |publisher=Phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] and the 2.0.x support forums have been locked. Furthermore all development for phpBB2, including security patches, has ceased as of February 1, 2009. However, a number of unofficial support sites for phpBB2 have formed to fill the void.
Many administrators still prefer to run phpBB2 because it provides a much simpler administration interface and has a thriving ecosystem of MODs (modifications) and styles that allow admins many options for customising the software to their liking. Others still run phpBB2 because they have installed many MODs, none of which are compatible with phpBB3.
The default theme in phpBB2 is named subSilver, and was designed by Tom "subBlue" Beddard. At the time that it premiered in 2001, it was a revolutionary new design for bulletin boards[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl], and many bulletin board themes since have borrowed many cues and design elements from subSilver.
Some of phpBB2's major features included the following:
The last official release of the 2.0.x line is 2.0.23, released on February 17, 2008.[tpl]cite web|last=Burn |first=Acyd |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=772285 |title=phpBB 2.0.23 Release Announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=February 17, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] However, the code for phpBB 2.0.24 still remains, unreleased, in the Git repository.

==Future development==

On September 28, 2013, phpBB released the latest stable version: phpBB3 release, 3.0.12. 
On June 10, 2009, phpBB's Development Team revealed that the next phpBB3 release, 3.0.6, would include a significant number of new features.phpBB 3.0.6 plans This is unusual for a minor release which is typically limited to bug and security fixes. New features would include support for new CAPTCHA plugins, ATOM feeds, support for new cache plugins (XCache, Alternative PHP Cache, eAccelerator, Memcache, and a "null" no-cache plugin), and quick reply (an often-requested feature by a subset of phpBB users) among other minor feature additions. phpBB 3.0.6 has had four RC releases and its final release was on November 17, 2009.
The Development Team has begun working on phpBB 3.1, formerly phpBB 3.2. (Before July 29, 2009, phpBB followed the original Linux kernel versioning scheme, in which the middle number represents a development version if it is odd and a stable version if it is even).[tpl]cite web|author=phpBB|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1715935|title=Significant phpBB (development) changes|publisher=phpBB Group|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-30[/tpl] The developers previewed their planned feature list at Londonvasion, and new features include a complete overhaul of the Moderator Control Panel (MCP) and moderation capabilities, implementation of AJAX where it is applicable and helpful, a trigger-based event system, a completely rewritten BBCode system, RSS feed support, enhancements to custom profile fields, enhancements to private messaging, a new authentication system with OpenID support, and numerous other small changes and features.[tpl]cite web|author=phpBB |url=http://vimeo.com/1536143 |title=05 phpBB 3.1 Features on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] The phpBB teams maintain a website for phpBB development named Area51. In keeping with the tradition to codename every new phpBB3 release after Martian mountains, phpBB 3.1 will be code-named "Ascraeus," named after Ascraeus Mons, the second-tallest mountain on Mars. (Olympus Mons, which 3.0 was named after, is the tallest.)
In addition to development of phpBB 3.1, other phpBB teams also are in the process of developing numerous other tools for use by the community. Development for these tools was followed on the phpBB Code Forge, which contained the Subversion repositories for these tools and the main phpBB development trunk. In March 2010, phpBB moved source code versioning from Subversion to Git.[tpl]cite web|author=phpBB|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2015905|title=phpBB moves source code versioning from Subversion to Git|publisher=phpBB Group|date=March 7, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-07[/tpl] On April 26, 2013, phpBB 3.1 entered the stage of feature freeze.[tpl]cite web|url=http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=81&t=44195 | title=3.1 feature freeze|date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl]

==MODs==

MODs are code modifications created by the phpBB community, often used to extend the functionality of or change the display of phpBB. The term is capitalised to distinguish code modifications from forum moderators, the latter of which is often abbreviated as mods. Modifications referred to in this manner are not authored by the phpBB developers, and do not enjoy the same level of support as unmodified official code. The phpBB MOD Team, headed by David Colón (known as DavidIQ in the community), accepts modifications from community sources for validation, and modifications which meet the MOD Team's standards are made available for download from the phpBB MOD Database. Other sites also provide phpBB2 and phpBB3 modifications for download. Some of the sites have their own standards which they validate to, and other sites do not do any validation, however the phpBB teams do not offer support for boards using MODs downloaded from sites other than phpBB.com. Documentation for phpBB3 MODding is provided by the MOD Team.

===MODX===

MODX is an XML-based document format developed by the phpBB MOD Team that is used to describe the steps required to modify the source code of a web application in order to install a modification.phpBB.com Although it can theoretically be utilised for any web application, it was developed for and is primarily used by MODs for phpBB. The phpBB MOD Team requires that MODs submitted to its database conform to the MODX specifications and other policies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/mods/policies/general.php |title=phpBB3 MOD Database Policies |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=January 18, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] The primary purpose of using an XML-based format is to better allow automatic installation tools, such as AutoMOD, to read and complete the installation instructions. MODX files can be viewed in a web browser using an included XSL file. The latest revision of the MODX spec is 1.2.3, released on September 27, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1795565 |title=phpBB • View topic - MODX 1.2.3 Released |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=September 26, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-27[/tpl]

===AutoMOD===

AutoMOD is a tool developed by the phpBB MOD Team that parses and automatically installs phpBB3 MODs distributed in the MODX format. Users simply have to upload the contents of a MOD download to their phpBB source directory and run AutoMOD, which will parse the MOD instructions and make the necessary file changes. Depending on the server configurations, it will either automatically merge the changes into place using FTP, or will create a compressed archive of the changed files for the user to copy into place. AutoMOD is also used by the MOD Team members during validation to ensure that the MODX files are valid and the MOD can be successfully installed on a vanilla phpBB installation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/mods/automod/ |title=AutoMOD information page |publisher=Phpbb.com |date=January 25, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
The current version of AutoMOD is 1.0.0.1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=225&t=1368025 |title=Current Version: AutoMOD 1.0.0.1 |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-06[/tpl] AutoMOD can be downloaded from the AutoMOD information pagephpBB.com and support can be obtained in the AutoMOD support forum.phpBB.com
AutoMOD is the successor to EasyMOD, a tool for phpBB2 which was also developed by the phpBB MOD Team and performed essentially the same task. The last version of EasyMOD was 0.4.0, released on June 30, 2008.[tpl]cite web|author=TerraFrost |date=June 30, 2008 |url=http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=29652 |title=EasyMOD 0.4.0 release announcement |publisher=Area51.phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] Support for EasyMOD is no longer provided since phpBB2 is retired.Area51.phpBBb.com

===Unified MOD Installation Library (UMIL)===

The Unified MOD Installation library is a library designed to simplify the installation and uninstallation of the database side of MODs.phpbb.com It is designed to be useful for configuring the forum for the new MOD, performing database actions such as adding and removing tables and columns, and purging the forum's cache. UMIL is GPL licensed and the latest version is 1.0.5.phpbb.com - Unified MOD Install Library (UMIL) 1.0.5 Released It can be downloaded from the UMIL page.phpBB.com To create a UMI-file automatically, a MOD author can use the Unified MOD Installation File creation tool.phpBB.com

==Security==

In December 2004, a large number of Web sites were defaced by the Santy worm, which used vulnerabilities in outdated versions of phpBB2 to overwrite PHP and HTML pages.[tpl]cite web|author=psoTFX |date=December 18, 2004 |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=248046 |title=phpBB team response to Santy worm |publisher=Phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] Although these were the result of outdated versions of PHP and phpBB,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] incidents like these have caused the security of phpBB to be disputed. There have also been a few times where new releases of phpBB have come out a few days apart, although the last occurrence of this was in early 2005.[tpl]cite web|author=dhn |date=February 27, 2005 |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=267563 |title=phpBB 2.0.13 release announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] However, the phpBB Team usually responds to security reports as soon as possible, and releases a new version quickly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] The phpBB Group, attempting to learn from previous failures, performed a codebase security audit before the release of 2.0.18.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=336756 |title=phpBB 2.0.18 release announcement |publisher=Phpbb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl] The phpBB3 codebase received an external security audit in September 2007, which was done by SektionEins.SektionEins.de The sixth release candidate of phpBB3 was published following the results of the security audit.
Changes were made to phpBB2 to avoid problems in the future, such as a re-authentication system for the administration panel, backported from phpBB3.
