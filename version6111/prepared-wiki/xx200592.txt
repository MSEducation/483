[[SN 2007uy]]

CATEGORIES: Supernovae, Astronomical objects discovered in 2007

SN 2007UY was a supernova that occurred in the spiral galaxy NGC 2770. It was discovered by Yoji Hirose on December 31, 2007. While interesting in its own right, it was overshadowed by SN 2008D, a supernova whose burst was observed serendipitously while SN 2007UY was being studied by Swift, something unprecedented in astronomy.
