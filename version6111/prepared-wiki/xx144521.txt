Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ibrahim or Ibrahim Secondary School is a  secondary school in the town of Sungai Petani in the northern Malaysian state of Kedah.

==History==

Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ibrahim was established in August, 1919 by Mr. E.A.G Stuart, who was the Superintendent of Education of Kedah and Perlis, of colonial British-Malaya. The school was named Government English School. The school consisted of a longhouse with cemented floor and wooden walls, consisting of three classrooms.
Before the school was opened, Mr. Stuart invited teachers from the Government English School (now known as Sultan Abdul Hamid College), Alor Setar to hold the position of School Principal of the newly formed school. Allahyarham Tuan Syed Jan was selected to be the first School Headmaster.
Most of the initial students came from an Anglo Chinese school which closed down. Student qualification of the school was different from other schools. The lowest standard was known as Class Primary. Students studied two years in Class Primary which was known as Primary 1 and Primary 2 before advancing to Standard 1. Students who were bright were allowed to advance to Standard 1 after only one year in Class Primary.
In 1921 and 1922, three more teachers were sent to the school in view of the increasing number of students. The Government rented a shop house in Jalan Petri to cater for this purpose.
In 1935, the school was relocated to Jalan Kolam Air, where the school currently stands and was renamed as Sultan Hamid School. The school was further renamed in 1936, in honour of Almarhum Yang Teramat Mulia Tengku Ibrahim Ibni Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, the Regent of Kedah (1913â€“1914).
