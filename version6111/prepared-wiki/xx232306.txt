==Information==

Slug is a common name for a shell-less terrestrial gastropod mullusk. The word "slug" is also often used as part of the name of any gastropod mollusc that is shell-less, has a very reduced shell, or just has a small internal shell. (This is in contrast to the common name "snail", which is a part to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is big enough that the softer parts of the animal can retract fully into it.
