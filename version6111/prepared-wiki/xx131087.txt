==Career==

===Barnsley===

Born in Scunthorpe, Jarman came through the youth ranks with Barnsley. He made his debut on 20 November 2004 against Oldham Athletic. In 2006 he played 2 games on loan with Bury, getting sent off on his debut. Jarman went on loan to Conference North side Worksop Town in February 2007. He played 13 times for the Tigers, scoring four goals. While his goal return was not as high as would have been hoped by manager Ian Bowling, some of his goals will live long in the memory of the Worksop fans. He marked his debut with a stunning overhead kick against Barrow and then added a 30-yard volley that crashed in off the post against Redditch. Jarman was eventually released from Oakwell at the end of the 2006–07 season.

===Grimsby Town===

In September 2007, Grimsby Town manager Alan Buckley brought Jarman to Blundell Park on a trial, following the advice of his assistant manager Stuart Watkiss, who had coached at his former club Barnsley. After a successful trial period, Jarman was rewarded with a one month contract. Nathan managed to provide his fitness in the early part of the season in which he scored twice for the Reserves in four games. Jarman was sent off in his full Grimsby debut, away at Rochdale, but did enough in the remaining games to earn a one-year deal, as the Mariners stumbled to a disappointing season end. He was often only known to made a cameo role in first team affairs under Buckley, and was a regular sight on the Grimsby substitute bench.
He managed to score his first senior goal in a Football League Trophy tie at Chesterfield on 3 September 2008. The Mariners struggled in the early part of the 2008–09 season and Buckley was dismissed as the club's manager. In stepped Mike Newell as his replacement, and despite Grimsby's ongoing poor luck in the League, Jarman soon found himself a first team regular, this was mainly down to the release of want-away striker Martin Butler and on-going fitness problems with Danny North. This enabled Nathan to hold down a regular place in the first team squad, partnering fellow youngster Peter Bore up front for several weeks. Nathan scored his first league goal for Grimsby in the club's 2–0 away win over his former club Bury. This was The Mariners first league victory of the season. Jarman continued to feature in the first team, but due to the arrivals of new strikers Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro, Adam Proudlock and Barry Conlon, Jarman found himself relegated back to the bench, before Newell moved him on to the right side of midfield, a position which had become his regular position in the first team during the run in of the 2008–09 season.
Coupled with several injuries and new additions to the playing squad, Jarman would only manage to play a cameo role in first team affairs during the 2009–10 season. He had only made 7 league appearances between August and February, failing to score a goal. His most recent game for the club was in the 1–1 home draw with relegation rivals Macclesfield Town, in which Jarman came on as a substitute for Tommy Wright in the 80th minute, only to be shown a red card in the 90th minute. Having not being included in the first team for one reason or another was something that eventually boiled over within the player, and after several rants on the social networking site Facebook, Jarman's status updates had been shown to his manager Neil Woods. The latest reading from Jarman's Facebook account read "As if not being allowed to train with the first team wasn't bad enough – now I'm not allowed to play for the Reserves." Woods was asked if Jarman had played his last game for the club, in which Woods replied "Maybe", he also claimed that Jarman had been training with the youth team, and stated that the individual issues will be discussed at the end of the season, and for the moment he is looking for focus from his team who are involved in a second successive relegation battle.http://www.sportgrimsby.co.uk/grimsbytown/Jarman-s-Town-career/article-1991339-detail/article.html?

===Chester===
