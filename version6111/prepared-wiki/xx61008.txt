Sangharakshita formally retired in 1995 and in 2000 stepped down from the movement's leadership, but he remains its dominant figure, and lives at its headquarters in Coddington, England.[tpl]cite web|title=Adhisthana|url=http://adhisthana.org/|publisher=Triratna Buddhist Order|accessdate=19 February 2014[/tpl]  Sangharakshita has often been regarded as a controversial teacher, and has been criticised for having had sexual relations with Order members.[tpl]citation | first = Karma Lekshe | last = Tsomo | year = 2000 | title = Innovative Buddhist women: swimming against the stream | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-7007-1253-4 | page = 266 [/tpl]

==Early life==

Sangharakshita was born Dennis Philip Edward Lingwood in Stockwell, London, in 1925.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | first2 = Margaret Z. | last2 = Wilkins | year = 2006 | title = A Reader in New Religious Movements | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-6168-9 | page = 46 [/tpl] After being diagnosed with a heart condition he spent much of his childhood confined to bed, and used the opportunity to read widely.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | first2 = Margaret Z. | last2 = Wilkins | year = 2006 | title = A Reader in New Religious Movements | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-6168-9 | page = 47 [/tpl] His first encounter with non-Christian thought was with Madame Helena Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled,[tpl]citation | first = Donald S | last = Lopez Jr | year = 2002 | title = A Modern Buddhist Bible: Essential Readings from East and West | publisher = Beacon Press | isbn = 0-8070-1243-2 | page = 186 [/tpl] upon reading which, he later said, he realised that he had never been a Christian.[tpl]citation | first = Stephen | last = Batchelor | year = 1994 | title = The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture | publisher = Parallax Press | isbn = 0-938077-69-4 | page = 323 [/tpl] The following year he came across two Buddhist texts—the Diamond Sutra and the Platform Sutra—and concluded that he had always been a Buddhist.
As Dennis Lingwood, he joined the Buddhist Society at the age of 18,[tpl]citation | first = John | last = Snelling | year = 1999 | title = The Buddhist Handbook: A Complete Guide to Buddhist Schools, Teaching, Practice, and History | publisher = Inner Traditions | isbn = 0-89281-761-5 | page = 230 [/tpl] and formally became a Buddhist in May 1944 by taking the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from the Burmese monk, U Thittila.
He was conscripted into the army in 1943, and served in India, Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon), and Singapore as a radio engineer[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | year = 1999 | title = Exploring New Religions | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-5959-5 | page = 225 [/tpl] in the Royal Signal Corps.[tpl]citation | first = Charles S. | last = Prebish | year = 1999 | title = Luminous passage: the practice and study of Buddhism in America | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 0-520-21697-0 | page = 47 [/tpl]
It was in Sri Lanka, while in contact with the swamis in the (Hindu) Ramakrishna Mission, that he developed the desire to become a monk.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | first2 = Margaret Z. | last2 = Wilkins | year = 2006 | title = A Reader in New Religious Movements |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-6168-9 | pages = 47–48 [/tpl] In 1946, after the cessation of hostilities, he was transferred to Singapore, where he made contact with Buddhists and learned to meditate.

==India==

Having been conscripted into the Army and posted to India, at the end of the war Sangharakshita handed in his rifle, left the camp where he was stationed and deserted.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | first2 = Margaret Z. | last2 = Wilkins | year = 2006 | title = A Reader in New Religious Movements | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-6168-9 | page = 48 [/tpl] He moved about in India for a few years,with a Bengali novice Buddhist, the future Buddharakshita, as his companion, meditating and experiencing for himself the company of eminent spiritual personalities of the times, like Mata Anandamayi, Ramana Maharishi and Swamis of Ramakrishna Mission. They spent fifteen months in 1947-48, in the Ramakrishna Mission centre at Muvattupuzha with the consent of Swami Tapasyananda and Swami Agamananda.  In May 1949 he became a novice monk, or sramanera, in a ceremony conducted by the Burmese monk, U Chandramani, who was then the most senior monk in India. It was then that he was given the name Sangharakshita (Pali: Sangharakkhita), which means "protected by the spiritual community." Sangharakshita took full bhikkhu ordination the following year, with another Burmese bhikkhu, U Kawinda, as his preceptor (upādhyāya), and with the Ven. Jagdish Kashyap as his teacher (ācārya). He studied Pali, Abhidhamma, and Logic with Jagdish Kashyap at Benares (Varanasi) University. In 1950, at Kashyap's suggestion, Sangharakshita moved to the hill town of Kalimpong close to the borders of India, Bhutan, Nepal. and Sikkim, and only a few miles from Tibet. Kalimpong was his base for 14 years until his return to England in 1966.
During his time in Kalimpong, Sangharakshita formed a young men's Buddhist association and established an ecumenical centre for the practice of Buddhism (the Triyana Vardhana Vihara). He also edited the Maha Bodhi Journal and established a magazine, Stepping Stones.[tpl]citation | first = Harry | last = Oldmeadow | year = 1999 | title = Journeys East: 20th century Western encounters with Eastern religious traditions | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-5959-5 | page = 280 [/tpl] In 1951, Sangharakshita met the German-born Lama Govinda, who was the first Buddhist Sangharakshita had known "to declare openly the compatibility of art with the spiritual life", and who gave Sangharakshita a greater appreciation for Tibetan Buddhism.[tpl]citation | first = Stephen | last = Batchelor | year = 1994 | title = The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture | publisher = Parallax Press | isbn = 0-938077-69-4 | pages = 328–329 [/tpl] Govinda had begun his explorations of Buddhism in the Theravada tradition, studying briefly under the German-born bhikkhu, Nyanatiloka Mahathera (who gave him the name Govinda), but after meeting the Gelug Lama, Tomo Geshe Rinpoche, in 1931, he turned towards Tibetan Buddhism.[tpl]citation | first = Donald | last = Lopez |year=2002 | title = A Modern Buddhist Bible: Essential Readings from East and West | publisher = Beacon Press | isbn = 978-0-8070-1243-7 | page = 98 [/tpl] Sangharakshita's spiritual explorations were to follow a similar trajectory.
Sangharakshita was ordained in the Theravada school, but said he became disillusioned by what he felt was the dogmatism, formalism, and nationalism of many of the Theravadin bhikkhus he met and became increasingly influenced by Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had fled Tibet after the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. Two years after his meeting with Lama Govinda he began studying with the Gelug Lama, Dhardo Rinpoche. Sangharakshita also received initiations and teachings from teachers who included Jamyang Khyentse, Dudjom Rinpoche, as well as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. It was Dhardo Rinpoche who was to give Sangharakshita Mayahana ordination. Later, Sangharakshita also studied with a Ch'an teacher, Yogi Chen (Chen Chien-Ming), along with another English monk, Bhikkhu Khantipalo.[tpl]citation | first = Laurence | last = Khantipalo | year = 2002 | title = Noble Friendship: Travels of a Buddhist Monk | publisher = Windhorse Publications | isbn = 1-899579-46-X | pages = 140–142 [/tpl] Together, the three men turned their ongoing seminar on Buddhist theory and practice into a book, Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical.[tpl]citation | first = C.M. | last = Chen | year = 1983 | title = Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical (Volume 42 of Hsientai fohsüeh tahsi) | publisher = Mile ch'upanshe | isbn = | page = xiii [/tpl]
In 1952, Sangharakshita met Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar[tpl]citation | first = Stephen | last = Batchelor | year = 1994 | title = The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture | publisher = Parallax Press | isbn = 0-938077-69-4 | page = 331 [/tpl] (1891–1956), the chief architect of the Indian constitution and India's first law minister. Ambedkar, who had been a so-called Untouchable, converted to Buddhism, along with 380,000 other Untouchables (now known as "dalits") on 14 October 1956.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | year = 1999 | title = Exploring New Religions | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-5959-5 | page = 226 [/tpl] Ambedkar and Sangharakshita had been in correspondence since 1950, and the Indian politician had encouraged the young monk to expand his Buddhist activities.[tpl]citation | first = debjani | last = Ganguly | year = 2005 | title = Caste, Colonialism, and Counter-Modernity: Notes on a Postcolonial Hermeneutics of Caste | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-34294-5 | pages = 167–168 [/tpl] Ambedkar appreciated Sangharakshita's "commitment to a more critically engaged Buddhism that did not at the same time dilute the cardinal precepts of Buddhist thought".[tpl]citation | first = debjani | last = Ganguly | year = 2005 | title = Caste, Colonialism, and Counter-Modernity: Notes on a Postcolonial Hermeneutics of Caste | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-34294-5 | page = 168 [/tpl] Ambedkar initially invited Sangharakshita to perform his conversion ceremony, but the latter refused, arguing that U Chandramani should preside. Ambedkar died six weeks later, leaving his conversion movement leaderless, and Sangharakshita, who had just arrived in Nagpur to visit dalit Buddhists, continued what he felt was Ambedkar's work by lecturing to former Untouchables, and presiding over a ceremony in which a further 200,000 Untouchables converted. For the next decade, Sangharakshita spent much of his time visiting dalit Buddhist communities in western India.[tpl]citation | first = debjani | last = Ganguly | year = 2005 | title = Caste, Colonialism, and Counter-Modernity: Notes on a Postcolonial Hermeneutics of Caste | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-34294-5 | page = 169 [/tpl]

==Return to the West==

In 1964, Sangharakshita was invited to help with a dispute at the Hampstead Buddhist Vihara in north London, where he proved to be a popular teacher. His ecumenical approach and failure to conform to some of the trustees' expectations was said to contrast with the strict Theravadin-style Buddhism at the vihara. Although originally planning to stay only six months, he decided to settle in England, but after he returned to India for a farewell tour, the Vihara's trustees voted to expel him.
Sangharakshita returned to England and in April 1967 founded the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. The Western Buddhist Order was founded a year later, when he ordained the first dozen men and women. The first ordinations were attended by a Zen monk, a Shin priest, and two Theravadin monks.[tpl]citation | first = Andrew | last = Rawlinson | year = 1997 | title = The Book of Enlightened Masters | publisher = Open Court | isbn = 0-8126-9310-8 | page = 503 [/tpl]
Satisfied neither with the lay-Buddhist approach of the Buddhist Society, nor the monastic approach of the Hampstead vihara—the two dominant Buddhist organisations in Britain at that time—he created what he said was a new form of Buddhism. The order would be neither lay nor monastic,[tpl]citation | first = Christopher S. | last = Queen | first2 = Sallie B. | last2 = King | year = 1996 | title = Engaged Buddhism | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn = 0-7914-2844-3 | page = 86 [/tpl] and members take a set of ten precepts that are a traditional part of Mahayana Buddhism.[tpl]citation | first = Damien | last = Keown | year = 2003 | title = A Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = Oxford University Press US | isbn = 0-8126-9310-8 | page = 70 [/tpl]
Initially, Sangharakshita led all classes and conducted all ordinations. He gave lectures drawing on what he felt were the essential teachings of all the major Buddhist schools.[tpl]citation | first = George D. | last = Chryssides | first2 = Margaret Z. | last2 = Wilkins | year = 2006 | title = A Reader in New Religious Movements | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn = 0-8264-6168-9 | page = 49 [/tpl] He led major retreats twice a year and frequent day and weekend events. As the order grew, and centres became established across Britain and in other countries, order members took more responsibility until, in August 2000, he devolved his responsibilities as the head of the Western Buddhist Order to eight men and women who formed what was called the "College of Public Preceptors."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dharmalife.com/issue19/unravelmap.html |title=Have Map, Can Unravel |publisher=Dharmalife.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-23 [/tpl]

==Sexual misconduct==

In 1997, Sangharakshita became the focus for controversy when The Guardian newspaper published complaints concerning some of his sexual relationships with FWBO members during the 1970s and 1980s.[tpl]citation | first = Karma Lekshe | last = Tsomo | year = 2000 | title = Innovative Buddhist Women: Swimming Against the Stream | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-7007-1219-9 | pages = 266–267 [/tpl] For a decade following these public revelations, he declined to give any response to concerns from within the movement that he had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men. He later addressed the controversy, stressing that his sexual partners were, or appeared to be, willing, and expressed regret for any mistakes.[tpl]citation | last = Vajragupta | year = 2010 | title = The Triratna Story: Behind the Scenes of a New Buddhist Movement | publisher = Windhorse | isbn = 978-1-899579-92-1 [/tpl]

==Contributions and legacy==

Sangharakshita has been described as "among the first Westerners who devoted their life to the practice as well as the spreading of Buddhism," and as a "prolific writer, translator, and practitioner of Buddhism."[tpl]citation | first = Francis | last = Brassard | year = 2000 | title = The Concept of Bodhicitta in Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn = 978-0-7914-4575-4 | pages = 22–23 [/tpl] As a Westerner seeking to use Western concepts to communicate Buddhism, he has been compared to Teilhard de Chardin,[tpl]citation | first = Francis | last = Brassard | year = 2000 | title = The Concept of Bodhicitta in Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn = 0-7914-4575-5 | page = 23 [/tpl] termed "the founding father of Western Buddhism," and noted as "a skilled innovator in his efforts to translate Buddhism to the West."
For Sangharakshita, as with other Buddhists, the factor that unites all Buddhist schools is not any particular teaching, but the act of "going for refuge" (sarana-gamana), which he regards "not simply as a formula but as a life-changing event" and as an ongoing "reorientation of one's life away from mundane concerns to the values embodied in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha."[tpl]citation | first = Stephen | last = Batchelor | year = 1994 | title = The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture | publisher = Parallax Press | isbn = 0-938077-69-4 | page = 334 [/tpl] Any decisive act upon the spiritual path—renunciation, ordination, initiation, the attainment of Stream Entry, and the arising of the bodhicitta—are manifestations or examples of Going for Refuge.[tpl]citation | first = Stephen | last = Batchelor | year = 1994 | title = The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture | publisher = Parallax Press | isbn = 0-938077-69-4 | page = 335 [/tpl]
Among his distinctive views is his use of the scientific theory of evolution as a metaphor for spiritual development, referring to biological evolution as the "lower evolution" and spiritual development as being a form of self-directed "higher evolution".  He considered women to be less evolved than men, and actively attacked the idea of heterosexual relationships.  The FWBO has been accused of cult like behavior for advising hetrosexual men to engage in sexual relationships with the "teachers" in order to obtain spiritual growth. He has drawn parallels between Buddhism and the spirit of the Romantics, who believed that what art reveals has great moral and spiritual significance, and has written of "the religion of art."[tpl]citation | first = David L. | last = McMahan | year = 2008 | title = The Making of Buddhist Modernism | publisher = Oxford University Press US | isbn = 0-19-518327-4 | page = 334 [/tpl]
Including compilations of his talks, Sangharakshita has authored more than 60 books. Meanwhile, the Triratna Buddhist Community, which he founded as the FWBO, has been described as "perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization".[tpl]citation | first = Harry L. | last = Oldmeadow | year = 2004 | title = Journeys East: 20th century Western encounters with Eastern religious traditions | publisher = World Wisdom, Inc | isbn = 0-941532-57-7 | page = 280 [/tpl] The community is one of the three largest Buddhist movements in Britain,[tpl]citation | first = Gwilym | last = Beckerlegge | year = 2001 | title = From Sacred Text to Internet | publisher = Ashgate | isbn = 978-0-7546-0748-9 | page = 147 [/tpl] and has a presence in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. More than a fifth of all Western Buddhist Order members, as of 2006, were in India,[tpl]citation | first = Sally | last = McAra | year = 2007 | title = Land of Beautiful Vision: Making a Buddhist Sacred Place in New Zealand | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2996-4 | page = 18 [/tpl] where Dr. Ambedkar's mission to convert dalits to Buddhism continues.[tpl]citation | first = Sally B. | last = King | year = 2005 | title = Being Benevolence: The Social Ethics of Engaged Buddhism | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2935-3 | page = 79 [/tpl] Martin Baumann, a scholar of Buddhism, has estimated that there are 100,000 people worldwide who are affiliated with the Triratna Buddhist Community.
For Buddhologist Francis Brassard, Sangharakshita's major contribution is "without doubt his attempt to translate the ideas and practices of Buddhism into Western languages."[tpl]citation | first = Francis | last = Brassard | year = 2000 | title = The Concept of Bodhicitta in Śāntideva's Bodhícaryāvatāra | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn = 978-0-7914-4575-4 | pages = 22–23 [/tpl] The non-denominational nature of the Triratna Buddhist Community, its equal ordination for both men and women,[tpl]citation | first = Sally | last = McAra | year = 2007 | title = Land of Beautiful Vision: Making a Buddhist Sacred Place in New Zealand | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2996-4 | page = 60 [/tpl] and its evolution of new forms of shared practice, such as what it calls team-based right livelihood projects, have been cited as examples of such "translation", and also as the creation of a "Buddhist society in miniature within the Western, industrialized world".[tpl]Citation | last = Baumann | first = Martin | title = Working in the Right Spirit:The Application of Buddhist Right Livelihood in the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order | journal = Journal of Buddhist Ethics | volume = 5 | page = 132 | date = May 1998 | postscript = . [/tpl] For Martin Baumann, the Triratna Buddhist Community serves as proof that "Western concepts, such as a capitalistic work ethos, ecological considerations, and a social-reformist perspective, can be integrated into the Buddhist tradition".[tpl]Citation | last = Baumann | first = Martin | title = Working in the Right Spirit:The Application of Buddhist Right Livelihood in the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order | journal = Journal of Buddhist Ethics | volume = 5 | page = 135 | date = May 1998 | postscript = .
