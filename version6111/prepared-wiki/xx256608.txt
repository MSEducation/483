==Reactions==

Abd al Haqq Kielan, imam at the Sabirin Mosque in Eskilstuna said in an interview that "These people do things that are explicitly forbidden in islam. They make our religion to appear cruel and brutal." The imam also said that "the prophet is very clear on this: A muslim must not be unloyal to the country one lives in, much less the country that received you, given you a visa, residence permit and protection when one most need it."
