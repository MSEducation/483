[[Petroica]]

CATEGORIES: Petroica, Bird genera

Petroica is a genus of Australasian robins, named due to their red and pink markings. They are not closely related to the European Robin nor the American robin. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words petro- "rock" and oikos "home", from birds' habits of sitting on rocks.
Many species in Australia have a red breast and are known colloquially as "Red Robins" as distinct from the "Yellow Robins" of the genus Eopsaltria.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dowling DK | title = Breeding biology of the red-capped robin | journal = Australian Journal of Zoology | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 533â€“549 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | year = 2003 | url = http://publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO03028.htm | doi = 10.1071/ZO03028 | accessdate = 2007-06-07[/tpl]
