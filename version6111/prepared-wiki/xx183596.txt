[[List of watercourses in Western Australia, 0–9]]

CATEGORIES: Watercourses of Western Australia

This is part of a list of watercourses in Western Australia. It includes all rivers, streams, brooks, creeks, gullies, anabranches, backwaters, and any other watercourses with a gazetted name, in Western Australia.
This list is complete with respect to the 1996 Gazetteer of Australia.Gazetteer of Australia (1996). Belconnen, ACT: Australian Surveying and Land Information Group. Dubious names have been checked against the online 2004 data,[tpl]cite web|year=2004|title=Place names of Australia|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/|publisher=Geoscience Australia|accessdate=2006-07-30[/tpl] and in all cases confirmed correct. However, if any watercourses have been gazetted or deleted since 1996, this list does not reflect these changes. Strictly speaking, Australian place names are gazetted in capital letters only; the names in this list have been converted to mixed case in accordance with normal capitalisation conventions. Locations are as gazetted; obviously some watercourses may extend over long distances.
