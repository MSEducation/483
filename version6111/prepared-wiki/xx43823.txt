The Clifford Milburn Holland Tunnel (more commonly known as the Holland Tunnel) is a highway tunnel under the Hudson River connecting the island of Manhattan in New York City with Jersey City, New Jersey at Interstate 78 on the mainland of the United States. Unusual for an American public works project, it is not named for a government official, a politician, a local hero, or a person of historical interest, but for its first chief engineer. An integral conduit within the New York Metropolitan Area, the tunnel was originally known as the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel or the Canal Street Tunnel; it was the first of two automobile tunnels built under the river, the other being the Lincoln Tunnel.

==Description==

Begun in 1920 and completed in 1927, the tunnel is named after Clifford Milburn Holland (1883–1924), Chief Engineer on the project, who died before it was completed. Tunnel designer Ole Singstad finished Holland's work. The tunnel is one of the earliest examples of a mechanically ventilated design. 84 fans, in four ventilation buildings, create a floor to ceiling air flow across the roadway at regular intervals, via systems of ducts beneath and above the roadway. The fans can completely change the air inside the tunnel every 90 seconds. A forced ventilation system is essential because of the poisonous carbon monoxide component of automobile exhaust, which constituted a far greater percentage of exhaust gasses before catalytic converters became prevalent.[tpl]cite news|title=Science: Holland Tunnel|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786201,00.html|magazine=Time|date=November 21, 1927|accessdate=September 25, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|date=January 1928|title=Compressed Air's Greatest Triumph|journal=Popular Science Monthly|page=25|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fycDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25|accessdate=November 21, 2011[/tpl]
The tunnel consists of a pair of tubes, each providing two lanes in a [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|adj=on|0[/tpl] roadway width with [tpl]convert|12.5|ft|m|1[/tpl] of headroom. The north tube is [tpl]convert|8558|ft|m|0[/tpl] from end to end, while the south tube is slightly shorter at [tpl]convert|8371|ft|m|0[/tpl].Holland Tunnel Statistics, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Accessed September 25, 2008. Both tubes are situated in the bedrock beneath the river, with the lowest point of the roadway being about 93 feet (28 m) below mean high water.
The amount of traffic at the Holland Tunnel has remained steady despite tight restrictions on eastbound traffic in response to the September 11 attacks, including a ban on commercial traffic entering New York City put in place after an August 2004 threat.Weekly Traffic Advisory, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

==Boyle Plaza==

The approach to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City begins where the Lower Level of NJ 139 and the Newark Bay Extension meet. On May 6, 1936, the section of what became NJ 139/I-78 between Jersey Avenue and Marin Boulevard was named in memory of John F. Boyle, the former interstate tunnel commissioner. Boyle Plaza is the only segment of I-78 and NJ 139 that has stoplights, as it runs concurrent with 12th Street (the eastbound lanes) and 14th Street (the westbound lanes).
The nine-lane toll plaza is equipped with E-ZPass (first made available in October 1997).[tpl]cite news|title=E-Z Pass to Start at Hudson River Tunnels|first=David M.|last=Halbfinger|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDB1731F934A15753C1A961958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 1997|accessdate=September 25, 2008[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2013|12|1|df=US[/tpl], the cash tolls going from New Jersey to New York are $13 for both of cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York to New Jersey. E-ZPass users are charged $9.00 for cars and $8.00 for motorcycles during off-peak hours (outside of 6–10 a.m. and 4–8 p.m. on the weekdays; and outside of 11 a.m.–9 p.m. on the weekends) and $11.00 for cars and $10.00 for motorcycles during peak hours (6–10 a.m. and 4–8 p.m. on the weekdays; and 11 a.m.–9 p.m. on the weekends).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panynj.gov/bridges-tunnels/tolls.html|title=New Toll Fare Rates for the Bridges & Tunnels Effective December 1, 2013 at 3:00 AM|work=Port Authority of New York & New Jersey|accessdate=2013-11-29[/tpl]

==History==

Passage across the lower Hudson River was only by ferry for centuries. The first tunnels to be bored below the Hudson River were the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad's uptown and downtown tunnels, constructed in the first decade of the 20th century to link the major railroad terminals in New Jersey with Manhattan Island (they currently run PATH trains). The Pennsylvania Railroad's twin tunnels, constructed to serve the new Pennsylvania Station, soon followed. Once tunneling had been shown to be feasible, increasing automobile traffic led to interest in a roadway crossing the river as well.
The concept for what would become the Holland Tunnel was developed in 1906 by a joint commission between New York and New Jersey. The commission initially considered building a bridge for cost reasons, but this plan was abandoned in favor of a tunnel in 1913 when it was determined that the cost of land for accessways to a suitably raised bridge would be prohibitive as a height of 200 ft (60 m) was considered the minimum necessary to avoid interfering with shipping.Holland Tunnel Historical Photos, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Accessed September 25, 2008.
Over the next several years, a number of design proposals were evaluated for the new tunnel. The first two called for a single tube containing two levels of traffic. One, authored by engineer George Goethals specified that traffic on each level would travel in a different direction. The other, by the firm Jacobs and Davies, called for a slightly different tube diameter, with an "express" level and a level for slower traffic. Both designs were eventually passed over in favor of a new type of design proposed by engineer Clifford Milburn Holland, in which two separate tubes would each contain two lanes both going in the same direction. Holland's proposal was adopted, and he was named Chief Engineer of the project.Holland Tunnel Historic Overview, nycroads.com. Accessed September 25, 2008. Promotional materials compared the diameter and capacity of the proposed tunnel with the smaller-diameter railroad tunnels.
In 1920, the New Jersey Interstate Bridge and Tunnel Commission and the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission appropriated funds for what was then referred to as the "Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel Project". Construction began on March 31, 1922, with a crew of workers starting digging at the corner of Canal Street and West Street. On October 27, 1924, the day before the two halves of the tunnel were scheduled to be linked, 41-year-old Holland died of a heart attack in a sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan, attributed by individuals cited in The New York Times to the stress he endured overseeing the tunnel's construction. "Holing through" ceremonies scheduled for that day, in which President Calvin Coolidge would have remotely set off an explosion to connect the two sides of the tunnel, were canceled out of respect for Holland's death.[tpl]cite news|title=C.

The project was renamed the Holland Tunnel in memory of its first chief engineer by the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission and the New Jersey Interstate Bridge and Tunnel Commission on November 12, 1924.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ascemetsection.org/content/view/333/866/|title=Holland Tunnel|work=ASCE Metropolitan Section|accessdate=January 18, 2009[/tpl] Holland was succeeded by Milton H.

===Construction===

Tunnel construction required workers to spend large amounts of time in the caisson under high pressure of up to [tpl]convert|47.5|psi|kPa[/tpl], which was thought to be necessary to prevent river water from entering prior to completion of the tubes. "Sandhogs", as they were termed, entered the tunnel through a series of airlocks, and could only remain inside of the tunnel for a designated time period. On exiting the tunnel, the workers had to undergo controlled decompression to avoid the bends, a condition in which nitrogen bubbles form in the blood from rapid decompression.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kindwall, Eric P|title=Compressed air tunneling and caisson work decompression procedures: development, problems, and solutions|journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine Journal|volume=24|issue=4|pages=337–45|year=1997|pmid=9444066|doi=|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2267|accessdate=March 11, 2009[/tpl] Fortunately, no workers died as a result of decompression sickness: the work involved "756,000 decompressions of men coming out of the compressed air workings," which resulted in 528 cases of the bends, none fatal.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Singstad|first=Ole|journal=Norwegian-American Technical Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–3, 10|date=September 1928[/tpl]Saga in Steel and Concrete, pp. 181–190

===Ventilation system===

The most significant design aspect of the Holland Tunnel is its pioneering ventilation system. At the time of its construction, underwater tunnels were a well-established part of civil engineering, but no long vehicular tunnel had been built: the technical hurdle was the ventilation required to evacuate the carbon monoxide emissions, which would otherwise asphyxiate the drivers.Saga in Steel and Concrete, pp. 191–202[tpl]Cite news|title=Studies and Methods Adopted for Ventilating the Holland Vehicular Tunnels|periodical=Engineering News-Record|volume=98|pages=934–939|date=1927-06-09[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Ventilating the Holland Vehicular Tunnel|periodical=Heating and Ventilating Magazine|volume=23|issue=79|date=August 1926[/tpl][tpl]cite conference|first=Ole|last=Singstad|title=Ventilation of Vehicular Tunnels|booktitle=Proceedings of the World Engineering Congress|volume=9|pages=381–399[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|first=A. C.|last=Davis|title=Development of the ventilation system of the Holland Tunnel|periodical=Heating, Piping and Air Conditioning|volume=2|pages=866–874|date=October 1930[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first1=A.C.|last1=Fieldner|first2=Y.|last2=Henderson|first3=J.W.|last3=Paul|last4=others|title=Ventilation of vehicular tunnels (Report of U.S. Bureau of Mines to New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission and New Jersey State Bridge and Tunnel Commission)|publisher=American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers|date=February 1927[/tpl]
There are four ventilation towers serving the two tubes of the tunnel, designed by Norwegian architect Erling Owre.[tpl]citation|last=Gomez|first=John|title=Brilliant design in Modernist towers that ventilate the Holland Tunnel: Legends & Landmarks|newspaper=The Jersey Journal|date=April 10, 2012|url=http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2012/04/brilliant_design_in_modernist.html|accessdate=2012-08-12[/tpl]
Thomas Edison had contended it was impossible to ventilate a tunnel with the volume of traffic envisioned for the Holland Tunnel.[tpl]cite web|title=Ingeniør Ole Singstad (1882–1969)|publisher=Historier.Norway|language=Norwegian|url=http://www.lotsberg.net/artiklar/Singstad.html[/tpl] Previously, tunnels had been ventilated longitudinally. Engineer Ole Singstad pioneered a system of ventilating the tunnel transversely.
Working with the Yale University and United States Bureau of Mines, Singstad built a test tunnel in the bureau's experimental mine at Bruceton, Pennsylvania, over [tpl]convert|400|ft|m[/tpl] long—where cars were lined up with engines running. Volunteer students were supervised as they breathed the exhaust in order to confirm air flows and tolerable carbon-monoxide levels by simulating different traffic conditions, including backups. Singstad concluded that a conventional, longitudinal ventilation system would have to be pressurized to an air flow rate of [tpl]convert|27|m/s|ft/s[/tpl] on along the tunnel.
Singstad confirmed the feasibility of a tri-level tunnel with the large middle section accommodating vehicles and two plenums, a lower and upper plenum each respectively supplying fresh air and exhausting fumes at regular intervals—solving the ventilation problem.
On opening day the average carbon monoxide content in both tunnels was 0.69 part per 10,000 parts of air. The highest was 1.60 parts per 10,000. The permissible standard was 4 parts per 10,000 parts of air.[tpl]cite web|title=Saga in Steel and Concrete: Norwegian Engineers in America|year=1947|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NORWAY/2003-05/1051983030[/tpl] The public and the press proclaimed air conditions were better in the tube than in some streets of New York City.

===Operation===

Completion of the tunnel took nearly seven years and claimed the lives of 14 workers. The tunnel opened on November 13, 1927, with President Coolidge ceremonially opening the tunnel from his yacht by turning the same key that had "opened" the Panama Canal in 1915, Time the magazine called it "the golden lever of the Presidential telegraphic instrument"—which rang a giant brass bell at the tunnel's entrances that triggered American flags on both sides of the tunnel to separate. Vehicles were allowed to pass through the tunnel at one minute after midnight, with the widows of Chief Engineers Holland and Freeman in the second toll-paying vehicle. The tunnel was an immediate success. On its first day of operation, 51,694 vehicles passed through, paying a 50 cent toll (equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|0.5|1927|r=2[/tpl][/tpl] today) per car (25 cents for a motorcycle and truck tolls of up to two dollars), which was intended to defray the tunnel's $48 million price tag, equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|48000000|1927[/tpl][/tpl] today.[tpl]cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/nyregion/a-tunnel-holland-named-us-historic-landmark.html|title=A Tunnel?

Horsedrawn vehicles have always been banned from the tunnel. A few months before the tunnel's opening, there were suggestions that pedestrians would be allowed to cross the tunnel if they paid a toll described as "not encouraging," but no further mention of this was ever made.[tpl]cite news|title=Holland Tube Roadways Involve a Huge Task|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16FF395D13728DDDA80A94D0405B878EF1D3|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 21, 1927|page=XX10|accessdate=May 29, 2010|first=Waldo|last=Walker[/tpl]
In 1955 a very narrow one-man miniature electric car was developed and installed so policemen could patrol the full length of the tunnel from the catwalk on the side of the tunnel instead of having to walk it. By use of a swivel seat the policemen could drive the car in either direction."Police Car Rides Narrow Gauge Track Catwalk in Tunnel" Popular Mechanics, March 1955, p. 100.
