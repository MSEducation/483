Kite flying and beach cricket are common sports at the beach, and there are also facilities for pony rides. Beach cricket at the Marina dates back several decades. However, Chennai City Police has banned it at different points due to its interference with traffic and beach walkers.<ref>

There are two swimming pools along the stretch—the Marina swimming pool and the Anna swimming pool. The Marina swimming pool was built in 1947 and is located opposite the Presidency College. The pool is 100 m long and 30 m wide, bigger than the standard Olympic pool size of 50 m × 25 m and is [tpl]convert|3|to|5.5|ft|m[/tpl] deep. It is maintained by Corporation of Chennai. It underwent renovation in 1994 and 2004. The Anna swimming pool is located opposite the clock tower building of the University of Madras and virtually remains hidden behind the Anna Square bus terminus. The pool is said to be the first Olympic size pool to be built in Tamil Nadu. It was constructed in 1976 with a diving board. However, the diving board was removed later during a renovation. The pool is [tpl]convert|4|to|11|ft|m[/tpl] deep. It also has a toddler pool that is [tpl]convert|2.5|ft|m[/tpl]. Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) conducts regular coaching camps at the pool.[ref]

The oval-shaped skating arena at the beach has an outer railing and standing area for people to watch from.
As part of the 'Chennai Forever' initiative by the Tamil Nadu government, a [tpl]convert|34|ft|adj=on[/tpl] tall, artificial waterfall was installed in September 2005 at a cost of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 1.5 million.[ref]
