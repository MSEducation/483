CATEGORIES: Video conversion software, DVD rippers, DVD

A DVD ripper is a software program that facilitates copying the content of a DVD to a hard disk drive. They are mainly used to transfer video on DVDs to different formats, to edit or back up DVD content, and to convert DVD video for playback on media players and mobile devices. Some DVD rippers include additional features such as Blu-ray support, DVD and Blu-ray Disc decryption, copy protection removal and the ability to make discs unrestricted and region-free.  While most DVD rippers only convert video to highly compressed MP4 video files, there are other rippers that can convert DVDs to higher quality compressed video.  These types of DVD rippers are used by the television and film industry to create broadcast quality video from DVD.  Video ripped by these professional DVD rippers is an exact duplicate of the original DVD video.
