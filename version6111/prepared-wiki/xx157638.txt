[[1973 Rally of Morocco]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 World Rally Championship season, Rally of Morocco, 1973 in Morocco

The 1973 Rally of Morocco was the 16th running of the Rally of Morocco, and the fifth round of the inaugural World Rally Championship season.  Run in mid-May between Morocco's two major cities, Rabat and Casablanca, the Rallye du Maroc was a very long stage rally covering more than 1200 km on both hard and soft surface roads.
In 1973, and for several years afterward, only manufacturers were given points for finishes in WRC events.  Morocco represented a third win for the strong Alpine Renault A110 1800, though the Citroën DS 23 also made a strong showing.
