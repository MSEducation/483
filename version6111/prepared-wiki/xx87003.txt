==Gameplay==

This game was an attempt to turn players of video games into directors. It also enabled them to completely control the direction of the cartoon by also making them into screenplay writers, music composer, cinematographer, and set decorators.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gamefabrique.com/games/tiny-toon-adventures-cartoon-workshop/|title=Choice of characters|publisher=Game Fabrique|date=|accessdate=2012-09-12[/tpl]
Up to two characters can be featured on screen at once, with Buster, Babs, Plucky, Furrball, Calamity, and Little Beeper available for selection. The characters can be set in many different poses and situations, and the cartoons have a myriad of settings and backgrounds for the show to take place. There are also options for musical inserts, sound effects, captions, and editing features using an easy-to-use graphic user interface that resembles a watered down version of most Windows 3.1 applications.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ttaworld.net/ttagames/nes/#game2|title=Basic game summary|publisher=Tiny Toon Adventures World|date=|accessdate=2008-10-30[/tpl]
Saving the cartoon is not possible, however, unless one uses a VCR or other screen capture method.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.fortunecity.com/westwood/wax/329/nes_tta3_index.html|title=Advanced game summary| publisher=Tiny Toon Image Gallery Plus|date=|accessdate=2008-10-30[/tpl] Cartoons that are created on this video game can only last up to five minutes;[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.giantbomb.com/tiny-toon-adventures-cartoon-workshop/61-30983/|title=Game limitations|publisher=Giant Bomb|date=|accessdate=2012-09-12[/tpl] as opposed to the typical 28 minutes that Tiny Toon Adventures dedicated to their actual TV show.
