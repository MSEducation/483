Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (May 16, 1804 – January 3, 1894) was an American educator who opened the first English-language kindergarten in the United States.   Long before most educators, Peabody embraced the premise that children's play has intrinsic developmental and educational value.
Peabody also served as the translator for the first English version of a Buddhist scripture which was published in 1844.

==Biography==

Peabody was born in Billerica, Massachusetts on May 16, 1804. She was the daughter of Nathaniel Peabody, a physician, and Elizabeth ("Eliza") Palmer, and spent her early years in Salem. After 1822 she resided principally in Boston where she engaged in teaching.[tpl]Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Peabody, Elizabeth Palmer|year=1900[/tpl]  She also became a writer and a prominent figure in the Transcendental movement. During 1834–1835, she worked as assistant teacher to Amos Bronson Alcott at his experimental Temple School in Boston. After the school closed, Peabody published Record of a School, outlining the plan of the school and Alcott's philosophy of early childhood education, which had drawn on German models.

===The Dial===

For a time, Peabody was the business manager of The Dial, the main publication of the Transcendentalists. In 1843, she noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. In 1844 the magazine published Peabody's translation of a portion of the Lotus Sutra from French, which was the first English version of a Buddhist scripture.[tpl]cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| title =Zen Master Who?| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| page =60| url =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8[/tpl] The publication ceased shortly thereafter in April 1844.Gura, Philip F.

===[tpl]anchor|Kindergarden[/tpl]Kindergarten===

When Peabody opened her kindergarten in 1860, the practice of providing formal schooling for children younger than six was largely confined to Germany. She had a particular interest in the educational methods of Friedrich Fröbel, and in 1867 visited Germany for the purpose of studying them more closely.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Peabody, Elizabeth Palmer[/tpl] Through her own kindergarten, and as editor of the Kindergarten Messenger (1873–1877), Peabody helped establish kindergarten as an accepted institution in American education. She also wrote numerous books in support of the cause. The extent of her influence is apparent in a statement submitted to Congress on February 12, 1897, in support of free kindergartens:
