[tpl]nihongo|Komatsu Airport|小松飛行場|Komatsu Hikōjō[/tpl] [tpl]Airport codes|KMQ|RJNK[/tpl] is an airport located [tpl]convert|4.2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] west southwest of Komatsu Station in the city of Komatsu, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the largest airport in the Hokuriku region and serves the southern portion of Ishikawa Prefecture including the capital of Kanazawa (which has its IATA city code QKW), as well as　Fukui and the northern portion of Fukui Prefecture.
The Japan Air Self-Defense Force Komatsu Base (小松基地 Komatsu Kichi) shares the runway with civil aviation; the inland-side taxiway is used by the JASDF and the sea-side one is used by civilian flights. The base hosts a Kōkū-sai (Air Festival) every September, featuring demo flights by fighter and rescue aircraft as well as the Blue Impulse acrobat flight team. It often hosts technical competitions of the JASDF. The "Airspace G" is a large training airspace over the Sea of Japan to the north of the base.
The airport has a single passenger terminal building serving domestic and international flights. Its international cargo terminal, known as HIACT (Hokuriku International Air Cargo Terminal), is owned by a consortium of government and corporate entities and aims to serve as an international distribution center for cargo from Europe and other continents.[tpl]cite web|title=Outline of HIACT|url=http://www.komatsuairport.jp/komatsusypher/www/english/cargo/Outline_HIACT.html|publisher=Komatsu Airport Association|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl] Its runway surface has been upgraded to enable non-stop freighter flights to and from Europe and North America in late 2006.

==History==

The airport was originally a base of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Construction of the first [tpl]convert|1500|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] east-west and [tpl]convert|1700|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] north-south runways was completed in 1944. The United States Armed Forces took over the base at the end of the war in 1945 and used the site as a radar facility. The airport saw irregular service to Osaka and Nagoya starting in 1955.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.komatsuairport.jp/komatsusypher/www/english/outline/index.htm|publisher=Komatsu Airport Association|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl] 
The base was handed over to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force in 1958 and designated as a jet fighter base in 1960. Komatsu Base was formally inaugurated in 1961. Scheduled service to Osaka and Nagoya began in 1962, using Douglas DC-3 aircraft, followed by Fokker F.27 service to Tokyo in 1963. The airport's first international service was a charter flight from Hong Kong in 1973.
Ishikawa Prefecture set aside funds for an airport promotion committee in 2012 amid expectations that the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen in 2015 would impact traffic on the Komatsu-Tokyo route.[tpl]cite news|title=石川県の2012年度予算案、エネルギー・新幹線に重点|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASJB2102W_R20C12A2LB0000/|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Nihon Keizai Shimbun|date=21 February 2012|quote=一方、羽田便が中心の小松空港（小松市）は新幹線開業で利用客の大幅減が必至。12年度予算案では「小松空港活性化委員会（仮称）」の設立や羽田空港での乗り継ぎの利用促進のための費用を計上。国際貨物便向けの助成制度も拡充する。[/tpl]
