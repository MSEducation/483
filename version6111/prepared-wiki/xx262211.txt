In 2012, Arizona State University decided to block access to Change.org in response to a petition created by student Eric Haywood protesting "rising tuition costs at the school".  University officials claimed that "Change.org is a spam site" and the blocking was conducted "to protect the use of our limited and valuable network resources for legitimate academic, research, and administrative uses".[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-levy/arizona-state-censors-cha_b_1253155.html|title = Arizona State Censors Change.org|author = Levy, Josh | work  = The Huffington Post |date = February 3, 2012[/tpl]

They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses."

==Petitions==

===In the United States===

On March 8, 2012, a petition entitled "Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin" was posted on Change.org.  The petition received over 2.2 million signatures – at that time the largest number of signatures for any campaign in Change.org's history.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/prosecute-the-killer-of-our-son-17-year-old-trayvon-martin|title = Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin|publisher = Change.org[/tpl]  The petition called for the prosecution of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, who, on February 26, 2012, shot and killed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, a suburb of Orlando.  Zimmerman, armed with a 9 mm gun, said he was acting in self-defense against the unarmed teenager, and he was set free the night of the killing without being charged.  Social media technology (including Change.org's petition) played a pivotal role in spreading awareness about the killing. On April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He stood trial in the months of June and July and was acquitted of all charges on July 13, 2013.
On October 1, 2011, Molly Katchpole, a "22 year old nanny with two jobs" in Washington D.C., started a petition on Change.org "asking Bank of America and their CEO Bryan Moynihan to drop its unexpected new $5/month banking fee" for debit card customers.  Less than one month later, 300,000 signatures were collected.  The petition was widely cited as a contributing cause for the bank formally announcing to drop the new banking fee.  U.S. President Barack Obama signed the petition; U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, responded to Bank of America and the petition on Twitter.  It may have contributed to the U.S. Congress deciding to "look at legislation for out-of-control banking fees".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-bank-of-america-no-5-debit-card-fees|title = Tell Bank of America: No $5 Debit Card Fees|publisher = Change.org[/tpl]
In December 2011, a fourth-grade class in Brookline, Massachusetts, launched the "Lorax Petition Project" through Change.org requesting Universal Studios to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, The Lorax, a classic Dr. Seuss children's story.  The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, "to help the environment".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/z-let-the-lorax-speak-for-the-trees|title = 'Universal Pictures: Let the Lorax Speak for the Trees!'|publisher = Change.org[/tpl]  The petition collected over 57,000 signatures (including Edward Norton's), and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website "with the environmental message the kids had requested".[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/kristof-after-recess-change-the-world.html?_r=1|title = After Recess - Change the World|author = Kristof, Nicholas | work = The New York Times|date = February 4, 2012[/tpl]

In November 2013, John Doe of Arlington, Texas launched a petition against changes made to the YouTube commenting system by Google.  The changes force YouTube users to create an account on Google+ and also removes the "reply" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+.  This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks.https://www.change.org/petitions/google-change-the-youtube-comment-section-back-to-its-original-form#|publisher= Change.Org
In November 2013, Aaron Thompson from Tuscaloosa, Alabama started a petition, directed at Seth MacFarlane to bring back Brian Griffin on Family Guy, after his death in Season 12 episode "Life Of Brian", he stated that "He added a witty and sophisticated element to the show," petition creator Aaron Thompson wrote. "Family Guy and Fox Broadcasting will lose viewers if Brian Griffin is not brought back to the show... they killed off the dog who has lived in our homes for the last 15 years. They killed the dog we all have come to love. They killed America's dog!" Thompson's petition gained 30,000 signatures within 36 hours and is still causing controversy today.http://www.change.org/petitions/seth-macfarlane-and-fox-broadcasting-company-bring-brian-griffin-back-to-family-guy

===In Germany===

Also in 2012, Philip Matesanz, a 21-year-old German university student, started a petition to allow third-party recording tools for YouTube. To date,[tpl]when|date=June 2013|reason=this is an undated article[/tpl] this petition has garnered approximately 4.3 million signatures, which is now the largest number of signatures in the history of Change.org.[tpl]cite web|url = https://www.change.org/petitions/youtube-googlede-allow-third-party-recording-tools-for-youtube-freedomonyoutube|title = @Youtube & @GoogleDE : Allow third party recording tools for YouTube #FreedomOnYoutube|publisher = change.org[/tpl]

===In Spain===

In February 2013, over one million people, a figure equivalent to around two percent of the total population of Spain, had signed the petition calling for the entire Spanish government to resign. The call was motivated by an unprecedented corruption scandal involving the majority of key leaders of the People's Party, including the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy himself.

==Business model==

==Criticism==

Under certain conditions,[tpl]cite web|title=Privacy Policy [tpl]![/tpl] Change.org|url=http://www.change.org/about/privacy|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012[/tpl] signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org, but[tpl]cite web|title=I want my name off of this petition immediately! : The Change.org Help Desk|url=http://helpdesk.change.org/entries/20272227-i-want-my-name-off-of-this-petition-immediately|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012[/tpl] it does not work if the signature was forged or appears on another site operated by Change.org, PetitionOnline.
There has been debate and criticism[tpl]cite web|title=Change Dot Biz|url=http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/change-dot-biz|publisher=The Information Diet|date= February 28, 2012|accessdate= July 6, 2012[/tpl] around the fact that Change.org is a for-profit business despite using the .org domain suffix rather than the commercial .com. The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is "a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions". 
Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in Wired Magazine, saying, "We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It’s not just that we’re not yet making a profit – it’s that we are decidedly not for-profit.” [tpl]cite news|last=Klint|first=Finley|title=Meet Change.org, the Google of Modern Politics|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/change-org/|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=26 September 2013[/tpl]
Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services, gaining money at the expense of the users.
