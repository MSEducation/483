[[2008 Wimbledon Championships]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 Wimbledon Championships

The 2008 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament played on grass courts. It was the 122nd edition of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, England, United Kingdom, from 23 June to 6 July 2008.
Spanish player Rafael Nadal won the first Wimbledon title of his career; the first Grand Slam tournament he had won other than the French Open. Nadal defeated five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final in what many regard as one of the greatest matches of all time.[tpl]cite news|author=Alistair Magowan|title=Roger v Rafa - the best final ever?| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7493099.stm|date =2008-07-07| accessdate =2008-07-09 | work=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Caroline Cheese|title=Federer stung by 'hardest loss'| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7492517.stm|date =2008-07-06| accessdate =2008-07-09 | work=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=International Herald Tribune, Associated Press|title=Federer-Nadal rivalry as good as it gets| url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/07/sports/TEN-On-Tennis-Rafa---Roger.php|date =2008-07-07| accessdate =2008-07-09[/tpl] In the women's singles, Venus Williams claimed her fifth title, and first win over her sister Serena in a Wimbledon final (she had lost the previous two). The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd.
Following the completion of the 2007 Championships, the new fixed roof was put in place, in time for the 2008 Championships. The retractable section of the new roof was completed for the 2009 Championships.

==Notable stories==

===Betting scandal===

There were allegations in a dossier that several matches, including eight at Wimbledon, were under suspicion of being fixed by professional gambling syndicates after bookmakers noted unexpected spikes in betting patterns.[tpl]cite news|author=reuters.com|title=Wimbledon betting controversy played down| url =http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSL2270241520080622?feedType=RSS&feedName=sportsNews|date =2008-06-22| accessdate =2008-06-24 | work=Reuters[/tpl] The dossier, released on the Sunday prior to the first day of play, had been commissioned by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and four Grand Slams earlier in the year, and was compiled by bookmakers. An official said, "If you look at a tournament, you might see one match for £23,000 betting turnover, one for £27,000, one for £36,000 and one for £4.5m. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that something is going on in the last one."[tpl]cite news|author=The Times|title=Wimbledon match betting scam| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article4187780.ece|date =2008-06-22| accessdate =2008-06-24 | location=London[/tpl] Betting on Wimbledon matches was popular in 2007, with over £420m wagered on bets.
To help deal with any potential gambling problems, the All England Club restricted access to player's changing rooms this year, allowing only the player and their coach permission. It was hoped that this would make communication between gamblers and players more difficult. Match fixing became a prominent issue in the media after the 2007 Orange Prokom Open, where the then World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko came under suspicion of colluding with gamblers, and gambling company Betfair took the unprecedented step of voiding all bets on a match of his with Martín Vassallo Argüello.

===Pigeon killing controversy===

The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the sport club that plays host to the Championships, came under fire from animal activists for using marksmen to shoot down dive-bombing pigeons. The marksmen were ordered to use hawks to scare them away, but when some failed to do so, the marksmen killed them, which led to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group releasing a statement admonishing the practice and subsequently, referring to the Animal Welfare Act 2006, contacting the Metropolitan Police.[tpl]cite news|author=Reuters, ESPN|title=Wimbledon under fire for pigeon cull| url =http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/news/story?id=3458900|date =2008-06-24| accessdate =2008-06-24[/tpl]
Several players complained about the pigeons distracting them during play, and because of the inefficient nature of the hawks, rapid action was sought on the Sunday evening before the tournament began.[tpl]cite news|author=Nick Harris|title=Wimbledon 'breaking law by killing pigeons'| url =http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-breaking-law-by-killing-pigeons-853509.html|date =2008-06-25| accessdate =2008-06-25 | location=London | work=The Independent[/tpl] The marksmen were hired by the All England Club and, armed with rifles, shot several birds. When the media broke the story on Monday, a spokesman for the All England Club defended the club's approach, saying that, "The hawks are our first line of deterrent, and by and large they do the job. But unfortunately there were one or two areas where the hawks didn't deter the pigeons, so it was deemed necessary to take a harder approach."[tpl]cite news|author=Bangkok Post|title=Wimbledon calls in the big guns to combat pesky pigeons| url =http://www.bangkokpost.com/sportsplus/sportsplus.php?id=128506|date =2008-06-23| accessdate =2008-06-25[/tpl] By Tuesday however, the Metropolitan Police wildlife crime unit had been alerted to the practice by PETA, after allegedly infringing the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Bruce Friedrich, vice-president of PETA, wrote in a letter to the All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, that the birds did not represent "a demonstrable risk to public health and safety", and the activity was therefore in violation of the Act. A Wimbledon spokesperson subsequently announced that they had reneged on their policy, and that the All England Club would no longer shoot pigeons.
A similar, but more inconspicuous, incident also occurred on the Sunday evening before the Championships. A swarm of bees descended upon the area surrounding the All England Club; this caused the clearing out of the players' lawn (where competitors gather after play) and a temporary cessation of some interviews.[tpl]cite news|author=Caroline Gammell |title=Wimbledon preparations disrupted by bees | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2176054/Wimbledon-Preparations-disrupted-by-bees.html|date =2008-06-23| accessdate =2008-07-09 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=thelondonpaper |title=Bee invasion sets Wimbledon abuzz as top players complain of the 'nightmare' | url =http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/news/article/1157152892855?packedargs=suffix%3DArticleController|date =2008-06-23| accessdate =2008-07-09[/tpl] Further disruption was caused because organizers had to alter the overnight queuing system, in order to protect people. This was the first time that bees had caused disruptions at the All England Club. Some media outlets reported that the bees deserted the grounds after around 90 minutes,[tpl]cite news|author=The Independent |title=Wimbledon invaded by bees | url =http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/sport/wimbledon-invaded-by-bees-1418707.html|date =2008-06-22| accessdate =2008-07-09|work=Irish Independent[/tpl] whilst others claimed that a similar resolution to the pigeon problem was sought, with the bees being professionally exterminated.

===British performance===

The British public were left with some palpable success, as London-based Laura Robson became the first British girl to win the Girls' juniors competition since Annabel Croft in 1984. Robson, aged 14 and the youngest player in the Girls' juniors, had to beat players aged up to 18, the maximum age allowed for entry into the juniors.[tpl]cite news|author=Chris Bevan |title=Robson flies flag for Britain | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7488551.stm|date =2008-07-03| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Piers Newbery |title=Briton Robson wins girls' title | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7491442.stm|date =2008-07-05| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl] She garnered considerable media attention,[tpl]cite news|author=Patrick Foster |title=Laura Robson repels trickery of Slovak to earn final treat | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article4272532.ece|date =2008-07-05| accessdate =2008-07-05 | location=London | work=The Times[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Esther Addley |title=Never mind Murray.

In the seniors, 2007 mixed doubles champion Jamie Murray could not replicate his triumph of the previous year with new partner Liezel Huber after his 2007 partner, Jelena Janković, opted not to play in order to concentrate on the singles competition.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC Sport |title=Jamie Murray seeks new partner | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7450516.stm|date =2008-06-12| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl] Murray & Huber were able to reach the semifinals.
In the seniors singles competition Scot Andy Murray made the most significant impact, becoming the first Brit since Tim Henman in 2004 to reach the quarterfinals. Murray, often castigated in the British media for his surly manner, won the crowd's affections with his five-set victory over Richard Gasquet (for further details on this match, see the Day 7 summary).[tpl]cite news|author=Michael Henderson |title=Now that he's a proper North Briton, how about a smile? | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/jul/02/wimbledon.tennis|date =2008-07-02| accessdate =2008-07-05 | location=London | work=The Guardian[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Piers Newbery |title=Murray wins after epic fightback | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7482226.stm|date =2008-06-30| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl] In the UK, the Murray-Gasquet match was watched by over 10m people, and in his native Scotland more than 50% of the potential viewing public watched the match.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC Sport |title=Murray viewing figures exceed 10m | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7482966.stm|date =2008-07-01| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl] Chris Eaton from Surrey, the ATP No. 661, began his campaign in qualifying, succeeded in doing so, and then beat ATP No. 114 Boris Pašanski, causing a huge surprise.[tpl]cite news|author=Chris Bevan |title=Briton Eaton continues progress | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7472420.stm|date =2008-06-24| accessdate =2008-07-05 | work=BBC News[/tpl] No British women made it beyond the second round, although Anne Keothavong was the first British woman to directly qualify to the main draw since 1998.

===A tournament of upsets and fairytales===

The men's side was notable for the performances of Marat Safin and Rainer Schüttler, ranked 75th and 94th respectively entering the tournament. Safin caused an upset in the second round when he defeated Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets,Djokovic crashes out of Wimbledon | News | NDTVSports.com on his way to his first ever Wimbledon semi-final, where he lost to Roger Federer. After more than five years without reaching the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament, and 13 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments without advancing past the second round, Schüttler also advanced to his first Wimbledon semi-final,Hewitt falls to master Federer - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) where he was defeated by the eventual champion Rafael Nadal in straight sets.Federer on track to create Wimbledon history - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Schüttler had earlier defeated Arnaud Clément, who had previously not reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament since reaching the final of the 2001 Australian Open, in an epic quarter-final which had lasted two days.Wimbledon 2008: Unseeded Schuettler comes through epic to reach last four | Sport | guardian.co.uk
The women's draw saw some of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history, in which the top four seeds (Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Janković, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova) all failed to reach the quarter-finals.Jankovic, Kuznetsova join exodus - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Maria Sharapova suffered her earliest exit at Wimbledon and her earliest exit at a Grand Slam since the 2003 US Open when she went down to Alla Kudryavtseva in the second round, whilst recent French Open champion and newly crowned World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic was stunned in the third round by Chinese wildcard entrant and World No. 133 Zheng Jie. This was the earliest exit by a top seed at Wimbledon since Martina Hingis lost in the first round in 2001, and Zheng Jie also became the lowest-ranked player ever to defeat a top seed at the tournament. Janković and Kuznetsova had their tournaments ended in the fourth round by Tamarine Tanasugarn and Agnieszka Radwańska, respectively. This was the first time since seedings began at Wimbledon in 1927 (and the first time in the Open Era) in which none of the top four seeds advanced past the fourth round at Wimbledon. For Zheng Jie's part, she became the second Chinese player (after Li Na in 2006) to reach the final eight at Wimbledon, and the first wildcard entry in the tournament's history to reach the semi-finals (a feat later achieved by Sabine Lisicki in 2011, where she also beat the reigning French Open champion), where she was defeated by eventual runner-up Serena Williams, whilst Tanasugarn reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final by virtue of her victory against Janković, losing to the eventual champion Venus Williams.

===Middle Sunday===

Middle Sunday in Wimbledon is traditionally a rest day, without any play, and this was the case in 2008. The seventh day of the competition, consequently, was Monday 30 June.

===Day 7===

Five-time Wimbledon winner, defending champion and World No. 1 Roger Federer advanced to the tournament's quarterfinals for the seventh time in ten participations past former World No. 1 and 2002 Wimbledon titlist Lleyton Hewitt after less than two hours of play, on the score of 7–6(7), 6–2, 6–4, while second seed, 2006 and 2007 finalist Rafael Nadal left no hopes to seventeenth seed Mikhail Youzhny, as he defeated the Russian 6–3, 6–3, 6–1. 2004 Wimbledon semifinalist and ATP No. 43 Mario Ančić was led two-sets-to-love by Nottingham finalist and twenty-second seed Fernando Verdasco, when he started a comeback, winning the third set, and overcoming Verdasco's 4–1 lead to take the fourth, to ultimately win the match, after the two players repeatedly broke each other in the one-hour-and-half-long fifth set, on the final score of 3–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 13–11, after nearly four hours of play, and set a rematch of the 2006 Wimbledon quarterfinal against Federer. Thirty-first-seeded Feliciano López climbed back from being led two-sets-to-one, and saved three match points, the third one with an ace on his second service, to finally beat tenth seed, 2006 semifinalist and 2007 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Marcos Baghdatis after almost four hours of play, 5–7, 6–2, 3–6, 7–6(4), 8–6. In the first fourth round match involving two unseeded players, ATP No. 94 and 2003 Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schüttler dominated ATP No. 40, victor of Andy Roddick, Serbian Janko Tipsarević 6–3, 3–6, 6–4, 7–6(4), and in the second one, 2001 Australian Open runner-up and 2007 Wimbledon doubles champion, ATP No. 145 Arnaud Clément outplayed nineteen-year-old Croatian, ATP No. 55 Marin Čilić, in straight sets 6–3, 7–5, 6–2. Former World No. 1 Marat Safin eliminated a third consecutive seed in the tournament, as he beat Rome Masters finalist Stanislas Wawrinka for the first time in three encounters, on the score of 6–4, 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, to match his best result in Wimbledon, a 2001 quarterfinal. Eighth seed, 2007 Wimbledon semifinalist, Frenchman Richard Gasquet entirely dominated his adversary, twelfth seed, British Andy Murray during two sets, and up to the end of the third one, when he served to win the match, before Murray broke the Frenchman back and won the set's tie-break, eventually taking back the control of the encounter, racing through the fourth set and breaking early in the fifth to win, in almost complete darkness, at 21:30 (UTC+1), after four hours of play, on the score of 5–7, 3–6, 7–6(3), 6–2, 6–4, and, reaching his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, complete the round of eight line up.[tpl]cite news|author=wimbledon.org|title=Monday 30 June: As it happened| url =http://2008.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2008-06-30/200806301214817111143.html|date =2008-06-30| accessdate =2008-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Federer Marches On at SW19, Faces Ancic Next| url =http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/wimbledon_monday2.asp|date =2008-06-30| accessdate =2008-06-30[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Murray Completes Comeback; Nadal Cruises into QFs| url =http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/wimbledon_monday2.1.asp|date =2008-06-30| accessdate =2008-07-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The first semifinal of the women's singles saw four-time winner and defending champion, seventh seed Venus Williams dominate her opponent Elena Dementieva during the first set, winning it 6–1 in thirty-eight minutes, before the Russian fifth seed fought back in the second, breaking Williams right after losing her serve to even the score, and holding to a second set tie-break. The American then left no chances to Dementieva, breaking her repeatedly to win the tie-break 7–3, and claim a 6–1, 7–6(3) victory, after nearly two hours of play, to advance to her thirteenth Grand Slam final since the 1997 US Open, her seventh in Wimbledon. The second semifinal between two-time champion, sixth seed Serena Williams and wild card, WTA No. 133 Jie Zheng followed the same pattern as the first, with Williams dominating her opponent in the first set, winning it 6–2, and the Chinese fighting back in the second, taking the match to a tie-break after holding a set point on Williams's serve. Williams, though, kept her edge on Zheng, winning the tie-break 7–5, to claim a 6–2, 7–6(5) victory, and proceed to her eleventh Grand Slam final since the 1999 US Open, the fourth in Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams's wins marked the first time since Wimbledon 2003 the two sisters would meet in a Grand Slam final, the seventh time overall, with Serena having won five of their six previous Grand Slam final meetings, including the two played in Wimbledon, in 2002 and 2003.[tpl]cite news|author=sonyericssonwtatour.com|title=Venus, Serena Survive Late Challenges, Move Into Final| url =http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2400|date =2008-07-03| accessdate =2008-07-04[/tpl]
In the first men's doubles semifinal, which lasted more than three hours, being interrupted several times by rain delays, World No. 1s and 2006 Wimbledon champions Bob Bryan & Mike Bryan battled a close match against eighth-seeded 2002, 2003 and 2004 champion Jonas Björkman & partner Kevin Ullyett, but the top-ranked Americans lost all three tie-breaks played against their adversaries, allowing Bjorkman & Ullyett to win on the score of 7–6(3), 5–7, 7–6(5), 7–6(9).

The other semifinal, between ninth seeds Lukáš Dlouhý & Leander Paes and second seeds Daniel Nestor & Nenad Zimonjić was stopped due to darkness as the latter led 7–6(4), 4–6, 6–1, 3–3.[tpl]cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Bjorkman/Ullyett Triumph Over Bryans| url =http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/doubles/2008news/wimbledon9.asp|date =2008-07-03| accessdate =2008-07-04[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Day 11===

The first semifinal of the men's singles was the eleventh encounter between World No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer, and former World No. 1, now 75th-ranked and victor, earlier in the tournament, of ATP No. 3 Novak Djoković, Russian Marat Safin, whose appearance in the semifinals was the first in a Grand Slam since he won the 2005 Australian Open, where he defeated Federer in the semifinal. The Swiss broke Safin in his first service game, racing through the first set to take it 6–3, before the Russian raised his level of play, and both players went on keeping their serves to a second set tie-break, which Safin eventually lost 3–7, letting Federer take his two-sets-to-love advantage to pressure him, and eventually break in the last game of the third set to claim a 6–3, 7–6(3), 6–4 victory, in less than two hours. The win meant Federer would reach his sixteenth Grand Slam final, and his sixth consecutive one in Wimbledon, already equalling Björn Borg's record of runs at the tournament, from his first win at the 1976 Wimbledon Championships to his lost final, after having won five consecutive ones, to John McEnroe at the 1981 Wimbledon Championships. The second semifinal opposed ATP No. 2, French Open and Queen's Club Championships winner, and defending finalist Rafael Nadal, to unseeded, 2003 Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schüttler, ATP No. 94, who finished his semifinal against Arnaud Clément only on the previous afternoon, after three-hours-and-a-half of play. Nadal raced early to a 4–0 lead, taking the first set 6–1, before Schüttler started to fight back, breaking the Spanish and dominating him through the second set, keeping his serve until 5–4, when serving to even the score to one-set-all, Nadal broke him, eventually winning the set in a tie-break 7–3, and keeping his edge on the German up to the end of the third set to win, in little more than two hours, on the score of 6–1, 7–6(3), 6–4. The win allowed Nadal to advance to his seventh Grand Slam final, his third consecutive one in Wimbledon, and set up his eighteenth meeting against Roger Federer, the sixth in a Grand Slam final.[tpl]cite news|author=wimbledon.org|title=Friday 4 July: As it happened| url =http://2008.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2008-07-04/200807041215166101421.html|date =2008-07-04| accessdate =2008-07-04[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Unstoppable Federer to Face Nadal in Blockbuster Final| url =http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/wimbledon_friday2.asp|date =2008-07-04| accessdate =2008-07-04[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=atptennis.com|title=Nadal Sets Up Dream Wimbledon Final Against Federer| url =http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/wimbledon_friday2.1.asp|date =2008-07-04| accessdate =2008-07-04[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The semifinals of the women's doubles took place, first confronting 2000 and 2002 champions and eleventh seeds Serena Williams & Venus Williams, to unseeded Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy & Australian Casey Dellacqua, with the Williams sisters, who lost no set since the beginning of the competition, dominating their opponents throughout the encounter, winning the match 6–3, 6–3, after only an hour of play and advance to their third doubles final in Wimbledon, having won the two first ones. That win also marked the second time since the 2002 Wimbledon Championships Serena and Venus Williams would be facing each other in the singles final, and be present together in the doubles final. The top half of the draw's semifinal took place between top ranked, recent Birmingham and Eastbourne winners and defending champions Cara Black & Liezel Huber, and sixteenth-seeded 2001 doubles champion Lisa Raymond & partner Samantha Stosur, with the latter taking the early advantages in each set, breaking the World No. 1s four times during the encounter and eventually knocking them out of the tournament on the score of 6–3, 6–3, in little more than an hour, to reach their fourth Grand Slam final together, after the 2005 US Open, the 2006 Australian Open and the 2006 French Open.
In the first semifinal of the mixed event, top seeds Mike Bryan & Katarina Srebotnik entirely dominated their unseeded opponents Igor Andreev & Maria Kirilenko to win the match on the final score of 6–4, 6–2, after little more than an hour, and proceed to their first Grand Slam final together. The win allowed Mike Bryan to advance to his fourth Grand Slam mixed final, his second in Wimbledon after finishing as the runner-up in 2001, and Srebotnik to advance to her eighth Grand Slam mixed final, her first in Wimbledon. Twelfth-seeded defending champion Jamie Murray & partner, women's doubles No. 1 Liezel Huber made the strongest start of their semifinal against unseeded Bob Bryan & Samantha Stosur quickly taking the first set 6–2 in twenty-one minutes, before Bryan & Stosur started to fight back, taking the second set to a tie-break, easily winning it 7–1, and extending their domination in the third set, eventually taking the match 2–6, 7–6(1), 6–4, to reach their first Grand Slam mixed doubles final together. The final would be Bob Bryan's sixth, the second in Wimbledon, after a 2006 loss, and Stosur's second, after the 2005 Australian Open. The win marked the second time in the year Bob Bryan and Katarina Srebotnik would face each other in a Grand Slam mixed doubles final, having already confronted at the French Open, set up the first ever meeting in a Grand Slam final of Bob and Mike Bryan, and marked the first time, with Stosur's win, a player would be present in both the doubles and the mixed doubles final of Wimbledon since Cara Black in 2004.

Serena made the stronger start, breaking her sister in her first service game, and quickly took a 4–2 lead, as Venus struggled with her return. The momentum of the first set then shifted, when Venus started to play more aggressively, breaking Serena to even the score, and breaking her again in the last game to win the set 7–5 after fifty-three minutes. Venus struggled again with her serve in the beginning of the second set, saving a break point in her first service game, She was broken in her second, but broke back to 2–2.

The men's doubles final followed the women's singles' one on Centre Court. The eighth-seeded team of ATP doubles No. 21 and former World No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon doubles champion Jonas Björkman & current ATP doubles No. 14, partner Kevin Ullyett, the oldest pair in the field, both aged thirty-six, met the World No. 2 duo of Daniel Nestor, a Wimbledon 2002 runner-up & Nenad Zimonjić, a finalist at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2004 and 2006. Both teams remained close through the first two sets, with neither pair breaking the other, and each set going to a tie-break, the first won 14–12 by Nestor & Zimonjic, the second 7–3 by Bjorkman & Ullyett. The second seeds proved more efficient in the third set, winning their only break point and holding their advantage to the end to take a two-sets-to-one lead. The fourth set resembled the third, with Nestor & Zimonjic converting their two break points, while their opponents were unable to attack them on their service games.

He is also the third male player to complete a career Golden Slam, as Nestor also won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.
The last final of the day to be played on the Centre Court was the women's doubles'. Eleventh-seeded two-time winning pair of Serena Williams & Venus Williams, who had just won the women's singles crown, met sixteenth-seeded Lisa Raymond, & 2002 champion Samantha Stosur, also in course to play the mixed doubles final in the tournament. The Williams sisters proved to be as dominant through the final as they were during the whole competition, in which they lost no set and knocked out several seeded teams, among them French Open champions Anabel Medina Garrigues & Virginia Ruano Pascual, as Serena & Venus broke twice in each of the sets, saving three break points in the first set, and not facing a single one in the second, to claim the 2008 Wimbledon doubles title after a mere fifty-eight minutes of play, on the score of 6–2, 6–2.[tpl]cite news|author=Ian Westbrook|title=Williams pair take doubles crown| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7491749.stm|date =2008-07-05| accessdate =2008-07-07 | work=BBC News[/tpl] The doubles title was Serena & Venus' third in Wimbledon, and the seventh overall together, since the 1999 French Open.

===Day 13===

The final Sunday, featuring the men's singles final, saw Rafael Nadal win the first Wimbledon title of his career and fifth Grand Slam tournament. No. 1 seed and five-time champion Roger Federer was aiming to equal William Renshaw's record of six consecutive Wimbledon titles (1881–1886), and edge ever closer to Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam titles, of which Federer had 12. Nadal, the No. 2 seed and four-time French Open champion was Federer's challenger for the third consecutive year, and was aiming to become the first man since Björn Borg to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Nadal's countryman, Manuel Santana, the last Spaniard to have won the Wimbledon title (in 1966), said Nadal could take inspiration from Spain's victory in the recent European Championships, which Spain had last won in 1964.
Rain and lightning delayed the final, scheduled for 14:00, until 14:35 (UTC+1). The final itself was a fragmented affair, with two rain delays removing the possibility of an uninterrupted final. However, the playing time made it the longest final in Wimbledon history, at four hours and 48 minutes.[tpl]cite news|author=Piers Newbury|title=Nadal wins epic Wimbledon final| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7490443.stm|date =2008-07-06| accessdate =2008-07-06 | work=BBC News[/tpl]
Nadal began well, winning the first set 6–4 in just under an hour, and taking the second by the same scoreline, despite having been down 4–1 at one point.[tpl]cite news|author=Caroline Cheese|title=Federer v Nadal as it happened| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7491696.stm|date =2008-07-06| accessdate =2008-07-06 | work=BBC News[/tpl] The third set was interrupted by rain delays but the players returned to finish the set with a tie break, which Federer won by seven points to five. The fourth mirrored the third by also going to a tie break, in which Nadal took a 5–2 lead. Nadal was on serve but served a double fault and then was forced by Federer into a hitting a backhand into the net. Later in the tie break, Nadal had two championship points, including one on his serve, which he squandered, with Federer triumphing 10-8, and forcing a final set. The fifth set went only four games before another rain delay; the score was 2–2 (40–40) when they returned. Nadal eventually prevailed, winning the final set 9–7, at 21:16 local time. Nadal celebrated his win by climbing to his family in the crowd, including coach Toni Nadal, and then traversed a roofed area to shake hands with members of Spanish royalty. Pundit and three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe lauded it as "the greatest match I have ever seen." With a final score of 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(8) 9-7.
