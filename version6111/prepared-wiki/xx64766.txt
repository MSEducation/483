[[Fast Food Song]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 singles, Debut singles

"Fast Food Song" is a song made famous by the British-based band the Fast Food Rockers, although it existed long before they recorded it. It was released in June 2003 as the lead single from their album It's Never Easy Being Cheesy. The song was highly successful on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number two in the official charts. The song also achieved chart success worldwide and reached number fifty-six on the Australian ARIA Charts. The song was co-written and produced by Mike Stock. The lyrics were mildly controversial for supposedly promoting the excessive consumption of fast food by children, which is why some UK-based radio stations will not play the song when it is requested.
Most recently, Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked the song at number 87 on the list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever, commenting, "We'd like to see Morgan Spurlock spend 30 days listening to nothing but this song. He'd never survive."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/09/11/worst-songs/?icid=main[tpl]![/tpl]main[tpl]![/tpl]dl2[tpl]![/tpl]sec1_lnk1[tpl]![/tpl]169800|title=100 Worst Songs Ever|author=Wilkening, Matthew|date=September 11, 2010|publisher=AOL Radio|accessdate=December 19, 2010[/tpl] Another version, "De Pizzadans", recorded by Dynamite, had been a hit in Belgium.Bubblegum Dancer: Fast Food Rockers This song has also been used in many advertising campaigns in the UK, for fast food shops, especially around the time of the release. Many people have seen the song as promotional towards the chains, and see it as more of an advert than a song.
The band are widely considered to be one-hit wonders, though their two follow up singles "Smile Please" and "I Love Christmas" both achieved mild success in the UK Singles Chart reaching number 10 and 25 respectively.
