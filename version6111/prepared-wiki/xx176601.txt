==History==

The opening of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line road across the Tokyo Bay in 1997 saw increased competition from long-distance bus services offering cheaper fares, resulting in decreasing ridership figures on the Sazanami services.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/national/news/CK2014032502000261.html|title= 房総特急　引き潮　高速道充実で利用者減少|trans_title= Boso limited expresses ebbing: Passenger numbers falling due to improved expressway network|date= 25 March 2015|work= Tokyo Shimbun Web|publisher= The Chunichi Shimbun|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 26 March 2014 [/tpl] From the start of the 15 March 2014 timetable revision, the number of services was reduced to six return workings daily.
