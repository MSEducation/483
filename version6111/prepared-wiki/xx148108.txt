==History==

The school first opened in 1899 as a small white wooden school in De Soto. Then the high school was moved to the present day City Hall and after the destruction of the original school the lower grades were moved to a building where district offices are today nearby the City Hall. The high school was then expanded to include the present day community center which has one of the oldest sunken gyms still in use in the Midwest. After the school experienced overcrowding the present day middle school was built as the high school. The middle school was then moved to the City hall. After overcrowding yet again the High School was moved to its present location. The current administration is Dave Morford, Principal and Chuck Mahon, Associate Principal. Plans for extension in 2011 are being initiated to solve for the over-crowding problem at DHS. Currently, the school is over-capacity.
