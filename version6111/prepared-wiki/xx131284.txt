</ref> In 1967, Abdullah Sadiq attended [[University of Peshawar|Peshawar University]] where he joined the Physics Department as a graduate student, and taught courses in Mathematics. In 1969, he received his [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] in physics under the supervision of [[physicist]] [[Abdul Majid Mian]] from the [[University of Peshawar]]. His mentor, Abdul Majid Mian refused to recommend him for a job after his college degree and instead advised him to gain doctrate in physics.
His mentor recommended him to go United States and gained a doctrate degree in Material physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He went to United States for higher studies. In 1971, he got his Ph.D in Condensed Matter Physics under the supervision of Leo Kadanoff from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, U.S. Sadiq was a guest lecturer at International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).
Sadiq was a close friend of Russian theoretical physicist Nikolay Bogolyubov. Sadiq  also worked as the Rector of Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Topi, Pakistan. He retired in September 2007 and  resided in his home town of Peshawar and focusing on his school in RextinKore. Recently, he moved to Islamabad where he joined Air University at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) as nuclear physicist and also teaching solid state physics and Condensed Matter Physics at there. He is also serving as a dean of physics department Air University.

==Research in physics==

Sadiq's keen research in Statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics and Superconductivity. He also research interests in condensed matter physics have included Ising models, correlated percolation and its relationship to spin glass transition and long chain polymers. He has been active in the area of computer simulation of physical systems and his current studies relate to the kinetics of irreversible chemical processes.He is also teaching ordinary differential equations to mechatronics engineering department.

==Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission==

In 1968, Sadiq moved to Lahore, West-Pakistan where he joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's Lahore Atomic Center (LAC). There, under Ishfaq Ahmad, Sadiq carefully studied and carried out the experiments on quantum electrodynamics, structure constant of electrons, electromagnetic radiation, and the Maxwell's equations in the field of electrodynamics.
In the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Abdullah Sadiq, with among other Pakistani nuclear physicists, worked in a Nuclear Physics Division (NPD) at PINSTECH Department. Abdullah Sadiq was a keen researcher in the field of isotope technology, laser physics, optical physics, particle physics, and radiophysics. Abdullah Sadiq had also worked at neutron particle accelerator as a chief scientist. He has been a distinguished researcher at the PAEC where he worked with numerous physics research project there. In a physics event, he paid heavy tribute to PAEC Chairman Munir Ahmad Khan and Ishfaq Ahmad, who also helped him to write his doctorate thesis.
He carried out the research  the work on solid state physics and published numerous papers.  The main focus of his  research effort in this area is material preparation and characterization. He has extensive work experience in a number of sophisticated facilities, such as  electron microscopes, X-ray and neutron diITractometers, crystal growth equipment, and. Auger spectroscopy. All of these facilities  have been established for this purpose and the necessary experience acquired. This work is mainly concentrated at PINSTECH and Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad and the Abdus Salam Solid State Centre in Lahore.
After retiring from PAEC, Abdullah Sadiq worked as a professor of high-energy physics in many universities of Pakistan. Due to his work in Pakistan and PAEC. Abdullah Sadiq is consider one of the prominent nuclear physicist and nuclear scientist in Pakistan. He is also a visiting scientist at the Riazuddin National Center of Physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University. Sadiq has contributed to the reputed international physics journals recognized worldwide by the scientists. In 2002, President of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf also conferred on him Pakistan's 3rd high civilian award Sitara-e-Imtiaz for his diverse contributions to education and research in physics.
