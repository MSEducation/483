Oliver Laurence "Ollie" North (born October 7, 1943) is a former United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel, conservative political commentator and television host, military historian, and New York Times best-selling author.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/498/000024426/|title=Oliver North|publisher=nndb.com|accessdate=2014-01-25[/tpl] North was a National Security Council staff member during the Iran–Contra affair, a political scandal of the late 1980s. The scandal involved the clandestine sale of weapons to Iran, which was to encourage the release of U.S. hostages then held in Lebanon. North formulated the second part of the plan which was to divert proceeds from the arms sales to support the Contra rebel groups in Nicaragua (which had been specifically prohibited under the Boland Amendment). He is currently the host of War Stories with Oliver North on Fox News Channel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/war-stories/index.html |title=War Stories | Oliver North |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=October 16, 2012[/tpl]

While at Brockport, North spent a summer at the United States Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and gained an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1963. He received his commission as second lieutenant in 1968 (he missed a year due to injuries from an auto accident).

Although a heavy underdog, North beat Webb in a championship boxing match at Annapolis.Real Clear Sports Top 10 Most Athletic Democrats

==U.S. Marine Corps career==

North served as a platoon commander during the Vietnam War, where during his combat service, he was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal and two Purple Heart medals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF153BF934A35754C0A961948260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/C/Cushman,%20John%20H.%20Jr |title=NY Times: Washington Talk, July 7, 1987 |work=New York Times |date=July 7, 1987 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |first=John H. |last=Cushman Jr[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] He then became an instructor at The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia. In 1970, North returned to South Vietnam to testify at the trial of Corporal Randy Herrod, a U.S. Marine formerly under his command who had been charged with the mass killing of Vietnamese civilians."Did Military Justice Fail or Prevail?" Duke University Law Center on Law, Ethics, and National Security (reprinted from Michigan Law Review1998 North was promoted to Captain in 1971 and served as the commanding officer of the U.S. Marine Corps' Northern Training Area in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.
After his duty in Okinawa, Japan, North was assigned for four years to Marine Corps Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. He was then promoted to major, and served two years as the operations officer of 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, commanded by then Lt. Col. John Southy Grinalds, 2nd Marine Division in Camp Lejeune at Jacksonville, North Carolina. He attended the Command and Staff Course at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and graduated in 1981.
North began his assignment to the National Security Council (NSC) in Washington, D.C., where he served as the deputy director for political-military affairs[tpl]cite news|last1=Greenwald |first1=John |last2=Beckwith |first2=David |last3=Halevy |first3=David |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962859,00.html |title=Washington's Cowboys |work=Time |date=November 17, 1986 |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] from 1981 until his reassignment in 1986. In 1983, North received his promotion to lieutenant colonel,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bpcbakbusconf.com/2002-north.htm |title=Oliver North |work=Speaker Line-Up 2002 |publisher=The Bakersfield Business Conference |accessdate=December 23, 2008[/tpl] which would be his last.
During his tenure at the NSC, North managed a number of missions. This included leading the hunt for those responsible for the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing that killed 299 American and French military personnel, an effort that saw North arranging a midair interception of an EgyptAir jet carrying those responsible for the Achille Lauro hijacking. Whilst also at the NSC, he helped plan the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the 1986 Bombing of Libya.
During his trial, Oliver North spent his last two years on active duty assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps in Arlington, Virginia.
North resigned his Marine Corps commission in 1988.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/19/world/north-quits-marines-suggesting-subpoenas-for-highest-officials.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fN%2fNorth%2c%20Oliver%20L%2e|title=North Quits Marines |work=New York Times |date=March 19, 1988 |accessdate=December 21, 2012[/tpl]

==Military awards and decorations==

==Iran–Contra affair==

North came into the public spotlight as a result of his participation in the Iran–Contra affair, a political scandal during the Reagan Administration, in which he claimed partial responsibility for the sale of weapons via intermediaries to Iran, with the profits being channeled to the Contras in Nicaragua. It was alleged that he was responsible for the establishment of a covert network, which subsequently funneled those funds to the Contras. Congress passed the Boland Amendment (to the House Appropriations Bill of 1982 and following years) which prohibited the appropriation of U.S. funds by intelligence agencies for the support of the Contras. The money was passed through a shell organization, the "National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty", to the Palmer National Bank of Washington, D.C., and then to the Contras.
In an August 23, 1986 e-mail to National Security Advisor John Poindexter, Oliver North described a meeting with a representative of Panamanian President Manuel Noriega: "You will recall that over the years Manuel Noriega in Panama and I have developed a fairly good relationship," North writes before explaining Noriega's proposal. If U.S. officials can "help clean up his image" and lift the ban on arms sales to the Panamanian Defense Force, Noriega will "'take care of' the Sandinista leadership for us".[tpl]cite book | last1 = Cockburn | first1 = Alexander | last2 = St. Clair | first2 = Jeffrey | title = Whiteout: the CIA, drugs, and the press | publisher=Verso | year = 1998 | page = 287 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=s5qIj_h_PtkC&lpg=PA287&dq=%22take%20care%20of'%20the%20Sandinista%20leadership%20for%20us%22&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q=%22take%20care%20of'%20the%20Sandinista%20leadership%20for%20us%22&f=false | accessdate =November 30, 2010 | isbn = 1-85984-139-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last1 = North American Congress on Latin America | title = NACLA report on the Americas | volume = 27 | publisher=NACLA | year = 1993 | location = California | page = 31 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=RowpAQAAIAAJ&q=%22take+care+of%27+the+Sandinista+leadership+for+us%22&dq=%22take+care+of%27+the+Sandinista+leadership+for+us%22 | accessdate =November 30, 2010[/tpl]
North told Poindexter that President Noriega could assist with sabotage against the ruling party of Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. North supposedly suggested that Noriega be paid one million dollars in cash, from "Project Democracy" funds raised from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran—for the Panamanian leader's help in destroying Nicaraguan economic installations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/index.htm |title=The Oliver North File |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl]
In November 1986, as the sale of weapons was made public, North was dismissed by President Ronald Reagan and, in July 1987, was summoned to testify before televised hearings of a joint Congressional committee that was formed to investigate Iran–Contra. The image of North taking the oath in full Marine uniform became iconic, and helped to define him in the eyes of the public.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] During the hearings, North admitted that he had lied to Congress previously, for which and other actions, he was later charged. He defended his actions by stating that he believed in the goal of aiding the Contras, whom he saw as freedom fighters, against the Sandinistas and said that he viewed the Iran–Contra scheme as a "neat idea".[tpl]cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0117320/ |title=A Perfect Candidate (1996) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] North admitted shredding government documents related to his Contra and Iranian activities, at William Casey's suggestion, when the Iran–Contra scandal became public. He also testified that Robert McFarlane had asked him to alter official records to delete references to direct assistance to the Contras and that he had helped.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/irancontra/contra3.htm |title=Hostile Witnesses (Page Three) |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |date=August 19, 1998[/tpl]
North was tried in 1988. He was indicted on sixteen felony counts, and, on May 4, 1989, he was initially convicted of three: accepting an illegal gratuity; aiding and abetting in the obstruction of a congressional inquiry; and ordering the destruction of documents via his secretary, Fawn Hall. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on July 5, 1989, to a three-year suspended prison term, two years' probation, $150,000 in fines, and 1,200 hours community service. Oliver North performed some of his community service within Potomac Gardens, a public housing project in Southeast Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite web|last=Crawford|first=Craig|title=One Avenue, Two Faces: White House, Crack House|url=http://craigcrawford.com/2011/10/30/one-avenues-2-faces-white-house-crack-house/[/tpl]
However, on July 20, 1990, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0710FA385E0C728EDDAE0894D0484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fA%2fAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union |title=New York Times |work=The New York Times |date=July 21, 1988 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |first=Philip |last=Shenon[/tpl] North's convictions were vacated, after the appeals court found that witnesses in his trial might have been impermissibly affected by his immunized congressional testimony.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_02.htm |title=Walsh Iran / Contra Report – Chapter 2 United States v. Oliver L. North |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl]
Because North had been granted limited immunity for his Congressional testimony, the law prohibited a prosecutor from using that testimony as part of a criminal case against him. To prepare for the expected defense challenge that North's testimony had been used, the prosecution team had—before North's congressional testimony had been given—listed and isolated all of its evidence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Further, the individual members of the prosecution team had isolated themselves from news reports and discussion of North's testimony. While the defense could show no specific instance in which North's congressional testimony was used in his trial, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge had made an insufficient examination of the issue. Consequently, North's convictions were reversed. After further hearings on the immunity issue, Judge Gesell dismissed all charges against North on September 16, 1991.

===Allegations of involvement with drug traffickers===

Allegations were made, most notably by the Kerry Subcommittee, that North and other senior officials created a privatized Contra network that attracted drug traffickers looking for cover for their operations, then turned a blind eye to repeated reports of drug smuggling related to the Contras, and actively worked with known drug smugglers such as Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to assist the Contras.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9-IP6ASjCL4C&pg=PA145&dq=isbn:0788129848 |title=Drugs, Law Enforcement And Foreign Policy: Report By The Committee On Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, DIANE Publishing Company, (2004) ISBN 0-7881-2984-8 |publisher=Google Books |date=August 30, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] Most Contra associates found guilty of trafficking by the Kerry Committee were involved in the supply chain (ostensibly for "humanitarian goods", though the supply chain was later found to have serviced the transport of arms), which had been set up by North. Organizations and individuals involved in the supply chain under investigation for trafficking included the company SETCO (operated by large-scale trafficker Juan Matta-Ballesteros), the fruit company Frigorificos de Puntarenas, rancher John Hull, and several Cuban Exiles; North and other U.S. government officials were criticized by the Kerry Report for their practice of "ticket punching" for these parties, whereby people under active investigation for drug trafficking were given cover and pay by joining in the Contra supply chain. In addition to the Kerry Committee's investigation, the Costa Rican government of Óscar Arias conducted an investigation of Contra-related drug trafficking, and as a result of this investigation, North and several other U.S. government officials were permanently banned from entering Costa Rica.

==Later life and career==

===Politics===

In 1994, North unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as the Republican Party candidate in Virginia. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia endorsed Marshall Coleman, a Republican who ran as an independent, instead of North. North lost by a 46% to 43% margin to incumbent Democrat Charles Robb,[tpl]cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1994/94Stat.htm#46 |title=Statistics Of The Congressional Election Of November 8, 1994 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |accessdate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] a son-in-law of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Coleman received 11%. North's candidacy was documented in the 1996 film A Perfect Candidate.
In his failed bid to unseat Robb, North raised $20.3 million in a single year through nationwide direct mail solicitations, telemarketing, fundraising events, and contributions from major donors. About $16 million of that amount was from direct mail alone. This was the biggest accumulation of direct mail funds for a statewide campaign to that date, and it made North the top direct mail political fundraiser in the country in 1994.[tpl]cite news |title=Ollie, Inc.: how Oliver North raised over $20 million in a losing U.S. Senate race |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v16/ai_17195256 |accessdate =September 24, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013164841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v16/ai_17195256  |archivedate = October 13, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]

In 1990, North founded the Freedom Alliance, a 501(c)(3) foundation "to advance the American heritage of freedom by honoring and encouraging military service, defending the sovereignty of the United States and promoting a strong national defense". The foundation's primary activities include providing support for wounded combat soldiers and providing scholarships for the sons and the daughters of service members killed in action.the Freedom Alliance Website[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] Beginning in 2003, Sean Hannity has raised over $10 million for the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund through Freedom Concerts and donations from The Sean Hannity Show and its listeners.
