The Newer Stuff was the first Nesmith album to be released on compact disc.  The album contains eight new tracks (all recorded in 1980, according to Nesmith's comments in the CD booklet), two tracks from From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing, and four from Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma. The CD release featured additional tracks from the LP release.
The song Carioca is an alternate recording to the original version from the album Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma.
