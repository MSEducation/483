There is a substantial presence of people of Pakistani origin (estimated to be 200,000, about 1.0%), mainly Punjabis as well as smaller groups of Pashtuns, Sindhis, Urdu-speaking people, Kashmiris and a small number of Afghans and Nepalis. Urdu is widely spoken by these groups. They arrived in Malaysia as British soldiers of the Punjab Rifles Regiment and as businessmen and traders.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] They were initially listed as others but many have intermarried with local Muslims and most of them list themselves as Malays. People of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Nepali origin are often included in the "Indian" category for statistical purposes. Some well known tycoons and bankers are from this category. The Punjabis (mostly Sikhs) are substantial in number with around 100,000 of them in Malaysia. Punjabis were originally brought in as police, guards and soldiers. Many middle and upper class Punjabis in Malaysia speak English as their first language. A Tamil Muslim community of 200,000 also thrives as an independent subcultural group. 
When India came under British rule, Indian labourers were brought to Malaya to work on sugarcane and coffee plantations and later in the rubber and oil palm estates. Some of them also brought to work on the construction of buildings, railways, roads and bridges. Sri Lankan Tamils came to Malaya as white-collar workers, holding jobs like clerks, public servants and hospital assistants. As for the Punjabis from Punjab, most of them joined the army in Malaya while some handled the bullock-cart services in the country.
The Indians who came to Malaysia brought with them the Hindu and Sikh culture, its unique temples and Gurdwaras, cuisine and colourful garments. Hindu tradition remains strong until today in the Indian community of Malaysia. There's also the Chitty community in Malacca, similar to the Babas and Nyonyas, it is the result of the assimilation between Indian immigrants and local culture. Though they remain Hindu, the Chitties speak Bahasa Malaysia and women dress in sarong kebayas instead of sarees. However, other Indian Hindus retain their vernacular languages and dialects. The Hindu community celebrates two main festivals — Deepavali and Thaipusam — and many other smaller religious events each year. On the other hand, the Sikhs celebrate Vasakhi, Lodi and Gurpurab. Indians in Malaysia mainly speak Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Punjabi and Hindi.

====Others====

A small minority of Malaysians do not fit into the broader ethnic groups. A small population exists of people of European and Middle Eastern descent. Europeans and Middle Easterners, who first arrived during the colonial period, assimilated through intermarriage into the Christian and Muslim communities. Most Eurasian Malaysians trace their ancestry to British, Dutch and/or Portuguese colonists, and there is a strong Kristang community in Melaka.
The Nepali population numbers little over 600 and lives in Rawang, Selangor. Originally brought by the British as bodyguards and security personnel, they come from the Rana, Chettri, Rai and Gurung clans. Other minorities include Filipinos and Burmese. A small number of ethnic Vietnamese from Cambodia and Vietnam settled in Malaysia as Vietnam War refugees.
There is no general consensus on the ethnic profiling of children of mixed parentage. Some choose to be identified according to paternal ethnicity while others simply think that they fall in the "Others" category. The majority choose to identify as Malay as long as either parent is Malay, mainly due to the legal definition of Bumiputra. Children of Chinese–Indian parentage are known as Chindians. Though this is not an official category in national census data, it is an increasing number especially in urban areas.

==Languages==

Malaysia contains speakers of 137 living languages,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MY |title=Ethnologue report for Malaysia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] 41 of which are found in Peninsula Malaysia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MYP |title=Ethnologue report for Malaysia (Peninsular) |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] The official language of Malaysia is known as Bahasa Malaysia, a standardized form of the Malay language. English was, for a protracted period, the de facto, administrative language of Malaysia, though its status was later rescinded. Despite that, English remains an active second language in many areas of Malaysian society and is compulsory, serving as the medium of instruction for Maths and Sciences in all public schools per the PPSMI policy (which is pending reversal in 2012).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/9/nation/6630852&sec=nation|title=PAGE hands in second memorandum|accessdate=8 September 2010|publisher=The Star Online|date=9 July 2010|quote=Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced last year that the policy of Teaching of Mathematics and Science in English (known by its Malay acronym, PPSMI) would be scrapped from 2012.[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/7/8/nation/20090708144354&sec=nation|title=Math and Science back to Bahasa, mother tongues|publisher=The Star Online|accessdate=8 September 2010|date=8 July 2009[/tpl] Many businesses in Malaysia conduct their transactions in English, and it is sometimes used in official correspondence. Examinations are based on British English, although there has been much American influence through television. 
Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE), is a form of English derived from British English, although there is little official use of the term, except with relation to education. Malaysian English also sees wide use in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese dialect and Tamil influences. Most Malaysians are conversant in English, although some are only fluent in the Manglish form. The Malaysian government officially discourages the use of Manglish.[tpl]cite web|last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003643.html |title=Language Log: Malaysia cracks down on "salad language" |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl]
Malaysian Chinese mostly speak Chinese dialects from the southern provinces of China. The more common dialects in Peninsular Malaysia are Hakka, Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hainanese, and Hokchiu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phuakl.tripod.com/Chinese.htm |title=Book Review: The Chinese in Malaysia |publisher=Phuakl.tripod.com |accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl] In Sarawak, most ethnic Chinese speak either Foochow or Hakka while Hakka predominates in Sabah except in the city of Sandakan where Cantonese is more often spoken despite the Hakka-origins of the Chinese residing there. Hokkien is mostly spoken in Penang and Kedah whereas Cantonese is mostly spoken in Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur. However, in Malaysia as a whole, the majority of ethnic Chinese speak Mandarin as their first language, while English is the first language for the rest. Some of the less-spoken dialects such as Hainanese are facing extinction. As with Malaysian youths of other races, most Chinese youth are multilingual and can speak up to four languages with at least moderate fluency – their native Chinese dialect, Mandarin, English and Malay.
Tamil is the most common language spoken among Indians in Malaysia, especially in Peninsular Malaysia where they still maintain close cultural ties with their homeland. However, many Indians in East Malaysia, especially the younger generation, do not speak much Tamil and speak either Malay or English as their first language.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] This is because there are far fewer Indians in East Malaysia than in the Peninsula.
Citizens of Minangkabau, Bugis or Javanese origins, who can be classified "Malay" under constitutional definitions may also speak their respective ancestral tongues. The native tribes of East Malaysia have their own languages which are related to, but easily distinguishable from, Malay. The Iban is the main tribal language in Sarawak while Dusunic languages are spoken by the natives in Sabah.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=5i1aMcmLWlMC&pg=PA397&lpg=PA397&dq=Dusunic+languages#v=onepage&q=Dusunic%20languages&f=false |title=The Austronesian languages of Asia ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.ph |accessdate=21 September 2010[/tpl] A variant of the Malay language[tpl]Specify|date=September 2010[/tpl] that is spoken in Brunei is also commonly spoken in both states.

==Citizenship==

Citizenship is usually granted by lex soli.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 14 |range=-1[/tpl] Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card, known as MyKad, at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.[tpl]cite web|author=Leow Yong May |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/8/30/nation/18649549&sec=nation |title=More than just a card |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=27 October 2010[/tpl]

==Religion==

Islam is the largest and official religion of Malaysia, although Malaysia is a multi-religious society and the Malaysian constitution guarantees religious freedom. Despite the recognition of Islam as the state religion, the first 4 prime ministers have stressed that Malaysia could function as a secular state. According to the Population and Housing Census 2000 figures, approximately 60.4 percent of the population practised Islam; 19.2 percent Buddhism; 9.1 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 2.6 percent practise Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. The remainder was accounted for by other faiths, including animism, folk religion, and Sikhism while 0.9% either reported having no religion or did not provide any information.[tpl]cite web|author=Malaysian government statistics department |url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/english/census/pressdemo.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323094806/http://www.statistics.gov.my/english/census/pressdemo.htm |archivedate=23 March 2007 |title=Population and Housing Census 2000 |publisher=Web.archive.org |year=2001 |accessdate=23 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=General Report of the Population and Housing Census 2000 |author=Department of Statistics, Malaysia |year=2005 |publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia |location=Putrajaya |isbn=983-9044-26-5 |pages=60–64 |url= [/tpl]
The majority of Malaysian Indians follow Hinduism (84.5%), with a significant minority identifying as Christians (7.7%), Muslims (3.8%), over 150,000 Sikhs, and 1,000 Jains. Most Malaysian Chinese follow a combination of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and ancestor-worship but, when pressed to specify their religion, will identify themselves as Buddhists. Statistics from the 2000 Census indicate that 75.9% of Malaysia's ethnic Chinese identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Taoism (10.6%) and Christianity (9.6%), along with small Hui-Muslim populations in areas like Penang. Christianity constitutes a slim majority of the non-Malay Bumiputra community (50.1%) with an additional 36.3% identifying as Muslims while 7.3% follow folk religion.

===Islam===

Islam is thought to have been brought to Malaysia around the 12th century by Arab traders.[tpl]cite book |title=A History of Malaysia |pages=52–53 |author=Barbara Watson Andaya, Leonard Y. Andaya |isbn=0-333-27672-8 |year=1984 |publisher=MacMillan Press Ltd |location=Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK[/tpl]  (text at Google Books) Since then the religion has become the predominant religion of the country and is recognised as the state's official religion. All ethnic Malays are considered Muslim by Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 160 (2) |range=-1[/tpl]
Muslims are obliged to follow the decisions of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi`i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia.[ref]
