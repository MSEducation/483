A people mover or automated people mover (APM) is a fully automated, grade-separated mass transit system.
The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks, but is sometimes applied to considerably more complex automated systems.
The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/Skybus.html |title=Skybus in Pittsburgh |work= |accessdate=2010-04-17[/tpl][ref]
