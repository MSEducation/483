==History==

Liverpool is one of the oldest urban settlements in Australia, founded on 7 November 1810 http://www.library.mq.edu.au/digital/lema/1810/1810nov.html#nov7 as an agricultural centre by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He named it after Robert Banks Jenkinson, Earl of Liverpool, who was then the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the British city of Liverpool, upon which some of the area's architecture is based.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.155, ISBN 0-207-14495-8
Liverpool is at the head of navigation of the Georges River and combined with the Great Southern Railway from Sydney to Melbourne reaching Liverpool in the late 1850s, Liverpool became a major agricultural and transportation centre as the land in the district was very productive.
Until the 1950s, Liverpool was still a satellite town with an agricultural economy based on poultry farming and market gardening. However the tidal surge of urban sprawl which engulfed the rich flatlands west of Sydney known as the Cumberland Plain soon reached Liverpool, and it became an outer suburb of metropolitan Sydney with a strong working-class presence and manufacturing facilities. The Liverpool area also became renowned for its vast Housing Commission estates housing thousands of low-income families after the slum clearance and urban renewal programs in inner-city Sydney in the 1960s.

==Population==

===Demographics===

According to the 2011 census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Liverpool had a population of 24,095.  These came from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds; less than one-third (32.4%) of residents were born in Australia, which is less than half of the national average of 69.8%. The next most common countries of birth were Iraq 9.5%, India 5.9%, Croatia 4.0%, Fiji 3.2% and Bosnia and Herzegovina 3.2%.  This should be considered together with residents' self-reported ancestry in the same census to show another aspect of their cultural identity: only 8.4% identified this as Australian; the most popular responses were Australian 8.4%, Indian 8.0%, English 7.5% and Iraqi 5.9%.
The age distribution is just a little younger than the rest of the country: the median age of Liverpool residents was 33 years (national median is 37). Children aged 0-14 years made up 21.1% of the population (19.3% nationally) and people aged 65 years and over made up 11.1% of the population (14.0% nationally).
Liverpool is remarkable for the high proportion of people who reported following some religion in the Census; only 6.1% stated that they had no religion, much lower than the national average of 22.3%.  However, it should also be noted that this Census question is optional and 11.6% of residents did not respond to it, which introduces some uncertainty into all the religious figures. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 20.5%, Islam 13.3%, Eastern Orthodox 13.0%, Hinduism 7.5% and "Miscellaneous Religions" 7.1%.
Over half (51.1%) the dwellings in Liverpool were apartments and 50.3% were being rented, which is significantly higher than the national average of 29.6%. The median rent of $280 was marginally lower than the national average ($285), but the average household income of $922 per week was substantially lower the national average of $1,234.
