==Critical reception==

The Washington Post, reviewing Songs for Hannah, noted "Joy and glee, of course, can be subjective. The Hannah texts are pretty severe: There's a lot of 'the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness' and 'they that strive with the Lord shall be broken in pieces.' But (Dienes-Williams's) music was luminous, with insistent rhythms and an almost ancient, incantatory feel."[tpl]cite web | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1033870441.html?dids=1033870441:1033870441&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+09%2C+2006&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=A+Perfect+10+for+The+Women%27s+Chorus&pqatl=google | title=The Washington Post | work=A Perfect 10 for The Women's Chorus | date=9 May 2006 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | pages=C.03 (Style)[/tpl] (pay per view)
John W. Lambert, reviewing the Guildford Cathedral Choir's visit to Raleigh, NC during its US East Coast tour, observed that Dienes-Williams "has a huge and altogether favorable reputation among church musicians." He went on to say that the reputation was "richly deserved"; she was a "highly animated director, and she elicited some of the most remarkable “church choir” singing heard hereabouts in a long time." A Haydn motet "left many members of the audience awe-struck."[tpl]cite web | url=http://cvnc.org/article.cfm?articleId=1609 | title=Guildford Cathedral Choir Graces St. Michael's Sanctuary | publisher=CVNC, an online arts journal in North Carolina | date=16 February 2009 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | author=Lambert, John W.[/tpl]
