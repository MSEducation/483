 [tpl]California County Labelled Map[/tpl] 
The state of California is divided into 58 counties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uscounties.org/cffiles_web/counties/state.cfm?statecode=ca|accessdate=2012-04-07|title=Find A County|work=National Association of Counties[/tpl] Twenty-seven of them existed when the area was first carved into counties on February 18, 1850. Sixteen additional counties were added by 1860, as well as four more within five years of that date. Ten more counties were added by the turn of the century, and the last county, Imperial County, was formed in 1907. No new counties have been added since. California is home to San Bernardino County, the largest county in area not counting Alaska's boroughs (at [tpl]convert|20105|sqmi|km2[/tpl]).
