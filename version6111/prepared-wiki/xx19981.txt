Elizabeth  Jennings (18 July 1926 â€“ 26 October 2001) was an English poet.

==Life and career==

Jennings was born in Boston, Lincolnshire.  When she was six, her family moved to Oxford, where she remained for the rest of her life.Couzyn, Jeni (1985) Contemporary Women Poets. Bloodaxe, pp. 98-100. There she later attended St Anne's College.  After graduation, she became a librarian.Profile at the Poetry Archive

Jennings' early poetry was published in journals such as Oxford Poetry, New English Weekly, The Spectator, Outposts and Poetry Review, but her first book was not published until she was 27. The lyrical poets she cited as having influenced her were Hopkins, Auden, Graves and Muir. Her second book, A Way of Looking, won the Somerset Maugham award and marked a turning point, as the prize money allowed her to spend nearly three months in Rome, which was a revelation. It brought a new dimension to her religious belief and inspired her imagination.
Regarded as traditionalist rather than an innovator, Jennings is known for her lyric poetry and mastery of form.  Her work displays a simplicity of metre and rhyme shared with Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Thom Gunn, all members of the group of English poets known as The Movement. She always made it clear that, whilst her life, which included a spell of severe mental illness, contributed to the themes contained within her work, she did not write explicitly autobiographical poetry. Her deeply held Roman Catholicism coloured much of her work.
She died in a care home in Bampton, Oxfordshire and is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford.
