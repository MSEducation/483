CATEGORIES: Women's universities and colleges, Lists of universities and colleges

A women's college is an institution of higher education where enrollment is all-female.  In the United States, almost all women's colleges are private undergraduate institutions, with many offering coeducational graduate programs.  In other countries, laws and traditions vary.
While most of institutions listed are women's universities; there are very few that are universities for women (curriculum as per women's needs) for instance, Banasthali Vidyapith, Rajasthan India which also happens to be the largest integrated residential university for over 12,000 women in the world.
Where institutions have become coeducational, this is noted, along with the year the enrollment policy was changed.  Current women's colleges are listed in bold text.  Colleges that are closing or transitioning to coeducation are listed in italics.
