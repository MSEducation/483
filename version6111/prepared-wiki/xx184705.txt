Salvino now resides in Schaumburg, IL (USA), and has remained active in various capacities of the PBA -- including ambassador, executive board, and tournament committee positions, as well as one term as PBA president (1985-86).
Despite all his victories, Salvino listed a loss to his good friend Dick Weber in the finals of the 1988 PBA Showboat Senior Invitational among his most memorable tournaments. Although both Salvino and Weber were original PBA members when the organization was founded in 1958, the two had never met in a televised match until this 1988 tour stop. Due to the matches being completed ahead of schedule that day, Salvino and Weber were interviewed at the end of the broadcast and spent several minutes recalling memories of bowling's heyday."The sounds and the furious...", article by Carmen Salvino and Dick Denny, Bowling Digest, June, 2003.
Salvino has made a number of memorable marks on the sport of bowling throughout his seven decades (1950s-2011): champion, Hall-of-Famer, showman and entertainer, bowling ball scientist in the areas of physics and chemistry, bowling ambassador, as well as bowling health enthusiast. 
During the 1970s, Salvino claimed to have based his bowling style on a mathematical equation, which he never revealed. The equation covered the bowling stance and ball delivery that stressed accuracy. http://www.sj-r.com/sports/x6415431/Former-Boy-Wonder-Salvino-as-colorful-as-ever
