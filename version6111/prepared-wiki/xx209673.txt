Before iDance, Positive Gaming had been the European distributor for In the Groove, a 4-panel dance game developed by the American company Roxor Games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.positivegaming.com/news_attach/Press_release_18_08_06_ITG_PC_MAC.pdf|title=Press_release_18_08_06_ITG_PC_MAC.pdf|date=2006-08-18|publisher=Positive Gaming|accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Positive Gaming also helped develop a multiplayer version of In The Groove 2, specifically designed for fitness centers and schools, helping try to make "machine dance" more popular in Europe, with their multiplayer system also being featured during the 2007 Eurovision Dance Contest.
In December 2007, Positive Gaming sent out a press release announcing a search for stepchart artists and musicians for "new four panel interactive machine dance game software", announced to be released by "autumn 2008".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.positivegaming.com/news_attach/2007_12_07_Press_Release_Music_Stepcharts.pdf|title=Press Release|date=2007-12-17|publisher=Positive Gaming|accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] No new information about the game would be released until a press conference in March 2008 at a European In The Groove 2 championship (which was published by Positive Gaming in Europe), where the game was announced to be known as Positive Gaming iDANCE, confirming a fitness release in October 2008, and arcade and home releases in 2009. 7 songs were also confirmed, along with a statement that the game was not based on StepMania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/2008-eurocup-winners-712|title= 2008 EuroCup Winners and PGs New Game Details!|date=2008-03-16|publisher=Bemanistyle|accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl] In August 2008, a countdown was added to the game's website, counting down to the Leisure Industry Week 2008 convention in Birmingham, where the multiplayer version of iDance would get its first public showing.
Additional information and screenshots were released on September 7, 2008. The final songlist was confirmed to have 100 songs, with 5 difficulty levels for each, support for up to 32 players on the multiplayer version, and a 3D game engine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/positive-gaming-idance-multiplayer-press-release-991|title=Positive Gaming iDANCE Multiplayer Press Release|publisher=Bemanistyle|accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl]
