==List of commandants==

Thirty-five  men have served as the Commandant of the Marine Corps, including the current Commandant James F. Amos.  The first Commandant was Samuel Nicholas, who took office as a captain, though there was no office titled "Commandant" at the time, and the Second Continental Congress had authorized that the senior-most Marine could take a rank up to Colonel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Docs_Speeches/Continentialcongressestmarines1775.htm|title=Resolution Establishing the Continental Marines|last=Journal of the Continental Congress|date=10 November 1775|publisher=United States Marine Corps History Division|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] The longest-serving was Archibald Henderson, sometimes referred to as the "Grand old man of the Marine Corps" due to his thirty-nine-year tenure. In the 236-year history of the United States Marine Corps, only one Commandant has ever been fired from the job: Anthony Gale, as a result of a court-martial in 1820.
