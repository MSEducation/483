In 225 innings of work, Bush posted a 15–10 record with a 6.20 ERA, one of the worst in the league that season. He gave up 291 hits, fifth highest in the league, and led the league in earned runs allowed with 155 and [[wild pitch]]es with 12. In November [tpl]By|1930[/tpl], writer [[F.C. Lane]] wrote in ''Baseball Magazine'' about Bush's unique pitching windup:

Bush had an improved season in [tpl]By|1931[/tpl], thanks to performances such as a September 13 one-hitter against the Braves. He finished the year with a 16–8 record and a 4.49 ERA, in 180.1 innings of work. The following year, the Cubs again won the pennant behind Bush's 19–11 record and 3.20 ERA. That year, Bush finished the year third in the league for wins and 23rd in the NL MVP voting. The Cubs were pinned up against the New York Yankees in the 1932 World Series. It was an infamous matchup, known now for the general tension and fighting between both teams. Bush did not fare well this time around in the World Series. As the starting pitcher for the Cubs in Game 1, Bush gave up eight runs on three hits, and walked five in just five innings of work, en route to a 12–6 Yankees win.[ref]
