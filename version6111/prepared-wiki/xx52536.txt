==The Daily Worker (1930–1966)==

===Early years===

The Morning Star was founded in 1930 as the Daily Worker, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain."The Papers of the Communist Party of Great Britain", The Archive hub, University of Manchester The first edition was produced on 1 January 1930"Help for Researchers: Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Twentieth Century", British Library website from the offices of the newspaper in Tabernacle Street, London by eight Party members including Kay Beauchamp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=394-cp_3&cid=-1&Gsm=2008-06-18#-1 |title=Access to Archives |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] In January 1934 The Daily Worker's offices moved to Cayton Street off the City Road. On 1 October 1935, the first eight page Daily Worker was produced.
The paper criticised Sir Walter Citrine after a Paris meeting with French Labour Minister Charles Pomaret in December 1939. Time said of the events following the meeting, "Minister Pomaret clamped down on French labour with a set of drastic wage-&-hour decrees and Sir Walter Citrine agreed to a proposal by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon that pay rises in Britain be stopped".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884032,00.html |title=Reds, Labor and the War|date=13 May 1940|publisher=TIME|accessdate=14 July 09[/tpl]
Citrine sued the Daily Worker for libel after it accused him and his associates of "plotting with the French Citrines to bring millions of Anglo-French Trade Unionists behind the Anglo-French imperialist war machine"; the publisher pleaded the British press equivalent of 'fair comment'. Citrine alleged, in response to his lawyer's questioning, that the Daily Worker received £2,000 pounds per month from "Moscow", and that Moscow directed the paper to print anti-war stories.
On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain spoke to the nation on the BBC, at which time he announced the formal declaration of war between Britain and Nazi Germany. Backed by his political ally, Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt, Daily Worker editor J. R. Campbell sought to portray the conflict against Hitler as a continuation of the anti-fascist fight.James Eaton and David Renton The Communist Party of Great Britain since 1920, Basingstoke: Pallgrave, 2002, pp.69–70 This contradicted the position of the Comintern, which became CPGB policy on 3 October, that the war was a struggle between rival imperialist powers, and Campbell was removed as editor as a result. The newspaper responded to the assassination of Leon Trotsky by a Soviet agent with an article on 23 August 1940 entitled "A Counter Revolutionary Gangster Passes", written by former editor Campbell.http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/etheory/1933-93/pdf/40Trotsky.pdf

===World War II===

During the period in World War II when the Soviet Union was in alliance with Germany the Daily Worker ceased to attack Nazi Germany and advocated policies that some perceived as seeking to undermine the war effort.Editorial "The 'Daily Worker", Manchester Guardian, 22 January 1941, reprint on The Guardian[tpl]'s[/tpl] website.  For this reason in January 1941 the newspaper was suppressed by the wartime coalition's (Labour) Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison. The ban was lifted in September 1942 following a campaign supported by Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, and Professor J. B. S. Haldane. A "Lift the ban" conference at Central hall, Westminster on 21 March 1942 was attended by over 2,000 delegates. A key part of the campaign was to secure Labour Party support (Herbert Morrison was a fierce opponent of the Daily Worker). On 26 May 1942, after a heated debate, the Labour Party carried a resolution declaring the Government must lift the ban on the Daily Worker. During the ban the Daily Worker offices at Cayton Street were totally destroyed by fire during The Blitz on 16 April 1941. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 to the former Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street (from where the old Communist Party Sunday Worker edited by William Paul had been printed from 15 March 1925 until 1929). In 1945 new offices were acquired at a former brush makers warehouse at 75 Farringdon Road, London EC1 for the sum of £48,000. A Scottish edition of the Daily Worker was produced from its plant in Glasgow from 11 November 1940.
Since September 1945 the paper has been owned and published by a readers' co-operative, the People's Press Printing Society, which operates on a one-vote-per-shareholder basis.

===Post-war===

The Daily Worker was fully supportive of the show trials in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria in the late 1940s as well as the split with Tito and Yugoslavia in 1948.Keith Laybourn Marxism in Britain: Dissent, Decline and Re-emergence 1945-c.2000, Abingdon: Routledge, 2006, p.43
The last edition of the Daily Worker was published on Saturday 23 April 1966. An editorial in that final issue declared: "On Monday this newspaper takes its greatest step forward for many years. It will be larger, it will be better and it will have a new name.... During its 36 years of life our paper has stood for all that is best in British working-class and Socialist journalism. It has established a reputation for honesty, courage and integrity. It has defended trade unionists, tenants, pensioners. It has consistently stood for peace. It has always shown the need for Socialism. Let all Britain see the Morning Star, the inheritor of a great tradition and the herald of a greater future". 

==The Morning Star (1966 to present)==

===History===

The first edition of the Morning Star appeared on Monday, 25 April 1966.
By the late 1970s, the paper and the CPGB were beginning to come into conflict with each other, as the Eurocommunist trend in the CPGB grew while the Morning Star retained a pro-Soviet stance and opposed eurocommunism.Christine F. Collette and Keith Laybourn Modern Britain Since 1979: A Reader, London: I.B. Tauris, 2003, p.185 In December 1981, when the Polish Solidarity trade union movement was suppressed and martial law declared, the paper criticised the Executive Committee of the party for condemning the acts of the (then communist) Polish government.Laybourn Marxism in Britain, p.116 In 1982, the Morning Star attacked the attitudes of Marxism Today, the party's monthly journal, which was controlled by the eurocommunists.John Callaghan The Far Left in British Politics, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987, p.186
The paper supported the National Union of Mineworkers during the miners' strike of 1984–1985, but the party had become critical of Scargill's strategy towards the end of the strike.Laybourn  Marxism in Britain, p.122 Meanwhile, the party EC put forward candidates to challenge those loyal to Morning Star editor Tony Chater, and his deputy, at the 1984 AGM of the PPPS and called for Chater's replacement. He was expelled from the CPGB at this time,Collette and Laybourn Modern Britain Since 1945, p.190 but in June 1985 AGMs of the PPPS held in Glasgow, Mqanchester and London voted by about 60 to 40%  for candidates backed by the management committee of the Morning Star.Callaghan, p.187 Chater remained editor of the paper for another decade.
Successive annual general meetings of the People's Press Printing Society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on Britain's Road to Socialism, the programme of the Communist Party of Britain;People's Press Printing Society Limited 61st Annual Report for Annual General Meeting June 2006, p. 4 in its earlier forms before 1985, the programme of the CPGB.

===Editorial policy===

On international issues the paper advocates a "two-state" solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and calls for Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories. It was the only daily paper in Britain to oppose the Kosovo War,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] denouncing North Atlantic Treaty Organization military intervention, and consistently defended Serbian President Slobodan Milošević,  according to other far-left publications,See for example Charlie Kimber "Milosevic- a socialist?", Socialist Worker 14 October 2000, p.4 and Roger Dark "Try Milosevic!" Weekly Worker No. 355 October 2000. and opposed NATO in the 1999 Kosovo War against what remained of the former Yugoslavia. The newspaper opposed the Iraq War.
On Northern Ireland the paper takes a pro-Irish nationalism line. News reports from Northern Ireland are described as "By Our Foreign Desk".
As its masthead suggests, the paper generally supports peace and socialism. It is Eurosceptic and supported the No2EU platform in the 2009 European Parliament election. It is critical of the upper or ruling classes. It defends peaceful protests and civil disobedience and industrial action by workers to improve working conditions and wages. The Morning Star is concerned with environmental issues and supports environment campaigning groups; it advocates unilateral nuclear disarmament. In elections the paper endorses the Communist Party of Britain; where the CPB is not standing, the paper advocates a vote for the Labour Party.

===Contributors and staff===

In the first years of the twenty-first century the paper has carried contributions from Uri Avnery, John Pilger, Green activist Derek Wall, ex-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Green MP Caroline Lucas, Respect MP George Galloway, former MP Alan Simpson, the cartoonist Martin Rowson, and many trade union general secretaries. Features are contributed by writers from a range of socialist, social democratic, green and religious perspectives. Despite this, according to John Haylett in 2005: "things that happened in the Soviet Union 70 years ago are still being used as a stick to beat the Morning Star."[tpl]lopsided|date=February 2014[/tpl]
On 1 January 2009, Bill Benfield took over as editor of the Morning Star.[tpl]cite news|last=Benfield|first=Bill|title=New year, old struggles|newspaper=Morning Star|date=31 December 2008|page=18[/tpl] John Haylett, who had been editor since 1995, took up the post of political editor. Bill Benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production.
In May 2012, Richard Bagley became editor of the Morning Star,[tpl]cite news|last=Bagley|first=Richard|title=What's next for the Daily Miracle|newspaper=Morning Star|date=22 May 2012|page=16[/tpl] having already worked at the paper in various positions since 2001.

===Finances and circulation===

The Morning Star carries little commercial advertising, with low advertising rates,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/72694 |title=Contact Us |publisher=Morningstaronline.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] and the cover price does not cover print and distribution. Consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. The paper relies on its "Star Fund" appeal (monthly target £16,000).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/5909 |title=/ Home – Morning Star |publisher=Morningstaronline.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] In its past, the paper received subsidy from the Soviet Union in the form of bulk orders. In 1981, its circulation was about 36,000 (down from the Daily Worker's 1947 peak of 122,000).Tomlinson J. Left Right, London: John Calder, 1981.
In March 2005, BBC News Magazine reported the Morning Star[tpl]'[/tpl]s circulation as between 13,000 and 14,000, quoting John Haylett's comment "perhaps only one in 10 of these readers would label themselves as communists", while in August 2006, The Guardian reported the print run to be "around 25,000".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/aug/03/olympicsandthemedia.pressandpublishing | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Morning Star faces Olympic challenge | first=Ben | last=Dowell | date=3 August 2006 | accessdate=13 May 2010[/tpl]
The Morning Star has also taken a much higher profile at trade union gatherings and within the UK trade union movement, particularly with unions such as Unite, GMB, and RMT. Since 2008, the Morning Star has hired exhibition space at the Trades Union Congress, with sponsored copies being handed out to delegates and a special deal with a large independent newsagent Martin McColl to provide copies of the paper at half the cover price for a limited period for delegates who opted for home delivery of the newspaper.
During the early morning of 28 July 2008, the offices of the newspaper were damaged by fire,"Morning Star offices go up in smoke", Metro, 28 July 2008. and the edition of 29 July took a reduced form.
On 1 June 2009, the Morning Star was re-launched. The re-launch included a 16-page edition during the week, and a 24-page weekend edition. There was also an expanded use of colour pictures and graphics, plus a redesign and a modern layout of the pages. The Morning Star also redesigned its website. In addition a number of new and experienced journalists were engaged and the positions of full-time Industrial Correspondent and Lobby Correspondent in the House of Commons were reintroduced.
In November 2011, the Morning Star launched an urgent appeal to raise £75,000 in order to address a number of funding issues which meant the paper might have gone under by the end of the year.Sunny Hundal "Morning Star could go under by Christmas", Liberal Conspiracy, 16 November 2011
Starting on Monday 18 June 2012, the Morning Star will enter into a printing press partnership with Trinity Mirror, which will help improve distribution of the Morning Star to all parts of the country, particularly Scotland.
