    cross Sion-Panvel Expressway: 126 meters
2. Project Cost:36 crores

==Housing Projects==

CIDCO framed its housing policy incorporating self-financing principle
using land as a prime resource in development of housing sector to meet the fast growing demand for all sections of society. The primary objective was to make the land affordable to all income groups and to allow all land uses. Households in Navi Mumbai are divided into various income categories, especially for the purpose of housing calculation (EWS is the economically weaker section, LIG is low-income group, MIG is the middle income group, and HIG is the high-income group). This is being used to achieve cross subsidisation. The higher income groups would pay a surcharge for housing, which would subsidise housing for the lower income groups. CIDCO decided to use a maximum surcharge of 15% on housing for highest income to compensate for a maximum subsidy of 45% to lowest income groups. Between 1970 and 1990, CIDCO was prime supplier of fully constructed affordable houses under conventional approach to the EWS, LIG, MIG and to some extent HIG.

Modern Technologies in use
The dynamics of ever changing technologies has always been a subject of keen interest for CIDCO, which lay the foundation of innovation in housing in the year 1972. The Corporation used load bearing composite masonry - involving brickwork and RCC mullions. Later, large-sized prefab panels were used. Innovations kept happening with various emerging technologies like Prefab Channel Slab, 3-S Siporex System, Tunnel Form, advanced Tunnel Form, MIVAN and earthquake resistant technology.
Seawoods Estate
Navi Mumbai is not known as the ideal modern city for no reason. While planning the city, CIDCO took every possible care to see that the citizens love to call it their home. A glimpse of this ambition was visible as Seawoods Estate emerged.
Located on a verdant 2,30,000 sq. m of land, Seawoods Estate in Nerul is an exclusive residential complex of elegant apartments and duplex penthouses. The Phase-I, developed in the year 1996, consisted of 46 towers and 1,534 apartments and is fully occupied. Set on a lush green landscape by the sea, the project offers an amazing harmony – a perfect blend of serene environment and comfort living – amidst the hustle and bustle of Navi Mumbai.
Initially planned for NRIs, these apartments are now being offered to resident Indians too. Automatic membership to an exclusive Spanish villa type clubhouse with contemporary facilities is also available.
What makes Seawoods Estate the crème-de-la-crème of housing projects ?
1. Manmade water bodies, mounds, downs and meadows within the complex.
2. Green landscaping all around.
3. A sea-facing rotunda and promenade with a tree-lined avenue.
4. An extensive recreation ground, away from the vehicular traffic area.
5. Creatively designed playground with many nooks and corners, with shaded and uncovered areas on
    different levels to facilitate imaginative and creative games.
Seawoods Estate-II
Considering the high demand for Higher Income Group Apartments on the Palm Beach Marg, CIDCO has planned and taken up the construction of the remaining apartments of the Seawoods Estate in the year 2007.
The project consists of four buildings with 252 apartments and offers 2 BHK, 3 BHK, duplex and penthouse apartments. A spacious clubhouse, swimming pool, children’s play area and greenery dotting the landscape will add to the sense of luxurious living in this complex.
