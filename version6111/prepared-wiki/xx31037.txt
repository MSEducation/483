In January 2008, Dish Network was spun-off from EchoStar, its former parent company, which was founded by Charlie Ergen as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980.  The company began using Dish Network as its consumer brand in March 1996, after the successful launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, in December 1995.  That launch marked the beginning of its subscription television services, and EchoStar has since launched numerous satellites, with nine owned and leased satellites in its fleet as of January 2013.  EchoStar continues to be the primary technology partner to Dish Network.

====Hopper with Sling====

At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, Dish announced the Hopper with Sling, an updated version of the Hopper with Slingbox place-shifting technology built-in, allowing the ability to watch live TV and DVR recordings online or through a free Dish Anywhere mobile app, and the ability to "fling" content from a mobile device (such as videos or photos) onto the TV as well. A Hopper Transfers app for the iPad also allows recordings to be downloaded directly to the device for offline viewing, but has decided not to support the also popular Android devices for offline viewing, and a new Dish Explorer app also provides control of the Hopper along with integration with social networks to track trends and reactions to a program. The new Hopper also includes a 2 TB hard drive (allowing the storage of up to 2,000 hours of standard definition recordings and 500 hours in high definition) and a Broadcom BCM7425 CPU.[tpl]cite web|last=Lendino|first=Jamie|title=CES 2013: Dish Launches Sling-Enabled Hopper|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414135,00.asp|publisher=PC World|accessdate=11 January 2013[/tpl]
CNET praised the Hopper with Sling for being cutting-edge technology that "helps Dish make a strong case that its HD DVR is the most advanced out there." It subsequently nominated the new Hopper for the CES Best in Show award (which was decided by CNET), and had won the award based off the original vote of CNET's staff. However, CNET's parent company CBS Corporation vetoed the results, disqualified the device, and forced a re-vote because CBS was in active litigation with Dish.[tpl]cite web|title=Dish Recorder Snubbed for CNET Award Over CBS Legal Scuffle|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/01/10/dish-recorder-snubbed-for-cnet-award-over-cbs-legal-scuffle/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=CNET Picked Dish Hopper as 'Best of CES' ...
