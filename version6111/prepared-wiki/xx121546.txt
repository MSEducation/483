The song is a protest against then President George H. W. Bush. The song features audio samples of his voice, with him repeating "A new world order" over and over again at the end of the song. At this point of the song in the video, Bush is portrayed by an actor with an enormous papier-mâché head, grabbing his crotch and waving his arms. The majority of the video is a mix of police beatings, riots, and gunfights. It also includes a scene in which a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty is beaten by police in a manner similar to the famous amateur video of Rodney King being beaten by police.
The music video was featured on Beavis and Butt-Head along with "Just One Fix" off the same album, although the credits for each song call the album Psalms 69. 
"N.W.O." was featured in the soundtrack of the film Cool World (Songs from the Cool World).
"It's alright! It's alright!" in the song is a clip of Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now when he first greets the PBR boat.
The song was featured in the video game Need for Speed: The Run.http://www.needforspeed.com/en_GB/post/need-speed-soundtrack-announced?source=therun
