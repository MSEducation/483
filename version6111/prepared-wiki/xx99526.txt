Roger Eugene Eno was born in Woodbridge, England in 1959. He is known primarily as an ambient music composer.[tpl]cite book|last=Gagné|first=Nicole V.|title=Historical dictionary of modern and contemporary classical music|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780810879621|pages=91|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dTnN4bLQSD4C&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=composer+%22Roger+Eno%22&source=bl&ots=VjUM4853O5&sig=7YvC3_IMwCIiaioBQuU64jOsj1I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RIUDUIr8IImK2wX8tJDACw&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=composer%20%22Roger%20Eno%22&f=false[/tpl]    
He began euphonium lessons at 12, and at 16 entered Colchester College to study music. On graduating, and after a period of busking in London (where he briefly shared a house with artists Mark Wallinger and Andy Dog), he returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for the mentally handicapped.
His first recording experience was in 1983 with his brother Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois for the album Apollo at Lanois’ Grant Avenue Studios in Canada. His first solo album, Voices, was released in 1985.  
Although mainly regarded as a pianist, Roger Eno is in fact a multi-instrumentalist and keen singer, as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including Bill Nelson, No-Man, Lol Hammond, Mads Arp, Peter Hammill, Tim Bowness, and Michael Brook, the most successful of which was probably his co-written album, The Familiar, with Kate St John.
Eno performs live on occasion and continues to write soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films, including For All Mankind, Nine and a Half Weeks, Warm Summer Rain and The Jacket, while tracks have been used in advertisements, including for Nissan and for Japan Railways.
Eno has recently recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the UK-based internet label Burning Shed. In 2007, he contributed to the Mid/Air LP by Dive Index, a collaborative music project of composer/producer Will Thomas.
In 2013 Eno released a new album, Endless City / Concrete Garden , under the name Roger Eno / Plumbline.http://www.rogereno.com/new-for-2013.php
