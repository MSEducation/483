The 1987 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 106th season in St. Louis, Missouri and the 96th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 95-67 during the season and finished first in the National League East Division for the third and last time before moving to the NL Central in 1994. They went on to win the NLCS in seven games over the San Francisco Giants. In the World Series against the Minnesota Twins, after having fallen behind 2-0 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, they won their next three games at home. However, back at the Metrodome, they lost the last two and fell one game short of a World Series title. It would be the Cardinals' last World Series appearance until 2004.

==Offseason==

==Regular season==

September highlights included a Terry Pendleton home run on a September 11 game against the contending Mets as well as a Tom Herr walk-off grand slam against the Mets on Seat Cushion Night.  As St. Louis proceeded into the post-season, they found themselves without clean-up hitter Jack Clark, the team's number-one offensive threat.  He damaged his ankle when he caught a cleat in the artificial turf at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-10-09/sports/26215384_1_jack-clark-turtlenecks-and-long-sleeves-cardinals |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |last=Peter |first=Pascarelli |title=Jack Clark's frustrating postseason: Cards slugger is pained by injury and uncertain about return |date=October 9, 1987[/tpl]   Nonetheless, the Redbirds won 95 games to capture the NL East title.

===World Series===

The Minnesota Twins defeated the Cardinals in seven games.  This Series was the first in which the home team won each of the seven games.  The Cardinals held their own at Busch Stadium, but the electronically enhanced crowd noise and the "Homer Hankies" in the Metrodome appeared to the give the Twins an edge.  The booming bats of the Twins were too much for the Cardinals' "inside baseball" style of offense in Games 1, 2, and 6.  In Game 7 it was the Twins' pitching that shut down the Cardinals.
