</ref> Bevan stated at the Trafalgar rally: <blockquote>"We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.<br><br>We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force in the case of a small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony, I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.<br><br>They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!"<ref name="Aneurin Bevan 1956"/></blockquote> That year, he was finally elected as party treasurer, beating [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]].
In 1957, Bevan joined Richard Crossman and Morgan Phillips in a controversial lawsuit for libel against The Spectator magazine, which had described the men as drinking heavily during a socialist conference in Italy. Having sworn that the charges were untrue, the three collected damages from the magazine. Many years later, Crossman's posthumously published diaries confirmed the truth of The Spectator's charges.

Bevan dismayed many of his supporters when he suddenly reversed his opposition to nuclear weapons.,[tpl]cite book|author=Peter Dorey|title=The Labour Governments 1964-1970|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YR3Il4gD4X8C&pg=PA12|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=12[/tpl] Speaking at the 1957 Labour Party conference, he decried unilateral nuclear disarmament, saying "It would send a British Foreign Secretary naked into the conference-chamber". This statement is often misconstrued: Bevan argued that unilateralism would result in Britain's loss of allies, and one interpretation of his metaphor is that nakedness would come from the lack of allies, not the lack of weapons.[tpl]cite book|author=John Callaghan|title=The Labour Party and Foreign Policy: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z7y1nYPOIocC&pg=PA225|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=225[/tpl] According to the journalist Paul Routledge, Donald Bruce, a former MP and Parliamentary Private Secretary and adviser to Bevan, had told him that Bevan's shift on the disarmament issue was the result of discussions with the Soviet government where they advised him to push for British retention of nuclear weapons so they could possibly be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300005 |title=Nye Bevan's sensational secret |accessdate=2008-10-13|last=Routledge |first=Paul|date=2005-05-30|publisher=New Statesman| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080905091305/http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300005| archivedate= 5 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 1959, Bevan was elected as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. In pain, he checked into a hospital at the end of 1959 to undergo surgery for an ulcer, but malignant stomach cancer was discovered instead.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=73-Trt8fqz8C&pg=PA118 |page=118 |title=The labour party and British Society: 1880–2005 |last=Rubinstein |first=David |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-84519-056-4[/tpl] Bevan died the following year at the age of 62 at his home Asheridge Farm, Chesham, Buckinghamshire. His remains were cremated at Gwent Crematorium in Croesyceiliog.
His last speech in the House of Commons, in the Debate of the 3 November 1959 on the Queen's Speech,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1959-11-03a.860.1#g860.7|date=3 November 1959|journal=Hansard|publisher=Theyworkforyou.com|volume=612|page=Columns 860–985|title=Debate On The Address|issue=House of Commons Debate|accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl] in which Bevan referred to the difficulties of persuading the electorate to support a policy which would make them less well-off in the short term but more prosperous in the long term, was quoted extensively in subsequent years.
In 2004, over 40 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, this being credited much to his contribution to the Welfare State after World War Two.
