It contains no gold and its colour and weight are quite unlike pure gold. It is non-allergenic; its other advantages include antimycotic  and weak antimicrobial (especially after abrasion)  attributes, and resistance to tarnishing. The alloy and its tradename are the intellectual property of the global metals and manufacturing group, Luvata (formerly Outokumpu Copper Products).[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
