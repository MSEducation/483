Shortly after crossing the Oldtown city limits, SH-41 intersects State Avenue, which straddles the state (and city) line between Oldtown, Idaho, and Newport, Washington.  North of this intersection, the northbound lanes lie in Oldtown, while the southbound lanes are known as State Route 41 by the Washington State Department of Transportation, and lie in Newport.  Approximately 7 blocks north of the intersection with State Avenue, SH-41 ends at U.S. Route 2.  The eastern terminus of Washington State Route 20 is three blocks west of the northern terminus of SH-41.[tpl]yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=48.180041&lon=-117.039622&zoom=16&q1=newport%2C%20wa |title=Newport, WA |accessdate=June 8, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

State Street straddles the Washington–Idaho state line, with the southbound lane in Newport and the northbound lane in Oldtown, Idaho. Between Walnut and Fourth, the Idaho side of the street is part of State Highway 41, which runs from US-2 at the state line south to Interstate 90 at Post Falls. Until 1997, the Washington side of the street was part of US 2, which created confusion as each side of the street was part of a completely different highway. In 1997 the Washington side of State Street was designated SR 41 to match the Idaho numbering.
