It aired on the New York City-owned public television station WNYC-TV (now WPXN-TV) in from 1984 to 1996. In 1996, the program moved to WNYE-TV after WNYC-TV was sold by the city to a private company.

==Show format & guest hosts==

Video Music Box format differed from other video shows of its era and later by eschewing a studio format. Most shows were shot on-location throughout New York City in parks, schools, and nightclubs. During interludes from videos, the hosts would often allow regular people to give shout-outs to their friends and families. Very often, the hosts would do man-on-the-street segments where they discussed the issues of the day, such as the first Gulf War, teen sex, and issues in hip hop and music in general.
The show also had theme-based shows during the week, such as slow jams on Tuesdays, nervous Thursdays hosted by Crazy Sam, and old-school Fridays. Among the other hosts the show has had during its run were Tuffy and Ray Dejon.
