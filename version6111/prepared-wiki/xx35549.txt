Hassell National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia (Australia), [tpl]convert|367|km[/tpl] southeast of Perth and [tpl]convert|57|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north east of Albany.[tpl]cite web|title=Location of Hassell National Park|url=http://www.exploroz.com/Places/67034/WA/Hassell_National_Park.aspx|accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]
Named after John Hassell, a retired sea captain, who was responsible for opening up extensive areas in the south of the State during the 1850s as he extended his pastoral leases east from Frankland as far as Jerramungup.
The park straddles the South Coast Highway between Manypeaks and Wellstead.
The site is regarded as an important ecological area as a result of it being a largely intact vegetation and wildlife corridor that serves as a link between the Mount Manypeaks and Waychinicup areas with the Cheynes Baech and Pallinup areas.[tpl]cite web|title=WA National Parks Accommodation|url=http://www.nationalparksaccom.com.au/western-australia|accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]
