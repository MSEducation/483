A customs union is a type of trade bloc which is composed of a free trade area with a common external tariff. The participant countries set up common external trade policy, but in some cases they use different import quotas. Common competition policy is also helpful to avoid competition deficiency.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aYBoUpj4xTMC&pg=PA177&dq=Trade+creation+and+diversion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3iZgUaS_JszrrQfwk4EI&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Trade%20creation%20and%20diversion&f=false | title=International Economics, Volume IV | publisher=Routledge | author=Winters, Alan L | year=1991 | pages=528 pages[/tpl]
