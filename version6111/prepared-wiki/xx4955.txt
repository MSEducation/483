Incest is sexual activity between family members or close relatives.[tpl]cite web|title=Incest|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/incest[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Incest|publisher=Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN)|year=2009|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/types-of-sexual-assault/incest[/tpl] This typically includes sexual activity between people in a consanguineous relationship (blood relations), and sometimes those related by affinity, such as members of the same household, step relatives, those related by adoption or marriage, or members of the same clan or lineage.[tpl]Cite book|last= Bittles|first=Alan Holland | title = Consanguinity in Context| year = 2012|publisher = Cambridge University Press |pages= 178–187 | isbn =0521781868|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t6CsCXXE8skC&pg=PA178&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2CkdUsjAIujTsATW94CwAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl]
The incest taboo is and has been one of the most widespread of all cultural taboos, both in present and in many past societies. Most modern societies have laws regarding incest or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages. In societies where it is illegal, consensual adult incest is seen by some as a victimless crime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540831,00.html|title=German High Court Takes a Look at Incest|author=Hipp, Dietmar|date=2008-03-11|publisher=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century |first=Arthur P. |last=Wolf |first2=William H. |last2=Durham |author2-link=William H.

Third-degree relatives (such as half-aunt, half-nephew, first cousin) share 12.5% genes, and sexual relations between them is viewed differently in various cultures, from being discouraged to being socially acceptable.The Encyclopedia of Genetic Disorders and Birth Defects - Page 101, James Wynbrandt, Mark D. Ludman - 2009. The children of incestuous relationships were regarded as illegitimate, and are still so regarded in some societies today. In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were and are normally also prohibited.
A common justification given for the incest taboo is the impact inbreeding may have on children of incestuous sex. Children whose biological parents have a close genetic relationship have an increased risk of congenital disorders, death and disability at least in part due to genetic diseases caused by the inbreeding.[tpl]cite book |title=Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century |first=Arthur P. |last=Wolf |first2=William H. |last2=Durham |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA3 |isbn=0-8047-5141-2[/tpl] Unintended sexual relations between genetically related persons may also arise when either or both biological parents are unknown or uncertain, as in the case of children born as a result of casual or extramarital sexual relations, anonymous sperm donation, surrogacy or adoption. On the other hand, most prohibitions on incest extend the categories of prohibited relationships to affinity relationships such as in-law relations, step relations, relations through adoption, among others. As such, the incest taboo is not solely based on inbreeding, and also applies to sexual activity between relatives (genetically related or otherwise) who cannot have children or to sexual activity between relatives where conception is not likely to occur; for example, because of the use of contraception.
In some societies, such as those of Ancient Egypt and others, brother–sister, father–daughter, and mother–son, cousin-cousin, aunt-nephew, uncle-niece, and other combinations of relations were practiced among royalty as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage.Maurice Godelier, Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004[tpl]cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24[/tpl] From a religious context, the marriage of Cain to his sister Awan has been described by some writers as the first instance of incest.Cain and Abel in Text and Tradition: Jewish and Christian Interpretations of the First Sibling Rivalry, John Byron - 2011, page 27 Some societies, such as the Balinese[tpl]cite book|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|last= Bateson|first=Gregory |author-link=Gregory Bateson |publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages= |year=2000|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3[/tpl] and some Inuit tribes,[tpl]cite book|title=Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family|last= Briggs|first=Jean|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages= |year=2006|isbn= 978-0-674-60828-3[/tpl] have different views about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest. However, sexual relations with a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) who share 50% DNA is almost universally forbidden.The Tapestry of Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Ninth Ed., Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press, p. 101

==Terminology==

The English word incest is derived from the Latin incestus, which has a general meaning of "impure, unchaste".
It was introduced into Middle English, both in the generic Latin sense (preserved throughout the Middle English periodOED Ancrene Riwle (c. 1225) has Incest‥is bituȝe sibbe fleschliche, where either the generic or the narrow sense may be intended. See also inetymonline.comest) and in the narrow modern sense.
The derived adjective incestuous appears in the 16th century.Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology, T. F. Hoad (ed.) (1996), p. 232
Prior to the introduction of the Latin term, incest was known in Old English as sibbleger (from sibb 'kinship' + leger 'to lie') or mǣġhǣmed (from mǣġ 'kin, parent' + hǣmed 'sexual intercourse') but in time, both words fell out of use.

==History==

===Antiquity===

In ancient China, first cousins with the same surnames (i.e., those born to the father's brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born to the father's sisters) were.[tpl]cite book |author=Gulik, Robert Hans van |title=Sexual Life in Ancient China: a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D. |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u9MUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA19 |isbn=90-04-03917-1[/tpl]
Several of the Egyptian Pharaohs married their siblings and had several children with them. (for example, Tutankhamun married his half-sister Ankhesenamun.  Tutankhamun himself was the child of an incestuous union between Akhenaten and an unidentified sister-wife). It is now generally accepted that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous papyri and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister, of the same father and mother.[tpl]cite web | first = Ashley | last = Jones | title = Incest in Ancient Egypt | url = http://cnersundergraduatejournal.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/incest_in_ancient_egypt_revised_.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Strong | first = Anise | title = Incest Laws and Absent Taboos in Roman Egypt | journal = Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 20 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.academia.edu/205164/Incest_Laws_and_Absent_Taboos_in_Roman_Egypt[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1983[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

The fable of Oedipus, with a theme of inadvertent incest between a mother and son, ends in disaster and shows ancient taboos against incest as Oedipus is punished for incestuous actions by blinding himself. In the "sequel" to Oedipus, Antigone, his four children are also punished for their parents' incestuousness. Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of Adonis, when his mother, Myrrha has sex with her father Cinyras during a festival, disguised as a prostitute.
In Ancient Greece, Spartan King Leonidas I, hero of the legendary Battle of Thermopylae, was married to his niece Gorgo, daughter of his half-brother Cleomenes I. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that Elpinice was for a time married to her half-brother Cimon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html|title=Elpinice|last=Lahanas|first=Michael|year=2006|work=Hellenic World encyclopaedia|publisher=Hellenica|accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl]
Incest is mentioned and condemned in Virgil's Aeneid Book VI:Vergil Aeneid Book VI in Latin: The descent to the Underworld. Ancienthistory.about.com (2010-06-15). Retrieved on 2011-10-01. hic thalamum invasit natae vetitosque hymenaeos; "This one invaded a daughter's room and a forbidden sex act".
Incestuous unions were discouraged and considered as nefas (against the laws of gods and man) in ancient Rome. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of incestus into two categories of unequal gravity: the incestus iuris gentium, which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the incestus iuris civilis, which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor Caligula is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters (Julia Livilla, Drusilla, and Agrippina the Younger).Potter, 2007, p. 62. Emperor Claudius, after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.Potter, 2007, p. 66. The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.[tpl]cite book|first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137–[/tpl] The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.
In Norse mythology there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between Njörðr and his unnamed sister (perhaps Nerthus), parents of Freyja and Freyr. Loki in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.

===Middle Ages===

Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Savoy and Bourbon royal houses. However, relations between siblings, that may have been tolerated in other cultures, was considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that Anne Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.
Incestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient Japan and Korea,Smith, George Patrick (1998). Family Values and the New Society: Dilemmas of the 21st Century. Greenwood Publishing Group via Google Books. p. 143. Inca Peru, Ancient Hawaii, and, at times, Central Africa, Mexico, and Thailand."The Risks and Rewards of Royal Incest". National Geographic Magazine. Like the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, the Inca rulers married their sisters.

In order to prevent the influence of the other families, a half-sister of Korean Goryeo Dynasty monarch Gwangjong became his wife in the 10th century. Her name was Daemok.Shultz, Edward J. (2000).

A study of victims of father–daughter incest in the 1970s showed that there were "common features" within families before the occurrence of incest: estrangement between the mother and the daughter, extreme paternal dominance, and reassignment of some of the mother's traditional major family responsibility to the daughter. Oldest and only daughters were more likely to be the victims of incest. It was also stated that the incest experience was psychologically harmful to the woman in later life, frequently leading to feelings of low self-esteem, unhealthy sexual activity, contempt for other women, and other emotional problems.Emotional Inheritance: A Dubious Legacy.

During interrogation by police, several of the adults openly admitted to engaging in many forms of sexual activity, up to and including full intercourse, multiple times with the children. Sixteen adults (both men and women) were charged with hundreds of allegations of incest and sexual abuse of children as young as five.

In Japan there is a popular misconception that mother-son incestuous contact is common, due to the manner in which it is depicted in the press and popular media.  According to Hideo Tokuoka, "When Americans think of incest, they think of fathers and daughters; in Japan one thinks of mothers and sons" due to the extensive media coverage of mother-son incest there.[tpl]cite journal|authors=Tokuoka, Hideo and Cohen, Albert K.|title=Japanese Society and Delinquency|journal=International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice|year=1987|volume=11|issue=1-2|pages=13–22|doi=10.1080/01924036.1987.9688852|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01924036.1987.9688852|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] Some western researchers even assumed this was established fact.

===Between childhood siblings===

Childhood sibling–sibling incest is considered to be widespread but rarely reported.
Sibling-sibling incest becomes child-on-child sexual abuse when it occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of coercion. In this form, it is believed to be the most common form of intrafamilial abuse.[tpl]cite book|author1=Michael G. Kalogerakis|author2=American Psychiatric Association.

A 2006 study showed a large portion of adults who experienced sibling incest abuse have distorted or disturbed beliefs (such as that the act was "normal") both about their own experience and the subject of sexual abuse in general.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bonnie E.

===Between consenting adults===

Sexual activity between adult close relatives may arise from genetic sexual attraction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4331603,00.html|title=Forbidden love|author=Johann Hari|date=2002-01-09|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-04-11[/tpl] This form of incest has not been widely reported in the past, but recent evidence has indicated that this behavior does take place, possibly more often than many people realize. Internet chatrooms and topical websites exist that provide support for incestuous couples.
Proponents of incest between consenting adults draw clear boundaries between the behavior of consenting adults and rape, child molestation, and abusive incest. According to one incest participant who was quoted for an article in The Guardian:
In Slate, William Saletan drew a legal connection between gay sex and incest between consenting adults.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2081904/|title=Incest Repellent? If gay sex is private, why isn't incest?|last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=2003-04-23|publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] As he described in his article, in 2003, U.S. Senator Rick Santorum commented on a pending U.S. Supreme Court case involving sodomy laws (primarily as a matter of Constitutional rights to Privacy and Equal Protection under the Law). He stated: "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery." However, David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign professed outrage that Santorum placed being gay on the same moral and legal level as someone engaging in incest. Saletan argued that, legally and morally, there is essentially no difference between the two, and went on to support incest between consenting adults being covered by a legal right to privacy. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh has made similar arguments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2010/12/12/incest/ |title=Incest |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |date=December 12, 2010 |work=The Volokh Conspiracy[/tpl] In a more recent article, Saletan said that incest is wrong because it introduces the possibility of irreparably damaging family units by introducing "a notoriously incendiary dynamic—sexual tension—into the mix".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html|title=Incest Is Cancer|last=Saletan|first=William|date=Dec 14, 2010|work=Slate|accessdate=30 April 2012[/tpl]

====Aunts, uncles, nieces or nephews====

In the Netherlands, marriage between nephews and nieces is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of genetic defects among their offspring. Nephew-niece marriages predominantly occur among foreign immigrants. In November 2008, the Christian democratic (CDA) party's Scientific Institute announced that it wanted a ban on marriages between nephews and nieces.Netherlands: CDA Think-Tank Wants Drastic Measures Against ‘Imported Brides’
Consensual sex between adults(persons of 18 years and older) is always lawful in the Netherlands and Belgium, even among closely related family members. Sexual acts between an adult family member and a minor are illegal, though they are not classified as incest, but as abuse of the authority such an adult has over a minor, comparable to that of a teacher, coach or priest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elfri.be/incest-strafbaar |title=is incest strafbaar ? | Goede raad is goud waard - Advocatenkantoor Elfri De Neve |publisher=Elfri.be |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-07-30[/tpl] (Dutch)

====Between adult siblings====

The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, Patrick Stübing and Susan Karolewski. Because of violent behavior on the part of the father, the brother was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister for the first time. The now-adult brother moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the couple became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated prosecutions and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in Der Spiegel states that the couple are happy together. According to court records, the first three children have mental and physical disabilities, and have been placed in foster care. In April 2012, at the European Court of Human Rights, Patrick Stuebing lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.CNN: German incest couple lose European court caseJudgment on the Stübing vs. Germany case.

Some societies differentiate between full sibling and half sibling relations. In ancient societies, half-sibling marriages occurred.Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality, Roy Porter, Mikuláš Teich - 1994 p.239 Sexual relations with half-aunts or half-uncles are illegal in some US states.The Encyclopedia of Genetic Disorders and Birth Defects, Third Edition - Page 101, James Wynbrandt, Mark D. Ludman - 2009

====Cousin relationships====

Marriages and sexual relationships between first cousins are stigmatized as incest in some cultures, but tolerated in much of the world. Currently, 24 US states prohibit marriages between first cousins, and another seven permit them only under special circumstances.Joanna Grossman, Should the law be kinder to kissin' cousins?
The United Kingdom permits both marriage and sexual relations between first cousins.[tpl]cite web|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|title=Marriage between first cousins doubles risk of birth defects, say researchers|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jul/04/marriage-first-cousins-birth-defects|work=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2014|date=4 July 2013[/tpl]  Cousin marriages are rare, accounting for less than 1% of marriages in Western Europe, North America and Oceania, while reaching 9% in South America, East Asia and South Europe and up to 25% in regions of the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paed.2008.02.008|title=Consanguinity and child health|url=http://www.channel4.com/microsites/D/Dispatches/when_cousins_marry/cousins_10.pdf|year=2008|last1=Saggar|first1=A|last2=Bittles|first2=A|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|volume=18|issue=5|page=244[/tpl] Communities such as the Dhond and the Bhittani of Pakistan clearly prefer marriages between cousins as believe they ensure purity of the descent line, provide intimate knowledge of the spouses, and ensure that patrimony will not pass into the hands of "outsiders".
Apart from the partial prohibition in the United States, there are some cultures in Asia which stigmatize cousin marriage, in some instances even marriages between second cousins or more remotely related people. This concerns notably the culture of Korea, and some Hindu communities in India. In South Korea, before 1997, anyone with the same last name and clan were prohibited from marriage. In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code). Hmong culture prohibits the marriage of anyone with the same last name - to do so would result in being shunned by the entire community, and they are usually stripped of their last name. In a review of 48 studies on the children parented by cousins, most of the babies born to cousins were healthy contrary to the popular perception, with birth defects being 4% of births for consanguineous couples as opposed to 2% for the general population.[tpl]cite web|last=Towie |first=Narelle |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |title=Most babies born to first-cousins are healthy |publisher=Perth Now |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl]

====Defined through marriage====

Some cultures include relatives by marriage in incest prohibitions; these relationships are called affinity rather than consanguinity. For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his deceased wife's sister was the subject of long and fierce debate in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, involving, among others, Matthew Boulton[tpl]cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684–1814|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore MD|year=2003|page=38|isbn=0-8018-7204-9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Tann|first=Jennifer|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=May 2007|chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728–1809)[/tpl] and Charles La Trobe. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a godparent to a child also created a bond of affinity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to "raise up seed to him" (per [tpl]bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5–6|HE[/tpl]).
In Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, step-parent, parents in-law, siblings, step-siblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.

==Inbreeding==

Offspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility (see Coefficient of relationship) of congenital birth defects because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are homozygous, in particular for deleterious recessive alleles that produce such disorders[tpl]cite journal | last=Livingstone | first=F. B. |year=1969 | title =Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45–62 |doi= 10.1086/201009[/tpl] (and see Inbreeding depression). Because most such alleles are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives share a large fraction of their alleles, the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. However, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to natural selection, in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population. In the short term, incestuous reproduction is expected to produce increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.[tpl]cite book |author=Thornhill, Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher = University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&printsec=frontcover [/tpl]
There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar immune systems may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection).[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rspb.2002.2290[/tpl]
A 1994 study found a mean excess mortality with inbreeding among first cousins of 4.4%.[tpl]cite web|title=A Background Summary of Consaguineous marriage |author=Bittles, A.H. |url=http://www.consang.net/images/d/dd/01AHBWeb3.pdf |publisher=consang.net |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-01-19[/tpl], citing [tpl]Cite journal |author1=Bittles, A.

==Animals==

Many mammal species, including humanity's closest primate relatives, tend to avoid mating with close relatives, especially if there are alternative partners available. However, some chimpanzees have been recorded attempting to mate with their mothers.Incest not so taboo in nature Livescience, retrieved 29 January 2012 Male rats have been recorded engaging in mating with their sisters, but they tend to prefer non-related females over their sisters.Sexual Behaviour In Animals A. Sarkar; retrieved 29 January 2012
Livestock breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with culling of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.

==Laws==

Laws regarding sexual activity between close relatives vary considerably between jurisdictions, and depend on the type of sexual activity and the nature of the family relationship of the parties involved, as well as the age and sex of the parties. Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while other also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the Netherlands, France and Spain. In Sweden, the only type of incestuous relationship allowed by law is that between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.Incest: an age-old taboo.

==Religious views==

===Jewish===

In three places in the Torah, there are lists of family members between whom it is prohibited to have sexual relations; each of these lists is progressively shorter. The biblical lists are not symmetrical – the implied rules for women and men are not the same. Relationships compare as follows:

Apart from the questionable case of the daughter, the first incest list in the Holiness code roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early (pre-Islamic) Arabic culture;[tpl]Jewish Encyclopedia|article=incest|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&letter=I[/tpl] in Islam, these pre-existing rules were made statutory.[tpl]EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=marriage|section=Manius-Mash[/tpl]
In the 4th century BCE, the Soferim (scribes) declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed seconds (Hebrew: sheniyyot), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.Yebamot' (Tosefta) 2:3 The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these seconds of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a safeguard against infringing the biblical incest rules,Yebamot 21a although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of seconds''.
Marriages forbidden in the Torah were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid – as if they had never occurred;Shulchan 'Aruk, Eben ha-'Ezer, 16, 1 any children born to such a couple were regarded as bastards under Jewish law, and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.Yebamot 94b On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as seconds, and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid; while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.

===Christian===

The Catholic Church does not generally permit the marriage if a doubt exists on whether the potential spouses are related by consanguinity in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.Code of Canon Law. Can. 1091
Definitions of incest varied throughout history.  The Fourth Lateran Council held in 1215 attempted to codify that marriage was forbidden up to and including third cousins, though permissible beyond this for fourth cousins, third cousins once removed, etc.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriages are banned between second cousins or closer and between second uncles / aunts and second nieces / nephews (between first cousins once removed) or closer. Marrying one's godparent or deceased spouse's sibling is also prohibited, although marrying one's stepchild is not - e.g. Vyacheslav Ivanov exercised his right to marry his stepdaughter after her mother's (his first wife's) death.
The Anglican Communion allows marriages up to and including first cousins.A Table of Kindred and Affinity 562

===Islamic===

The Quran gives specific rules regarding incest, which prohibit a man from marrying or having sexual relationships with:

In Zoroastrianism, incest between parent-child or brothers-sisters is virtue.Sex and Punishment Four Thousand Years of Judging Desire, Eric Berkowitz. pp. 21–22, 2012. Incest is called Xvaetvadatha. Incest is performed with all the statuses.Historisch-Anthropologische Familienforschung, Michael Mitterauer. Böhlau - 1990.

Rigveda regard incest to be "evil".[tpl]cite book|title = The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|author = Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|page = 7|publisher = University of California Press[/tpl] Hinduism speaks of incest in abhorrent terms. Hindus are fearful of the bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both endogamy and exogamy, as well as same family tree (gotra) or bloodline (Pravara). Marriages within the gotra ("swagotra" marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system."there can be no matrimony between the sects of Gehlawat and Kadiyan as they have a “brotherhood” akin to consanguinity."Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage.

===Buddhist===

Buddhist societies take a strong ethical stand in human affairs and sexual behavior in particular. Most variations of Buddhism decide locally about the details of incest as a wrongdoing, according to local cultural standards.GLBT in World Religions | Thomas Paine Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. Tpuuf.org (2008-08-03). Retrieved on 2011-10-01.
