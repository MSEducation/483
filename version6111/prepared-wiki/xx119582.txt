==Playing career==

===Minor hockey===

MacArthur played minor hockey in his hometown of Lloydminster, Alberta.  He went unselected in the Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft when he was eligible, due in part to his short stature.[tpl]cite web|title=MacArthur proves himself all over again|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/leafs-beat/macarthur-proves-himself-all-over-again/article1814330/|work=The Globe and Mail|date=2010-11-25|accessdate=2010-12-03|last=Mirtle|first=James[/tpl]  While playing bantam hockey in Alberta, MacArthur put up impressive statistics, despite standing only 5'4".  He recorded 99 points in 38 games during the 2000–01 season with the Strathcona Warriors.[tpl]cite web|title=Clarke MacArthur Toronto Maple Leafs|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470667&view=stats|publisher=Toronto Maple Leafs|accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl]  After the season, he was named his club's most valuable player.

===Junior hockey===

With the numbers MacArthur put up in bantam hockey, he was able to secure a tryout with the Medicine Hat Tigers, but was the club's final cut heading into the 2001–02 season.  As a result, MacArthur played in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) for the Drayton Valley Thunder.  In his only season in the AJHL, MacArthur recorded 62 points in 62 games, and helped the Thunder capture a league championship.[tpl]cite web|title=Hockey Canada Clarke MacArthur|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/3466/la_id/1.htm|publisher=Hockey Canada|accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl] During the season he grew seven inches and the Medicine Hat Tigers were again interested in his services.  He joined the club for the 2002–03 season, putting up 75 points in 70 games as a WHL rookie.  During the summer, MacArthur was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round (75th overall) of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.
During his sophomore season in the WHL, MacArthur helped lead the Tigers to the 2004 WHL Championship and a berth in the 2004 Memorial Cup.[tpl]cite web|title=The 2004 Memorial Cup History|url=http://mastercardmemorialcup.com/cuphistory.php?y=2004|publisher=Canadian Hockey League|accessdate=2010-12-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101126114434/http://mastercardmemorialcup.com/cuphistory.php?y=2004 |archivedate=2010-11-26[/tpl]  MacArthur was the fourth leading scorer in the tournament with one goal and four assists and was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team.[tpl]cite web|title=Clarke MacArthur Toronto Maple Leafs|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470667&view=notes|publisher=Toronto Maple Leafs|accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Top Scorers 2004 Memorial Cup|url=http://www.leaguestat.com/chl/memcup/en/stats/statdisplay.php?type=top_scorers&season_id=1|publisher=Canadian Hockey League|accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl]  The Tigers lost in the semi-final of the tournament.
