</ref> He wrote in his Northamptonshire dialect, introducing local words to the literary canon such as 'pooty' (snail), 'lady-cow' ([[Coccinellidae|ladybird]]), 'crizzle' (to crisp) and 'throstle' ([[song thrush]]).
In his early life he struggled to find a place for his poetry in the changing literary fashions of the day.  He also felt that he did not belong with other peasants.  Clare once wrote  
 "I live here among the ignorant like a lost man in fact like one whom the rest seemes careless of having anything to do with—they hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but toiling and talking of it and that to no purpose."

It is common to see an absence of punctuation in many of Clare's original writings, although many publishers felt the need to remedy this practice in the majority of his work. Clare argued with his editors about how it should be presented to the public.
Clare grew up during a period of massive changes in both town and countryside as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. Many former agricultural workers, including children, moved away from the countryside to over-crowded cities, following factory work. The Agricultural Revolution saw pastures ploughed up, trees and hedges uprooted, the fens drained and the common land enclosed. This destruction of a centuries-old way of life distressed Clare deeply. His political and social views were predominantly conservative ("I am as far as my politics reaches 'King and Country'—no Innovations in Religion and Government say I."). He refused even to complain about the subordinate position to which English society relegated him, swearing that "with the old dish that was served to my forefathers I am content."[tpl]cite web|last=Manjoo |first=Farhad |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2089950/ |title=Man Out of Time by Christopher Caldwell; Slate, 17 Oct., 2003 |publisher=Slate.com |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
His early work delights both in nature and the cycle of the rural year. Poems such as Winter Evening, Haymaking and Wood Pictures in Summer celebrate the beauty of the world and the certainties of rural life, where animals must be fed and crops harvested. Poems such as Little Trotty Wagtail show his sharp observation of wildlife, though The Badger shows his lack of sentiment about the place of animals in the countryside. At this time, he often used poetic forms such as the sonnet and the rhyming couplet. His later poetry tends to be more meditative and use forms similar to the folks songs and ballads of his youth. An example of this is Evening.
His knowledge of the natural world went far beyond that of the major Romantic poets. However, poems such as I Am show a metaphysical depth on a par with his contemporary poets and many of his pre-asylum poems deal with intricate play on the nature of linguistics. His 'bird's nest poems', it can be argued, illustrate the self-awareness, and obsession with the creative process that captivated the romantics. Clare was the most influential poet, aside from Wordsworth, to practice in an older style.

==Revival of interest in the twentieth century==

Clare was relatively forgotten during the later nineteenth century, but interest in his work was revived by Arthur Symons in 1908, Edmund Blunden in 1920 and John and Anne Tibble in their ground-breaking 1935 2-volume edition. Benjamin Britten set some of 'May' from A Shepherd's Calendar in his Spring Symphony of 1948, and included a setting of The Evening Primrose in his Five Flower Songs.
Copyright to much of his work has been claimed since 1965 by the editor of the Complete Poetry,Oxford University Press, 9 vols., 1984–2003) Professor Eric Robinson, though these claims were contested. Recent publishers have refused to acknowledge the claim (especially in recent editions from Faber and Carcanet) and it seems the copyright is now defunct.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.johnclare.info |title=The John Clare Page website 'copyright' section: full list of recent reactions to the copyright dispute |publisher=Johnclare.info |date= |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=John Goodridge |url=http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4042964,00.html |title=Poor Clare by John Goodridge, an article summarising the copyright issue |publisher=Guardianunlimited.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,885727,00.html |title=Letter to the Guardian: Robinson's most recent public declaration of ownership of copyright, February 2003 |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date= 31 January 2003|accessdate=15 August 2012 |location=London[/tpl]
The largest collection of original Clare manuscripts are housed at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, where they are available to view by appointment.
Altering what Clare actually wrote continued into the later twentieth century; for instance, Helen Gardner amended not only the punctuation but also the spelling and grammar in The New Oxford Book of English Verse 1250-1950 (1972) which she edited.
Since 1993, the John Clare Society of North America has organised an annual session of scholarly papers concerning John Clare at the annual Convention of the Modern Language Association of America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.johnclare.org/ClareSessionMLA.htm |title=MLA Session organized by the John Clare Society of North America |publisher=Johnclare.org |date= |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]

==John Clare Cottage==

The thatched cottage where he was born was bought by the John Clare Trust in 2005.clarecottage.org In May 2007 the Trust gained £1.27m of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and commissioned Jefferson Sheard Architects to create a new landscape design and Visitor Centre, including a cafe, shop and exhibition space. The Cottage at 12 Woodgate, Helpston has been restored using traditional building methods and is open to the public.
