Sings Hank Williams is the seventh album by American country singer Johnny Cash, released under Sun Records on September 15, 1960 (see 1960 in music). The album was reissued on Varèse Sarabande on June 17, 2003 as Sings Hank Williams and Other Favorites (see 2003 in music) with five bonus tracks, two of them being alternate recordings of numbers already available on the album. Contrary to what the title might suggest, only the first four out of the twelve tracks on the album were written by Williams himself, with most of the others being versions of Cash's self-penned songs.
