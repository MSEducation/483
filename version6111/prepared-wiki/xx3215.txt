Ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is a hydrocarbon with the formula [tpl]chem|C|2|H|4[/tpl] or H2C=CH2.  It is a colorless flammable gas with a faint "sweet and musky" odor when pure.H. S. Booth and M. B. Campbell (1926), Studies of Anesthetic Ethylene: I. The Odor of Ethylene. Anesthesia and Analgesia, July–August 1929, pages 221-226. It is the simplest alkene (a hydrocarbon with carbon-carbon double bonds), and the simplest unsaturated hydrocarbon after acetylene ([tpl]chem|C|2|H|2[/tpl]).
Ethylene is widely used in chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 109 million tonnes in 2006) exceeds that of any other organic compound.[tpl]cite journal |title=Production: Growth is the Norm |journal=Chemical and Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=28 |pages=59 |date=July 10, 2006 |format=PDF |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/84/pdf/8428production.pdf |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n034.p059 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/propylene-production-from-methanol|title= Propylene Production from Methanol|publisher=by Intratec, ISBN 978-0-615-64811-8[/tpl] Ethylene is also an important natural plant hormone, used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wang K, Li H, Ecker J | title = Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Networks | journal = Plant Cell | volume = 14  | issue =Suppl | pages = S131–51 | year = 2002| pmid = 12045274 | pmc = 151252 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.001768 | ref = harv[/tpl]

==Structure and properties==

This hydrocarbon has four hydrogen atoms bound to a pair of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are coplanar. The H-C-H angle is 117.4°, close to the 120° for ideal sp² hybridized carbon. The molecule is also relatively rigid: rotation about the C-C bond is a high energy process that requires breaking the π-bond.
The π-bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high electron density, thus it is susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind transiently to the ethylene using both the π and π* orbitals.
Being a simple molecule, ethylene is spectroscopically simple. Its UV-vis spectrum is still used as a test of theoretical methods.[tpl]cite web | title=Ethylene:UV/Visible Spectrum | work=NIST Webbook | url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C74851&Units=SI&Mask=400#UV-Vis-Spec | accessdate=2006-09-27[/tpl]

==Uses==

Major industrial reactions of ethylene include in order of scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation.  In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/74851.pdf|format=PDF|title=OECD SIDS Initial Assessment Profile — Ethylene|publisher=inchem.org|accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]
thumb|520 px|left|Main industrial uses of ethylene. Clockwise from the upper right: its conversions to ethylene oxide, precursor to ethylene glycol; to ethylbenzene, precursor to styrene; to various kinds of polyethylene; to ethylene dichloride, precursor to vinyl chloride. 

===Polymerization===

Polyethylene consumes more than half of world ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called polythene, is the world's most widely used plastic, being primarily used to make films used in packaging, carrier bags and trash liners. Linear alpha-olefins, produced by oligomerization (formation of short polymers) are used as precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic lubricants, additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.

===Oxidation===

Ethylene is oxidized to produce ethylene oxide, a key raw material in the production of surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce ethylene glycol, widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, glycol ethers and polyethylene terephthalate.
Ethylene undergoes oxidation by palladium to give acetaldehyde. This conversion remains a major industrial process (10M kg/y).[tpl]cite book|last=Elschenbroich|first=C.|coauthors=Salzer, A.|title=Organometallics : A Concise Introduction|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|year=2006|isbn=3-527-28165-7|series=[/tpl] The process proceeds via the initial complexation of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.

===Halogenation and hydrohalogenation===

Major intermediates from the halogenation and hydrohalogenation of ethylene include ethylene dichloride, ethyl chloride and ethylene dibromide. The addition of chlorine entails "oxychlorination," i.e. chlorine itself is not used. Some products derived from this group are polyvinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methyl chloroform, polyvinylidene chloride and copolymers, and ethyl bromide.

===Alkylation===

Major chemical intermediates from the alkylation with ethylene is ethylbenzene, precursor to styrene. Styrene is used principally in polystyrene for packaging and insulation, as well as in styrene-butadiene rubber for tires and footwear. On a smaller scale, ethyltoluene, ethylanilines, 1,4-hexadiene, and aluminium alkyls. Products of these intermediates include polystyrene, unsaturated polyesters and ethylene-propylene terpolymers.

===Oxo reaction===

The hydroformylation (oxo reaction) of ethylene results in propionaldehyde, a precursor to propionic acid and n-propyl alcohol.

===Hydration===

Ethylene has long represented the major nonfermentative precursor to ethanol.  The original method entailed its conversion to diethyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis.  The main method practiced since the mid-1990s is the direct hydration of ethylene catalyzed by solid acid catalysts:Naim Kosaric, Zdravko Duvnjak, Adalbert Farkas, Hermann Sahm, Stephanie Bringer-Meyer, Otto Goebel and Dieter Mayer in "Ethanol" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2[/tpl]

===Dimerization to n-Butenes===

Ethylene can be dimerized to n-butenes using processes licensed by Lummus or IFP. The Lummus process produces mixed n-butenes (primarily 2-butenes) while the IFP process produces 1-butene.

===Niche uses===

An example of a niche use is as an anesthetic agent (in an 85% ethylene/15% oxygen ratio). It can also be used to hasten fruit ripening, as well as a welding gas.[tpl]cite journal|date=June 1, 1976|title=Informational Bulletin|publisher=California Fresh Market Advisory Board|volume=12|ref=harv[/tpl]

==Production==

Global ethylene production was 107 million tonnes in 2005, 109 million tonnes in 2006.National Non-Food Crops Centre  NNFCC Renewable Chemicals Factsheet: Ethanol, 138 million tonnes in 2010 and 141 million tonnes in 2011.Warren R. True, Oil and Gas Journal, 2012, vol 110, issue 7  By 2010 ethylene was produced by at least 117 companies in 55 countries. To meet the ever increasing demand for ethylene, sharp increases in production facilities are added globally, particularly in the Mideast and in China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/ethylene/|title=Market Study: Ethylene, Ceresana Research, December 2010|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2011-02-01[/tpl]
Ethylene is produced in the petrochemical industry by steam cracking. In this process, gaseous or light liquid hydrocarbons are heated to 750–950 °C, inducing numerous free radical reactions followed by immediate quench to stop these reactions. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. Ethylene is separated from the resulting complex mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In a related process used in oil refineries, high molecular weight hydrocarbons are cracked over zeolite catalysts. Heavier feedstocks, such as naphtha and gas oils require at least two "quench towers" downstream of the cracking furnaces to recirculate pyrolysis-derived gasoline and process water. When cracking a mixture of ethane and propane, only one water quench tower is required.[tpl]Cite book | last=Kniel | first=Ludwig | coauthors=Winter, Olaf; Stork, Karl | title=Ethylene, keystone to the petrochemical industry | year=1980 | publisher=M.

}}[/ref] If the partial pressure of acetylene is expected to exceed these values, the [tpl]chem|C|2[/tpl] stream is partially hydrogenated. The [tpl]chem|C|2[/tpl]'s then proceed to a [tpl]chem|C|2[/tpl] splitter. The product ethylene is taken from the overhead of the tower and the ethane coming from the bottom of the splitter is recycled to the furnaces to be cracked again;
Since ethylene production is energy intensive, much effort has been dedicated to recovering heat from the gas leaving the furnaces. Most of the energy recovered from the cracked gas is used to make high pressure (1200 psig) steam. This steam is in turn used to drive the turbines for compressing cracked gas, the propylene refrigeration compressor, and the ethylene refrigeration compressor. An ethylene plant, once running, does not need to import steam to drive its steam turbines. A typical world scale ethylene plant (about 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year) uses a [tpl]convert|45000|hp[/tpl] cracked gas compressor, a [tpl]convert|30000|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] propylene compressor, and a [tpl]convert|15000|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] ethylene compressor.

===Laboratory synthesis===

Although of great value industrially, ethylene is rarely used in the laboratory and is ordinarily purchased.[tpl]cite book |author=Crimmins, M.T.; Kim-Meade, A.S. |chapter=Ethylene |editor=Paquette, L. |title=Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/047084289[/tpl]

==Ethylene as a plant hormone==

Ethylene serves as a hormone in plants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lin, Z.; Zhong, S.; Grierson, D. |title=Recent advances in ethylene research |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=60 |pages=3311–36 |year=2009 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp204 |issue=12 |pmid=19567479 |ref=harv [/tpl] It acts at trace levels throughout the life of the plant by stimulating or regulating the ripening of fruit, the opening of flowers, and the abscission (or shedding) of leaves.
Commercial ripening rooms use "catalytic generators" to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening ([tpl]convert|20|C|F|disp=x|; [/tpl])[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] has been seen to produce CO2 levels of 10% in 24 hours.External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control

===History of ethylene in plant biology===

Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn incense in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems. In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Neljubov D. | title = Uber die horizontale Nutation der Stengel von Pisum sativum und einiger anderen Pflanzen | journal = Beih Bot Zentralbl | volume = 10 | pages = 128–139 | year = 1901 | ref = harv  [/tpl] Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated abscission in 1917.[tpl]cite journal | author = Doubt, Sarah L.| title = The Response of Plants to Illuminating Gas | journal = Botanical Gazette | jstor= 2469142 | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 209–224 | year = 1917  | doi = 10.1086/332006 | ref = harv [/tpl] It wasn't until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gane R. | title = Production of ethylene by some fruits | journal = Nature| volume = 134| issue = 3400| pages = 1008| year = 1934  | doi = 10.1038/1341008a0 | ref = harv [/tpl] In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening as well as senescence of vegetative tissues.Crocker W, Hitchcock AE, Zimmerman PW. 1935 Similarities in the effects of ethlyene and the plant auxins.

===Ethylene biosynthesis in plants===

Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds.
Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as germination, ripening of fruits, abscission of leaves, and senescence of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yang, S. F., and Hoffman N. E. | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and its regulation in higher plants | journal = Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. | volume = 35 | pages = 155–89 | year = 1984 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pp.35.060184.001103 | ref = harv[/tpl]
Ethylene is biosynthesized from the amino acid methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme ACC synthase (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this enzyme is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme ACC-oxidase (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of auxins, especially indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins. 

===Ethylene perception in plants===

Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding an ethylene receptor[tpl]which|date=September 2013[/tpl] has been cloned in Arabidopsis thaliana and then in tomato.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in the Arabidopsis and tomato genomes. Mutations in any of the gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can lead to insensitivity to ethylene.Bleecker, A.B., Esch, J.J., Hall, A.E., Rodríguez, F.I. and Binder, B.M. (1998) The ethylene-receptor family from Arabidopsis: structure and function. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, London. B Biological Sciences. 353(1374), 1405–1412. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria.

===Environmental and biological triggers of ethylene===

Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or anoxia, which leads to the synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes nastic movements (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.http://www.planthormones.info/epinasty.htm

====List of plant responses to ethylene====

====Commercial issues====

Ethene shortens the shelf life of many fruits by hastening fruit ripening and floral senescence. Ethene will shorten the shelf life of cut flowers and potted plants by accelerating floral senescence and floral abscission. Flowers and plants which are subjected to stress during shipping, handling, or storage produce ethene causing a significant reduction in floral display. Flowers affected by ethene include carnation, geranium, petunia, rose, and many others.[tpl]cite journal | title = Effect of ethylene on flower abscission: a survey |journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 689–693| year = 2002 | pmid = 12102524 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcf124 | author = Van Doorn, W. G. | ref = harv[/tpl]
Ethene can cause significant economic losses for florists, markets, suppliers, and growers. Researchers have developed several ways to inhibit ethene, including inhibiting ethene synthesis and inhibiting ethene perception. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), Aminooxyacetic acid (AOA), and silver salts are ethylene inhibitors.[tpl]cite book|last=Cassells |first=A. C. |coauthors=Peter B. Gahan|title=Dictionary of plant tissue culture|publisher=Haworth Press|year= 2006|pages=77|isbn= 978-1-56022-919-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cR5y5_vahAUC[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Constabel|first=Friedrich |coauthors=Jerry P. Shyluk|title=Plant Cell and Tissue Culture|publisher=Springer|year=1994|pages=5|chapter=1: Initiation, Nutrition, and Maintenance of Plant Cell and Tissue Cultures |isbn=0-7923-2493-5[/tpl] Inhibiting ethene synthesis is less effective for reducing post-harvest losses since ethene from other sources can still have an effect. By inhibiting ethene perception, fruits, plants and flowers don't respond to ethene produced endogenously or from exogenous sources. Inhibitors of ethene perception include compounds that have a similar shape to ethene, but do not elicit the ethene response. One example of an ethene perception inhibitor is 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP).
Commercial growers of bromeliads, including pineapple plants, use ethene to induce flowering. Plants can be induced to flower either by treatment with the gas in a chamber, or by placing a banana peel next to the plant in an enclosed area.
Chrysanthemum flowering is delayed by ethene gas[tpl]cite journal |author=van Berkel, N. |title=Injurious effects of low ethylene concentrations on Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat |journal=Acta Hort. (ISHS) |volume=197 |pages=43–52 |year=1987 |ref=harv [/tpl] and growers have found that carbon dioxide 'burners' and the exhaust fumes from inefficient glasshouse heaters can raise the ethene concentration to 0.05 vpm causing delay in flowering of commercial crops.

==Ligand==

Ethylene is a ligand in organometallic chemistry.  One of the first organometallic compounds, Zeise's salt is a complex of ethylene.  Useful reagents containing ethylene include Pt(PPh3)2(C2H4) and Rh2Cl2(C2H4)4.  The Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of ethylene is conducted on industrial scale to provide propionaldehyde.

==History==

Many geologists and scholars believe that the famous Greek Oracle at Delphi (the Pythia) went into her trance-like state as an effect of ethylene rising from ground faults.[tpl]cite news|title= Delphic Oracle's Lips May Have Been Loosened by Gas Vapors|author=John Roach|publisher=National Geographic|date=2001-08-14|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/08/0814_delphioracle.html |accessdate=March 8, 2007 [/tpl]
Ethylene appears to have been discovered by Johann Joachim Becher, who obtained it by heating ethanol with sulfuric acid;[tpl]cite book |first1=Henry Enfield |last1=Roscoe |first2=Carl |last2=Schorlemmer |title=A treatise on chemistry |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o7gtAAAAYAAJ |year=1878 |publisher=D. Appleton |page=611 |ref=harv| volume=1[/tpl] he mentioned the gas in his Physica Subterranea (1669).[tpl]cite book |first=James Campbell |last=Brown |title=A History of Chemistry: From the Earliest Times Till the Present Day |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pEhCyILvi8cC |date=July 2006 |publisher=Kessinger |isbn=978-1-4286-3831-0 |page=225[/tpl] Joseph Priestley also mentions the gas in his Experiments and observations relating to the various branches of natural philosophy: with a continuation of the observations on air (1779), where he reports that Jan Ingenhousz saw ethylene synthesized in the same way by a Mr. Enée in Amsterdam in 1777 and that Ingenhousz subsequently produced the gas himself.Appendix, §VIII, pp. 474 ff., Experiments and observations relating to the various branches of natural philosophy: with a continuation of the observations on air, Joseph Priestley, London: printed for J. Johnson, 1779, vol. 1. The properties of ethylene were studied in 1795 by four Dutch chemists, Johann Rudolph Deimann, Adrien Paets van Troostwyck, Anthoni Lauwerenburgh and Nicolas Bondt, who found that it differed from hydrogen gas and that it contained both carbon and hydrogen.[tpl]harvnb|Roscoe|Schorlemmer|1878|p=612[/tpl] This group also discovered that ethylene could be combined with chlorine to produce the oil of the Dutch chemists, 1,2-dichloroethane; this discovery gave ethylene the name used for it at that time, olefiant gas (oil-making gas.)[tpl]harvnb|Roscoe|Schorlemmer|1878|p=613[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |first=William |last=Gregory |title=Handbook of organic chemistry |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oKe808wkZzgC |year=1857 |publisher=A.S. Barnes & Co. |page=157 |edition=4th American[/tpl]
In the mid-19th century, the suffix -ene (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names meaning "daughter of") was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, ethylene ([tpl]chem|C|2|H|4[/tpl]) was the "daughter of ethyl" ([tpl]chem|C|2|H|5[/tpl]). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.
In 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent alkane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/Hofmannaeiou.html|title=Hofmann's Proposal for Systematic Nomenclature of the Hydrocarbons|author=A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.|accessdate=2007-01-06|publisher=www.chem.yale.edu[/tpl] In this system, ethylene became ethene. Hofmann's system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the IUPAC nomenclature. However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.

===Nomenclature===

The 1979 IUPAC nomenclature rules made an exception for retaining the non-systematic name ethylene,IUPAC nomenclature rule A-3.1 (1979) however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rulesFootnote to IUPAC nomenclature rule R-9.1, table 19(b) so the IUPAC name is now ethene.

===Safety===

Like all hydrocarbons, ethylene is an asphyxiant and combustible. It has been used as an anesthetic.[tpl]cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3[/tpl] It is listed as an IARC class 3 carcinogen.
