Nepicastat (INN, codenamed SYN117, RS-25560-197) is an inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stanley WC, Li B, Bonhaus DW, et al. |title=Catecholamine modulatory effects of nepicastat (RS-25560-197), a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase |journal=Br J Pharmacol|volume=121 |issue=8 |pages=1803–9 |date=August 1997 |pmid=9283721 |pmc=1564872 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0701315 |url=[/tpl]
It has been studied as a possible treatment for congestive heart failure, and appears to be well tolerated as such.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hegde SS, Friday KF |title=Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition: a novel sympatho-modulatory approach for the treatment of congestive heart failure |journal=Current pharmaceutical design |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=469–79 |date=December 1998 |pmid=10197057[/tpl] As of 2012, clinical trials to assess nepicastat as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cocaine dependence have been completed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00641511 |title=Pharmacogenetic Clinical Trial of Nepicastat for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) |date=June 4, 2008 |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |work=ClinicalTrials.gov[/tpl] Retrieved on February 1, 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00656357 |title=Study of Safety and Potential Efficacy of SYN117 in Cocaine Dependent Volunteers |date=August 15, 2008 |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |work=ClinicalTrials.gov[/tpl] Retrieved on February 1, 2012.
