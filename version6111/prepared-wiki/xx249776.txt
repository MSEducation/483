Charles Edwin Benham JP (pronounced Ben-am; 15 April 1860 in Colchester, Essex, England - 1 April 1929, also in Colchester) was a journalist, editing for many years the Essex County Standard, a published author of works such as Essex Ballads and an amateur scientist-cum-inventor, which led him to create Benham's top, which was named after him.
Born on 15 April 1860 into a family of newspaper proprietors, Benham was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School but did not attend university.[tpl]Cite book|quote=Seine Schulbildung empfing er in der Grammar School des Geburtsortes; eine Universität hat er nicht besucht|language=German|title=Der sprachgebrauch des dialettdichters Charles E.

He left a widow.
In the spare time that this provided, Benham was a keen amateur scientist and contributor to the journal Nature. His obituary in Nature noted that Benham was "a representative of the type of scientific amateur of which British science has reason to be proud... by faithful observation and original mind he was able to make some notable contributions to knowledge."[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v123/n3104/abs/123651a0.html|journal=Nature|title=Mr. C.

The disc, when spun, produces vivid and coloured images of concentric circles (Fechner colours), despite neither of these being present in the design.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Blom | first1 = Jan | title = A Dictionary of Hallucinations | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = | isbn = 1-4419-1222-3 | pages = 60–1[/tpl]
Additionally, Benham contributed an essay defending the reputation of William Gilbert, asserting that "though Gilbert's actual discoveries were few and crude, he must be judged rather by the spirit of his work." Other contributions were plentiful in the areas of optics and fluorescence. His exploits were also described in KnowledgeSee, for example, [tpl]cite journal|first=Charles E.|last=Benham|title=Miniature harmonographs|journal=Knowledge|volume=3|pages=452–454|year=1906[/tpl] and the (English) Journal of Botany
.See, for example, "Ferns Grown Under Bottles" (1924) as described in the American Fern Journal. The invention of a "miniature twin elliptic pendulum harmonograph" was also credited to him. It was, according to Archibald Williams, "a good means of entertaining friends at home or elsewhere."[tpl]Cite book|title=Things to Make|year=1918|url=http://www.1920-30.com/toys/things-to-make/harmonographs.html|last=Williams|first=Archibald[/tpl] In addition, Benham became a justice of the peace in 1917 and was a distinguished artist in his own right, particularly in watercolour.
