[[Banja (woreda)]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Banja was one of the 105 woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. It was named after a significant mountain located in the woreda, Mount Banja, where Fasil crushed a revolt of the Agaw in the late 18th century.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, selected and edited with an introduction by C.F. Beckingham (Edinburgh: University Press, 1964), p. 128. Part of the Agew Awi Zone, Banja was bordered on the south by Ankesha, on the west by Guangua, on the north by Faggeta Lekoma, and on the east by the Mirab Gojjam Zone. Towns in Banja included Injibara, Kessa, Kosober and Tilili. Other high points included Mount Faddi. Bodies of water in this woreda included the Zengena crater lake. Banja was separated for Banja Shekudad and Guagusa Shekudad woredas.
The woreda administration announced that by 22 March 2009, Banja had achieved 100% coverage of sanitation facilities, an increase from 0.03% in the 1990s, and 61% as recently as 2005. Through an innovative program which focussed on education of every resident of the woreda, the local Health Desk was able to convince the inhabitants of all 26 kebeles to construct enough latrines to ensure each household was no further than 6 meters from a latrine, as well as building one common latrine in every village. In addition, there are now public latrines for passers-by and boys who stay and sleep in the field herding cattle and sheep. However, only 28% of inhabitants currently have access to safe water.Hailu T., "A success story: amid grim national figures, Banja achieves 100% sanitation coverage", The Reporter (Ethiopia), 21 March 2009 (accessed 5 May 2009)
