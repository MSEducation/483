[[Register (sculpture)]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient art, Sculpture

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a register is a vertical level in a work that consists of several levels, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines; modern comic books typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. 
Common examples are from Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs as decoration scenes, on objects.
Luwian language hieroglyphs were also represented in stone art, in registers. Another example, in Mesopotamian art, would be the stones called Kudurru, or boundary stones, which often had registers of gods on the upper registers of the scenes.
