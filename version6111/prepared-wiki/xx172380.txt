[[Ornate eagle ray]]

CATEGORIES: Aetomylaeus

The ornate eagle ray or reticulate eagle ray (Aetomylaeus vespertilio) is a species of fish in the Myliobatidae family. It is found in Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Mozambique, Taiwan, and Thailand. Its natural habitats are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, and estuarine waters. It is usually found at depths of 5-50m.
The ornate eagle ray has a clearly distinct pattern of reticulate dark lines and rings on its back. If the extremely long tail is unbroken, it can considerably add to the maximum body length of 4m.
Lacking  spine on the tail, it is deemed harmless to humans.
