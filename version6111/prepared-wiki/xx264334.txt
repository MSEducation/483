The South African Class 14A 4-8-2 of 1914 is a South African steam locomotive from the 
South African Railways era.
In 1914 and 1915 the South African Railways placed forty-one Class 14A steam locomotives with a 4-8-2 Mountain wheel arrangement in service.[tpl]Paxton-Bourne|pages=10-11, 57-58[/tpl]

==Manufacturer==

Following the success of the Class 14, D.A. Hendrie, then the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), used the design as basis for the lighter Class 14A locomotive for use on coastal lines. The second version of the Class 14 locomotive was ordered from the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in 1913 and was built in two batches. Twenty were delivered in 1914, numbered in the range from 1576 to 1595, and another twenty-one in 1914 and 1915, numbered in the range from 1901 to 1921.
Like the Class 14, the Class 14A had Walschaerts valve gear and a Belpaire firebox and was superheated, but it had nearly [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=off|sigfig=3[/tpl] less boiler diameter than the Class 14 to bring the axle loading down to [tpl]convert|15|LT|t|1|abbr=off[/tpl], specifically for use on the lighter track on the Cape Eastern main line from East London. Because of the smaller boilers, they were equipped with smaller cylinders with a bore of [tpl]convert|21|in|mm|abbr=off|sigfig=3[/tpl] instead of [tpl]convert|22|in|mm|abbr=off|sigfig=3[/tpl] to compensate.[tpl]Durrant-Twilight|pages=63-64[/tpl]

==Watson Standard boilers==

During the 1930s many serving locomotives were reboilered with a standard boiler type designed by then CME A.G. Watson as part of his standardisation policy. Such Watson Standard reboilered locomotives were reclassified by adding an "R" suffix to their classification.
All the Class 14A locomotives except number 1915 were eventually reboilered with Watson Standard no 2 boilers. In the process they were also equipped with Watson cabs, with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. In spite of being lighter than the Class 14, they were reclassified to Class 14R along with reboilered Class 14 locomotives, instead of to Class 14AR. Even so, they could still be identified as ex Class 14A locomotives by the absence of sandboxes on their running boards.
An obvious visual difference between an original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover just to the rear of the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of reboilered Class 14A locomotives two even more obvious visual differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives.

==Service==

===South African Railways===

As intended, the Class 14A was placed in service on the East London mainline, but although they were good locomotives, they were not very successful there and were soon relocated to be shared between the Cape Western system for use between Cape Town and Beaufort West, and the Eastern Transvaal system for use on the line to Delagoa Bay out of Pretoria, particularly between Waterval Boven and Komatipoort. The Cape Western locomotives later joined the rest of the Class in the Eastern Transvaal. They proved themselves as free steaming locomotives, low on maintenance costs and trouble-free, and therefore popular with crews and fitters alike.

===Industrial===

Six were eventually sold into industrial service.
