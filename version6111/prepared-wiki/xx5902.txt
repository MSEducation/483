[tpl]nihongo|Kendo|剣道|kendō[/tpl], meaning "Way of The Sword", is a modern Japanese  sport/martial art, which descended from swordsmanship (kenjutsu) and uses bamboo swords (shinai) and protective armour (bōgu). Today, it is widely practiced within Japan and many other nations across the world.
Kendo is a physically and mentally challenging activity that combines martial arts practices and values with sport-like strenuous physical activity.

==History==

Swordsmen in Japan established schools of kenjutsu (the ancestor of kendo) which continued for centuries and which form the basis of kendo practice today.[ref]

The formal kendo exercises known as kata were developed several centuries ago as kenjutsu practice for warriors. They are still studied today, in a modified form.[ref]

The introduction of bamboo practice swords (shinai) and armour (bōgu) to sword training is attributed to Naganuma Shirōzaemon Kunisato during the Shotoku Era (1711–1715). Naganuma developed the use of bōgu and established a training method using the shinai.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/brief-history-of-kendo.htm| title=The History of Kendo |publisher=All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF)[/tpl]
In addition, the inscription on the gravestone of [tpl]nihongo|Yamada Heizaemon Mitsunori's (Ippūsai)|山田平左衛門光徳(一風斎)||1638–1718[/tpl] third son [tpl]nihongo|Naganuma Shirōzaemon Kunisato|長沼 四郎左衛門 国郷||1688–1767[/tpl], the 8th headmaster of the Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū Kenjutsu, states that his exploits included improving the bokuto and shinai, and refining the armour by adding a metal grille to the men (head piece) and thick cotton protective coverings to the kote (gauntlets). Kunisato inherited the tradition from his father Heizaemon in 1708, and the two of them worked hard together to improve the bogu until Heizaemon's death.[tpl]cite web | last = Tamio| first = Nakamura | url=http://www.kendo-world.com/articles.php?article%5Bid%5D=21&article%5Bpage%5D=2| title=The History of Bogu |publisher=Kendo World |date=03/01/2007[/tpl]
The Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) was established in 1895 to promote the ideals of "bushido" and preserve traditional systems of "bujutsu". The DNBK changed the name of the sporting form of swordsmanship, called gekiken, (Kyūjitai: 擊劍; Shinjitai: 撃剣, "hitting sword") to kendō in 1920.[tpl]cite book| last1 = Green| first1 = Thomas A.| last2 = Svinth| first2 = Joseph R.| title = Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation| url = http://books.google.com/?id=P-Nv_LUi6KgC&pg=PA600| volume = 2| year = 2010| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-59884-244-9| pages = 600–1 [/tpl]
Kendo (along with other martial arts) was banned in Japan in 1946 by the occupying powers. This was part of "the removal and exclusion from public life of militaristic and ultra nationalistic persons" in response to the wartime militarisation of martial arts instruction in Japan. The DNBK was also disbanded.  Kendo was allowed to return to the curriculum in 1950 (first as [tpl]nihongo|"shinai competition"|竹刀競技|shinai kyōgi[/tpl] and then as kendo from 1952).[tpl]cite journal |first=J.R. |last=Svinth | url=http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth_1202.htm| title=Documentation Regarding the Budo Ban in Japan, 1945–1950 |publisher=Journal of Combative Sport (JCS) |date=December 2002  |issn=1492-1650[/tpl]
