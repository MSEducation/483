GNOME Files, formerly called Nautilus, is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop. The name is a play on words, evoking the shell of a nautilus to represent an operating system shell. Nautilus replaced Midnight Commander in GNOME 1.4 and was the default from version 2.0 onwards.
Nautilus was the flagship product of the now-defunct Eazel Inc. Released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, Nautilus is free software.

==History==

Nautilus was first released in 2001 and development has continued ever since.  The following is a brief timeline of its development history:

==Features==

Nautilus supports browsing local filesystems as well as filesystems available through the GVFS system, including FTP sites, Windows SMB shares, OBEX protocol often implemented on cellphones, Files transferred over shell protocol, HTTP and WebDAV servers and SFTP servers.
Bookmarks, window backgrounds,  notes, and add-on scripts are all implemented, and the user has the choice between icon, list, or compact list views. In browser mode, Nautilus keeps a history of visited folders, similar to many web browsers, permitting easy access to previously visited folders.
Nautilus can display previews of files in their icons, be they text files, images, sound or video files via thumbnailers such as Totem.  Audio files are previewed (played back over GStreamer) when the pointer is hovering over them.
With the use of the GIO library, Nautilus tracks modification of local files in real time, eliminating the need to refresh the display manually. GIO internally supports Gamin and FAM, Linux's inotify, and Solaris' File Events Notification system.
Nautilus embeds MetaTracker.
In earlier versions, Nautilus included original vectorized icons designed by Susan Kare.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gnome.org/projects/nautilus/about.html | title=Nautilus' contributors | year=2004 | publisher=GNOME | accessdate=2007-10-31[/tpl]
