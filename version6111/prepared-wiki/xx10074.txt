Romansh comprises a group of closely related dialects, which are most commonly divided into five different varieties, all of which have developed a standardized form:
Aside from these five major dialects, two additional varieties are often distinguished. One is the dialect of the Val Müstair, which is closely related to Vallader but often separately referred to as Jauer (derived from the personal pronoun jau 'I', i.e. 'the jau-sayers'). Less commonly distinguished is the dialect of Tujetsch and the Val Medel, which is markedly different from Sursilvan and is referred to as Tuatschin.Curdin & Schläpfer(1984). p. 261, 265 Additionally, the standardized variety Rumantsch Grischun intended for pan-regional use has been introduced since 1982. The dialect of the Val Bregaglia is usually considered a variety of Lombard and speakers use Italian as their written language, even though the dialect shares many features with the neighboring Putèr dialect of Romansh.[tpl]HDS|8064|Bergell|date=2005-11-15[/tpl]
These dialects form a dialect continuum without clear-cut divisions. This continuum has now been ruptured by the spread of German, so that Romansh is now geographically divided into at least two non-adjacent parts. The Romansh language area can be described as consisting of two widely divergent varieties, Sursilvan in the west and the dialects of the Engadine in the east, with Sutsilvan and Surmiran forming a transition zone between them.Curdin & Schläpfer(1984). p. 260-165 The Engadinese varieties Putèr and Vallader are sometimes referred to as one specific variety known as Ladin (rm. [tpl]Audio|Roh-putèr-ladin.ogg|ladin[/tpl]); it is not to be confused with the closely related language in Italy's Dolomite mountains also known as Ladin.
Sutsilvan and Surmiran are sometimes referred to as Central Romansh (rm. Grischun central), which is then grouped together with Sursilvan as "Rhenish Romansh".In German: "Rheinischromanisch One feature that separates the Rhenish varieties from Ladin is the retention of the rounded front vowels /[tpl]IPA link|y[/tpl]/ and /[tpl]IPA link|ø[/tpl]/ (written ü and ö) in Ladin, which have been unrounded in the other dialects,Curdin & Schläpfer(1984). p. 264 as in Ladin [tpl]Audio|Roh-putèr-mür.ogg|mür[/tpl], Sursilvan [tpl]Audio|Roh-sursilvan-mir.ogg|mir[/tpl], Surmiran meir ‘wall’ or  Ladin [tpl]Audio|Roh-putèr-chaschöl.ogg|chaschöl[/tpl] to Rhenish [tpl]Audio|Roh-sursilvan-caschiel.ogg|caschiel[/tpl] ‘cheese’. Another is the development of Latin -CT-, which has developed into /tɕ/ in the Rhenish varieties as in détg ‘said’ or fatg ‘did’, while developing into /t/ in Ladin (dit and fat). A feature separating Sursilvan from Central Romansh however, involves the extent of palatalization of Latin K in front of A, which is rare in Sursilvan but common in the other varieties: Sursilvan [tpl]Audio|Roh-sursilvan-casa.ogg|casa[/tpl], Sutsilvan tgea, Surmiran tgesa, Putèr [tpl]Audio|Roh-putèr-chesa.ogg|chesa[/tpl], and  Vallader [tpl]Audio|Roh-vallader-chasa.ogg|chasa[/tpl] 'house'. Overall however, the Central Romansh varieties do not share many unique features, but rather connect Sursilvan and Ladin through a succession of numerous small dialect differences from one village to the next.Curdin & Schläpfer(1984). p. 264-265Liver (1999). p. 44
The dialects of Romansh are not always mutually comprehensible. Speakers of Sursilvan and of the Ladin varieties Vallader and Putèr in particular, are usually unable to understand each other initially.Liver in Schläpfer & Bickel 2000. p. 219 Because speakers usually identify themselves primarily with their regional dialect, many do not take the effort to attempt to understand unfamiliar dialects, and prefer to speak Swiss German with speakers of other varieties.Curdin & Schläpfer(1984). p. 260 A common Romansh identity is not widespread outside of intellectual circles, even though this has been changing among the younger generation.Jachen Curdin Arquint in Schläpfer & Bickel 2000, p. 244

==Official status in Switzerland and language politics==

In Switzerland, official language use is governed by the "territorial principle": Cantonal law determines which of the four national languages enjoys official status in which part of the territory. Only the federal administration is officially quadrilingual. Romansh is an official language at the federal level, one of the three official languages of the Canton of Grisons, and is a working language in various districts and numerous municipalities within the canton.

===Official status at the federal level===

The first Swiss constitution of 1848, as well as the subsequent revision of 1872, make no mention of Romansh, which at the time was not a working language of the Canton of Grisons either. The federal government did finance a translation of the constitution into the two Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader in 1872, noting however that these did not carry the force of law.Lechmann (2005), p. 183 Romansh became a national language of Switzerland in 1938, following a referendum. However, a distinction was introduced between "national languages" and "official languages". The status of a national language was largely symbolic, whereas only official languages were to be used in official documents, a status reserved for German, French, and Italian. The recognition of Romansh as the fourth national language is best seen within the context of the "Spiritual defence" preceding World War II, which aimed to underline the special status of Switzerland as a multinational country. Additionally, this was supposed to discredit the efforts of Italian nationalists to claim Romansh as a dialect of Italian and establish a claim to parts of Grisons.Lechmann (2005). p. 503 The Romansh language movement led by the Lia Rumantscha was mostly satisfied with the status as a national but not official language. Their aims at the time were to secure a symbolic "right of residence" for Romansh, and not actual use in official documents.Lechmann (2005). p. 506
This status did have disadvantages however. For instance, official name registers and property titles had to be in either German, French, or Italian. This meant that Romansh-speaking parents were often forced to register their children under German or Italian versions of their Romansh names. As late as 1984, the Canton of Grisons was ordered not to make entries into its corporate registry in Romansh.Lechmann (2005). p. 191 The Swiss National Bank first planned to include Romansh on its bills in 1956, when a new series was introduced. Due to disputes within the Lia Rumantscha over whether the bills were to feature the Sursilvan version "Banca nazionala svizra" or the Vallader version "Banca naziunala svizzra", the bills eventually featured the Italian version twice, alongside French and German. When new bills were again introduced in 1976/77, a Romansh version was added by finding a compromise between the two largest varieties Sursilvan and Vallader, which read "Banca naziunala svizra". The numbers on the bills were printed in Surmiran, a minor intermediate dialect.
Following a referendum on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people.See art. 4 and 70 of the 1999 Swiss Federal Constitution. This means that in principle, it is possible to address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language.Furer (2005). p. 40 In what the Federal Culture Office itself admits is "more a placatory and symbolic use"[tpl]cite news| author = Isobel Leybold-Johnson|title = Official Romansh still has some way to go| url = http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/top_news/detail/Official_Romansh_still_has_some_way_to_go.html?siteSect=106&sid=7056834|publisher = Swissinfo| date =  September 21, 2006| accessdate =  2008-09-01[/tpl] of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a unified standard language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It takes time and needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.Cathomas (2012). pp. 57-58
The Swiss Army attempted to introduce Romansh as an official language of command between 1988 and 1992. Attempts were made to form four entirely Romansh-speaking companies, but these efforts were abandoned in 1992 due to a lack of sufficient Romansh-speaking non-commissioned officers. Official use of Romansh as a language of command was discontinued in 1995 as part of a reform of the Swiss military.Lechmann (2005). p. 154

===Official status in the canton of Grisons===

Grisons is the only canton of Switzerland where Romansh is recognized as an official language. The only working language of the Three Leagues was German until 1794, when the assembly of the leagues declared German, Italian, Sursilvan, and Ladin (Putèr and Vallader) to have equal official standing. No explicit mention of any official language was made in the cantonal constitutions of 1803, 1814, and 1854. The constitution of 1880 declared that "The three languages of the Canton are guaranteed as national languages,„Die drei Sprachen des Kanton sind als ‹Landesprachen› gewährleistet“ without specifying anywhere which three languages are meant. The new cantonal constitution of 2004 recognizes German, Italian, and Romansh as equal national and official languages of the canton.Lechmann (2005). p. 155 The canton used the Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader up until 1997, when Rumantsch Grischun was added and use of Sursilvan and Vallader was discontinued in 2001.Cathomas (2008). p. 41
This means that any citizen of the canton may request service and official documents such as ballots in their language of choice, that all three language may be used in court, and that a member of the cantonal parliament is free to use any of the three languages.Gross (2004). p. 43 Since 1991, all official texts of the cantonal parliament must be translated into Romansh and offices of the cantonal government must include signage in all three languages. In practice, the role of Romansh within the cantonal administration is limited and often symbolic and the working language is mainly German. This is usually justified by cantonal officials on the grounds that all Romansh speakers are perfectly bilingual and able to understand and speak German.Lechmann (2005). pp. 158–160 Up until the 1980s it was usually seen as a provocation when a deputy in the cantonal parliament used Romansh during a speech.Richter (2005:949) in Cordey (2008). p. 81
Cantonal law leaves it to the districts and municipalities to specify their own language of administration and schooling. According to Article 3 of the cantonal constitution however, the municipalities are to "take into consideration the traditional linguistic composition and respect the autochthonous linguistic minorities". This means that the language area of Romansh has never officially been defined, and that any municipality is free to change its official language. In 2003, Romansh was the sole official language in 56 municipalities of Grisons, and 19 were bilingual in their administrative business.Furer (2005). pp. 140–145 In practice, even those municipalities which only recognize Romansh as an official working language, readily offer services in German as well. Additionally, since the working language of the canton is mainly German and many official publications of the canton are available only in German, it is virtually impossible for a municipal administration to operate only in Romansh.Furer (2005). p. 79
