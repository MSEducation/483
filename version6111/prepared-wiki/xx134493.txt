The Sammarinese Democratic Progressive Party (Partito Progressista Democratico Sammarinese, PPDS) was a democratic socialist political party in San Marino. Its Italian counterpart was the Democratic Party of the Left.
The party was formed in 1990 as the successor to the Sammarinese Communist Party. In 1992 some hard-liners who did not accept the abandonment of communism left to form the Sammarinese Communist Refoundation. On 25 March 2001 the PPDS merged with two minor groups, the Socialists â€“ Ideas in Motion and the Democratic Reformers, into the Party of Democrats.
