CD Publications. Housing and Neighborhood Development Services, Inc. Copyright © 2007 Housing and Neighborhood Development Services, Inc.
In early 2008, CDD invested news space on lobbying efforts of the National Alliance of Community Economic Development Associations (NACEDA) for legislation to prevent home foreclosures, "NACEDA Backs Plan for $10 billion in CDBG Funds to Fight Foreclosures." Community Development Digest (2008-02-08). CD Publications. From "NACEDA in the News.""CD Groups Lead Fight for Foreclosure Prevention Bills." Community Development Digest (2008-01-06).
