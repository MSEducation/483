Going Public is the fifth studio album by Christian pop rock band Newsboys, released in 1994. The album was the band's second commercial success (following Not Ashamed), and it featured "Shine," one of their most popular songs.
The album was recognized with two Dove Awards at the 25th GMA Dove Awards, one for "Rock Album of the Year", and the other "Rock Recorded Song of the Year" for "Shine", as well as nominations for Short Form Music Video of the Year ("Shine") and Song of the Year ("Shine"). Going Public was also nominated for a Grammy, for Best Rock Gospel Album.
In 2001, Going Public was recognized by CCM Magazine as one of the 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music (appearing at No. 70 on the list), and in 2006, "Shine" was included at No. 9 on CCM Magazine's 100 Greatest Songs of Christian Music.
The CD was recently included as the first in a series of influential Christian albums in Blaze magazine's Blast from the past section, saying that modern Christian artists owe a lot to the path this album created, because it "...showed music from a Godly perspective could sound extremely catchy, have lyrics that were honest and still glorify God".Blaze magazine's blast from the past review
According to the liner notes the cover photo was taken at a 1948 Post-World War II meeting in Germany which was conducted by the Rev. George A Palmer for the European Evangelical Crusade.
