[[List of Macintosh models grouped by CPU type]]

CATEGORIES: Macintosh computers, Macintosh computers by CPU family, Lists of computer hardware

This list of Macintosh models grouped by CPU type contains all CPUs used by Apple Inc. for their Macintosh computers. It is grouped by processor family, processor model, and then chronologically by Macintosh model.

==Motorola 68000==

===Motorola 68000===

The Motorola 68000 was the first Apple Macintosh processor. Although it had some 32-bit characteristics, such as its 32-bit CPU registers, it is considered a 16-bit processor because of its 16-bit data path.

===Motorola 68020===

The Motorola 68020 was the first 32-bit Mac processor. However, the Macintosh LC ran on a 16-bit system bus with ASICs that artificially limited RAM to 10 MB (as opposed to the 32-bit limit of 4 GB).
It was also the first Mac processor to support memory management units.

===Motorola 68030===

The Motorola 68030 was the first Mac processor with an integrated memory management unit, allowing for virtual memory.

===Motorola 68040===

The Motorola 68040 was the first Mac processor with an integrated floating point unit (not available on the 68LC040).

==PowerPC==

===PowerPC 601===

===PowerPC 603===

===PowerPC 604===

The PowerPC 604e was the first Mac processor available in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration.

===PowerPC G3===

===PowerPC G4===

The PowerPC 7400 was the first Mac processor to include an AltiVec vector processing unit.
The PowerPC 7455 was the first Mac processor to break the 1Â GHz barrier.

===PowerPC G5===

The PowerPC 970 was the first 64-bit Mac processor.
The PowerPC 970MP was the first dual-core Mac processor and the first to be found in a quad-core configuration. It was also the first Mac processor with partitioning and virtualization capabilities.

==Intel x86==

===Overview===

===P6===

Yonah was the first Mac processor to support the MMX, SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instruction sets.
The Core Solo was a Core Duo with one of the two cores disabled.

===Core===

Woodcrest added support for the SSSE3 instruction set.
Merom was the first 64-bit processor to appear in a Mac notebook.
Clovertown was the first quad-core Mac processor and the first to be found in an 8-core configuration.

===Penryn===

Penryn added support for a subset for SSE4 (SSE4.1).

===Nehalem===

Bloomfield and Gainestown introduced a number of notable features for the first time in any Mac processors:

===Westmere===

===Sandy Bridge===

===Ivy Bridge===

===Haswell===
