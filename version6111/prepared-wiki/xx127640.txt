The Suzuki GS500 is a popular entry level motorcycle manufactured by the Suzuki Motor Corporation. Suzuki produces two forms of the bike; the GS500 or GS500E from 1989 onwards and the fairing model GS500F from 2004 onwards.

==GS500 / GS500E==

The unfaired version of the GS500 was released in the US in 1989 as the GS500E. It was equipped with an air-cooled [tpl]convert|487|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] parallel twin engine derived from the earlier GS450.
The GS500 can be restricted under the maximum power-to-weight ratio for use in countries where restrictive motorcycle licenses are issued (such as the UK motorbike license with restriction to 33 bhp), adding to its worldwide popularity. In 2002, Suzuki stopped producing the GS500E for the US market and did not release a GS500 for 2003. In 2007, Suzuki dropped the GS500E from its UK range, but it continues to be sold in many other countries.
In 2008, the GS500 and GS500F models appeared in the official UK Suzuki Dealers "on road" motorbike list.

==GS500F==

In 2004, after a year hiatus, Suzuki came out with the GS500F to fill the void left (in the US market) by the GS500E. This bike was very similar to the previous E model, but now comes with a fully enclosed fairing. The fairing offers a sportier, aggressive look and improved rider comfort by providing wind protection and better aerodynamics. An oil cooler was also added. As with the previous E model, the F is able to be restricted for use in countries where restrictive motorcycle licenses are issued. The GS500F was dropped from the UK Suzuki range in 2007 and from the US range after 2009 model year.
The GS500F is still available in Australia and Denmark.

==Model History==

==GS500 / GS500E Specifications==

GS 500 E 1979-1981
The air cooled GS500E engine traces its roots back to the first Suzuki four-strokes. The 1977 GS400 became the GS425, then the GS450, and finally the GS500, which retains the same basic layout and qualities, such as reliability, that made the original GS engines so appealing.
GS 500 E 1989-2009
The model name GS500E suddenly reappeared in the Suzuki program in 1989. Again, the four-stoke DOHC formula was used but this time there were only two cylinders, with a 180 degree crank. A counterbalancer was used in the engine to get rid of vibrations but despite the double overhead camshafts the engine had only two valves per cylinder and modest power output. 
However, the GS500E twin had a very rigid frame, full floater swingarm, slingshot carburetors, large disc brake at the front and lightweight, hollow 3-spoke wheels. The combination made the chassis better than usually found in ”commuter” bikes. 
The GS500E has been a popular model for years and is still in production. No larger upgrades have been made and the bike is still popular, after 14 years in production.
The given specifications vary somewhat between the countries to meet emission/noise/insurance regulations, etc.

==Comparative reviews==

In March 1992, Motor Cyclist magazine, in an article titled "Budget Bullets," compared the Kawasaki EX500, the Yamaha Seca II, the Honda Nighthawk CB750, and the Suzuki GS500. The Seca II came in first, with the CB750, and the GS500 following in that order.
In April 1994, in an article titled "Bargain Hunters," Cycle World compared the Kawasaki Ninja 500, the Suzuki GS500E, the Suzuki Katana 600, the Yamaha FZR600, and the Yamaha Seca II.
