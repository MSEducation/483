CATEGORIES: Eurovision Song Contest 2003, 2003 in Latvia, Eurovision Song Contest by year

The Eurovision Song Contest 2003 was the 48th annual Eurovision Song Contest. The contest took place in Riga, Latvia on 24 May 2003, following Marie N's win in the 2002 contest with the song "I Wanna". It was the first win and hosting of the competition for Latvia with only their third participation after debuting at the 2000 contest. Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) chose the Skonto Hall as the venue after conducting a bidding process among several cities and venues in Latvia. The hosts for the contest were the previous year's winner Marie N and former Latvian representative at the 2000 contest, Renārs Kaupers, who competed in the contest as part of the band Brainstorm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/996/renars_kaupers_and_marie_n_hosts_2003_show/|title=Renars Kaupers and Marie N hosts 2003 show|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=1 December 2002|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The design of the contest was built around the theme "Magical rendez-vous", which represented the meeting of the various European nations coming to Latvia and encountering Latvia's versatile landscapes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/868/eurovision_2003_theme_will_be_rendez-vous/|title=Eurovision 2003 theme will be rendez-vous|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=26 November 2002|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7803|title=The end of a decade: Riga 2003|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=24 December 2009|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] Twenty-six countries participated, which saw the return of Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and Poland after having been relegated from competing the previous year, Portugal returning to the contest after withdrawing the previous year, while Ukraine participated in the contest for the first time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/780/ebu_released_list_of_participant_for_2003/|title=EBU released list of participant for 2003|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=27 November 2002|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Macedonia and Switzerland were required to withdraw due to their poor results in the 2002 contest.
The winner for 2003 was Turkey with the song "Everyway That I Can" sung by Sertab Erener, which scored 167 points, narrowly beating Belgium into second place with a margin of 2 points and Russia into third place with a margin of 3 points.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2932760.stm|title=Turkish delight at Eurovision win|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=24 May 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] This was the first win for Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest. Norway and Sweden rounded out of the top five, placing fourth and fifth respectively. The United Kingdom achieved their worst result to date, coming in last place (26th) and scoring no points from any of the twenty-six voting nations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2935874.stm|title=UK act hits Eurovision low|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=25 May 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The 2003 contest was the last contest to take place on one evening.

The contest also marked the fifth time in the history of the competition where all participants were participating for the first time; there were no returning artists that had already competed in the contest on a previous occasion.

==Location==

On 22 August 2002, Latvian public broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) announced that it had chosen the Skonto Hall in Riga as the host venue for the 2003 contest.[tpl]cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Archived news. Part 1.|url=http://esckaz.ueuo.com/archive1.htm|date=22 August 2002| accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl]
Latvia won the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 on 25 May 2002 in Tallinn, Estonia with the song “I Wanna” performed by Marie N. This was Latvia’s first victory in the contest, which also carried the right for LTV to organise the 2003 contest. LTV initially had budgetary concerns with staging the contest. The chairman of the National Radio and Television Council Ojārs Rubenis stated that if the government presented no budget guarantees, the council, which owns shares in LTV, would vote against organising the contest. Rubenis elaborated that LTV was prepared to cover the creative side and broadcasting of the contest, but additional funds would be needed for infrastructure, hotels and other financial issues.
The Government of Latvia allotted €5.3 million for the event with a further €1.1 million being provided by the Riga City Council – covering the anticipated organisational costs for the contest.[tpl]cite web|title=Vēstulē noliedz Eirovīzijas finansu problēmas|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/vestule-noliedz-eirovizijas-finansu-problemas.d?id=4700906|publisher=Delfi|date=31 January 2003| accessdate=27 October 2013|language=Latvian[/tpl]   A task force that included members from LTV, the National Radio and Television Council and state secretaries was formed to explicitly work on organisation of the contest and report on the estimated expenses.

===Bidding phase===

Three cities were considered as host city of the contest: Riga, Ventspils and Jūrmala.[tpl]cite web|title=Dzintaru koncertzāles pārbūve Eirovīzijas rīkošanai izmaksātu trīs miljonus latu|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/izklaide/notikumi/47667-dzintaru_koncertzales_parbuve_eirovizijas_span_classhiliterikosanaispan_izmaksatu_tris_miljonus_latu|publisher=TVNET|date=6 June 2002 | accessdate=27 October 2013|language=Latvian[/tpl]  LTV requested proposals from the three cities concerning how they plan to organise the contest. Riga City Council offered the Mežaparks Open-air Stage, Skonto Hall and the Ķīpsala International Exhibition Centre as potential venues for hosting the contest. Ventspils bid to host the contest at the Ventspils Olympic Centre with a pledge of support from city mayor Aivars Lembergs, who added that Ventspils could also provide two cruise ferries that could be used to accommodate up to 8,000 guests.[tpl]cite web|first=Vēsma|last=Lēvalde|title=Ventspils dome vēlas Eirovīzijas rīkošanu Ventspilī (papildināts)|url=http://www.db.lv/citas-zinas/ventspils-dome-velas-eirovizijas-rikosanu-ventspili-papildinats-197167|publisher=db.lv|date=3 June 2002| accessdate=27 October 2013|language=Latvian[/tpl] Jūrmala City Council offered the Dzintari Concert Hall with plans to expand and upgrade the facility and surrounding infrastructure.
LTV’s organisational task force later decided to proceed with the bids from Riga and Ventspils, eliminating Jūrmala and the Mežaparks Open-air Stage in Riga. On 15 June 2002, the EBU Reference Group decided in conjunction with the organisational task force in Latvia that Riga would host the 2003 contest with the venue option between the Skonto Hall and Ķīpsala International Exhibition Centre being decided upon by LTV.[tpl]cite web|title=Eirovīzija izmaksās 4,7 vai 5,5 miljonus latu|url=http://financenet.tvnet.lv/zinas/115462-eirovizija_izmaksas_47_vai_55_miljonus_latu|publisher=TVNET|date=2 July 2002|accessdate=27 October 2013|language=Latvian[/tpl] LTV ultimately chose the Skonto Hall as the venue to stage the contest.

==Format==

The EBU released the rules for the 2003 contest in November 2002, which detailed that twenty-six countries would participate, making it the largest number of participants to take part in the contest up to this point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/news/pdf/ESC2003Rules.pdf|title=RULES OF THE 2003 EUROVISION SONG CONTEST|date=20 November 2002|work=European Broadcasting Union|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The rules also modified the eligibility criteria for entries, changing the date of release cut-off point for songs from 1 January 2003 to 1 October 2002.[tpl]cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Archived news. Part 4.|url=http://esckaz.ueuo.com/archive4.htm|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] There was also a change in the tie-break rule, which would now resolve such a case in favour of the nation that received points from a higher number of countries rather than taking into account the amount of top scores (12 points) received. The draw for running order was held on 29 November 2002 in Riga, hosted by Marie N and Renārs Kaupers, with the results being revealed during a delayed broadcast of the proceedings later that day.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=Draw to be made public Friday 17:00 CET|url=http://www.esctoday.com/994/draw_to_be_made_public_friday_1700_cet/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=28 November 2002|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl]

Full preparations for the 2003 contest began on 18 May 2003 at the Skonto Hall. There were rehearsals, press conferences and participants were also involved in an internet chat.[tpl]Wayback |date=20030602021415 |url=www.eurovision.tv/public/25144.html |title=Event [/tpl]. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved on 22 March 2008. Two dress rehearsals were held on 23 May, in front of an estimated 12,000 people. The organisers of the contest held a press conference; one of the issues complained about was the lack of invitations for the after-party. The final dress rehearsal was held on 24 May, the day of the contest. A simulation of the voting procedure was also held, in which the presenters linked up with all twenty-six countries by satellite for the first time.
The contest featured special guests that communicated with the hosts via satellite: Lys Assia, winner of the 1956 Contest greeted the hosts and spectators from Nicosia, Elton John spoke to the presenters live from the Life Ball in Vienna and one astronaut and one cosmonaut—Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko—gave their greetings from the International Space Station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1603|title=Artists and fan sites campaign on World AIDS Day|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=1 December 2008|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1062|title=1956 winner Lys Assia: "It will go on!"|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=21 May 2008|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.balticsworldwide.com/eurovision%20_%202003%20_%20results.htm|title=Turks beat back Russia and Belgium to win; Baltics and Britain bomb.|last=Tarm|first=Michael|year=2003|publisher=City Paper|accessdate=22 March 2008[/tpl] The interval act for the contest was a short film directed by Anna Viduleja that featured a sequence of performances by Latvian post-folklore group Iļģi, Renārs Kaupers' band Brainstorm, Marie N and piano player Raimonds Pauls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/kultura/news/music/eirovizijas-veidotaji-parcelusies-uz-skonto-halli.d?id=5335547|title=Eirovīzijas veidotāji pārcēlušies uz ‘Skonto’ halli|date=6 May 2003|publisher=Delfi|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Latvian[/tpl]

===Graphic design===

LTV launched a competition in order to find the logo for the contest. At the close of the competition, high interest from the public translated into 204 logo submissions, which were ultimately judged by a jury panel consisting of Uldis-Ivars Grava (general director of LTV), Arvīds Babris (then executive producer of the contest), Ugis Brikmanis (director), Laimonis Šteinbergs (artist), Ingūna Rībena (architect), Arta Giga (LTV representative) and Juhan Paadam (EBU representative).[tpl]cite web|first=Aija|last=Medinika|title=204 logo propositions for ESC 2003|url=http://www.esctoday.com/760/204_logo_propositions_for_esc_2003/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=27 November 2002|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] On 16 November 2002, LTV and the EBU presented the logo for the contest which was designed by the director of the Computer Graphics Department of LTV, Maris Kalve with further elaboration by LTV's chief artist Kristaps Skulte.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=Logo for Eurovision 2003 selected|url=http://www.esctoday.com/783/logo_for_eurovision_2003_selected/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=27 November 2002|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] The logo was named upes, the Latvian word for rivers, and carried the slogan "All rivers flow toward the sea, all songs flow toward the Eurovision Song Contest".
The postcards shown between the entries were directed by Ugis Brikmanis and featured the artists competing at the contest interacting with Latvia's various landscapes: forests, rivers, lakes and towns.[tpl]cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Archived news. Part 3.|url=http://esckaz.ueuo.com/archive3.htm|date=7 October 2002| accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The postcards were recorded during the preceding week of the contest and ran behind schedule, leading to some postcards featuring only footage from the rehearsals and press conferences.[tpl]cite web|first=Paul|last=Jordan|title=What’s Another Year?

The stage design was created by Aigars Ozoliņš and based on the concept called Planet Latvia.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2003 on Planet Latvia|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1438/eurovision_song_contest_2003_on_planet_latvia/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=27 March 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Itamar|last=Barak|title=Magical encounter on the Eurovision stage|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1499/magical_encounter_on_the_eurovision_stage/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=7 May 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The stage used several light and video effects and included an innovation new to the contest - a video screen stage floor that could be used to give each entry a unique look. The green room where the delegations and competitors awaited the results of the contest was placed directly behind the stage and unveiled shortly before the voting portion of the show commenced, allowing the audience to view the representatives of the competing nations as they received points.[tpl]cite web|first=Remi|last=Kübar|title=Details revealed about the stage in May|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1240/details_revealed_about_the_stage_in_may/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=7 February 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl]

===National host broadcaster===

Initially, Arvīds Babris, head of the Latvian delegation at the 2002 contest, was appointed as executive producer for the contest, however, after production fell behind schedule and the EBU applied pressure upon LTV, he was dismissed and Brigita Rozenbrika took over the position, receiving additional support from the Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT) and Estonian broadcaster Eesti Televisioon (ETV).[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=Arvids Babris will produce the contest in Latvia|url=http://www.esctoday.com/737/arvids_babris_will_produce_the_contest_in_latvia/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=28 November 2002|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Itamar|last=Barak|title=Riga 2003: A new executive producer|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1422/riga_2003_a_new_executive_producer/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=18 March 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] SVT was also the technical producer of the contest for the second year running with Sven Stojanovic as director and the Swedish lighting company Spectra+ contracted for the contest.[tpl]cite web|first=Bjørn Erik|last=Opheim|title=SVT to produce 2003 Eurovision Song Contest|url=http://www.esctoday.com/992/svt_to_produce_2003_eurovision_song_contest/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=13 December 2002|accessdate=21 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Spectra+ lands third Eurovision contract|url=http://livedesignonline.com/news/lighting_spectra_lands_third/|publisher=Live Design|date=17 April 2003|accessdate=21 March 2008[/tpl] 

===Voting===

The EBU reintroduced televoting as an obligatory voting mode in all participating countries, which awarded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 points to their ten favourite songs, in ascending order. Countries voted in the same order as they had performed. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Russia were granted an exception to holding a televote as they cited that their telecommunications penetration was less than 80%. Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska opted to use only SMS-voting.[tpl]cite web|first=Aija|last=Medinika|title=Poland will use SMS-voting only|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1631/poland_will_use_sms-voting_only/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=24 May 2003|accessdate=23 March 2008[/tpl] All other countries planned to use a televote. This contest was also the first to introduce a computer-generated scoreboard which rearranged itself in order as the points were awarded. Broadcasters were required to assemble back-up juries that consisted of eight voting members, with age and gender equally distributed, in the case of televote failure on the night of the competition. Four members of the jury had to be members of the general public and the other four members had to be music professionals.

===Future changes in contest format===

With the increased amount of potential participating countries, the EBU began to review the format of the contest with potential changes being considered such as adding extra evenings for the show, holding a regional pre-selection, or putting a limit to number of participating countries by increasing the entrance fee.[tpl]cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Archived news. Part 2.|url=http://esckaz.ueuo.com/archive2.htm|date=17 September 2002|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] On 29 January 2003, the EBU unveiled a two-night system for the contest in 2004: a semi-final would be held before a grand final. The "Big Four", along with the top ten from the 2003 contest, would automatically qualify for the 2004 final.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=EBU confirms new Eurovision Song Contest format|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1192/ebu_confirms_new_eurovision_song_contest_format/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=29 January 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The format change eliminated the relegation system, allowing all countries to send an artist and song to the contest. The fourteen eventual countries from the 2003 contest that qualified to compete directly in the 2004 final were Turkey, Belgium, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Poland, Spain, Iceland, Romania, Ireland, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. All other countries would have to compete in the semi-final for ten remaining spots in the final.

===Organisational issues===

In January 2003, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Guntars Kukuls, spokesperson of the city council of Riga, stated that Riga was suffering from serious financial problems that could possibly lead to a breach of contract and that the contest needed to be moved to another city.[tpl]cite web|first=Oliver|last=Rau|title=Financial problems in Riga|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1195/financial_problems_in_riga/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=28 January 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] Ilona Bērziņa, spokesperson of LTV, denied that potential financial issues the city council of Riga may be facing would interrupt the organisation of the contest.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=LTV: 'Eurovision Song Contest not in danger'|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1198/ltv_eurovision_song_contest_not_in_danger/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=29 January 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] In February 2003, The Baltic Times reported that a committee of Riga municipality rejected the proposal to withdraw the promised funds it pledged in support of organising the contest.[tpl]cite web|first=Itamar|last=Barak|title=Riga municipality won't cut Eurovision budget|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1217/riga_municipality_wont_cut_eurovision_budget/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=2 February 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl]
In March 2003, Danish newspaper B.T. published an article based on accusations that the EBU television director Bjørn Erichsen made in reference to LTV suffering from organisational chaos which could result in the removal of Latvia's hosting duties since they were running behind schedule.[tpl]cite web|first=Daniel|last=Ringby|title=Danish newspaper writes about LTV's chaos|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1409/danish_newspaper_writes_about_ltvs_chaos/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=15 March 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] The general director of LTV, Uldis-Ivars Grava, replied, saying: "A few weeks ago, the EBU's legal director, Werner Rumphorst, was in Riga, and I spent an entire day with him and with the former general director of the Danish broadcaster DR, Bjørn Erichsen. We talked about co-operation and about programme exchanges, and neither of them said a single word that would indicate any doubts, lack of trust or accusation."[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=LTV: "Eurovision will take place in Riga!"|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1414/ltv_eurovision_will_take_place_in_riga/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=16 March 2003|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] Ingrida Smite, head of press for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, reaffirmed that the contest would take place in Riga despite reports to the contrary.

===Controversies surrounding Russian artists===

Upon the selection of the Russian artists t.A.T.u., the duo gave an interview to German tabloid Bild in March 2003 where they claimed that they would win the contest without a doubt and criticised the German entrant Lou calling her a witch with duo member Julia Volkova stating, "In Russia we nurse blind and old people, but we don't send them to the Grand Prix. This must be different in Germany."[tpl]cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Archived news.

===Russian complaint against Irish vote===

After the contest, Russian broadcaster Channel One complained that Irish broadcaster RTÉ had used a back-up jury, and that it had cost them victory. A statement by Channel One said "Considering the insignificant difference in points between the first and third places, there are grounds to believe that the contest results could be much different for Russia."[tpl]cite web|first=Nick Paton|last=Walsh|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 May 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Russia launches Eurovision appeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2947872.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=29 May 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] On the night of the competition, the voting polls operated by Irish telecommunications company Eircom suffered a delay in delivering the results on time, which prompted RTÉ to use the votes of the back-up jury instead.[tpl]cite web|first=André|last=Rodrigues|title=EBU approves use back-up jury of Irish television|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1695/ebu_approves_use_back-up_jury_of_irish_television/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=20 June 2003|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The EBU cleared RTÉ of any potential wrongdoing after an investigation on the matter and stated that the rules concerning substituting the back-up jury in place of the televote were correctly applied. RTÉ later published the unused results of the televote, which showed that had the jury not been used, Turkey would still have won, and Ireland's voting "partners", the United Kingdom, would still have no points. Russia did not receive any points from the televote, however, since Belgium only received 2 points from the Irish televote as opposed to 10 points awarded by the Irish jury, Russia would have placed second.[tpl]cite web|first=Sietse|last=Bakker|title=Irish televoting results finally announced|url=http://www.esctoday.com/1707/|publisher=ESCToday.com|date=27 June 2003|accessdate=22 March 2008[/tpl]

===United Kingdom's last place finish===

The United Kingdom's last-place finish was greeted with much consternation in the British media. Terry Wogan, long-time commentator on the contest for the BBC, said that the UK was suffering from "post-Iraq backlash". Chris Cromby from Jemini said "The monitors were off. Maybe it was sabotage, but we couldn't hear anything...we used the floor monitors, the others used their own."[tpl]cite web|title=Eurovision flops blame equipment|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2937700.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=26 May 2003|accessdate=26 March 2008[/tpl] The UK's result was their worst-ever at Eurovision; by contrast, Turkey's win was their first. Alf Poier's sixth place was Austria's best result for fourteen years, Poland's seventh place was their best in nine, and Romania's tenth place was one place behind their best-ever. Belgium's second place was their first top-five finish in seventeen years, but Latvia's third-from-bottom finish was their worst result in four attempts; it was also the worst placing for a host country since 1992.

==Participating countries==

Twenty-four countries participated in the 2002 contest in Tallinn; of these, fourteen were expected to compete in 2003. The bottom ten in Tallinn would be relegated, to allow countries to compete for the first time.Sietse Bakker (25 May 2002). Latvia won the 47th Eurovision Song Contest. ESCtoday.com. Retrieved on 23 March 2008. In reality, only five countries were relegated— nineteen countries that entered in 2002 competed in Riga. Macedonia, Finland, Switzerland, Lithuania and Denmark were forced to sit out the contest. The nineteen qualifiers were joined by the six countries that had sat out the 2002 contest: Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Portugal. The twenty-sixth contestant was Ukraine, making its debut at the contest.Sietse Bakker. EBU released list of participant for 2003. ESCtoday.com. Retrieved on 23 March 2008.

RTBF was the Belgian broadcaster at the forty-eighth contest, marking the first Walloon entry since 2000. Twenty-six entries was the highest number in the contest's history at that point; it remains the most to have competed in a Eurovision final, and was subsequently equalled nine years later in 2012. The draw for the running order took place in December 2002 in Riga: Iceland would open the contest and Slovenia would complete it.Sietse Bakker (1 December 2002).
