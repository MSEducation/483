Chaplin is a 1992 British-American biographical film about the life of British comedian Charlie Chaplin. It was produced and directed by Richard Attenborough and stars Robert Downey, Jr., Moira Kelly, Dan Aykroyd, Penelope Ann Miller, and Kevin Kline. It also features Geraldine Chaplin in the role of her own paternal grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.
The film was adapted by William Boyd, Bryan Forbes and William Goldman from the books My Autobiography by Chaplin and Chaplin: His Life and Art by film critic David Robinson. Associate producer  Diana Hawkins got a story credit. The original music score was composed by John Barry.

==Plot==

The film is structured around lengthy flashbacks as the elderly Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) (now living in Switzerland) recollects moments from his life during a conversation with fictional character George Hayden (Anthony Hopkins), the editor of his autobiography. Chaplin's recollections begin with his childhood of extreme poverty, from which he escapes by immersing himself in the world of the London music halls, after which he relocates to the United States.
There are references to some of his many romantic episodes (including Hetty Kelly, Mildred Harris, Georgia Hale, Marion Davies, Edna Purviance, Lita Grey, Paulette Goddard, Joan Barry and Oona O'Neill), his professional collaboration with Mack Sennett and friendship with Douglas Fairbanks.

==Critical reception==

Although the film was criticized for taking dramatic licence with some aspects of Chaplin's life, Downey's performance as Chaplin won almost universal acclaim. Attenborough was sufficiently confident in Downey's performance to include historical footage of Chaplin himself at the end of the film.
The film was lauded for its high production values, but many critics dismissed it as an overly glossy biopic.[tpl]cite web|title=Chaplin (1992) : Film|url=http://digiguide.tv/programme/Film/Chaplin/44781/|publisher=DigiGuide|quote=Dismissed on its release by many critics as a typically fluffy paean to Chaplin ... this sumptuous biopic may have a touch too much gloss, but it's anything but bland.[/tpl] One critic wrote that the screenplay "endeavors to cover too much ground.  The life of Charlie Chaplin was so vast and varied that a film is far too restrictive a format to give it justice."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterinfo.com/chaplin_(1992).htm |title=Chaplin (1992) |publisher=Hometheaterinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07[/tpl]
