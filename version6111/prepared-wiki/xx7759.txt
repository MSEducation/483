 The week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer [[Gary Anderson (F1 designer)|Gary Anderson]] and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. His manager [[Willi Weber]] assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]] track well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, team-mate [[Andrea de Cesaris]] was meant to show Schumacher the circuit but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up [[bicycle|bike]] he had brought with him.<ref>
