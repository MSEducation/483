[[Dès que le printemps revient]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Luxembourg, Eurovision songs of 1964

"Dès que le printemps revient" (English translation: "Once Spring Returns") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964, performed in French by French singer Hugues Aufray.
The song is a ballad, with Aufray musing on how he feels when Spring begins. He sings that everyone finds love during the season, but frequently forgets it later on. As for his own situation, he sings that he hopes to find love, but also that occasionally he "wants to die" as a result of not finding it. Aufray also recorded his entry in German, as "Das alles geht vorbei", and Spanish, as "La primavera llegó".
The song was performed first on the night, preceding the Netherlands' Anneke Grönloh with "Jij bent mijn leven". As Luxembourg had performed last at the 1963 contest, this represents the rare event of a country "succeeding itself" on the Eurovision stage. At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 16.
It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1965 Contest by France Gall with "Poupée de cire, poupée de son".
