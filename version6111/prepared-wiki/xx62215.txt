The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape is an album by post-hardcore noise rock band Big Black. It was released in 1987 by Touch and Go Records. The album is a CD compilation of Big Black's Atomizer album, "Heartbeat" single and Headache EP. The track "Strange Things" from the original Atomizer LP was not included on this release.
The title of the album, and the liner notes by Steve Albini, show the band's low regard for compact discs (the 8-track tape was state of the art in the 1970s).
