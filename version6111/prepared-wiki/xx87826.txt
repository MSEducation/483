The National Map, accessed April 28, 2011 water course on the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the longest river in Hawai'i and its course lies mostly along the divide between the lava flows  of Mauna Kea and those of Mauna Loa to the south.

The lower reach of the river is used for the generation of hydroelectricity. The flow at Hilo averages 275 cubic feet per second (8 m³/s) with peak flows 40 times as great. The stream carries an average of 10 tons of suspended sediment into Hilo Bay each day, at [tpl]coord|19|43|40|N|155|5|15|W |display=inline,title |type:river_region:US-HI[/tpl].
