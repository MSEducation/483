Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the [[Four Great Classical Novels|classic Chinese novel]] ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.
During the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. In 1900, the attempt by the "Boxers" to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by foreign powers.[tpl]harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=119–120[/tpl] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.

===Republican era===

The fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[tpl]harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=133–134[/tpl] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. The most powerful factions fought frequent wars {–} the Zhili-Anhui War and the First and Second Zhili-Fengtian War {–} to take control of the capital. Following the success of the Nationalists' Northern Expedition, the capital was formally removed to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as "Peiping").[tpl]harvnb|MacKerras|Yorke|1991|p=8[/tpl]
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Beiping fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[ref]
