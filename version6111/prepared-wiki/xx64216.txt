Sheen's breakthrough role was as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's The Deal. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prior to the 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan.

Sheen came to international attention in 2006 for his portrayal of Tony Blair in The Queen. The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had "a weight to him that he didn’t have before". When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the "less opinion" he has of the politician: "Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice, it's sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/stephen_merchant/tracklisting_20071230.shtml |title=The Stephen Merchant Show, BBC 6 Music, 30 December 2007 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 November 2011[/tpl] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised "a sensational performance, alert and nuanced"[tpl]cite news |title=The Queen |author=Peter Travers |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-queen-20060921 |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=21 September 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2011[/tpl] while Empire spoke of an "uncanny, insightful performance".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134552 |title= The Queen|work=Empire |accessdate=22 November 2011[/tpl] Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/search.html?q=michael%20sheen&w=true|title=Michael Sheen BAFTA nominations |type=search results |publisher=BAFTA |accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl] His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in Blood Diamond as an unscrupulous diamond dealer.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jan/28/leonardodicaprio.thriller |title=Blood Diamond Review |author=Philip French |newspaper=The Observer |date=28 January 2007 |accessdate=21 September 2011 [/tpl] Also in 2006, Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's Fantabulosa!

Sheen reprised the role of David Frost in 2008's Frost/Nixon, a film dramatisation of the The Nixon Interviews of 1977.
