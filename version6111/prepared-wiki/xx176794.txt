Maynard Davis "Doc" Morrison (May 28, 1909[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]June 2, 2006) was an All-American football fullback and center for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1929-1931. Michigan football coach Harry Kipke ranked Morrison as the finest linebacker he ever saw.  "No one ever got past him," Kipke said.[tpl]cite news|title=University of Michigan Football All- American: Maynard Morrison, Center, 1931|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aamorrm.htm[/tpl]  In 1931, he was chosen by Grantland Rice and the NEA Service as a first-team All-American at center and helped lead Michigan to a Big Ten Conference championship.

==1929 season==

As a sophomore in 1929, Morrison was already a significant contributor at the fullback position.  When Morrison finished his freshman year, he "was rated the outstanding fullback prospect in Michigan history."[tpl]cite news|author=Rice, Grantland|title=The Sportlight|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|date=1929-11-07[/tpl]  In the fall of 1929, Morrison missed five games at the beginning of the season due to injury.  Then, against Illinois, he was placed in the lineup at tackle and became "the individual star of the Wolverines by a wide, handsome and undisputed margin."  On defense, he was taken out of the line and played at defensive fullback, and when an Illinois back found a hole in the line, Grantland Rice wrote that “Morrison usually picked him up bodily and hurled him back into the breach in the wall.”  And occasionally, "he was content with merely smacking the ball carriers against the ground as they had never been smacked before."  After the Illinois game, Coach Kipke said of Morrison, "That boy will develop into the finest defensive back in Michigan’s history.  His injured knee isn't entirely well, and when it is he will add more speed to his play."
At the end of the 1929 season, Coach Kipke touted Morrison as the best back to wear the Michigan uniform in 15 years: "Coach Harry Kipke says Maynard Morrison . . . is the nearest approach to Johnny Maulbetsch the Wolverines have seen in the last 15 years.  Morrison is a husky sophomore of more than 200 pounds and hits the line with all the force and power that made Maulbetsch famous as a line smasher.  Morrison suffered early season injuries that kept him from play during the first month but he is expected to show his stuff in the closing games."[tpl]cite news|title=Best Since Maulbetsch|publisher=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1929-11-14[/tpl]  He scored a touchdown in a 14-12 victory over Harvard, as he "hurled his 210 pound bulk through the Crimson forward wall for a touchdown."[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Trims Harvard by Slim Margin of 14 to 12: Michigan Makes Most of Breaks|publisher=The Kingsport Times (Tenn.)|date=1929-11-10[/tpl]  After a scoreless tie with Iowa, the Associated Press reported that Morrison “was responsible for most of the Wolverine’s first downs.”[tpl]cite news|title=Iowa’s Big 10 Final 0-0 Tie With Wolves|publisher=Capital Times (Madison, Wisc.)|date=1929-11-23[/tpl]

==1930 season==

In the summer of 1930, Coach Kipke reported that he had 15 varsity caliber backs but was lacking in talent in the line.  Accordingly, Kipke reported he was considering moving Morrison to the center position.[tpl]cite news|title=Wolverine Grid Talent Runs to the Backfield|publisher=Te Daily Inter Lake (Mont.) (AP)|date=1930-08-16[/tpl]  Again in early September, Kipke announced that “so great is the lack of linemen” that he proposed making a center of Morrison.[tpl]cite news|author=Stevenson, W.G.|title=Michigan Out to Break Old Tradition of Losing Games|publisher=The Daily Mail (Md.)|date=1930-09-09[/tpl]  However, before making the move, Kipke had to persuade Morrison's father.  One newspaper account in 1930 reported: "Maynard Morrison was a pretty good fullback last year at Michigan.  Coach Harry Kipke though he saw great center possibilities in the young man from Royal Oak.  But Morrison’s father wanted him to carry the ball.  Kipke made the trip himself to Royal Oak to persuade Papa Morrison that Maynard would be better at flipping the ball than lugging it."[tpl]cite news|author=Braucher, William|title=Hooks and Slides|publisher=Jefferson City Post-Tribune|date=1930-12-17[/tpl]
After ten days of experimenting during fall practice, Kipke made the switch, moving Maynard from fullback to center.[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Fans to See Change: Kipke Switches Stars of Last Season; Fesler Shines at Ohio|publisher=The Kokomo Tribune (AP)|date=1930-09-24[/tpl]
Morrison performed well at his new position in 1930, being praised by the AP for his “defensive genius.”[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Hoping to Avenge Defeat|publisher=Stevens Point Daily Journal (Wisc.)|date=1930-10-11[/tpl]  At the end of the 1930 season, Morrison was named to All-Big Ten teams by the United Press and the NEA (Newspaper Enterprise Association) Service.[tpl]cite news|title=United Press Names Big Ten All-Stars|publisher=Decatur Herald|date=1930-11-24[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Burcky, Claire|title=Big Ten All-Stars|publisher=Jefferson City Post-Tribune|date=1930-11-28[/tpl]  One reporter noted that Morrison "was just about everything a coach could ask for in a center."[tpl]cite news|author=McEwan, John|title=Ticknor Named As Best Center: Four Other Centers Stand Out in Season’s Play|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1930-12-11[/tpl]

==1931 season==

In 1931, Morrison started nine games for the 8-1-1 Wolverines team that tied for the Big Ten Conference championship.  Morrison was selected as a first-team All-American in 1931 by Grantland Rice for Collier’s magazine and by the NEA Service All-America Board.[tpl]cite news|title=Munn Placed on Rice’s All-American Team: Rentner and Morrison Get Honor Posts|publisher=The Evening Tribune (Albert Lea, Minn.)|date=1931-12-18[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Barry Wood Made All-American Eleven Named by Gil Dobie and Associate Coaches and Officials as Football Jury: Dalrymple of Tulane is the Most Popular Player With Experts in Selection|publisher=Syracuse Herald|date=1931-12-12[/tpl]  The NEA Service All-America Board made their All-American selections based on more than 680 reports from coaches, writers and officials representing every section of the country where football was played.  According to newspaper accounts reporting on Morrison being the consensus selection by the board members at the center position, it was noted that his "great defensive ability gave him the call."  Thomas Yarr of Notre Dame was named the first-team center by the Associated Press in 1931.[tpl] cite news|title=Irish Place Three on AP All-America Team|publisher=Morning News (Florence, S.C.)|date=1931-12-05[/tpl]
In announcing Morrison as its All-Big Ten team center, the Associated Press described him as "Michigan’s 210 pound center from Royal Oak, Michigan," a player who was "big, shifty and fast," and "the key man of Michigan's defense."[tpl]cite news|author=Mickelson, Paul|title=Three Wildcats on 'All' Squad: Big Ten 'Cream' Has 2 From Each of 3 Other Schools|publisher=The Billings Gazette|date=1931-11-25[/tpl]  Football writer Merle Oliver called Morrison Michigan’s “diagnostician of enemy plays.”[tpl]cite news|title=Sixteen Veterans Nucleus of Michigan’s Grid Eleven|publisher=The Galveston Daily News|date=1931-09-12[/tpl]
Morrison was part of a long line of All-American centers at Michigan, starting with William Cunningham and Germany Schulz followed by Ernie Vick, Jack Blott,  Bob Brown, and Chuck Bernard.[tpl]cite news|author=Powers, Francis J.|title=Great Centers Produced at Michigan|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=1933-11-26[/tpl]
