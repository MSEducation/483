[[Uttaradit Railway Station]]

CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Thailand, Art Nouveau architecture

Uttaradit Station is the main railway station for Uttaradit province. It is owned by the State Railway of Thailand and serves the Northern Line. Uttaradit Railway Station is located 485.17 kilometres from Bangkok Railway Station. It is also a Class 1 Station and is also the base for lots of maintenance subdivisions.

==History==

During 1905-1906 King Chulalongkorn planned to build a railway line from Bangkok-Chiang Mai and another from Uttaradit to Ban Krai then across the Mekong River to Luang Prabang. Thus a railway station was built here, and trees were cleared and the land was levelled to await the track-laying process, which happened later in 1907. In 1907, trains hauled rock-filled wagons in which the people saw everyday. A railway station was therefore built in the forest cemetery of Wat Tha Thanon (Uttaradit Station in Present) in 1909 and was finished in 1910. The first Uttaradit Station was built in the Modernist Style of Jugendstil with a tower in the middle, designed and built by German architect Karl Siegfried DÃ¶hring. However, the tower was torn down during World War 2 and turned into a bomb shelter for protection against Allied Bombings. Uttaradit station was hit and rebuilt after the war and opened for service once again in 1951. Due to an increase of train traffic, a new station had to be built 2.35 kilometres north and was finished in 1958, it was called Sila At Station.
Today Uttaradit Station is kept as an OTOP centre and there have been plans of expanding the station building into a department store.
