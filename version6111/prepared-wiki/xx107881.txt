State Route 592 (SR 592) is a [tpl]convert|8.451|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] eastâ€“west highway section line arterial in the Las Vegas Valley.  The highway currently exists in two separate sections on Flamingo Road.  The road is named after the Flamingo Hotel which is located on the Las Vegas Boulevard near where it intersects with Flamingo Road.

==Route description==

The first portion of SR 592 begins at Rainbow Boulevard (SR 595) and extends easterly to Interstate 15.  The second section resumes at Paradise Road and continues east, skirting the northern edge of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus before reaching its terminus at Boulder Highway (SR 582).

==History==

Flamingo Road originally only existed east of Las Vegas Boulevard, with a nearby street, Dunes Road connecting Las Vegas Boulevard with Interstate 15 (I-15). In the early 1980s, the Nevada Department of Transportation rebuilt the Dunes interchange at I-15, and constructed a six-lane Flamingo Road west to Rainbow Boulevard.
The segment between I-15 and Las Vegas Boulevard remained named Dunes-Flamingo Road until 1995.
The portion of SR 592 between I-15 and Paradise Road was decommissioned by 2008.
The route is a candidate to be decommissioned with control given to Clark County; however, only the above section located in the resort corridor has been relinquished as of January 2008.
