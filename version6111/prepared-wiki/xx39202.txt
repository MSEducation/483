Lallans ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|l|ə|n|z[/tpl])OED (a variant of the Modern Scots word lawlands [tpl]IPA-sco|ˈlo̜ːlən(d)z, ˈlɑːlənz|[/tpl]SND: Lawland meaning the lowlands of Scotland), is a term that was traditionally used to refer to the Scots language as a whole.SND: Lallan However, more recent interpretations assume it refers to the dialects of south and central Scotland,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] while Doric, a term once used to refer to Scots dialects in general, is now generally seen to refer to the Mid Northern Scots dialects spoken in the north-east of Scotland.SND:DoricMcColl Millar. 2007.

Both Robert Burns and Robert Louis Stevenson used it to refer to the Scots language.
They took nae pains their speech to balance, 
Or rules to gie; 
But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans, 
Like you or me. 
"What tongue does your auld bookie speak?" 
He'll spier; an' I, his mou to steik: 
"No bein' fit to write in Greek, 
I wrote in Lallan, 
Dear to my heart as the peat reek, 
Auld as Tantallon. 

==Synthetic Scots==

The term Lallans was also used during the Scottish Renaissance of the early 20th century to refer to what Hugh MacDiarmid called synthetic Scots, i.e., a synthesis  integrating, blending, and combining various forms of the Scots language, both vernacular and archaic. This was intended as a classical, standard Scots for a world-class literature, although it was more often than not Scots words grafted on to a standard English grammatical structure somewhat removed from traditional spoken Scots, its main practitioners not being habitual Lowland Scots speakers themselves.
MacDiarmid's detractors often referred to it as plastic Scots — a word play on synthetic as in synthetic plastics — to emphasize its artificiality. William Shakespeare also indulged in similar activities using the English language but has never been accused of writing synthetic or plastic English. With this in mind Sydney Goodsir Smith answered critics in his Epistle to John Guthrie:
In Ulster the neologism Ullans merging Ulster and Lallans is often used to refer to a revived literary variety of Ulster Scots. The magazine of the Ulster-Scots Language Society is also named Ullans.
