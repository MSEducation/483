Afonso Paulo Martins da Agra (born 11 April 1973), known as Martins, is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a midfielder.

==Football career==

Born in Póvoa de Varzim, Martins family emigrated to France when he was very young, and he first played professionally with AS Nancy, spending three seasons at the club. In the 1995–96 campaign he returned to Portugal, signing with league powerhouse Sporting Clube de Portugal. 
Martin's tenure with the capital outfit was an inconsistent one: he was a starter during his first years but, towards the end, was often demoted to the B-team, and participated very little in the side's 2000 and 2002 championship conquests (no games whatsoever in the latter, as he was left without a place in the squad and only trained separately).
Martins finished his career in June 2007, after spells with Moreirense FC, Vitória de Guimarães and lowly F.C. Lixa – he did not have a club in the 2005–06 season. He played for the Portuguese national team at under-21 level, also appearing at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta where he scored both goals in the 2–0 win over Tunisia in the first game, as the country eventually finished fourth.
