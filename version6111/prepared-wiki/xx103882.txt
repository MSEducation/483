Nonbenzodiazepines [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ən|b|ɛ|n|z|ɵ|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|z|ɨ|p|iː|n[/tpl] (sometimes referred to colloquially as "Z-drug") are a class of psychoactive drugs that are very benzodiazepine-like in nature. Nonbenzodiazepines pharmacodynamics are almost entirely the same as benzodiazepine drugs and therefore employ similar benefits, side-effects, and risks. Nonbenzodiazepines, however, have dissimilar or entirely different chemical structures and, therefore, are unrelated to benzodiazepines on a molecular level.[tpl]cite journal |author=Siriwardena AN, Qureshi Z, Gibson S, Collier S, Latham M |title=GPs' attitudes to benzodiazepine and 'Z-drug' prescribing: a barrier to implementation of evidence and guidance on hypnotics |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=56 |issue=533 |pages=964–7 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17132386 |pmc=1934058 |doi=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Wagner J, Wagner ML, Hening WA |title=Beyond benzodiazepines: alternative pharmacologic agents for the treatment of insomnia |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=680–91 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9640488 |doi=10.1345/aph.17111[/tpl]

==Classes==

Currently, the major chemical classes of nonbenzodiazepines are:
Imidazopyridines
Pyrazolopyrimidines
Cyclopyrrolones
β-Carbolines
Others

==Pharmacology==

The nonbenzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor. Like the benzodiazepines, they exert their effects by binding to and activating the benzodiazepine site of the receptor complex.

==Background==

Nonbenzodiazepines have demonstrated efficacy in treating sleep disorders. There is some limited evidence that suggests that tolerance to nonbenzodiazepines is slower to develop than with benzodiazepines.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] However, data are limited so no conclusions can be drawn. Data are also limited into the long term effects of nonbenzodiazepines. Further research into the safety of nonbenzodiazepines and long term effectiveness of nonbenzodiazepines has been recommended in a review of the literature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Benca RM |title=Diagnosis and treatment of chronic insomnia: a review |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=332–43 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15746509 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.56.3.332[/tpl] Some differences exist between the Z-drugs, for example tolerance and rebound effects may not occur with zaleplon.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lader MH |title=Implications of hypnotic flexibility on patterns of clinical use |journal=Int J Clin Pract Suppl |volume= |issue=116 |pages=14–9 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11219327 |doi=[/tpl]

==Pharmaceuticals==

The first three nonbenzodiazepine drugs to enter the market were the "Z-drugs", zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon. These three drugs are all sedatives used exclusively for the treatment of mild insomnia. They are safer than the older barbiturates especially in overdosage and they may, when compared to the benzodiazepines, have less of a tendency to induce physical dependence and addiction, although these issues can still become a problem. This has led to the Z-drugs becoming widely prescribed for the treatment of insomnia particularly in elderly patients.[tpl]cite journal |author=Neubauer DN |title=New approaches in managing chronic insomnia |journal=CNS Spectrums |volume=11 |issue=8 Suppl 8 |pages=1–13 |year=2006 |pmid=16871130 |doi=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Najib J |title=Eszopiclone, a nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia |journal=Clinical Therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=491–516 |year=2006 |pmid=16750462 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lieberman JA |title=Update on the Safety Considerations in the Management of Insomnia With Hypnotics: Incorporating Modified-Release Formulations Into Primary Care |journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17599165 |doi= |url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v09n01/v09n0105.pdf |format=PDF |pmc=1894851[/tpl] Long-term use is not recommended as tolerance and addiction can occur.[tpl]cite journal |author=Touitou Y |title=disorders and hypnotic agents: medical, social and economical impact |language=French |journal=Ann Pharm Fr |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=230–8 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17652991 |doi= |url=[/tpl] A survey of patients using nonbenzodiazepine Z drugs and benzodiazepine hypnotic users found that there was no difference in reports of adverse effects that were reported in over 41% of users and, in fact, Z drug users were more likely to report that they had tried to quit their hypnotic drug and were more likely to want to stop taking Z drugs than benzodiazepine users. Efficacy also did not differ between benzodiazepine and Z drug users.[tpl]cite journal |author=Siriwardena AN, Qureshi MZ, Dyas JV, Middleton H, Orner R |title=Magic bullets for insomnia?

==Side-effects==

The Z-drugs are not without disadvantages, and all three compounds are notable for producing side-effects such as pronounced amnesia and more rarely hallucinations,[tpl]cite journal |author=Stone JR, Zorick TS, Tsuang J |title=Dose-related illusions and hallucinations with zaleplon |journal=Clin Toxicol (Philadelphia) |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=1–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17852167 |doi=10.1080/15563650701517442[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Toner LC, Tsambiras BM, Catalano G, Catalano MC, Cooper DS |title=Central nervous system side effects associated with zolpidem treatment |journal=Clin Neuropharmacol |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=54–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10682233 |doi=10.1097/00002826-200001000-00011[/tpl] especially when used in large doses. On rare occasions, these drugs can produce a fugue state, wherein the patient sleepwalks and may perform relatively complex actions, including cooking meals or driving cars, while effectively unconscious and with no recollection of the events upon awakening. While this effect is rare (and has also been reported to occur with some of the older sedative drugs such as temazepam and secobarbital), it can be potentially hazardous, and so further development of this class of drugs has continued in an effort to find new compounds with further improved profiles.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mellingsaeter TC, Bramness JG, Slørdal L |title=z-hypnotics better and safer sleeping pills than benzodiazepines? |language=Norwegian |journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske Laegeforening |volume=126 |issue=22 |pages=2954–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17117195 |doi= |url=http://www.tidsskriftet.no/pls/lts/pa_lt.visSeksjon?vp_SEKS_ID=1453732[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Yang W, Dollear M, Muthukrishnan SR |title=One rare side effect of zolpidem--sleepwalking: a case report |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=1265–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15954071 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2004.11.022[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lange CL |title=Medication-associated somnambulism |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=211–2 |year=2005 |pmid=15725964 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000150618.67559.48[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Morgenthaler TI, Silber MH |title=Amnestic sleep-related eating disorder associated with zolpidem |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=323–7 |year=2002 |pmid=14592194 |doi=10.1016/S1389-9457(02)00007-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Liskow B, Pikalov A |title=Zaleplon overdose associated with sleepwalking and complex behavior |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=927–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15266187 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000129219.66563.aa[/tpl] 
Daytime withdrawal-related anxiety can also occur from chronic nightly nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic usage such as with zopiclone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fontaine R, Beaudry P, Le Morvan P, Beauclair L, Chouinard G |title=Zopiclone and triazolam in insomnia associated with generalized anxiety disorder: a placebo-controlled evaluation of efficacy and daytime anxiety |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=173–83 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2230061 |doi=10.1097/00004850-199007000-00002[/tpl]
Side-effects can differ within the drug class due to differences in metabolism and pharmacology. For example, long-acting benzodiazepines have problems of drug accumulation especially in the elderly or those with liver disease, and shorter-acting benzodiazepines have a higher risk of more severe withdrawal symptoms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shader RI, Greenblatt DJ |title=Clinical implications of benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=652–6 |date=June 1977 |pmid=17302 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17302[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Noyes R, Perry PJ, Crowe RR, et al. |title=Seizures following the withdrawal of alprazolam |journal=J.

===Increased risk of depression===

It has been claimed that insomnia causes depression and hypothesized that insomnia medications may help to treat depression. However, an analysis of data of clinical trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning the drugs zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone found that these sedative hypnotic drugs more than doubled the risks of developing depression compared to those taking placebo pills. Hypnotic drugs, therefore, may be contraindicated in patients suffering from or at risk of depression. Hypnotics were found to be more likely to cause depression than to help it. Studies have found that long-term users of sedative hypnotic drugs have a markedly raised suicide risk as well as an overall increased mortality risk.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, on the other hand, has been found to both improve sleep quality as well as general mental health.[tpl]cite journal |journal=BMC Psychiatry |date=August 21, 2007 |volume=7 |title=Greater incidence of depression with hypnotic use than with placebo |publisher=pubmed |author=Kripke DF |pmid=17711589 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-7-42 |pages=42 |pmc=1994947[/tpl]

==Dependence and withdrawal management==

Nonbenzodiazepines should not be discontinued abruptly if taken for more than a few weeks due to the risk of rebound withdrawal effects and acute withdrawal reactions, which may resemble those seen during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Treatment usually entails gradually reducing the dosage over a period of weeks or several months depending on the individual, dosage, and length of time the drug has been taken. If this approach fails, a crossover to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine (such as chlordiazepoxide or more preferably diazepam) can be tried followed by a gradual reduction in dosage. In extreme cases and, in particular, where severe addiction and/or abuse is manifested, an inpatient detoxification may be required, with flumazenil as a possible detoxification tool.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a605009.html |title=Eszopiclone |accessdate=21 March 2008 |author=MedlinePlus |date=January 8, 2001 |publisher=National Institutes of Health |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227024716/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a605009.html |archivedate=February 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/ |title=Benzodiazepines: How They Work and How to Withdraw |author=Professor Heather Ashton[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Quaglio G, Lugoboni F, Fornasiero A, Lechi A, Gerra G, Mezzelani P |title=Dependence on zolpidem: two case reports of detoxification with flumazenil infusion |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=285–7 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16096519 |doi=10.1097/01.yic.0000166404.41850.b4 |url=[/tpl]

==Carcinogenicity==

The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a paper that had carried out a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications and raised concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines, and the Z-drugs that are used as hypnotics in humans. The review found that almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. It was found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times higher than non-industry-sponsored studies and that 24% of authors did not disclose being funded by the drug companies in their published papers when they were funded by the drug companies. The paper found that there is little research into hypnotics that is independent from the drug manufacturers. Also of concern was the lack of focus in industry-sponsored trials on their own results showing that use of hypnotics is correlated with depression.
The author was concerned that there is no discussion of adverse effects of benzodiazepine agonist hypnotics discussed in the medical literature such as significant increased levels of infection, cancers, and increased mortality in trials of hypnotic drugs and an overemphasis on the positive effects. No hypnotic manufacturer has yet tried to refute the epidemiology data that shows that use of their product is correlated with excess mortality. The author stated that "major hypnotic trials is needed to more carefully study potential adverse effects of hypnotics such as daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and death and the resultant balance of benefits and risks." The author concluded that more independent research into daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and shortening of lives of sedative hypnotic users is needed to find the true balance of benefits and risks of benzodiazepine agonist hypnotic drugs in the treatment of insomnia.[tpl]cite journal |journal=J Clin Sleep Med |date=December 15, 2007 |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=671–3 |title=Who Should Sponsor Sleep Disorders Pharmaceutical Trials? |author=Kripke DF |pmid=18198797 |quote=major hypnotic trials is needed to more carefully study potential adverse effects of hypnotics such as daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and death and the resultant balance of benefits and risks. |pmc=2556906[/tpl] Significant increases in skin cancers and tumors are found in clinical trial data of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics compared to trial subjects having taken placebo tablets. Other cancers of the brain, lung, bowel, breast, and bladder also occurred. An increase of infections, possibly due to decreased immune function, also occurred in the nonbenzodiazepine users. It has been hypothesised that either depressed immune function or the viral infections themselves were the cause of the increased rates of cancer.
Initially, the FDA was hesitant to approve some of the nonbenzodiazepines due to concerns regarding increases in cancers. The author reported that, due to the fact that the FDA requires reporting of both favourable and unfavourable results of clinical trials, the FDA New Drug Application data is more reliable than the peer-reviewed literature, which is subject to serious bias regarding hypnotics. In 2008, the FDA analysed their data again and confirmed an increased rate of cancers in the randomised trials compared to placebos but concluded that the rate of cancers did not warrant any regulatory action.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kripke DF |title=Possibility that certain hypnotics might cause cancer in skin |journal=J Sleep Res |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=245–50 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18844818 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00685.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0962-1105&date=2008&volume=17&issue=3&spage=245[/tpl]

==Elderly==

Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, similar to benzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up during the night or the next morning; falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mets MA, Volkerts ER, Olivier B, Verster JC |title=Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=259–67 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20171127 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 |url=[/tpl] In general, nonbenzodiazepines are not recommended for older patients due to the increased risk of falls and fractures.[tpl]cite journal |author=Antai-Otong D |title=The art of prescribing. Risks and benefits of non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the treatment of acute primary insomnia in older adults |journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=196–200 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16916422 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2006.00070.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118727940/abstract[/tpl] An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all age groups and that these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics offer little if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents such as the melatonin agonists may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=168–92 |title=Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons |author=Bain KT |pmid=16860264 |doi=10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006[/tpl]

==Controversy==

A review of the literature regarding hypnotics including the nonbenzodiazepine Z drugs concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health and lack evidence of long-term effectiveness due to tolerance. The risks include dependence, accidents, and other adverse effects. Gradual discontinuation of hypnotics leads to improved health without worsening of sleep. It is preferred that they should be prescribed for only a few days at the lowest effective dose and avoided altogether wherever possible in the elderly.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=What's wrong with prescribing hypnotics? |journal=Drug Ther Bull |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=89–93 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15587763 |doi=10.1136/dtb.2004.421289 |url=http://dtb.bmj.com/content/42/12/89.long |registration=yes[/tpl]

==New compounds==

More recently, a range of non-sedating anxiolytic drugs derived from the same structural families as the Z-drugs have been developed, such as alpidem (Ananyxl) and pagoclone, and approved for clinical prescription. Nonbenzodiazepine drugs are much more selective than the older benzodiazepine anxiolytics, producing effective relief of anxiety/panic with little or no sedation, anterograde amnesia, or anticonvulsant effects, and are thus potentially more precise than older, anti-anxiety drugs. However, anxiolytic nonbenzodiazepines are not widely prescribed and many have collapsed after initial clinical trials and consumption halted many projects, including but not limited to alpidem, indiplon, and suriclone.
