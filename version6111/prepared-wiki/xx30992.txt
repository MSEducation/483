The Myrmidons or Myrmidones ([tpl]lang-el|Μυρμιδόνες[/tpl]) were legendary people of Greek history. They were very brave and skilled warriors commanded by Achilles,Achilles himself is "the great Myrmidon/Who broils in loud applause" in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida.  as described in Homer's  Iliad. Their eponymous ancestor was Myrmidon, a king of Thessalian Phthia, who was the son of Zeus and "wide-ruling" Eurymedousa, a princess of Phthia.
An etiological myth of their origins, expanding upon their etymology — the name in Classical Greek was interpreted as "ant-people", from μυρμηδών (murmedon) "ant's nest"Murmedon, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus and that from μύρμηξ (murmex) "ant"Murmex, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus — was first mentioned by Ovid, in Metamorphoses: in Ovid's telling, King Aeacus of Aegina, Achilles' grandfather, pleaded with Zeus to populate his country after a terrible plague. Zeus said his people would number as the ants on his sacred oak, and from the ants sprang the people of Aegina, the Myrmidons.

==Later use of the term==

The Myrmidons of Greek myth were known for their skill in battle and loyalty to their leaders. In pre-industrial Europe the word "myrmidon" carried many of the same connotations that "minion" does today.  Myrmidon later came to mean "hired ruffian" (according to the Oxford English Dictionary) or "a loyal follower, especially one who executes orders without question, protest, or pity - unquestioning followers." (Dictionary.com).
Myrmidons is also the title of the first of a trilogy of plays by Aeschylus, collectively known as the Achilleïs.  The other plays in the trilogy are Nereids and Phrygians (see Achilleis for more).
