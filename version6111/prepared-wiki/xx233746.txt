John Burke, 9th Earl of Clanricarde (1642â€“1722) was an Irish peer.
Burke succeeded his brother Richard. He was created Baron Bophin in 1689 and commanded a foot regiment as its colonel during the Williamite War in Ireland. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 and outlawed. In 1703 he obtained a reversal in return for a fine of twenty-five thousand pounds and that his two eldest sons be raised Protestant, after a private act of the English Parliament.
While the elder sons conformed, the younger Burkes remained Catholic and fought with the Wild Geese. Colonel Ulick Burke served the King of France, living as late as 1757. Lt. General Eamonn Burke was a member of the Irish regiment in Spain, and died at Bologna in 1744. Their brother William was killed at Fontenoy in 1745. His daughter was Honora de Burgh, who was married to Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan.[tpl]cite book|last=Burke|first=John|title=A General and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire|publisher=H.
