CATEGORIES: Obesity

Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health.WHO 2000 p. 6  Relative weight and body mass index (BMI) are nearly identical and are reasonable estimates of body fatness as measured by percentage body fat.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gray DS, Fujioka K |title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=545–50 |year=1991 |pmid=2037859 |doi= 10.1016/0895-4356(91)90218-X|url=[/tpl] However, BMI does not account for the wide variation in body fat distribution, and may not correspond to the same degree of fatness or associated health risk in different individuals and populations.WHO 2000, p. 7[tpl]cite journal |journal= Nutr J |year=2007 |volume=6 |pages=32 |title= Measurement and Definitions of Obesity In Childhood and Adolescence: A field guide for the uninitiated |author= Sweeting HN |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-6-32 |pmc= 2164947|pmid=17963490 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/32 |issue=1[/tpl]NHLBI p.xiv Other measurements of fat distribution include the waist–hip ratio and body fat percentage.

==BMI==

Body mass index or BMI is a simple and widely used method for estimating body fat mass.[tpl]cite journal | author=Mei Z, Grummer-Strawn LM, Pietrobelli A, Goulding A, Goran MI, Dietz WH | title=Validity of body mass index compared with other body-composition screening indexes for the assessment of body fatness in children and adolescents | journal=Am J Clin Nutr | date=1 June 2002| volume=75 | pages=978–85 | pmid=12036802 | url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/75/6/978 | issue=6 [/tpl] BMI was developed in the 19th century by the Belgian statistician and anthropometrist Adolphe Quetelet.[tpl]cite book | author=Quetelet LAJ | year=1871 | title=Antropométrie ou Mesure des Différences Facultés de l'Homme | location=Brussels | publisher=Musquardt[/tpl] BMI is an accurate reflection of body fat percentage in the majority of the adult population. It however is less accurate in people such as body builders and pregnant women.NHLBI p.60  A formula combining BMI, age and gender can be used to estimate a person's body fat percentage to an accuracy of 4%.Seidell 2005 p.3  An alternative method, body volume index (BVI), is being developed in an effort to better take into account different body shapes.Romero-Corral, A.

(2008) 3-D Body Scanner, Body Volume Index: A Novel, Reproducible and Automated Anthropometric Tool Associated with Cardiometabolic Biomarkers Obesity A Research Journal 16 (1) 266-P
BMI is calculated by dividing the subject's mass by the square of his or her height, typically expressed either in metric or US "Customary" units:
The most commonly used definitions, established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table at right.WHO 2000 p.9
Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular bodies. The surgical literature breaks down class III obesity into further categories, though the exact values are still disputed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sturm R |title=Increases in morbid obesity in the USA: 2000–2005 |journal=Public Health |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=492–6 |date=July 2007  |pmid=17399752 |pmc=2864630 |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2007.01.006 |url=[/tpl]
As Asian populations develop negative health consequences at a lower BMI than Caucasians, some nations have redefined obesity. The Japanese have defined obesity as any BMI greater than 25[tpl]cite journal |author=Kanazawa M, Yoshiike N, Osaka T, Numba Y, Zimmet P, Inoue S |title=Criteria and classification of obesity in Japan and Asia-Oceania |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |volume=11 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=S732–S737 |date=December 2002  |pmid=12534701 |doi= 10.1046/j.1440-6047.11.s8.19.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0964-7058&date=2002&volume=11&issue=&spage=S732[/tpl] while China uses a BMI of greater than 28.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bei-Fan Z |author2=Cooperative Meta-Analysis Group of Working Group on Obesity in China |title=Predictive values of body mass index and waist circumference for risk factors of certain related diseases in Chinese adults: study on optimal cut-off points of body mass index and waist circumference in Chinese adults |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |volume=11 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=S685–93 |date=December 2002  |pmid=12534691 |doi= 10.1046/j.1440-6047.11.s8.9.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0964-7058&date=2002&volume=11&issue=&spage=S685[/tpl]
The BMI-based definition is easy to use and it is particularly convenient for statistical purposes, since it only depends on two commonly measured quantities, one's height and weight. However, it ignores variations between individuals in amounts of lean body mass, particularly muscle mass. Individuals involved in heavy physical labor or sports may have high BMI values despite having little fat. For example, more than half of all NFL players are classified as "obese" (BMI ≥ 30), and 1 in 4 are classified as "extremely obese" (BMI ≥ 35), according to the BMI metric.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20050301/many-nfl-players-fatter-than-couch-potatoes|title=Many NFL Players Fatter Than Couch Potatoes[/tpl] However, their mean body fat percentage, 14%, is well within what's considered a healthy range.[tpl]cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/heart/articles/2009/05/26/nfl-players-not-at-increased-heart-risk|title=NFL Players Not at Increased Heart Risk: Study finds they showed no more signs of cardiovascular trouble than general male population[/tpl] 
The preferred obesity metric in scholarly circles is the body fat percentage (BF%) - the ratio of the total weight of person's fat to his or her body weight, and BMI is viewed merely as a way to approximate BF%.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/2/238.full.pdf|title=Assessing obesity: classification and epidemiology|author=Jacob C Seidell and Katherine M Flegal|journal=British Medical Bulletin|year=1997[/tpl] Levels in excess of 32% for women and 25% for men are generally considered to indicate obesity. However, accurate measurement of body fat percentage is much more difficult than measurement of BMI. Several methods of varying accuracy and complexity exist. 
Other proposed but less common obesity measures include waist circumference and waist–hip ratio. These measure a common form of obesity known as abdominal or central obesity, characterized by excess deposits of fat in the abdominal region and inside peritoneal cavity. They have been shown to be comparable to BMI in their power to predict the risk of metabolic abnormalities such as type II diabetes,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/1/115.full|title=Comparison of Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, and Waist/Hip Ratio in Predicting Incident Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis[/tpl] and possibly superior to BMI as predictors of cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal|url=https://www.carmenwiki.osu.edu/download/attachments/21739701/WaistHipRatioReview.pdf|title=Body mass index, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio as predictors of cardiovascular risk—a review of the literature|author=R Huxley et al|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2010[/tpl]

==Waist circumference and waist–hip ratio==

In the United States a waist circumference of >102 cm(~40") in men and >88 cm(~34.5") in women[tpl]cite journal |author=Janssen I, Katzmarzyk PT, Ross R |title=Body mass index, waist circumference, and health risk: evidence in support of current National Institutes of Health guidelines |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=162 |issue=18 |pages=2074–9 |date=October 2002  |pmid=12374515 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.162.18.2074|url=[/tpl] or the waist–hip ratio (the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips of >0.9 for men and >0.85 for women) are used to define central obesity.
In the European Union waist circumference of ≥ 94 cm(~37") in men and ≥ 80 cm(~31.5") in non pregnant women are used as cut offs for central obesity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tsigosa Constantine |last2=Hainer |first2=V |last3=Basdevant |first3=A |last4=Finer |first4=N |last5=Fried |first5=M |last6=Mathus-Vliegen |first6=E |last7=Micic |first7=D |last8=Maislos |first8=M |last9=Roman |first9=G |last10=Schutz |first10=Yves |last11=Toplak |first11=Hermann |last12=Zahorska-Markiewicz |first12=Barbara |title=Management of Obesity in Adults: European Clinical Practice Guidelines|journal=The European Journal of Obesity |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=106–16 |date=April 2008  |pmid= 20054170|doi=10.1159/000126822 |url=|display-authors=8 |author13=Obesity Management Task Force of the European Association for the Study of Obesity [/tpl]
A lower cut off of 90 cm has been recommended for South Asian and Chinese men, while a cut off of 85 cm has been recommended for Japanese men.
In those with a BMI under 35, intra-abdominal body fat is related to negative health outcomes independent of total body fat.[tpl]cite book |author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Evidence Syntheses|title=HSTAT: Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 3rd Edition: Recommendations and Systematic Evidence Reviews, Guide to Community Preventive Services |publisher=  |location=  |year=2000 |isbn= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=hstat3.section.36199[/tpl] Intra-abdominal or visceral fat has a particularly strong correlation with cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal | author=Yusuf S, Hawken S, Ounpuu S, Dans T, Avezum A, Lanas F, McQueen M, Budaj A, Pais P, Varigos J, Lisheng L, INTERHEART Study Investigators. | title=Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): Case-control study|journal=Lancet | year=2004 | pages=937–52 | issue=9438 | volume=364 | pmid=15364185 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9[/tpl] In a study of 15,000 people, waist circumference also correlated better with metabolic syndrome than BMI.[tpl]cite journal |author=Janssen I, Katzmarzyk PT, Ross R |title=Waist circumference and not body mass index explains obesity-related health risk |journal=Am.

==Body fat percentage==

Body fat percentage is total body fat expressed as a percentage of total body weight. There is no generally accepted definition of obesity based on total body fat. Most researchers have used >25% in men, and >30% in women, as cut-points to define obesity.Okorodudu et al, 2010. International Journal of Obesity (2010) 34, 791–799 However, the finding that metabolic disturbance increases with increasing body fat percentageRomero-Corral et al, 2010. European Heart Journal (2010) 31, 737–746. suggests that focusing exclusively on cut-points of body fat percent may be of limited value. 
Body fat percentage can be estimated from a person's BMI by the following formula: 
This formula takes into account the fact that body fat percentage tends to be 10 percentage points greater in women than in men for a given BMI. It recognizes that a person's percentage body fat tends to increase as they age, even if their weight and BMI remain constant. The results of this formula have been shown to have an accuracy of 4% in one group of individuals.Body mass index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-specific prediction formulas. Deurenberg P, Weststrate JA, Seidell JC. Br J Nutr, Mar 1991;65(2):105-14.
There are many other methods used to determine body fat percentage. Hydrostatic weighing, one of the most accurate methods of body fat calculation, involves weighting a person underwater. Two other simpler and less accurate methods have been used historically but are now not recommended.NICE 2006 p.36 The first is the skinfold test, in which a pinch of skin is precisely measured to determine the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer.Jebb and Wells 2005 p. 16. The other is bioelectrical impedance analysis which uses electrical resistance. Bioelectrical impedance has not been shown to provide an advantage over BMI.NICE 2006:36.
Body fat percentage measurement techniques used mainly for research include computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). These techniques provide very accurate measurements, but it can be difficult to obtain in the severely obese due to weight limits of most equipment and insufficient diameter of many CT or MRI scanners.Jebb and Wells 2005 p.20

==Childhood obesity==

The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th percentile.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm |title=Healthy Weight: Assessing Your Weight: BMI: About BMI for Children and Teens|publisher=Center for disease control and prevention|accessdate=April 6, 2009[/tpl]  The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL |title=Prevalence of overweight in US children: comparison of US growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with other reference values for body mass index |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1086–93 |date=June 2001  |pmid=11382664 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11382664[/tpl]
Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in 21st century with rising rates in both the developed and developing world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in 1980s to over 30% in 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.
As with obesity in adults many different factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important in causing the recent increase in the rate of obesity. Activities from self-propelled transport, to school physical education, and organized sports has been declining in many countries.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L |title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=892–7; discussion 897 |date=December 2005  |pmid=16306494 |pmc=1725088 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675 |url=[/tpl]  
Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood, and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, it is important that children who are obese be tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fennoy I |title=Childhood Obesity, Part 1: Weight Evaluation and Comorbidity Screening|journal=Consultant for Pediatricians |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/cholesterol/article/1145470/1403931[/tpl]
Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques. Medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group.[tpl]cite journal |author=Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, et al. |title=Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations |journal=Obes Rev |volume=7 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=7–66 |date=February 2006  |pmid=16371076 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x |url=[/tpl]
