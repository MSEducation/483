==Controversy==

Kerkut's book The Implications of Evolution pointed out some existing unsolved problems and points of concern for evolutionary studies. He referred to seven evolutionary assumptions which he felt lacked sufficient evidentiary support. Creationists have taken these points as evidence against evolution and interpreted them to support their own claims.Bruce A. Demarest, Gordon R. Lewis (1996) Fossil Groupings and Gaps p. 54 in Integrative Theology, Zondervan, ISBN 0-310-20915-3 In his book, Kerkut distinguished between the Special Theory of Evolution (often referred to as microevolution) and what he termed the General Theory of Evolution (often referred to as macroevolution, but also including abiogenesis).Bert Thompson (1985) Is Evolution a “Fact” of Science?
