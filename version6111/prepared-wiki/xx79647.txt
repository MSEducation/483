</ref> [[Kraft Foods]] developed the first commercially-available, shelf-stable, sliced, processed cheese; it was introduced in 1950. This form of sliced cheese (and its derivatives) have become ubiquitous in U.S. households ever since, most notably used for [[cheeseburgers]] and [[grilled cheese sandwiches]] (due to its ability to cook evenly, distribute/stretch smoothly, and resist [[Congelation|congealing]] — unlike natural, [[cheddar cheese]]s). [[The Laughing Cow]] is one brand of European processed cheese.

==Advantages==

Processed cheese has several technical advantages over natural cheese, including: far longer shelf-life; resistance to separating when cooked; and, a uniform look and physical behavior. Its mass-produced nature provides arguably its greatest advantage over natural cheese: a dramatically lower cost — to producers and consumers, alike — than conventional cheesemaking.  This is often due to ingredients that are more widely-varied and of simpler quality.  This, in turn, enables industrial-scale production volumes, lower distribution costs, a steadier supply, and much faster production time (compared to natural cheeses).
The use of emulsifiers in processed cheese results in a product that melts smoothly (i.e., without separating) when cooked; with prolonged heating, some natural cheeses (especially the extremely-popular-in-the-U.S., cheddar and mozzarella) will separate into a lumpy, molten protein gel & liquid fat combination. The emulsifiers (typically sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, tartrate, or citrate) reduce the tendency for tiny fat globules in the cheese, to coalesce and pool on the surface of the molten cheese.
Because processed cheese does not separate when melted, it is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. Unlike some unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste and/or texture.

==Sale and labeling==

Processed cheese is often sold in blocks, pressurized cans, and (especially in the U.S.A.,) packs of in individual slices -- often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually-wrapped by machine.  The first commercially-available, individually-wrapped, cheese slices were introduced in the U.S.A. by Clearfield Cheese Co. in 1956.  US Pat. 2759308 by Arnold Nawrocki was assigned to Clearfield Cheese Co. in 1956.

===Legal definitions===

Due to its highly mechanized (e.g., assembly line) methods of production, and additive ingredients (e.g., oils, salts, colors), some softer varieties of processed cheese cannot legally be labeled as actual "cheese" in many countries -- even those in which slightly harder varieties can be.  Such products tend to be classified "cheese food", "cheese spread", or "cheese product" (depending primarily on the amount of cheese, moisture, and milkfat present in the final product).
In the United States, processed cheese is defined, categorized, and regulated by the Food & Drug Administration under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Section 133 (Cheeses and Cheese Related Products).[ref]Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Article 133, Section 169 (Pasteurized process cheese), the allowed usage of the term "American Cheese" for certain types of "Pasteurized process cheese" is detailed.  Specifically, in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of section 133.169, it states In case it is made of cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, or granular cheese or any mixture of two or more of these, it may be designated "Pasteurized process American cheese"; or when cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these is combined with other varieties of cheese in the cheese ingredient, any of such cheeses or such mixture may be designated as "American cheese."
