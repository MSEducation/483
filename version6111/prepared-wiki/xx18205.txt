Asparagus officinalis is a spring vegetable, a flowering perennial name="prota">
</ref>
plant species in the genus Asparagus. It was once classified in the lily family, like its Allium cousins, onions and garlic, but the Liliaceae have been split and the onion-like plants are now in the family Amaryllidaceae and asparagus in the Asparagaceae. Asparagus officinalis is native to most of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia,[ref]

and is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop.

==Biology==

Asparagus is a herbaceous, perennial plant growing to [tpl]convert|100|–|150|cm[/tpl] tall, with stout stems with much-branched feathery foliage. The "leaves" are in fact needle-like cladodes (modified stems) in the axils of scale leaves; they are [tpl]convert|6|–|32|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|1|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] broad, and clustered 4–15 together.  The root system is adventitious and the root type is fasciculated.  The flowers are bell-shaped, greenish-white to yellowish, [tpl]convert|4.5|–|6.5|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with six tepals partially fused together at the base; they are produced singly or in clusters of two or three in the junctions of the branchlets. It is usually dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants, but sometimes hermaphrodite flowers are found. The fruit is a small red berry 6–10 mm diameter, which is poisonous to humans.http://www.gardengrow.co.nz/plant/Asparagus
Plants native to the western coasts of Europe (from northern Spain north to Ireland, Great Britain, and northwest Germany) are treated as Asparagus officinalis subsp. prostratus (Dumort.) Corb., distinguished by its low-growing, often prostrate stems growing to only [tpl]convert|30|–|70|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] high, and shorter cladodes [tpl]convert|2|–|18|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] long.
It is treated as a distinct species, Asparagus prostratus Dumort, by some authors.[ref]

A remarkable adaptation is the edible asparagus, while in the  Macaronesian Islands several species, (A. umbellatus, A. scoparius, etc.), are preserved the original form, a leafy vine; in the Mediterranean, the asparagus genus has evolved into thorny species.

==History==

Asparagus has been used as a vegetable and medicine, owing to its delicate flavour, diuretic properties, and more. It is pictured as an offering on an Egyptian frieze dating to 3000 BC. In ancient times, it was also known in Syria and in Spain. Greeks and Romans ate it fresh when in season, and dried the vegetable for use in winter; Romans even froze it high in the Alps, for the Feast of Epicurus. Emperor Augustus created the "Asparagus Fleet" for hauling the vegetable, and coined the expression "faster than cooking asparagus" for quick action.>Latin velocius quam asparagi conquantur (or celerius quam asparagi cocuntur), ascribed to Augustus by Suetonius (The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Book 2 (Augustus), para. 87). See List of Latin phrases (V).[/ref][ref]

</ref>
A recipe for cooking asparagus is in the oldest surviving book of recipes, Apicius’s third-century AD De re coquinaria, Book III.
The ancient Greek physician Galen (prominent among the Romans) mentioned asparagus as a beneficial herb during the second century AD, but after the Roman empire ended, asparagus drew little medieval attention.[ref]

 Apparently around 1000 AD, the word "sparagus" appeared in an English text. See Brunning (June 2010), p. 6.&nbsp;– Brunning uses the term "in print", though no printing technique was used in England at the time. In the same sentence, she states that ''peasants'' often called it "sparrow grass", and further on mentions a 1667 diary in which Samuel Pepys bought a bundle of "sparrow grass" in Fenchurch Street, London.</ref>
until al-Nafzawi's The Perfumed Garden. That piece of writing celebrates its (scientifically unconfirmed) aphrodisiacal power, a supposed virtue that the Indian Ananga Ranga attributes to "special phosphorus elements" that also counteract fatigue. By 1469, asparagus was cultivated in French monasteries. Asparagus appears to have been hardly noticed in England until 1538,
and in Germany until 1542.
The finest texture and the strongest and yet most delicate taste is in the tips.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The points d'amour ("love tips") were served as a delicacy to Madame de Pompadour.[ref]
</ref>
Asparagus became available to the New World around 1850, in the United States.

==Uses==

Only young asparagus shoots are commonly eaten: once the buds start to open ("ferning out"), the shoots quickly turn woody.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/hort/ext/pubs/ho/ho_096.pdf |title=Growing Asparagus in the Home Garden; Section on harvesting |page=2 |publisher=Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]
Water makes up 93% of Asparagus's composition.Snyder, Harry. (1908). "Human Foods and their Nutritive value". The MacMillan Company. Asparagus is low in calories and is very low in sodium. It is a good source of vitamin B6, calcium, magnesium and zinc, and a very good source of dietary fibre, protein, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, rutin, niacin, folic acid, iron, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese and selenium,[ref]

as well as chromium, a trace mineral that enhances the ability of insulin to transport glucose from the bloodstream into cells.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=In-depth biochemistry definitely needs to be sourced|date=December 2010[/tpl] The amino acid asparagine gets its name from asparagus, as the asparagus plant is relatively rich in this compound.
The shoots are prepared and served in a number of ways around the world, typically as an appetizer[ref]
Asparagus appetizer recipe[/ref]
or vegetable side dish. In Asian-style cooking, asparagus is often stir-fried.  Cantonese restaurants in the United States often serve asparagus stir-fried with chicken, shrimp, or beef. Asparagus may also be quickly grilled over charcoal or hardwood embers. It is also used as an ingredient in some stews and soups. In recent years asparagus eaten raw, as a component of a salad, has regained popularity.Salad Recipe
Asparagus can also be pickled and stored for several years. Some brands label shoots prepared this way as "marinated".
Stem thickness indicates the age of the plant, with the thicker stems coming from older plants. Older, thicker stalks can be woody, although peeling the skin at the base removes the tough layer. Peeled asparagus will however poach much faster.[ref]
</ref> The bottom portion of asparagus often contains sand and dirt, so thorough cleaning is generally advised before cooking.
Green asparagus is eaten worldwide, though the availability of imports throughout the year has made it less of a delicacy than it once was.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. ISBN 0-340-40170-2. In Europe, however, the "asparagus season is a highlight of the foodie calendar"; in the UK this traditionally begins on 23 April and ends on Midsummer Day.Oxford Times: "Time to glory in asparagus again".[ref]
British Asparagus[/ref] As in continental Europe, due to the short growing season and demand for local produce, asparagus commands a premium price.

===White asparagus in continental northwestern Europe===

Asparagus is very popular in the Netherlands, Spain, France, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, and is almost exclusively white—else, it is specified by the local language term for "green asparagus". White asparagus is the result of applying a blanching technique while the asparagus shoots are growing. Compared to green asparagus, the locally cultivated so-called "white gold" or "edible ivory" asparagus, also referred to as "the royal vegetable", is less bitter and much more tender. Freshness is very important, and the lower ends of white asparagus must be peeled before cooking or raw consumption.
To cultivate white asparagus, the shoots are covered with soil as they grow, i.e. hilling; without exposure to sunlight no photosynthesis starts, so the shoots remain white in colour.
Only seasonally on the menu, asparagus dishes are advertised outside many restaurants, usually from late April to June. For the French style, asparagus is often boiled or steamed and served with hollandaise sauce, melted butter or olive oil, Parmesan cheese or mayonnaise.[ref]
 (''Salsifis'' is French for asparagus.)</ref> Tall, narrow asparagus cooking pots allow the shoots to be steamed gently, their tips staying out of the water.
During the German Spargelsaison or Spargelzeit ("asparagus season" or "asparagus time"), the asparagus season that traditionally finishes on 24 June, roadside stands and open-air markets sell about half of the country's white asparagus consumption.[tpl]cite news|last=Evans|first=Stephen|title=Asparagus, royalty and the joys of seasonal eating|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17753372|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=2012-04-21[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Since asparagus often originates in maritime habitats, it thrives in soils that are too saline for normal weeds to grow. Thus, a little salt was traditionally used to suppress weeds in beds intended for asparagus; this has the disadvantage that the soil cannot be used for anything else. Some places are better for growing asparagus than others. The fertility of the soil is a large factor. "Crowns" are planted in winter, and the first shoots appear in spring; the first pickings or "thinnings" are known as sprue asparagus. Sprue has thin stems.[ref]
</ref>
A new breed of "Early Season Asparagus" that can be harvested two months earlier than usual was announced by a UK grower in early 2011.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8392483/New-breed-of-early-asparagus-hits-the-shelves.html|title=New breed of early asparagus hits the shelves|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=March 19, 2011|accessdate=20 March 2011[/tpl] This variety does not need to lie dormant and blooms at [tpl]Convert|7|C|F[/tpl] rather than the usual [tpl]Convert|9|C|F[/tpl].
The blanching of white asparagus is obtained by the labor intensive hilling cultivation method, to distinguish its gastronomical qualities from those of the green plant, which is the same botanical variety.
Purple asparagus differs from its green and white counterparts, having high sugar and low fiber levels. Purple asparagus was originally developed in Italy and commercialized under the variety name "Violetto d' Albenga". Since then, breeding work has continued in countries such as the United States and New Zealand.[tpl]Verify source|date=July 2007[/tpl]

===Companion planting===

Asparagus is a useful companion plant for tomatoes. The tomato plant repels the asparagus beetle, as do several other common companion plants of tomatoes. Meanwhile, asparagus may repel some harmful root nematodes that affect tomato plants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Asparagus+officinalis|title=Plants for a Future[/tpl]

==Commercial production==

The top asparagus importers (2004) were the United States (92,405 tonnes), followed by the European Union (external trade) (18,565 tonnes), and Japan (17,148 tonnes).According to Global Trade Atlas and U.S. Census Bureau statistics
China is the world's largest producer: in 2010 (6,960,357 tonnes), at a large distance followed by Peru (335,209 tonnes), and Germany (92,404 tonnes).http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#VISUALIZE_BY_DOMAIN U.S. production was concentrated in California, Michigan and Washington.[ref]
</ref><ref name=faostat>
</ref>
The annual production for white asparagus in Germany is 57,000 tonnes (61% of consumer demand).[ref]
</ref>

===Celebrations===

The green crop is significant enough in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta region that the city of Stockton holds a festival every year to celebrate it, as does the city of Hart, Michigan, complete with a parade and asparagus queen. The Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire is heralded as the largest producer within Northern Europe, celebrating like Stockton, with a week-long festival every year involving auctions of the best crop and locals dressing up as spears of asparagus as part of the British Asparagus Festival.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.british-asparagus.co.uk/asparagus_festival.php#cotswolds | title=British Aparagus Festival[/tpl]
Many German cities hold an annual Spargelfest (asparagus festival) celebrating the harvest of white asparagus. Schwetzingen claims to be the "Asparagus Capital of the World" and during its festival an Asparagus Queen is crowned. The Bavarian city of Nuremberg feasts a week long in April, with a competition to find the fastest asparagus peeler in the region. This usually involves generous amounts of the local wines and beer being consumed to aid the spectators' appreciative support.[ref]

==Vernacular names and etymology==

Asparagus officinalis is widely known simply as "asparagus", and may be confused with unrelated plant species also known as "asparagus", such as Ornithogalum pyrenaicum known as "Prussian asparagus" for its edible shoots.
The English word "asparagus" derives from classical Latin, but the plant was once known in English as sperage, from the Medieval Latin sparagus. />
This term itself derives from the Greek aspharagos or asparagos, and the Greek term originates from the Persian asparag, meaning "sprout" or "shoot". Asparagus was also corrupted in some places to "sparrow grass"; indeed, the Oxford English Dictionary quotes John Walker as having written in 1791 that "Sparrow-grass is so general that asparagus has an air of stiffness and pedantry". In Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, it is also known simply as "grass", and young plants too small to cut are called "pru".[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Another known colloquial variation of the term, most common in parts of Texas, is "aspar grass" or "asper grass".[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] In the Midwest United States and Appalachia, "spar grass" is a common colloquialism. Asparagus is commonly known in fruit retail circles as "Sparrows Guts", etymologically distinct from the old term "sparrow grass".
The Sanskrit name of Asparagus is shatavari and it has been historically used in India as a part of Ayurvedic medicines. In Kannada, it is known as ashadhi, majjigegadde or sipariberuballi.
In China it is known as lu sun (Cantonese: lo sun) 蘆筍 (simplified 芦笋), in Thailand as no mai farang ([tpl]lang-th|หน่อไม้ฝรั่ง[/tpl]), and in Vietnam as măng tây which literally mean "European bamboo shoots" and "Western bamboo shoots", respectively.  The green asparagus is commonly used in Chinese-American cuisine and Thai cuisine.
In Turkish, asparagus is known as "kuşkonmaz," literally "bird can't land," in reference to the shape of the plant. 

==Effects on urine==

The effect of eating asparagus on the urine has long been observed:

There is debate about whether all—or only some—people produce the smell, and whether all (or only some) people identify the smell. It was originally thought this was because some of the population digested asparagus differently from others, so some people excreted odorous urine after eating asparagus, and others did not. In the 1980s three studies from France,[tpl]cite journal | journal=Br J. Clin. Pharmac | title=Odorous urine in man after asparagus | author=C. RICHER1, N. DECKER2, J. BELIN3, J. L. IMBS2, J. L. MONTASTRUC3 &  J. F. GIUDICELLI |date=May 1989 | pmc=1379934 | pmid=2757887 | volume=27 | issue=5 | pages=640–1[/tpl] China and Israel published results showing that producing odorous urine from asparagus was a common human characteristic. The Israeli study found that from their 307 subjects all of those who could smell 'asparagus urine' could detect it in the urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus, even if the person who produced it could not detect it.[tpl]cite journal | journal=Br J. Clin. Pharmac | title=Asparagus and malodorous urine | author=S. C. MITCHELL |date=May 1989 | pmc=1379935 | pmid=2757888 | volume=27 | issue=5 | pages=641–2[/tpl] However, a 2010 study[tpl]cite journal|last1=Pelchat|first1=M. L.|author2=Bykowski, C., Duke, F. F., Reed, D. R. |title=Excretion and Perception of a Characteristic Odor in Urine after Asparagus Ingestion: a Psychophysical and Genetic Study |journal=Chemical Senses |year=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=9–17 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjq081 |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/09/27/chemse.bjq081.abstract |pmid=20876394 |pmc=3002398[/tpl] found variations in both production of odorous urine and the ability to detect the odour, but that these were not tightly related. It is believed most people produce the odorous compounds after eating asparagus, but only about 22% of the population have the autosomal genes required to smell them.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/story/0,,1576765,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |title=The scientific chef: asparagus pee |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=21 April 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070504232117/http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/story/0,,1576765,00.html |archivedate=4 May 2007  |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/area/skinnyon/skinnyon970115/skinny1.html |title=Why Asparagus Makes Your Pee Stink |author=Hannah Holmes |publisher=Discover.com[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |year=1980 |author=Lison M, Blondheim SH, Melmed RN. |title=A polymorphism of the ability to smell urinary metabolites of asparagus |pmid=7448566 |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6256.1676 |issue=6256 |pmc=1715705 |pages=1676–8[/tpl]
In 2010, the company 23andMe published a genome-wide association study on whether participants have "ever noticed a peculiar odor when you pee after eating asparagus?"[tpl]cite journal | journal=PLoS Genet. | title=Web-Based, Participant-Driven Studies Yield Novel Genetic Associations for Common Traits | year=2010 | url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000993 |author=Eriksson N, Macpherson JM, Tung JY, Hon LS, Naughton B, Saxonov S, Avey L, Wojcicki A, Pe'er I, Mountain J | pmid=20585627 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000993 | pmc=2891811 | editor1-last=Gibson | editor1-first=Greg | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=e1000993[/tpl]  This study pinpointed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a cluster of olfactory genes associated with the ability to detect the odor.  While this SNP did not explain all of the difference in detection between people, it provides support for the theory that there are genetic differences in  olfactory receptors that lead people to be unable to smell these odorous compounds.

===Chemistry===

Certain compounds in asparagus are metabolized to yield ammonia and various sulfur-containing degradation products, including various thiols and thioesters,[tpl]cite journal | journal=Science | volume=189 | pages=810–11 | year=1975  | author=White RH. | title=Occurrence of S-methyl thioesters in urines of humans after they have eaten asparagus | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1162354 | pmid=1162354 | doi = 10.1126/science.1162354 | issue=4205 [/tpl] which give urine a characteristic smell.
Some[tpl]cite web |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/1/9/T1.expansion.html#xref-fn-1-1 |title=Excretion and Perception of a Characteristic Odor in Urine after Asparagus Ingestion: a Psychophysical and Genetic Study |author= |date=July 26, 2010 |work= |publisher=Chemical Senses, Oxford Journals, Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl] of the volatile organic compounds responsible for the smell are:[tpl]cite journal | author = Mitchell S.C. | year = 2001 | title = Food idiosyncrasies: beetroot and asparagus | url = http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/29/4/539#SEC2 | journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 539–543 | pmid = 11259347 [/tpl]
Subjectively, the first two are the most pungent, while the last two (sulfur-oxidized) give a sweet aroma. A mixture of these compounds form a "reconstituted asparagus urine" odor.  This was first investigated in 1891 by Marceli Nencki, who attributed the smell to methanethiol. These compounds originate in the asparagus as asparagusic acid and its derivatives, as these are the only sulfur-containing compounds unique to asparagus. As these are more present in young asparagus, this accords with the observation that the smell is more pronounced after eating young asparagus. The biological mechanism for the production of these compounds is less clear.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
The onset of the asparagus urine smell is remarkably rapid. The smell has been reported to be detectable 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/43/1671_51089 | publisher=WebMD | title=Eau D'Asparagus | author=Somer, E. | date=August 14, 2000 | accessdate=31 August 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060821225214/http://www.webmd.com/content/article/43/1671_51089| archivedate= 21 August 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]Research completed and verified by Dr. R.
