Celeda (real name Victoria Sharpe) is an African-American dance music singer and drag performer born in Chicago, Illinois.  She began having hits on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart in the late 1990s, beginning with "Music Is the Answer (Dancin' & Prancin')," a collaboration with DJ and producer Danny Tenaglia that peaked at number 15 in 1998. The track reached #36 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1998.
In 1999, Celeda released a full-length album entitled This Is It on Twisted Records and on the Portuguese Kaos Records. The album featured tracks produced by E-Smoove, Danny Tenaglia, Cevin Fisher, Peter Rauhofer and Maurice Joshua among others. The tracks released as singles were "Messin' with My Mind" (1997), "Music Is the Answer (Dancin' & Prancin')" (1998), "Be Yourself (And No One Else)" and "Burnin' Up" (1999). The album also contained the dance hits "Let the Music Use You Up" and "Happy".
Since then Celeda placed four consecutive singles in the top 10, including "The Underground", which hit number one on the U.S. dance chart in 2001 (originally produced by Peter Rauhofer and remixed by Saeed & Palash). "Dirtyfilthy", a collaboration with Superchumbo, became her second chart-topper in 2004, and "Amazing" topped the dance chart in 2008.
