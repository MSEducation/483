The Phascogales (members of the eponymous genus Phascogale), also known as wambengers, are carnivorous Australian marsupials of the family Dasyuridae. There are two species: the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa) and the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura). As with a number of dasyurid species, the males live for only one year, dying after a period of frenzied mating. The term Phascogale was coined in 1824 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in reference to the brush-tailed phascogale, and means "pouched weasel".

==Life cycle==

Mating generally happens between May and July. All males die soon after mating. Females give birth to about 6 young ones about 30 days after mating. Phascogales do not have the true pouch that is found in most other marsupialshttp://www.arkive.org/brush-tailed-phascogale/phascogale-tapoatafa/http://www.marsupialsociety.org.au/keeping-marsupials-dasyurids.html.   Instead, they form temporary folds of skin - sometimes called a "pseudo-pouch" http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/24/3775.full.pdf around the mammary glands during pregnancy.  Young stay in this pseudo-pouch area, nursing for about 7 weeks before being moved to a nest where they stay until they are weaned at about 20 weeks of age. Females live for about 3 years, and generally produce one litter.
