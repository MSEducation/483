Effectively a suburb of Ramsbottom, the M66 motorway divides Shuttleworth from the main core of that town.
Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Shuttleworth is believed to derive from Sceot-hulls-worth, implying an Anglo-Saxon "dwelling-place by the Scout hills".[tpl]Harvnb|Chetham Society|1856|p=260[/tpl]. The prefix is sceotan, Old English for "shot", and the suffix -worth (also Old English) means "enclosure". During the Middle Ages, Shuttleworth lay within the township of Walmersley (sometimes called Walmersley-cum-Shuttleworth), parish of Bury, and hundred of Salford. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area became a civil parish, but in 1933  was dissolved and amalgamated into the Ramsbottom Urban District.
Shuttleworth is bounded to the south by Holcombe Brook and Summerseat; to the north by Edenfield, Irwell Vale; to the west by Holcombe and Ramsbottom and to the east by Stubbins, Turn Village and Shuttleworth-cum-Turn.
