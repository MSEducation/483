The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a compilation album by Australian alternative rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on May 11, 1998.
In order to decide the track listing, Cave asked each of the Bad Seeds, past and present, to choose their favourite tracks from the ten albumsâ€”their lists would then be discussed until a final list was produced. In the end, only guitarist and founding Bad Seed Mick Harvey bothered, and it is his listing, unchanged, that makes up The Best Of.
