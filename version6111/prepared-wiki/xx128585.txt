Privately managed, the airport is home to an active flight school (Aéroclub du Borinage), but also to other aeronautical oriented leisure activities, such as old aircraft restoration, or amateur aircraft building.
A modernization of the airport was completed in 1992, including a hard-surfacing of the single runway.
