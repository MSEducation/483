He became organist of St. Luke's in 1861, conductor of the Berlin Bach-Verein from 1862 to 1874, and Royal Music Director in 1864. He received an honorary D.Phil. from the University of Marburg in 1868. In 1870, he became teacher of theory and composition at the Stern Conservatory. In 1878 he moved to Leipzig, where he became a teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory and organist at the Thomaskirche. In 1880 he succeeded Ernst Richter as Cantor of the Thomasschule zu Leipzig and director of the Thomanerchor.
