[[Hour record]]

CATEGORIES: Track cycling, Sports world records

The hour record for bicycles is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle. There are several records. The most famous is for upright bicycles meeting the requirements of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). It is one of the most prestigious in cycling. Hour-record attempts are made in a velodrome.
The first recorded record was in 1876 when the American Frank Dodds rode [tpl]convert|26.508|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] on a penny-farthing.[tpl]cite book|last=Mallon|first=Jeroen Heijmans, Bill|title=Historical dictionary of cycling|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0810873699|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nrdfuueq2CcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] In 1972, Eddy Merckx set a record of [tpl]convert|49.431|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] that stood for 12 years.

==History==

Because of aerodynamics, the hour record has seen innovative equipment, but this has led to debate in cycling over the extent to which records should reflect only the skill, strength and stamina of the cyclist on an upright bike with drop handlebars, or whether changes in bicycle design should be accepted.
On July 7, 1933, Francis Faure set [tpl]convert|45.055|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] riding an aerodynamic recumbent bicycle, but in 1934 the UCI reversed their position and rejected recumbent bicycles. This led to two classes of record. In one, only upright bicycles are permitted; this is administered by the UCI. In the other, any design is allowed, provided the power comes from the rider; this is administered by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA).

===UCI hour record===

The hour record is usually attempted by road cyclists towards the end of their career. This is true of Miguel Indurain (Spain), Francesco Moser (Italy) and Chris Boardman (Great Britain).
Eddy Merckx said his hour record attempt was "the hardest ride I have ever done". It was set in 1972 in Mexico City at an altitude of 2,300m (7,550 ft). 
In January 1984, Moser set two records, the second being [tpl]convert|51.151|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. This was the first noted use of disc wheels, which provided aerodynamic benefit. 
In 1993 and 1994, Graeme Obree, a Scot who built his own bikes, posted two records with his hands tucked under his chest. In 1996, Boardman set a record using another position pioneered by Obree, his arms out in front in a Superman position. Both were considered controversial by the UCI, and while the records were allowed to stand, the positions were banned. Obree and Boardman made several attempts to top the previous record.
With the increasing gap between modern bicycles and what was available at the time of Merckx's record, the UCI established two records:
All records since 1972, including Boardman's [tpl]convert|56.375|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in 1996 were downgraded to Best Human Effort. In 2000, Boardman attempted the UCI record on a traditional bike, and rode [tpl]convert|49.441|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], topping Merckx by 10 m (32.8 ft) - an improvement of 0.02%.
In 2005 Ondřej Sosenka improved Boardman's performance at [tpl]convert|49.700|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] using a 54×13 gear. At 200 cm (6 ft 6¾ in) tall, Sosenka used an unusual saddle position and a small vertical frame height to stay within UCI regulations.Ondřej Sosenka has posted photographs of his record-winning bicycle and other information in Czech at http://www.sosenka.cz Sosenka failed a doping control in 2001 and then again in 2008, the latter resulting in a career ending in suspension which puts in doubt the validity of his record.
The veteran's record set by Moser in 1994 was faster than his more celebrated record in 1984, when he used a bullhorn handlebar, steel airfoil tubing, disk wheels and skinsuit. It was also faster than Obree's first record in 1993.  Had Moser ridden Obree's bike before Obree did, Moser might have held the official record at age 42.  Moser was riding before UCI rule changes were to be put in effect by May 7 of that year.  These were to out-law the Obree praying mantis style.  The bike that Boardman used for his attempt was designed by the Lotus car company using ideas from Mike Burrows. The frame was built by the South African company Aerodyne Technology near Cape Town. Boardman eventually rode to the UCI Absolute record of 56.375 km in 1996. The original branding on the frame was replaced by Eddy Merckx branding for the record attempt. Only 450 of these bikes were built. 
Moser was inspired by Obree's bike and wanted a copy.  The bike Moser rode on his veteran's record had a praying mantis handlebar and Obree-style frame.  Moser modified it with a chest pad. But if Obree hadn't broken style and tradition in the first place, this form of time-trial bike would not have been known.  However, at that same time, Boardman held the overall record.  Later that year, Obree beat both for his second hour record at low-altitude, this time in Bordeaux in France.

===IHPVA/WHPVA Hour record===

====Streamlined Human Powered Vehicles====

The IHPVA/WHPVA record led to fully faired human powered machines, typically streamlined recumbent bicycles. These feature a lower frontal area than a UCI bicycle due to their recumbent seating design of the rider. They enclose the rider and machine in aerodynamic shapes made of carbon fibre, Kevlar or fiberglass to reduce air resistance. The record hour speeds for these machines (90km/h - men's and 84km/h - women's) are faster than a UCI rider could perform in a short 200-meter sprint (72km/h) for 10 seconds, demonstrating a remarkable level of efficiency and speed.
The IHPVA was started in 1975 by Jack Lambie and California college professor, Dr. Chet Kyle, who challenged his students to build a faster bicycle.  The recumbent design (banned in 1934) and the use of additional streamlined devices (banned in 1914) were allowed back into a sanctioned competition.    
The IHPVA hour record was first set in 1979 by Olympian Ron Skarin, who went 51.31 km (31.88 mi) on a streamlined upright bicycle designed by Chet and Joyce Kyle. It was 40 years since a streamlined upright had held the record, but this record was short-lived. The following year, Ron Skarin and Eric Hollander went 74.51 km (46.30 mi) on a streamlined recumbent tandem, a 23 km increase on the previous record. The record stood for ten years, and was the last time the record would be held by a tandem. The single-rider record, however, was beaten by Eric Edwards in 1980 at 59.45 km (36.94 mi), and then by Fred Markham in 1989 at 73 km (45.36 mi). 
In 1990, Pat Kinch went 75.57 km (46.96 mi) on a streamlined recumbent, narrowly breaking the record set by Skarin and Hollander. Lars Teutenberg exceeded this in 1996, reaching 78.04 km (48.49 mi). Sam Whittingham went 79.13 km (49.17 mi) in 1998, then broke his own record in 2004 when he cycled 84.22 km (52.33 mi) on the GM/Opel test track in Dudenhofen, Germany. 
In 2006, Fred Markham, a 1976-80 US Olympic team member, set a record distance of 85.99 km (53.43 mi) on the track at the Nissan Technical Center, near Casa Grande in Arizona.Dempsey-MacCready One Hour Record Attempts, WISIL HPVers, 26 June 2006 Markham won $18,000 as a share of the $25,000 Dempsey-MacCready One Hour Prize that was to be awarded to the first HPV to surpass 90 km. Although Markham had not exceeded 90 km, the prize time limit had expired and its shares awarded to those that traveled furthest.Circles in the desert; an hpv hour record attempt, Rob English, 2 July 2006. Both Markham and Whittingham rode vehicles called Varna designed and built by the Bulgarian sculptor George Georgiev, who lives in British Columbia, Canada. Sam Whittingham won back the record one year later at the Nissan Technical Center with 86.75 km, and went on to set a distance of 90.60 km (56.30 mi) in 2009, at the Ford Michigan Proving Grounds.
In August 2011, Francesco Russo travelled 91.56 km (56.89 mi) at the Dekra Test Oval near Klettwitz, Germany. He rode the Eiviestretto bicycle, which he designed and built with earlier record-holder Damjan Zabovnik. The Eiviestretto is a backwards-ridden vehicle with the rider's head pointed in the direction of travel. The rider lies on his back, using a mirror to navigate. The design is based on Eivie III from Damjan Zabovnik, with several improvements.Eiviestretto - the World Record Speedbike, Russo Speedbike.
As of August 2009, 138 one-hour runs using aerodynamic fairings have exceeded Boardman's 56.375 km UCI record.  This list is maintained by Mike Mowett, IHPVA Records Committee. Some marks on the list are considered unofficial, but all are recorded hour distances for human powered vehicles.Fastest Human Powered Vehicle databases, recumbents.com

====Unfaired Recumbents====

This section refers to recumbent bicycles without additional aerodynamic enclosures. Amongst the various racing associations that host racing events for such bicycles, these are called Stock Recumbents or Unfaired Recumbents.
The hour record for recumbent bicycles without aerodynamic fairings, set by Francis Faure in 1933, was broken in 2007 by Sean Costin, who covered 48.80 km (28.46 mi) on the 382m outdoor concrete velodrome in Northbrook, Illinois. Costin then rode 47.89 km (29.76 mi) on the 250m indoor wooden velodrome at the ADT Event Center in California. He rode a recumbent made by the Polish manufacturer Velokraft (model name NoCom), which he converted to a fixed-gear for the indoor event. Both events were conducted by the World Recumbent Racing Association (WRRA).World Recumbent Racing Association
On October 24, 2008, Gert-Jan Wijers bettered Costin with 50.39 km (31.31 mi) on the 250m Alkmaar velodrome located near sea-level. Wijers rode a production version of the M5 carbon high-racer recumbent modified with dual disk carbon wheels and a fixed-gear freewheel. Wijers became the first unfaired recumbent rider to exceed 50 km.[tpl]cite web|title=Mission accomplished - 50,392 km in one hour!|url=http://www.m5-ligfietsen.nl/site/EN/News/Latest_news/pnCurrent:5/|work=M5 Recumbents|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66BTTs3Z7|archivedate=15 March 2012[/tpl] On May 15, 2009, 26 year old Aurélien Bonneteau set a new WRRA unfaired world record of 50.52 km (31.40 mi) in Bordeaux-Lax, France, at the Guy Lapebie indoor velodrome. Bonneteau was racing an M5 lowracer set up with single speed gearing, both front and rear wheel disks, and a very elliptical chainring.Aurélien Bonneteau - 1 Hour TT Record, World Recumbent Racing Association.
On the weekend of October 17-18, 2009, a special event called the Apeldoorn Recumbent Record Weekend was held at the Apeldoorn 250 meter indoor wooden Velodrome in the Netherlands. The Unfaired Recumbent One Hour record was broken three times in quick succession this weekend. Gert-Jan Wijers of the Netherlands set a new mark of 51.287 km (31.868 miles) on a M5 Carbon High-Racer recumbent on October 17. The next day October 18, 2009, Niels van de Wal set a new mark of 51.33 km (31.895 miles) on a M5 mid-racer recumbent called the Nadir. This was slightly lower to the ground than the high-racer version. However later in the day, Aurélien Bonneteau set a new Unfaired Recumbent One Hour record of 52.074 km (32.357 miles) this time on the M5 Carbon High-Racer recumbent. These records are recognized by the WRRA World Recumbent Racing Association. Details of the race weekend here: Recumbents Discussion forum
Barbara Buatois of France set two Ladies Unfaired Recumbent One-Hour records within two weeks in October 2009.[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl] She rode a Zockra Le Rapide recumbent. At the Apeldoorn event on October 17, 2009, she rode 46.048 km (28.613 miles), a mark which would have also broken the long-standing men's record of Francis Faure from 1933. Two weeks later, at the Velodrome du Lac in Bordeaux, France, Buatois rode 46.348 km (28.799 miles) on October 31, 2009 for another record. At the October 2011 Apeldoorn event, Janneke Sindram unofficially broke this record with a ride of 46.505 km (28.90 miles). This record is not yet verified by the WRRA. Sindram had reportedly just starting racing that year. Recumbents Discussion forum
In April 2012, Aurélien Bonneteau announced a May 2012 attempt to better his record. The attempt will take place at the 250 meter Bordeaux wooden velodrome in France, the site of Chris Boardman's and Barbara Buatois's records. Bonneteau will use a carbon fiber recumbent that he has built himself. This recumbent features two 700c-sized wheels similar to the M5 Carbon high-racer, and a single speed and an elliptical chainring. A picture of the bike was posted on a discussion forum.

====Women's Streamlined One Hour Record====

In July 2009, at the Ford Michigan Proving Grounds, Barbara Buatois set two world records in one weekend. Buatois, a 32-year-old French woman, first broke the existing women's record on Friday July 17, covering 82.12 km (51.03 mi). This broke the existing women's mark by 12%, and gave her the title of the 6th fastest human to have done the One Hour. However, her 84.02 km (52.20 mi) on late Sunday evening moved her up to the title of the 4th fastest human (man or woman) to have done the One Hour. She rode a vehicle called the Varna Tempest, designed and built by Georgi Georgiev of Canada. The Ford oval is around 8 km, with 60% of the course turns and 40% straightaways.  It had been rebuilt and repaved the year prior to these attempts. The elevation of the course is flat at 295 meters above sea level, hence this is considered a low-altitude location (
