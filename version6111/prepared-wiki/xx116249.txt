==Background==

The song was recorded in 1980 after RAK Records boss Mickie Most heard Wilde singing on a backing track for her brother Ricky Wilde. He liked her voice and image and expressed an interest to work with her.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Ricky Wilde, together with his father Marty Wilde (a 1950s/1960s rock and roll star) wrote the song "Kids in America" for Wilde to record.

===1994 version===

"Kids in America 1994" was released in May 1994 in order to help promote Wilde's compilation album The Remix Collection. Although it was intended to be released in the UK, for reasons unknown these plans were cancelled at the last minute. However, the track was released in other countries in several remixed forms using Wilde's original vocals from 1981. The "radio version" of the track was remixed by Cappella, with James Stevenson on guitar.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

==Reaction==

The song peaked at number 2 in the United Kingdom. The following year it became a Top 30 hit in the United States. In the summer of 1981, the track appeared on Wilde's self-titled debut album.
