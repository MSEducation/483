Charles Gresford Edmondes (1838–1893) was an archdeacon and college principal. 
He was born to the vicar of Cowbridge; his uncle was Charles Williams (1806–1877), who later became principal of Jesus College, Oxford; his brother, Frederick William Edmondes (1841–1918) became archdeacon of Llandaff.
From schools in Cowbridge, Edmondes went to Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first in classical moderations in 1856. After some years as Curate of Bridgend, he was, from 1865 to 1881, professor of Latin at St David's College, Lampeter (now the University of Wales, Lampeter). After vicariates at Boughrood, Radnorshire (1881), and Warren, Pembrokeshire (1882-8) he was, in 1883, made Archdeacon of St David's.
He resigned his office in 1888 to become principal of St David's College, and remained there till his health broke down in 1892. He died 18 July 1893.
He was for many years an assiduous member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association.
