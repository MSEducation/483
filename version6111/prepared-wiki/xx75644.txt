==Early life and education==

His sister Kara (1960—2011) was a television/film producer and his brother Ted Jr. (born 1961) is a lawyer. Patrick was named after his patrilineal great-grandfather, businessman/politician Patrick Joseph "P. J." Kennedy (1858—1929).
He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts in 1986, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island in 1991.[ref]

==Rhode Island House of Representatives==

Kennedy became the youngest member of the Kennedy family to hold elected office when, in 1988, he won election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives at age 21. He served two terms in the House serving District 9 in Providence, Rhode Island, choosing not to run for a third term. He was succeeded by Anastasia P. Williams.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===

From 1999 to 2001, he served as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — the Democratic Hill committee for the U.S. House. It works to elect Democrats to the U.S. House and it plays a critical role in recruiting candidates, raising funds and organizing races in districts that are expected to yield politically notable or close elections. After his tenure as Chairman of the DCCC, Kennedy became a headliner at Democratic political events and fundraisers around the country. He was a Vice-Chairman of the Native American Caucus in the House of Representatives.
From 2001 until his retirement in 2011, Kennedy served on the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations and on its U.S. House standing subcommittees.

==Political positions==

He was a chief sponsor of one of the major pieces of legislation of 2008, the Mental Health Parity Act, a bill requiring most group health plans to provide coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses that is comparable to what they provide for physical illnesses.[tpl]cite news | last=Rucker | first=Philip | title=Patrick Kennedy discusses leaving Congress after 16 years | date=12 March 2010 | publisher=The Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031102325_3.html?sid=ST2010031102370[/tpl]
He is a strong proponent of adding a comprehensive prescription-drug benefit to the U.S. Medicare and has consistently opposed attempts to privatize the Medicare program. Kennedy has also made numerous speeches advocating the reorientation of the U.S. health-care system to preventive care. He has received numerous awards for his health-care advocacy, including being named the recipient of the Lymphoma Research Foundation’s Paul E. Tsongas Memorial Award as well as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Congressional Honors Award.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

===Health care===

Kennedy is a vocal advocate for health care reform. During his career, he joined with Republican U.S. Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico in introducing legislation that places mental illness under the umbrella of health insurance.
Among the rewards received on behalf of his work include the Society for Neuroscience — Public Service Award (2002), Eli Lilly and Company 2003 Helping Move Lives Forward Reintegration Awards, American Psychoanalytic Association 2003 President’s Award, American Psychiatric Association Alliance award (2003), and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance — Paul Wellstone Mental Health Award (2003).
In a March 7, 2008, speech to the Cleveland City Club, Kennedy acknowledged having bipolar disorder and being a recovering alcoholic.  He and his siblings have legal custody of their mother, who has long struggled with alcoholism. Kennedy is co-founder of One Mind for Research, which seeks to increase resources and efficiency in brain disorder research.http://www.1mind4research.org/

==Project SAM==

Kennedy co-founded Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) in 2013 with Kevin Sabet and David Frum. SAM advocates for a "commonsense, third-way approach to marijuana policy."

==Political campaigns==

Kennedy campaigned for the seat being vacated by U.S. Representative Ronald Machtley (who was retiring) in the 1994 Rhode Island 1st congressional district election. He won the election, defeating Republican candidate Kevin Vigilante. He was one of four Democrats in the 1994 congressional elections to win a congressional seat that had just been held by a Republican, while Republicans gained dozens of seats to take over the U.S. House. He has been re-elected in each subsequent election.
He considered running against Republican Lincoln Chafee in the 2000 U.S. Senate election in Rhode Island, later won by Chafee. During the 2000 U.S. Senate recruiting phase, U.S. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, then-U.S. House Minority Leader, appointed Kennedy to the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations, a high-profile assignment that led Kennedy to pass up the U.S. Senate opportunity for 2000. He again considered running against Chafee in 2006, but did not.
Kennedy did not run for another term in 2010.[tpl]cite web|author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLzr-4MMyDc&feature=player_embedded |title=Rep.

===Rape accusation against William Kennedy Smith===

During Easter weekend in 1991, Kennedy and his father were in Palm Beach, Florida, along with Patrick's cousin, William Kennedy Smith. At Au Bar, Patrick met a 27-year-old Testas Restaurant waitress, Michelle Cassone, and Smith met another woman, Patricia Bowman. Both women returned with the Kennedys to the family's beachfront retreat, where a series of events took place that resulted in Smith being charged with raping Bowman. The prosecution alleged that the three Kennedys collaborated to cover up this alleged crime. In a widely covered trial, Smith was acquitted.[ref]"Bell, Rachael (Undated).  "William Kennedy Smith".

===Capitol Hill intoxicated-driving accident===

On May 4, 2006, Kennedy crashed his automobile into a barricade on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., at 2:45 a.m.  A Capitol Police official said the congressman had appeared intoxicated when he crashed his car, but Kennedy claimed that he was merely disoriented from prescription medications Ambien and Phenergan.[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl][ref][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl]
[/ref] Anonymous sources are alleged to have seen Kennedy drinking at the nearby Hawk & Dove bar prior to the accident.[ref][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl]

[/ref] Kennedy also stated to officers that he was "late for a vote". However, the last vote of the night had occurred almost six hours earlier. The standard field sobriety test was not administered, and Kennedy was driven home by an officer.
On May 5, 2006, Kennedy admitted that he had an addiction to prescription medication and announced he would be re-admitting himself to a drug-rehabilitation facility at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where he has sought treatment for prior addictions. He has stated that he has no recollection of the car crash. On May 8, 2006, Kennedy got a show of support when he was endorsed by the Rhode Island Democratic Party. On June 5, 2006, Kennedy was released from drug rehabilitation.[ref][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2009[/tpl]

On June 13, 2006, Kennedy made a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of prescription drugs.[ref][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2009[/tpl]
[/ref] He was sentenced to one-year probation and a fine of $350. Two of the three charges (reckless driving and failure to exhibit a driving permit) were dismissed. He was also ordered to attend a rehabilitation program that includes weekly urine tests, twice-weekly meetings with a probation officer, near-daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a weekly meeting of recovering addicts.
On Friday, June 12, 2009, Kennedy again announced that he has "checked into a medical facility for treatment". In a statement to the press, Kennedy said that his recovery is a "lifelong process" and that he will do whatever it takes to preserve his health. "I have decided to temporarily step away from my normal routine to ensure that I am being as vigilant as possible in my recovery," Kennedy said.

===Rhode Island auto accident===

In an earlier incident, on April 15, 2006, Kennedy was involved in an automobile accident with off-duty U.S. Coast Guard Warrant Officer Thomas Guthlein in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Portsmouth police did not issue a citation to either driver.[tpl]Verify source|date=August 2009[/tpl]Portsmouth Rhode Island Police Accident Report #06-157-AC (PDF format) Guthlein is quoted in the Daily News (New York City) as saying "I never really got that close to him ..... It was just a regular traffic accident".

==Political controversies==

==="Never worked"===

In 2003, Kennedy was criticized for saying "I have never worked a fucking day in my life", which his staff later claimed was a satirical reference to repeated charges of his never having worked.

===Retention of donor's money===

In 2007, the Kennedy camp stated that they would retain $6,600 in donations from Democratic fundraiser Norman Hsu, who had been convicted that year of a Ponzi scheme fraud. Kennedy is one of the few Democrats not to return or donate these contributions.[tpl]cite news |author=Staff writer| title= Arrest Warrant Issued For Fugitive Fundraiser Hsu|publisher=KTVU News|date=September 4, 2007|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/14046563/detail.html|accessdate = September 1, 2009[/tpl]

===Communion controversy===

In February 2007, Kennedy was asked to refrain from receiving Holy Communion by his Bishop, Thomas Tobin. Kennedy later said that the bishop had asked priests not to give him the sacrament "because of the positions that I’ve taken as a public official," particularly on abortion. Tobin acknowledged that he had requested Kennedy not to receive communion but not that he had asked priests to deny Kennedy the sacrament.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-22/politics/kennedy.abortion_1_catholic-bishops-bishops-support-rep-patrick-kennedy?_s=PM:POLITICS |publisher=CNN |date=November 22, 2009 |title=Bishop bars Patrick Kennedy from Communion over abortion[/tpl]

===Criticism of Senator Scott Brown===

Kennedy criticized Republican Senator Scott Brown for demanding to be sworn in as a Senator as soon as the election results from the 2010 Massachusetts special senate election were certified. "Brown's whole candidacy was shown to be a joke today when he was sworn in early in order to cast his first vote as an objection to Obama's appointment to the NLRB," [tpl]cite web|author=3:20 EDT |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Patrick-Kennedys-sour-grapes-over-Scott-Brown-83651192.html |title=Patrick Kennedy's sour grapes over Scott Brown |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] Senator Brown responded “I was elected and the votes are certified and I’m here to do my job. It’s unfortunate that he would use mean-spirited comments like that at a time when we’re just trying to solve the problems of the Commonwealth” [tpl]cite web|author=3:20 EDT |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Brown-slaps-back-at-Paddy-K-83680522.html |title=Brown slaps back at Patrick Kennedy |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]

===Troop withdrawal from Afghanistan===

On March 10, 2010, Kennedy went on a tirade over the maneuvering stratagem to the war in Afghanistan during a debate of a measure calling for the end of the war. He yelled so loudly at times about the war in Afghanistan that he went hoarse until he was finally finished with his 3 minute time limit.[tpl]cite web|last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20100310patrick_kennedy_rips_media_coverage/srvc=home&position=0 |title=Patrick Kennedy rips media coverage of war |publisher=BostonHerald.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]
He anticipated that some would object to his demand to withdraw from Afghanistan by claiming such withdrawal would dishonor those who have already fallen. His comment was, "Somewhere—I can't believe I even heard this—someone said 'Oh, I can't go to a funeral, and tell the parents of someone who just died that they lost their child in vain'. Somewhere, I heard that during the Vietnam War." After requesting an additional 30 seconds and being granted the time, Kennedy also went after the media for lack of coverage of the war, citing only two press members in the gallery at the time and "24/7" media coverage of the resignation of Eric Massa.

==Private life and family==

He resides in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Kennedy announced his engagement to sixth-grade history teacher Amy Savell (born c. 1979) (daughter of Jerryhttp://galloway.patch.com/articles/local-football-tradition-now-has-a-kennedy-connection and Leni Savell) on March 28, 2011.http://www.patrickjkennedy.net/press/2012/11/patrick-kennedy-and-jersey-girl/ Amy has a daughter, Harper Petitgout (born c. 2008), from her previous marriage to Mark Petitgout.

His father, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, died on August 25, 2009. Patrick made a tearful eulogy at the funeral, saying that "He Ted would be very proud to see you all out here today paying a final respect and tribute to his memory". He further elaborated on his experiences with his father as a child, saying his father would stay at his bedside during his frequent bouts of ill health.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/29/kennedy.funeral/index.html | work=CNN | title=As Kennedy laid to rest, a papal prayer request is revealed - CNN.com | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | date=August 30, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOB6UZHPpQg |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]

When Kennedy decided not to run for reelection in 2010, he cited his decision on the fact that his life "has taken a new direction". Mark Weiner, a major Democratic fundraiser in Rhode Island and one of Kennedy's top financial backers, said "It's tough to get up and go to work every day when your partner is not there, I think he just had a broken heart after his father passed away."[tpl]cite web|author=By 10:40 p.m., Thursday, February 11, 2010 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/11/patrick-kennedy-wont-seek-re-election/ |title=Patrick Kennedy won't seek re-election |publisher=Washington Times |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]
