CATEGORIES: Bays of Livingston Island

Moon Bay is a bay [tpl]Convert|7|nmi|km[/tpl] wide which recedes [tpl]Convert|4|nmi|km|0[/tpl] between Edinburgh Hill and Renier Point, on the east side of Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands off Antarctica. The bay was known to sealers in the area as early as 1821. It was recharted in 1935 by Discovery Investigations personnel on the Discovery II, and probably named by them for nearby Half Moon Island, which lies in the entrance to the bay.
