Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. is country music artist Dwight Yoakam's d√©but album. It was also the first of three consecutive No. 1 Billboard Country Albums for him. Three of its tracks rose into the Top 40 of the Hot Country Singles chart in 1986. Yoakam's first single was "Honky Tonk Man" peaking at No. 3 on the country charts; it was a song originally popularized by Johnny Horton in 1956. The follow-up was the title song, "Guitars, Cadillacs" at No. 4. His third single from the album was "It Won't Hurt," which only rose to No. 31. Another featured tune is "Bury Me," a duet with Maria McKee, then lead vocalist of Lone Justice.  The album was the first of more than a dozen Yoakam albums featuring his collaboration with record producer-guitarist Pete Anderson.
The album was re-issued on October 17, 2006, complete with demos from 1981 and tracks recorded live at the Roxy in 1986.
