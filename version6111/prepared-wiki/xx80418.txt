The Janghang Line is a railway line serving South Chungcheong Province in South Korea.  The line connects Cheonan (on the Gyeongbu Line) to the railway junction city of Iksan. The Janghang Line is served by frequent Saemaul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho passenger train services between Seoul and Iksan. There is also a link from Asan Station to the KTX network at Cheonan Asan Station.

==History==

The original Janghang Line opened along its full length between Cheonan and Janghang on June 1, 1922.[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=경영원칙 > 경영공시 > 영업현황 > 영업거리현황 |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl]

===Upgrade===

The entire Janghang Line is being electrified and double-tracked and upgraded for higher speeds with a straighter alignment. Work started in 1997 from Cheonan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/south-koreas-growing-network.html |title=South Korea's growing network |date=2008-09-08 |publisher=Railway Gazette International |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] By the end of 2008, the new alignment was in service from Cheonan via Asan and Hongseong to Sinseong, from Jupo to Nampo, and from Ganchi to Janghang,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/area/425930.html |title=장항선 타면 ‘곡선이 주는 여유’ 절로 |language=Korean |date=2010-06-16 |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=2010-10-19[/tpl] and electrification was put in service on the first 19.4 km between Cheonan and Sinchang, after Asan, on December 15, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epic.or.kr/cont/yearbook/download/yearbook_chap07_3.pdf |title=Electricity Almanac 2009 |publisher=Korea Electric Association |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]  The 17.1 km section near Janghang, opened in December 2007, also linked up the Janghang Line with the previously isolated Iksan-Gunsan line via a new bridge over the Geum River, with alignment built for two tracks but initially a single track laid. Currently the Sinseong-Jupo, Nampo-Ganchi and Janghang-Gunsan sections are in construction. The entire line is slated to be finished in 2018.
The Janghang Line would link up with a planned southern extension of the Daegok–Sosa–Wonsi Line before Hwayang Station. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Janghang Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h, the connecting Wonsi–Hwayang line would be set out for 250 km/h, and the lines may see KTX service.[tpl]cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925474 |title=Bullet trains coming to a town near you by 2020 |date=2010-09-02 |publisher=JoongAng Daily |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]
