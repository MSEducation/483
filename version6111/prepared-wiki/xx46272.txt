</ref> There are [[utility software|utilities]] to achieve this, such as [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]]'s Precision, [[RivaTuner]], [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] Overdrive (on [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] cards only), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm on Zotac cards, and the [[PEG Link Mode]] on [[Asus]] [[motherboard]]s. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance.<ref>[http://www.altesc.net/2013/06/15/gtx-780-overclocking/ Alt+Esc | GTX 780 Overclocking Guide]</ref>
It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts.  Two such discriminated "warning bells" are widely understood: green-flashing, random triangles appearing on the screen usually correspond to overheating problems on the GPU itself, while white, flashing dots appearing randomly (usually in groups) on the screen often mean that the card's RAM is overheating[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, clock rate, or voltage limits (If seen when not overclocked they indicate a faulty card.) If the clock speed is excessive but without overheating the artifacts are different. There is no general rule, but usually if the core is pushed too hard, black circles, or blobs appear on the screen and overclocking the video memory beyond its limits usually results in the application or the entire operating system crashing. After a reboot video settings are reset to standard values stored in the video card firmware, and the maximum clock rate of that specific card is now known.
Some overclockers apply a potentiometer to the video card to manually adjust the voltage (which invalidates the warranty).  This results in much greater flexibility, as overclocking software for graphics cards is rarely able to adjust the voltage. Excessive voltage increases may destroy the video card.

===Alternatives===

Flashing and unlocking can be used to improve performance of a video card, without technically overclocking.
Flashing refers to using the firmware of a different card with the same core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes standalone software to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. NiBiTor (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, [tpl]As of|2011|lc=on[/tpl]) have two voltage and clock rate settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with three voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to "serious" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this clock rate, reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).
Some cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's GeForce 6600GT (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab.
Unlocking refers to enabling extra pipelines or pixel shaders.  The 6800LE, the 6800GS and 6800 (AGP models only), Radeon X800 Pro VIVO were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking.  While these  models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 GPU core as a 6800GT or Ultra, but  pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become permanently unusable.  Later generations of ATI and Nvidia disable additional pipelines by irreversible laser cutting to prevent this practice.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]

==History==

Overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold overclocked version of the Intel 8088 CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the Intel 80286 CPU by replacing the clock crystal. IBM stopped this practice by modifying the BIOS to prevent overclocking.
