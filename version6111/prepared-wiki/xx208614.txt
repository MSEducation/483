The Norfolk Heritage Fleet Trust is a waterway society and charitable trust based at Hunter's Yard, Ludham on the Norfolk Broads, England, UK. The Trust maintains and hires out a fleet of wooden sailing yachts from the 1930s.
Hunter's Yard is situated in its own dyke off Womack Water on the Norfolk Broads in which the two original boat sheds (the first being built in 1932 and the second in 1935) are mostly as they were built in the 1930s, from timber in the traditional Broads' style, with many of its original features intact and numerous pieces of equipment, tools and boat fittings on view to the public.http://www.huntersyard.co.uk/75_years_of_the_yard.html

==History==

Hunter's Yard was operational until 1968 when it was sold to the Norfolk County Council and was renamed Norfolk County Sailing Base. The Council maintained the traditions of the Yard, however its main aim was to encourage young people to sail and experience the Yachts and discounts were offered to schools. In 1995 the Council decided to sell the Yard and it’s Fleet as part of an economy measure.http://www.huntersyard.co.uk/75_years_of_the_yard.html Subsequently a fundraising effort was carried out to retain the yard which raised £100,000 from public sources and £200,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.http://www.huntersyard.co.uk/pdf/2011-Hunters-Yard-Brochure.pdf In 1996 the Norfolk Heritage Fleet Trust was established and took over the yard, continuing to encourage young people to use and sail on the Yachts,http://www.angliaafloat.co.uk/heritage/waterway-history/historic_plans_for_hunter_s_yard_in_ludham_1_1093165 as well as hiring them out for public use.
