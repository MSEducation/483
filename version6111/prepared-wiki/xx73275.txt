[[Classes of United States Senators]]

CATEGORIES: United States Senators

The three classes of United States Senators are made up of 33 or 34 Senate seats each. The purpose of the classes is to determine which Senate seats will be up for election in a given year. The three groups are staggered so that one of them is up for election every two years. 
A senator's description as junior or senior senator is not related to his or her class. Rather, a state's senior senator is the one with the greater seniority in the Senate. This is mostly based on length of service.

==Historical division==

When the Founding Fathers agreed to give six-year terms to Senators, they also decided to stagger the elections, so that a third of the Senate was up for election every two years. With this staggered turnover, the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure stability in the Senate, and encourage Senators to deliberate measures over time, rather than risk a rapid turnover of the entire chamber every six years. At the same time, they wanted more frequent elections, as opposed to waiting every six years, to prevent Senators from permanently combining for "sinister purposes".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Constitution_Senate.htm | title=The Senate and the United States Constitution | publisher=senate.gov | accessdate=2011-10-23[/tpl]
The three classes of the Senate were then specified by Article I, Section 3 of the U. S. Constitution:
This was achieved in May 1789, several weeks after the first Senate assembled.  The Senate first divided the members into three classes, on May 14.[tpl]cite web|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28sj00143%29%29 |work=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789-1793 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |date=May 14, 1789[/tpl]

On the following day, May 15, the term expiration of each class was determined by drawing lots.[tpl]cite web|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28sj00144%29%29 |work=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789-1793 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |date=May 15, 1789[/tpl]

Upon the expiration of a senator's term of any length, someone starts a new six-year term as senator (based on election by the state legislatures until the Seventeenth Amendment required direct popular election of Senators).
