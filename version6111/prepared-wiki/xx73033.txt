==Political career==

===Militant tendency===

Sheridan became a member of the Militant tendency while a student at Stirling University around 1983 after being active in a broad-based anti-Trotskyist group including Liberals and Communists as well as Labour Party members. After graduating he went to Cardonald College as a typing student as part of an (unsuccessful) effort on the part of Militant to recruit Scottish Labour Students in further-education colleges. The Labour Party, then led by Neil Kinnock, found that Militant contravened the Labour Party constitution, and Sheridan himself was expelled from the Labour Party in 1989 for "bringing the party into disrepute".
From within Militant, he was the public face of a mass non-payment campaign against the Community Charge in Scotland (where it was introduced a year earlier than other parts of Great Britain). The campaign involving the refusal to pay the tax, together with resistance to warrant sales which local councils held to try to recoup the money, was ultimately successful and Sheridan became a popular political figure. Sheridan denounced those who fought the police in the large-scale riot against the poll tax in London – which took place on 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was introduced in England and Wales – and publicly threatened to "name names". The police widely advertised for people to tell them the names of alleged rioters, and partly as a result of police acting on such information, over 100 individuals were jailed.  With Joan McAlpine, he published A Time to Rage which chronicled the anti-poll tax movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s. McAlpine has since written about the Sheridan she became close to during that turbulent youthful period, with reference in particular to the libel case.
As the highest profile Militant member in Scotland, Sheridan was a leading figure in the group's split in the early 1990s. Emboldened by the success of the campaign against the poll tax; many Militant members – particularly in Scotland – argued for the abandonment of entryism and for the creation of Scottish Militant Labour and Militant Labour in England and Wales as separate political parties.
The argument was resolved when Sheridan and his supporters won a vote at a special conference held in Bridlington in October 1991, defeating the faction around Militant founder Ted Grant who argued against abandoning the Labour Party. The result was a split in the Militant in what has become known as the 'Scottish Turn'; Scottish Militant Labour had gained six councillors in Glasgow by 1993, including Sheridan. With a strong Scottish National Party (SNP), Scottish Militant Labour argued in favour of founding a new, left-wing political party. Discussions were held with other left-wing and Scottish republican groups and a new group was formed in 1996 known initially as the Scottish Socialist Alliance. In 1998, the new Scottish Socialist Party was formed from the SSA. Differences over political strategy and priorities within the CWI soon surfaced, especially on the issue of Scottish independence, leading to a split within the CWI and Sheridan along with the majority of Scottish supporters left the organisation.
Sheridan fought two elections while in prison, coming second in the Pollok constituency at the 1992 General Election, gaining nearly 20%, a result ahead of three candidates, but behind the elected Labour Party MP. A few weeks later he won the Pollok ward on Glasgow City Council. He contested the European Parliament election in 1994 as the SML candidate in Glasgow, and came third with 8% of votes cast.

===Scottish Socialist Party===

Sheridan was a leading figure in the negotiations to establish the Scottish Socialist Alliance in 1996, which evolved into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998. He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow representative and re-elected in 2003. Together with Alan McCombes he published Imagine, an outline of the principles of socialism for a modern era.
He was the convenor of the SSP from its formation until 11 November 2004, when he resigned, citing as a prime reason his wife Gail expecting their first child.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4001489.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Sheridan resigns as SSP leader | date=11 November 2004 | accessdate=14 July 2006 [/tpl] The resignation was steeped in controversy. After his announcement that he was stepping down for family reasons, the News of the World ran a series of articles, among other allegations claiming that he had had an extramarital affair. Sheridan strenuously denied the accusations and quickly announced his intention to sue.
The minutes of the meeting which detailed the deliberations leading to Sheridan's resignation were kept confidential until subpoenaed by News International. Alan McCombes was ordered to appear before judge Lady Smith at the Court of Session, Edinburgh, when he refused to release the minutes. He was jailed for 12 days, at which point the party agreed to hand over the minutes as part of the subsequent court case and were then made public. The minutes included a discussion about a recent article in the News of the World which alleged that a married MSP had visited a swingers' club in Manchester, and also the admission by Sheridan "that he had in fact visited the club on two occasions, in 1996 and 2002 with close friends. Some of those present at the meeting were later cited as witnesses for News International, to give evidence that they had heard Sheridan acknowledge he had been "reckless" in his behaviour which had, with hindsight, been "a mistake" and that "his strategy was to deny the allegations". Others present, notably Rosemary Byrne MSP, gave evidence that Sheridan had made no such statement. The minutes recorded that Sheridan left the meeting early, but before leaving, according to the minute, "he repeated that he did not believe there was any evidence which would prove him to be lying. He did not accept that he should admit the visits to the club and felt that no-one should comment on private lives". Sheridan claimed in court that the minute was not accurate and that he had denied visiting the swingers' club. Sheridan would later (December 2010) be convicted of perjury for lying during this court case.
At the annual conference of the SSP in early 2005 Sheridan was elected to the SSP executive and at the March 2006 conference he was elected as party co-chair. However Sheridan announced that he was leaving the SSP in August 2006, after his prominent court-case victory, accusing the SSP of being part of "the mother of all stitch ups" involving not only their leadership, but also MI5 and News International.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1886865,00.html | title=Sheridan accuses MI5 and Murdoch over 'mother of stitch-ups' | author=Severin Carrell | date=4 October 2006 | work=The Guardian | accessdate=4 May 2007 | location=London[/tpl]

===Solidarity (Scotland)===

In September 2006 Tommy Sheridan announced the formation of  a new political party in Scotland named Solidarity, with himself and fellow MSP Rosemary Byrne as joint convenors.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5307316.stm | title=Sheridan unveils Solidarity party | date=3 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl] Sheridan narrowly failed to be re-elected in the 2007 Holyrood election as top of his party's list nominees for Glasgow. The party also stood a candidate in by-elections in 2008 in Glasgow East and the Glenrothes, and Sheridan himself stood in the Glasgow North East by-election, 2009.
Sheridan stood as a candidate in the 2009 European Parliament elections for No to EU – Yes to Democracy, a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition led by RMT union leader Bob Crow.Mark Smith "Exclusive: Tommy Sheridan to stand for Euro elections", Daily Record, 10 March 2009"No To EU – RMT launches election campaign", Socialist Worker, 24 March 2009

==Defamation action==

Hearings in Sheridan's defamation case against the publishers of the News of the World began in the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 4 July 2006.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5143460.stm | title=Sheridan starts defamation action | date=4 July 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl]  Unusually in Scottish civil proceedings, the case was heard before a jury.
The jury heard allegations that Sheridan had visited a swingers clubs in Manchester and engaged in adulterous affairs with two women.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5150246.stm | title=Call girl claims Sheridan affair | date=5 July 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl] Sheridan, who claims to be a teetotaller, reportedly drank champagne and consumed cocaine during an extramarital liaison.[tpl]cite web | url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=983512006 | title=Sheridan had an affair with former prostitute, journalist tells court | author=John Robertson | date=6 July 2006 | work=The Scotsman | accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl] Sheridan denies drinking the champagne and the claim of substance abuse.

On 14 July 2006, Sheridan sacked his legal team and announced that he would represent himself following controversy over the source of a question over credit card fraud addressed to one of the witnesses.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5179718.stm | title=Legal counsel sacked by Sheridan | date=14 July 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007 [/tpl]
On 4 August 2006, Sheridan won his case with a majority verdict of 7–4 and the jury awarded him maximum damages of £200,000.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5246378.stm | title=Sheridan victory in court battle | date=4 August 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007 [/tpl] The News of the World has appealed the verdict. In the Scottish Socialist Voice of 8 August, a letter signed by a further six leading members of the SSP claimed that Sheridan had told them that he had admitted at an SSP Executive meeting to attending the Manchester swingers club.
The News of the World announced its intention to appeal what they described as the "perverse" decision in the immediate aftermath of the trial, and a provisional date for the hearing was set for December 2007, however it was postponed until the procurator fiscal announced the outcome of the perjury probe.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6358371.stm | title=Newspaper's Tommy appeal date set | date=13 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007 [/tpl]

===Allegations of witness intimidation===

On 10 October 2006, BBC News reported that Grampian Police were investigating a claim by Fiona McGuire, who had been a witness in the trial for the News of the World, that she had received a death threat through the post. In a statement to the BBC, Sheridan said: "I utterly condemn any threats to Fiona McGuire or any other individual".[ref][tpl]cite news | title = Sheridan witness 'threat' inquiry | publisher = BBC News | date = 10 October 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6036271.stm[/tpl]

On 26 August 2007, the Sunday Herald reported that John Lynn had been questioned by detectives about allegations of witness tampering. Lynn is reportedly an associate of Paul Ferris, a reformed criminal who has become friendly with Sheridan. The report said Helen Allison, who claimed in court that she saw Sheridan having sex in a Glasgow hotel, had been approached by Lynn who asked her not to give evidence. Lynn was once jailed for 17 years for shooting an Ulster barman.[ref][tpl]cite news | title = Sheridan case police quiz ex-gunman | work = Sunday Herald | date = 26 August 2006 | url = http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1644235.0.sheridan_case_police_quiz_exgunman.php[/tpl]

===Hidden video===

On 1 October 2006, the News of the World reignited controversy by publishing new evidence in support of its claim that Sheridan lied to the Court of Session. It was a video recording of Sheridan admitting he had visited a swingers club in Manchester on two occasions and further, that he had, as other senior SSP members claimed in court, admitted this at an Executive meeting of the SSP. The tape had been made without Sheridan's knowledge using a hidden camera by SSP member George McNeillage in McNeillage's house after he invited Sheridan there. McNeillage had been one of three best men at Sheridan's wedding.
Tommy Sheridan does not appear on the video at any time. The newspaper has not been able to produce any images from the video showing Sheridan's face and Sheridan says the video is a fake. He conceded his voice was on the tape but suggested it was "spliced" with clips of the voice of someone else.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1467102006 | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman[/tpl] The News of the World claimed four independent voice analysts had confirmed that the voice on the tape is that of Tommy Sheridan.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5396828.stm | title=Sheridan rubbishes video claims | date=10 January 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2 October 2006[/tpl] However, in an interview with the BBC a forensic speech scientist, Peter French, said: "Experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5402832.stm | title=How accurate is voice identification? | date=4 October 2006 | work=BBC News Magazine | accessdate=4 May 2007 [/tpl]
Sheridan then suggested that MI5, someone within the SSP and Rupert Murdoch had conspired to concoct the videotape to undermine his campaign for an independent socialist Scotland.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1467102006 | title=Sheridan claims to be 'victim of MI5 plot' | author=Louise Gray | date=4 October 2006 | work=The Scotsman | accessdate=4 May 2007 | location=Edinburgh[/tpl]

===Perjury conviction===

The conflicting evidence given during the trial resulted in the judge warning several witnesses about the implications of perjuring themselves. On Monday 7 August 2006, Lothian and Borders Police said they had received two complaints of perjury, one from the former Conservative MSP Brian Monteith,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legalprospects.com/cgi-bin/directnews_view_article.cgi?article_id=17442813&channel_page_code=LEGSEC |title=Official perjury complaint lodged following Sheridan libel victory |publisher=Legalprospects.com |accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl] the other alleged to be from the SSP's minutes secretary.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5253328.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=SSP chiefs at war with Sheridan | date=7 August 2006 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]
On 22 August 2006, the Crown Office announced it had instructed the Edinburgh Procurators Fiscal office to ascertain if there were grounds for a criminal investigation. On 2 October 2006, it was concluded that there were and Lothian and Borders Police were instructed to start a criminal investigation.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400298.stm | title=Perjury probe over Sheridan trial | date=2 October 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl] On 21 February 2007, The Herald reported that the Crown Office had asked Lothian and Borders Police to undertake a full inquiry after receiving a preliminary report.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1206609.0.0.php | title=Sheridan perjury investigators given go-ahead for full inquiry | author=Tom Gordon | date=21 February 2007 | work=The Herald | accessdate=4 May 2007 [/tpl]
In May 2007, it was reported that staff at Cupid's Swingers Club in Manchester had told police they had been offered bribes not to co-operate with the inquiry.Paul Hutcheon "Police investigate ‘bribery’ allegation in Sheridan case", Sunday Herald, c.18 March 2007. Retrieved 3 August 2007.
On 16 December 2007, Sheridan was charged with perjury in relation to the News of the World case.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7146907.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Sheridan charged in perjury probe | date=16 December 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl] In a public statement outside the police station he attributed his arrest to the "powerful reach" of the Murdoch press. During February 2008, his wife Gail, former SSP MSP Rosemary Byrne, former members of the SSP Executive Committee, Patricia Smith, Graeme McIver, Jock Penman, and Sheridan's father-in-law, Angus Healey were also charged with perjury.
On 27 January 2009, Sheridan and his wife were indicted for perjury, and were summoned to attend a pre-trial hearing at Edinburgh High Court on 26 February.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2484960.0.Tommy_and_Gail_Sheridan_indicted_on_perjury_charge.php | title=Tommy and Gail Sheridan indicted on perjury charge | work=The Herald [/tpl] however this was postponed until 11 May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefirmmagazine.com/news/1326/Sheridan_trial_postponed_for_three_months.html| title=Sheridan trial postponed for three months | work="The Firm" | accessdate=13 February 2009[/tpl]
This trial started at Glasgow High Court on 4 October 2010.  Sheridan's initial defence team included Donald Findlay, who was replaced by Maggie Scott.[tpl]cite web | url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Sheridan-axes-top-lawyer-.5678971.jp  / | title=Sheridan axes top lawyer in run-up to perjury trial[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/sheridan-drops-qc-findlay-as-perjury-trial-nears-1.922019 / | title=Sheridan drops QC Findlay as perjury trial nears[/tpl] However, a few weeks into the case, Sheridan instructed his Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who has defended him since 2007, to withdraw Scott's instructions. He then conducted his own defence, with Anwar assisting him as amicus curiae.
On 23 December 2010 a jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury and on 26 January 2011 he was sentenced to 3 years in prison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/223183-tommy-sheridan-jailed-for/ |title=STV 26 January |publisher=News.stv.tv |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl]

====Support for Sheridan====

On 17 December 2007, Sunday Herald columnist Iain MacWhirter questioned the investigation saying "it is hard not to conclude that the police's diligence has been inspired by Rupert Murdoch's News International."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/17/thekingoftheswingers|title=The king of the swingers?|author=MacWhirter, Iain|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2007[/tpl]
A campaign by Sheridan's supporters, 'Defend Tommy Sheridan' was launched, calling for answers into the nature of this investigation and the reasons behind it.  The campaign has received widespread support and funding from individuals, political campaigners and civil rights activists, including high-profile left-wing politician George Galloway MP: John McManus, head of MOJO, the organisation which campaigns against miscarriages of justice: The Royle Family actor and left-wing political campaigner Ricky Tomlinson: Paddy Hill of the Birmingham Six: Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four: Singers Paul Heaton (Beautiful South) and Edwyn Collins. Leading trade unionists Bob Crow (RMT), Janice Godrich (PCS), Kenny Ross (FBU) all support the campaign.
On 21 February 2008, The Daily Telegraph columnist Alan Cochrane questioned the treatment of the Sheridans by the police and claimed that his view was shared by "Senior members of Scotland's legal fraternity, including some with the closest of links to the Scottish Executive".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/alancochrane/3555267/Dark-days-for-Tommy-Sheridan---and-justice.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Dark days for Tommy Sheridan – and justice | first=Alan | last=Cochrane | date=21 February 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]
In June 2008 a rally organise by the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, heard speeches from Fire Brigades Union Secretary Kenny Ross, Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six, and Gerry Conlon (Guildford Four), the later two were both wrongly convicted and imprisoned. The speakers queried the motives for the investigation, questioned the role of the police and Crown Office and verbally attacked the witnesses who had given evidence unhelpful to Sheridan in the original hearing.
On 11 February 2009, Scottish law magazine The Firm claimed that Police had put "incredible pressure" on the Crown Office to proceed with a case against Gail and Tommy Sheridan. Lothian and Borders Police and the Crown Office deny the claims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefirmmagazine.com |title=The Firm : Scotland'S Independent Law Journal |publisher=Thefirmmagazine.com |accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl]

===Claims of illegal surveillance===

In March 2007, Lothian and Borders Police investigated claims that Tommy Sheridan had been bugged after a suspicious device was found in his car.
