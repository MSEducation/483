Woody Allen (born Allan Stewart Konigsberg, December 1, 1935) is an actor, director, screenwriter, comedian, musician and playwright whose career spans more than 50 years.
He worked as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comic, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comic, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality.Gross, Terry (2009–12).

By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s. He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late '70s.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/13/woody-allen-michael-newton |title=Woody Allen: cinema's great experimentalist |author=Newton, Michael |date=January 13, 2012 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |quote=In the 1970s, Allen looked irreverent, hip, a part of the New Hollywood generation.

Some best-known of his over 40 films are Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and Midnight in Paris (2011). Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as "a treasure of the cinema."[tpl]cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110524/REVIEWS/110529987 |title=Midnight in Paris :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= May 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 20, 2011[/tpl]
Allen has been nominated 24 times and won four Academy Awards: three for Best Original Screenplay and one for Best Director (Annie Hall). He has more screenwriting Academy Award nominations than any other writer. He has won nine British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards. Allen performs regularly as a jazz clarinetist at small venues in Manhattan.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/an-evening-with-woody-20090617-ch8w.html | title=An evening with Woody | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=June 20, 2009 | accessdate=October 23, 2012 | author=Kelly, Nathan[/tpl] In 2011, PBS televised the film biography, Woody Allen: A Documentary, on the American Masters TV series.

To raise money he wrote jokes (or "gags") for agent David O. Alber, who sold them to newspaper columnists.

==Career==

===Writer and comedian===

He was hired as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week. At 19, he began writing scripts for The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, specials for Sid Caesar post-Caesar's Hour (1954–1957), and other television shows.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/+IMDb+profile |title=IMDb: Woody Allen |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl][tpl]sup|p.111[/tpl] By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week; with Caesar, he worked alongside Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702568_pf.html |title=TV Comedy Writer Danny Simon Dies |work=The Washington Post |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl]
In 1961, he began working as a comedian, debuting in a Greenwich Village club, the Duplex. He released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled Woody Allen (Colpix 518; 1964), Volume 2 (Colpix 488, 1965), and The Third Woody Allen Album (Capitol 2986; 1968) recorded at a fund-raiser for Eugene McCarthy's presidential run. The material from these albums was edited and abridged into the 2-LP compilation albums Standup Comic and Nightclub Years 1964–1968 (also on CD), including his "The Moose" routine, co-written with Mickey Rose.Michael Barrie "Mickey Rose (1935–2013)", The Huffington Post, April 15, 2013 Together with his managers, Allen developed a neurotic, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up routine, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television. Allen brought innovation to the comedy monologue genre and his stand-up comedy is considered influential.[tpl]cite journal| title=Man on the moon, interview with comedian Daniele Luttazzi | first=Andrea |last= Scanzi | publisher= Il Mucchio Selvaggio | year= 2002 | language= Italian[/tpl]

===Playwright===

He became a successful Broadway playwright and wrote Don't Drink the Water in 1966. The play starred Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring Jackie Gleason. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.
The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was Play It Again, Sam, in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts. Allen, Keaton and Roberts would reprise their roles in the film version of the play, directed by Herbert Ross. For its March 21 issue, Life featured Allen on its cover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2neatmagazines.com/life/1969cover.html |title=1969 LIFE Magazine Cover Art |accessdate=January 25, 2010[/tpl] In 1981, his play The Floating Light Bulb premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it was notable for giving an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including 'Riverside Drive' and 'Old Saybrook' exploring well-known Allen themes.
On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play Honeymoon Motel opened as part of a larger piece entitled Relatively Speaking on Broadway, with two other one-acts by Ethan Coen and Elaine May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.relativelyspeakingbroadway.com |title=Official Website[/tpl]

===Early films===

His first movie was the Charles K. Feldman production What's New Pussycat? in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay.[tpl]cite video |people=Weide, Robert B. (Director) |title=Woody Allen: A Documentary |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/woody-allen-a-documentary/about-the-film/1865/ " |medium=Television |language=English |publisher=PBS, November 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2012[/tpl] He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film that he would later write. Allen's first directorial effort was What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie – Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys" – was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof Casino Royale.
Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) Take the Money and Run in 1969, which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with United Artists to produce several films. Those films eventually became Bananas (1971, co-written with Rose), Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (1972), Sleeper (1973), and Love and Death (1975). Sleeper was the first of four films where the screenplay was co-written by Allen and Marshall Brickman.
In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the film version of Play It Again, Sam, directed by Herbert Ross and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred in The Front (directed by Martin Ritt), a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood blacklisting during the 1950s.
Then came two of Allen's most popular films. Annie Hall won four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Diane Keaton, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director for Woody Allen. Annie Hall set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes worn by Diane Keaton in the film. While in production, the working title was "Anhedonia", a term that means the inability to feel pleasure and the plot revolved around a murder mystery. Allen re-cut the movie after production ended to focus on the romantic comedy between Allen's character, Alvy Singer, and Keaton's character, Annie Hall. The new version, retitled Annie Hall (named after Keaton, Hall being her original last name and Annie a nickname), deals with the inability to feel pleasure. The film is ranked at No. 35 on the American Film Institute[tpl]'s[/tpl] "100 Best Movies" and at No. 4 on the AFI list of "100 Best Comedies."
Manhattan, released in 1979, is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the protagonists are upper-middle class academics. The love-hate opinion of cerebral persons found in Manhattan is characteristic of many of Allen's movies, including Crimes and Misdemeanors and Annie Hall. Manhattan focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and a 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway).
Between Annie Hall and Manhattan, Allen wrote and directed the dark drama Interiors (1978), in the style of the late Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, one of Allen's chief influences. Interiors represented a departure from Allen's "early, funny" comedies (a line from 1980's Stardust Memories).

===1980s===

Allen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with their influences being the works of European directors, specifically Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. Stardust Memories was based on 8½, which it parodies, and Wild Strawberries. A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy was adapted from Smiles of a Summer Night. In Hannah and Her Sisters, part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from Fanny and Alexander. Amarcord inspired Radio Days. September resembles Autumn Sonata. Allen uses many elements from Wild Strawberries. In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen references a scene from Wild Strawberries.
A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy was the first of 13 movies Allen made starring Mia Farrow, who stepped into Diane Keaton's role when Keaton was shooting Reds.
Stardust Memories features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states, "I don't want to make funny movies any more" and a running gag has various people (including visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, "especially the early, funny ones."[tpl]cite web |url=http://triviana.com/film/sfilm/stmem.htm |title=Stardust Memories review |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl] Allen believes this to be one of his best films.[tpl]cite news |author= Kamp, David |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Kamp-t.html |title= Woody Talks |work=The New York Times |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2010[/tpl]
Allen combined tragic and comic elements in such films as Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors, in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He produced a vividly idiosyncratic tragi-comical parody of documentary, Zelig.
He made three films about show business: Broadway Danny Rose, in which he plays a New York show business agent, The Purple Rose of Cairo, a movie that shows the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, and Radio Days, a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The Purple Rose of Cairo was named by Time as one of the 100 best films of all time and Allen described it as one of his three best films, along with Stardust Memories and Match Point. (Allen defines them as "best" not in terms of quality but because they came closest to his vision.)
In 1989, Allen teamed with directors Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese to make New York Stories, an anthology film about New Yorkers. Allen's short, Oedipus Wrecks, is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. His short pleased critics, but New York Stories bombed at the box office.

===1990s===

His 1992 film Shadows and Fog is a black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and features the music of Kurt Weill. Allen then made his critically acclaimed drama Husbands and Wives (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.
He returned to lighter movies like Bullets Over Broadway (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, Everyone Says I Love You (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in Everyone Says I Love You are similar to musicals starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The comedy Mighty Aphrodite (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an Academy Award for Mira Sorvino. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama Sweet and Lowdown was nominated for two Academy Awards for Sean Penn (Best Actor) and Samantha Morton (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire towards the end of the decade with Deconstructing Harry (1997) and Celebrity (1998).
Allen made one sitcom "appearance" to date (2009) via telephone on the show Just Shoot Me! in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody" which paid tribute to several of his films. Allen provided the lead voice in the 1998 animated film Antz, which featured many actors he had worked with and Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.

===2000s===

Small Time Crooks (2000) is similar to the 1942 film Larceny, Inc. (from a play by S.J. Perelman).Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies on June 15, 2006 Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it.  Small Time Crooks was Allen's first film with the DreamWorks studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (with a budget of $26 million). Hollywood Ending, Anything Else, and Melinda and Melinda were given "rotten" ratings from film-review website Rotten Tomatoes and each earned less than $4 million domestically.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen |title=Woody Allen – Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl] Some critics claimed that Allen's films since 1999's Sweet and Lowdown were subpar and expressed concern that Allen's best years were now behind him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qwipster.net/melindamelinda.htm |title=Melinda and Melinda review (2004) Woody Allen – Qwipster's Movie Reviews |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl] Others have been less harsh; reviewing the little-liked Melinda and Melinda, Roger Ebert wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LtJgv-f-nl8C&pg=PA451&lpg=PA451&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007|publisher=Google Books |date= November 1, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2011|isbn=978-0-7407-6157-7[/tpl] Woody gave his godson Quincy Rose a small part in Melinda and Melinda.

It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In Match Point, Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. It earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&id=woodallen.html |title=Box Office Mojo – People Index |accessdate=January 17, 2008[/tpl] Match Point earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing – Original Screenplay with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987.

Allen returned to London to film Scoop, which also starred Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Kevin McNally and Allen himself. The film was released on July 28, 2006, and received mixed reviews. He filmed Cassandra's Dream in London. Cassandra's Dream was released in November 2007, and stars Colin Farrell, Ewan McGregor and Tom Wilkinson.
After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain. He reached an agreement to film Vicky Cristina Barcelona in Avilés, Barcelona and Oviedo, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Penélope Cruz.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249259,00.html |title= Woody Allen's Next Star: Penelope Cruz – Celebrity Gossip |publisher=FOX News |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |date=February 1, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117935397 |title=Spain woos Woody | work = Variety |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |first=John |last=Hopewell |date=January 2, 2006[/tpl] Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: "I'm delighted at being able to work with Mediapro and make a film in Spain, a country which has become so special to me." Vicky Cristina Barcelona was well received, winning Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe awards. Penélope Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.
Allen has said that he "survives" on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his films, particularly in Spain, France and Italy – countries where he has a large audience (joked about in Hollywood Ending). "In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films – if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million."[tpl]cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1278451,00.html |title=Why I love London |first=Simon |last=Garfield |date= August 8, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=January 17, 2008 [/tpl]

===Future projects===

For many years, Allen wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The film, tentatively titled American Blues, would follow the vastly different careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the film would cost between $80 and $100 million and is therefore unlikely to be made.Lax, Eric. Conversations with Woody Allen. Alfred A. Knopf. 2007. pp. 315–316 ISBN 1-4000-3149-4.
It was announced in February 2012 that Allen would adapt Bullets Over Broadway into a Broadway musical scheduled to open in 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/allen-taking-bullets-over-broadway-to-broadway/|title='Bullets Over Broadway' Is Heading There|last=Healy|first=Patrick|date=February 23, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2012[/tpl]

==Theatre==

While best known for his films, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theater, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue From A to Z. His first great success was Don't Drink the Water, which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with Play It Again, Sam, which opened in 1969, starring Allen and Diane Keaton. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three Tony Awards, although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.[tpl]cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010[/tpl]
In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably God and Death, which were published in his 1975 collection Without Feathers.
In 1981, Allen's play The Floating Light Bulb opened on Broadway. The play was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two Tony Award nominations, a Tony win for the acting of Brian Backer (who won the 1981 Theater World Award and a Drama Desk Award for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.[tpl]cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010[/tpl]
After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theater in 1995, with the one-act Central Park West, an installment in an evening of theater known as Death Defying Acts that was also made up of new work by David Mamet and Elaine May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune – David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010[/tpl]

==Personal life==

===Marriages and romantic relationships===

Allen has had three wives: Harlene Rosen (1954–1959), Louise Lasser (1966–1970) and Soon-Yi Previn (1997–present). Though he had a 12-year romantic relationship with actress Mia Farrow, the two never married. Allen also had romantic relationships with Stacey Nelkin and Diane Keaton.

====Harlene Rosen====

At age 19, Allen married 16-year-old Harlene Rosen.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-3,00.html |title=Woody Allen: Rabbit Running |work=Time |page=3 |date=July 3, 1972 |accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl] The marriage lasted from 1954 to 1959. Time stated that the years were "nettling" and "unsettling."
Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as "the Dread Mrs. Allen", sued him for defamation due to comments at a TV appearance shortly after their divorce. Allen tells a different story on his mid-1960s standup album Standup Comic. In his act, Allen said that Rosen sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been sexually assaulted outside her apartment and according to Allen, the newspapers reported that she "had been violated".  In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a moving violation." In an interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Allen brought up the incident again where he repeated his comments and stated that the sum for which he was sued was "$1 million."[tpl]cite web|title=Dick & Woody discuss particle physics|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=9xq5Nh2UqCc#t=309|accessdate=November 18, 2013[/tpl]

====Louise Lasser====

Allen married Louise Lasser in 1966. They divorced in 1969, and Allen did not marry again until 1997. Lasser appeared in three Allen films after the divorce – Take the Money and Run, Bananas, and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)  and briefly appeared in Stardust Memories.

====Diane Keaton====

In 1970, Allen cast Diane Keaton in his Broadway show, Play It Again, Sam. During the run she and Allen became romantically involved and although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in a number of his films, including Sleeper as a futuristic poet and Love and Death as a composite character based on the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Annie Hall was very important in Allen and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Diane Keaton's given name is Diane Hall. She then starred in Interiors as a poet, followed by Manhattan. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in Radio Days and was chosen to replace Mia Farrow in the co-starring role for Manhattan Murder Mystery after Allen and Farrow began having troubles with their personal and working relationship while making this film. Keaton has not worked with Allen since Manhattan Murder Mystery. Since the end of their romantic relationship, Keaton and Allen remain close friends.Q&A: Diane Keaton. CBS News. February 18, 2004.

Around 1980, Allen began a relationship with actress Mia Farrow, who had leading roles in most of his movies from 1982 to 1992. Farrow and Allen never married and kept separate homes.

It was a turning point for the better." Of his relationship with Farrow, he said, "I'm sure there are things that I might have done differently. . . Probably in retrospect I should have bowed out of that relationship much earlier than I did." In 2011, Allen said,  "What was the scandal? I fell in love with this girl, married her. We have been married for almost 15 years now. There was no scandal, but people refer to it all the time as a scandal and I kind of like that in a way because when I go I would like to say I had one real juicy scandal in my life."[tpl]cite news |last=Kearney |first=Christine|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCATRE75L1OV20110622 |title= Just A Minute With: Woody Allen on nostalgia, scandal | publisher = Reuters |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl]

In 1991, when the relationship began, Allen was 56 and Previn around 19. Asked whether their age difference was conducive to "a healthy, equal relationship", Allen said equality is not necessarily a requirement in a relationship and "The heart wants what it wants.

Following their separation, Farrow won custody of their children. Allen was denied visitation rights with Malone and could see Ronan only under supervision.

After Allen and Farrow separated, a long public legal battle for the custody of their three children began. Prior to the proceedings, Dylan Farrow's doctor reported concerns that Allen had sexually molested his adopted daughter, who was then seven years old. The police-appointed medical team concluded that Dylan "was not molested", citing contradictory statements by Dylan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html|title=Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statement|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|date=May 4, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 4, 2014[/tpl] The judge eventually found that the sex abuse charges were inconclusive.Brozan, Nadine (May 13, 1994).

===Psychoanalysis===

Allen spent over 37 years undergoing psychoanalysis, and some of his films, such as Antz, jokingly include references to psychoanalysis. Moment Magazine says, "It drove his self-absorbed work." Allen biographer John Baxter, wrote, "Allen obviously found analysis stimulating, even exciting."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.momentmag.com/archive/dec99/feat1.html |title=Moment Mag|accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070311035947/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/dec99/feat1.html |archivedate = March 11, 2007| deadurl = yes[/tpl] Allen says his psychoanalysis ended around the time he began his relationship with Previn, although he is still claustrophobic and agoraphobic.
Allen has described himself as being a "militant Freudian atheist".[tpl]cite news|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvF1HspfnN8l|title=YouTube|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=May 19, 2008[/tpl]
