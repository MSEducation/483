==History==

Glasgow Army Air Field, also known as the Glasgow Satellite Airfield, was activated on November 10, 1942. It was one of three satellite fields of Great Falls Army Air Base which accommodated a bombardment group. There were four Bomber Squadrons within this group, one located at the Great Falls Army Air Base and one at each of the three satellite air fields at Lewistown, Glasgow and Cut Bank.
The 96th Bombardment Squadron of the Second Bombardment Group arrived at Glasgow Army Air Field on November 29, 1942. Heavy bomber squadrons of the time usually consisted of 8 B-17s with 37 officers and 229 enlisted men. The satellite field was used by B-17 bomber crews from the Second Air Force during the second phase of their training. Actual bombing and gunnery training was conducted at the airfield’s associated sites, Glasgow Pattern Bombing Range and the Glasgow Pattern Gunnery Range, though other training sites within the bombardment group were probably also used. The target-towing aircraft assigned to the Fort Peck Aerial Gunnery Range were also stationed at Glasgow. The last unit to complete training at Glasgow Satellite Field was the 614th Bombardment Squadron of the 401st Bombardment Group, which left for England in October 1943.[tpl]cite book|last=|first=|coauthors=|editor=Closway, Gordon R.|title=Pictorial Record of the 401st Bomb Group|url= https://archive.org/stream/PictorialRecordofthe401stBombGroup#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=September 10, 2013|series= |year=1946 |publisher=Newsfoto Publishing Co.|location=San Angelo, TX|isbn= |page=45[/tpl]
On December 1, 1944 a German prisoner-of-war camp was established at the site. On July 15, 1946 the Glasgow Army Air Field was classified surplus and it was subsequently transferred to the War Assets Administration on November 18, 1946.
