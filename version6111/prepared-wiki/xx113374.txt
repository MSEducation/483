==Rising to the World Cup challenge==

"I knew it would be physical but was surprised at their organisation and their fitness," Ireland second row Paul O'Connell said after his side escaped with a 14-10 victory over Georgia on Saturday to keep alive their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals.
If the final whistle left Ireland counting their blessings - and their bruises - it was a cause for massive celebration for the Georgian gladiators, who were cheered by the 33,000 crowd on a deserved lap of honour.

==Georgia record first RWC win==

Georgia recorded their first win in a rugby world cup with a 30-0 win over Namibia in their rain-affected Pool D match at Stade Felix-Bollaert.
The foundation for the three-tries-to-none victory was laid by Georgia's experienced forward pack who wore down their opponents at the breakdown.
Dominating territory and possession in the first half it took 37 minutes for Georgia to break Namibia's defensive line, hooker Akvsenti Giorgadze, in his 50th international, pushing his way over after good lead-up work from his forwards.
Two penalties and a conversion from the boot of fly half Merab Kvirikashvili contributed to Georgia's 13-0 lead at the break, the number 10 becoming Georgia's record point-scorer in rugby world cups.
Georgia's forward pack continued to dominate at the breakdown in the second stanza but Namibia's defence held strong. It was another Kvirikashvili penalty in the 68th minute that got the scoreboard ticking over again.
Wing Irakli Machkhaneli then raced 30m to score in the 70th minute after knocking the ball loose in a bonecrunching tackle.
Centre Davit Kacharava put the finishing touches on the win intercepting a pass and scooting 40m to score on the final whistle.
Namibia's RWC 2007 campaign was over with the Georgia honourable 7-64 defeat to hosts France on 30 September.
