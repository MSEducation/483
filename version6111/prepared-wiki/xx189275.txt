Fritz Frauenheim (9 January 1912 – 28 September 1969) was a German U-boat commander of the Second World War.  From September 1939 until retiring from front line service in December 1940, he sank 19 ships for a total of [tpl]GRT|78,853|metric=yes|first=yes[/tpl], and damaged two others.  For this he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ([tpl]lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes[/tpl]), among other commendations. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

==Early life==

Frauenheim was born in Berlin-Friedenau on 9 March 1912.  He entered the navy and spent his initial training on the cadet ship Schleswig-Holstein, followed by a period on the light cruiser Karlsruhe. He was transferred to the U-boat force in January 1936 and rose quickly through the ranks and on 1 April 1939 he was promoted to Kapitänleutnant.[tpl]cite web |url= http://uboat.net/men/frauenheim.htm |title=Fritz Frauenheim |last=Helgason |first=Guðmundur |date=1995–2013 |work=The Men – U-boat Commanders – Top U-boat Aces |publisher=Guðmundur Helgason |accessdate=[/tpl] He appears to have spent time with the German forces supporting the Spanish Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War, as he was awarded the Spanish Cross on 6 June 1939.

==Wartime career==

Frauenheim had been made watch officer on [tpl]GS|U-25|1936|2[/tpl] in 1938, eventually spending over a year in this role, until October 1939. He was appointed to command [tpl]GS|U-21|1936|2[/tpl] on 1 October 1937, eventually carrying out five patrols, eventually sinking four merchant ships.  He also laid mines, one of which damaged [tpl]HMS|Belfast|C35|6[/tpl] on 21 November, putting her out of action for nearly three years.  The [tpl]sclass-|Net|boom defence vessel[/tpl] Bayonet was sunk by one of U-21’s mines on 21 December.
Frauenheim left U-21 on 6 January 1940, taking over command of the newly built [tpl]GS|U-101|1940|2[/tpl] on 11 March 1940. He commissioned the boat and took her on four successful patrols. He sank a total of 12 ships, including three sunk and one damaged from convoy SC-7. He left U-101 on 18 November 1940 and became a teacher in the 2nd ULD. He went on to hold a number of staff positions, before taking command of 23rd U-boat Flotilla in the Mediterranean in September 1941. In 1942 he moved to command 29th U-boat Flotilla. On 1 March 1943 he was promoted to Korvettenkapitän. In February 1944 Frauenheim joined the staff of the Admiral der Kleinkampfverbände (Admiral of Midget Assault Units), where he remained for the rest of the war.  He was again promoted, this time to Fregattenkapitän on 1 December 1944.

After the end of the war Frauenheim spent eight months in Allied captivity before being released. Frauenheim for almost 20 years until his death worked at the Mobil Oil AG in the Federal Republic of Germany.
