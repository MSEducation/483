Agronomes et Vétérinaires sans frontières is a French non-profit organisation created in 2004 by the merger of Vétérinaires sans frontières (VSF) and the Centre International de Coopération pour le Développement Agricole (CICDA).
As explained on its website, it is an "association for international solidarity which acts for rural development, supports rural farming in underprivileged regions and contributes to advocacy and lobbying activity in the North and South in favour of these agricultures by making the most of existing skills in agriculture, livestock and animal health."
In 2005, the Organization spent from US$250,000 to $500,000 on its projects in Vietnam promoting sustainable rural development.
