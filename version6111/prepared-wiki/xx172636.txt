Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas had one of the great seasons by a passer in NFL history. Says Cold Hard Football Facts, "Unitas's 32 scoring strikes was an NFL record –- he was the first and only to top 30 touchdowns in the NFL's first 40 years –- and remains the standard for a 12-game season. He was in the midst of his record 47-game streak with a touchdown pass, and connected on at least one in every game of 1959."Cold Hard Football Facts: The Dandy Dozen: 12 best passing seasons in history
