Rupert James Hamer (28 February 1970 – 9 January 2010) was a British journalist and, at the time of his death, was the defence correspondent for the Sunday Mirror.

==Career==

Hamer was educated at Town Close School in Norwich and Gresham's School in Holt before joining the Eastern Daily Press as a trainee reporter in the late 1980s. In 1991 he attended Leeds University where he studied Politics, and edited a satirical column for the university's newspaper, the Leeds Student, entitled "Rupert Hamer on Friday". After graduating he worked as health correspondent for the Bournemouth Evening Echo, where he met his wife Helen, before moving to London in 1997. After working as a freelance for both the INS news agency and the Sunday Mirror, he accepted a staff job appointment by the newspaper in 1997. He was appointed as the Sunday Mirror's defence correspondent in 2004 reporting from both Afghanistan and Iraq.

Hamer and his Mirror colleague, photographer Philip Coburn, flew to Afghanistan on New Year's Eve 2009, where Hamer commenced his fifth assignment reporting from that country.
