The United Kingdom is responsible for the island's defence and ultimately for good governance, and for representing the island in international fora, while the island's own parliament and government have competence over all domestic matters.Isle of Man Government website

===Structure===

The island's parliament, Tynwald, has been in continuous existence since 979AD or earlier, making it the oldest continuously governing body in the world.British Library page on the Chronicle of Mann Tynwald is a bicameral or tricameral legislature, comprising the House of Keys (directly elected by universal suffrage) and the Legislative Council (consisting of indirectly elected and ex-officio members). These two bodies meet together in joint session as Tynwald.
The executive branch of government is the Council of Ministers, which is composed of members of Tynwald. It is headed by the Chief Minister, currently Allan Bell MHK. The Council of Ministers comprises the greater part of the House of Keys.
Vice-regal functions of the Head of State are performed by a Lieutenant Governor.

===External relations and security===

====Defence====

Under British law, the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom. However, Britain takes care of its external and defence affairs, and retains paramount power to legislate for the island.[tpl]cite report | title = Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969–1973, Volume I, Report (Cmnd 5460)|year=1973 | location = London[/tpl] There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man although HMS Ramsey is affiliated with the town of the same name.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/mine-countermeasure/sandown-class/hms-ramsey/ | title = HMS Ramsey | publisher = Royal Navy | year = 2009 | accessdate =11 September 2011[/tpl] From 1938 there was a (now disbanded) Manx Regiment of the British Territorial Army, which saw extensive action during the Second World War.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.iomguide.com/douglas/regimental-museum.php | title = Regimental Museum – History | publisher = Isle of Man Guide | accessdate =11 September 2011 [/tpl] In 1779, the Manx Fencible Corps, a fencible regiment of three companies, was raised and disbanded in 1783 at the end of the American War of Independence. Later, the Royal Manx Fencibles was raised at the time of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795,See The Forgotten Army: Fencible Regiments for more detail. and it saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

====Emergency Services====

The Isle of Man Government maintains five emergency services.The official Government web portal lists five emergency services here. These are:
All of these services are controlled directly by the Isle of Man Government, and are independent of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the Isle of Man Constabulary voluntarily submits to inspection by the British inspectorate of police,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gov.im/dha/police/ | title = Welcome to the Isle of Man Constabulary | publisher = Isle of Man Constabulary accessdate = 11 September 2011[/tpl] and the Isle of Man Coastguard contracts Her Majesty's Coastguard (UK) for air-sea rescue operations.

====Citizenship====

Citizenship in the Isle of Man is governed by British law. Passports issued by the Isle of Man Passport Office say "British Islands – Isle of Man" on the cover but the nationality status stated on the passport is simply "British Citizen". Although Manx passport holders are British citizens, because the Isle of Man is not part of the European Union, people born on the Island without a parent or grandparent either born or resident for more than five consecutive years in the United Kingdom do not have the same rights as other British citizens with regard to employment and establishment in the EU. Isle of Man passports can be issued to any British citizen in the Isle of Man (whether or not that person has "Manx status" as an Isle of Man worker under the local Isle of Man employment laws). They can also be issued to Manx-connected British citizens residing in Britain or either of the other Crown Dependencies.

====European Union====

The Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the European Union. Protocol 3 of the UK's Act of Accession to the Treaty of Rome permits trade for Manx goods without tariffs.Manx government explanation of Protocol 3 In conjunction with the Customs and Excise agreement with the UK, this facilitates free trade with the UK. While Manx goods can be freely moved within the EU, capital and services cannot be.
EU citizens are entitled to travel and reside, but not work, in the island without restriction. And Manx citizens—without the hereditary qualification outlined above—are similarly restricted from working in the EU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/iomfinance/media/facts.xml|title=Isle of Man Facts & Economic Data|work=Isle of Man Finance|publisher=Isle of Man Government|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/cso/immigrationintheisleofmanpub.pdf|title=Immigration in the Isle of Man|publisher=Isle of Man Government|page=12|date=October 2006|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl]

====Commonwealth of Nations====

The Isle of Man is not itself a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. By virtue of its relationship with the United Kingdom, it takes part in several Commonwealth institutions, including the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Commonwealth Games. The Government of the Isle of Man has made calls for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,[tpl]cite web|title=The role and future of the Commonwealth|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/11410.htm|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.[tpl]cite web|title=Written evidence from the States of Guernsey|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/114/114we18.htm|publisher=Policy Council of Guernsey|accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man has said: "A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island’s international relationships"[tpl]cite news|title=Isle of Man welcomes report on Commonwealth future|url=http://www.gov.im/lib/news/cso/isleofmanwelcome5.xml|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Isle of Man Government|date=23 November 2012[/tpl]

===Politics===

Most Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Though political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as in the United Kingdom.
There are two political parties in the Isle of Man. The Liberal Vannin Party (established 2006) with two seats in the House of Keys, they promote greater Manx independence and more accountability in Government. The Manx Labour Party is the other, they hold one seat.
A number of pressure groups also exist on the island. Mec Vannin advocate the establishment of a sovereign republic.MecVannin website The Positive Action Group campaign for three key elements to be introduced into the governance of the island: open accountable government, rigorous control of public finances, and a fairer society.PAG website

===Local government===

Local government on the Isle of Man is based on the concept of ancient parishes. There are two types of local authorities: a corporation for the Borough of Douglas, and bodies of commissioners for the town districts of Castletown, Peel and Ramsey, the village districts of Kirk Michael, Laxey, Onchan, Port Erin and Port St Mary, and the 15 'parish districts' (those parishes or parts of parishes which do not fall within the districts previously mentioned). Local authorities are under the supervision of the Isle of Man Government's Department of Local Government and the Environment (DOLGE).

==Education==

Public education is under the Department of Education and Children. Thirty-four primary schools, five secondary schools, and the Isle of Man College function under the department.Department of Education and Children Home Page – Isle of Man Government Department of Education and Children.

==Economy==

The Isle of Man is a low-tax economy with no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or inheritance taxDirect Tax – Isle of Man Government and a top rate of income tax of 20%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2013/04/interview-with-brian-donegan-director-of-foreign-direct-investment-at-isle-of-man-government-treasur.html |title=Interview With Brian Donegan, Director Of Foreign Investment, Isle Of Man Government |publisher=OnlinePersonalsWatch |date= |accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] A tax cap is in force; the maximum amount of tax payable by an individual is £115,000 or £230,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes jointly assessed. The £115,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the Island.
The rate of corporation tax is 0% for almost all types of income, the only exceptions are that the profits of banks are taxed at 10%, as is rental (or other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man.New Assessor of Income Tax – Isle of Man GovernmentForget Monaco: Isle of Man cuts tax to tempt super-rich – Tax, Money – Independent.co.uk
Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism form key sectors of the economy. Agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, now make declining contributions to the Island's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Trade takes place mostly with the United Kingdom. The island is in customs union with the UK, and related revenues are pooled and shared under the Common Purse Agreement.
The Manx government promotes island locations for making films by contributing to the production costs. Since 1995, over eighty films have been made on the island. The policy has been criticized as unsustainable. Since 2007, the Isle of Man government invested £34 million in the film industry but recouped only £6.3 million, representing a loss of over £27 million.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jun/17/isle-of-man-film-industry | date = 17 June 2011 | accessdate =11 September 2011 | title = Isle of Man film industry loses £27m | last = Brooks | first = Xan | publisher = guardian.co.uk [/tpl]

The main telephone provider on the Isle of Man is Manx Telecom. At present, the island has two mobile operators: Manx Telecom, previously known as Manx Pronto, and Sure. For a short time, Cloud9 operated as a third mobile operator on the island, but has since withdrawn. Broadband internet services are available through four local providers which are Wi-Manx, Domicilium, Manx Computer Bureau and Manx Telecom. The island does not have its own ITU country code, but is accessed via the British country code (+44) and the island's telephone numbers are part of the British telephone numbering plan with local dialling codes 01624 for landlines and 07524, 07624 and 07924 for mobiles.

In conjunction with the Isle of Man TT a limited number of sailings operate to and from Larne in Northern Ireland. All ferries are operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.
The only commercial airport on the island is the Isle of Man Airport at Ronaldsway. There are scheduled and chartered flights to numerous airports in the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as further afield. The Irish operator Aer Arann entered a code-sharing agreement with Abu Dhabi airliner Etihad Airways in 2009, a deal which provides for the booking of one-ticket flights from the Isle of Man.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/aer-arann-teams-up-with-etihad-1603889.html | title = Aer Arann teams up with Etihad | date = 16 January 2009 | accessdate =12 September 2011 | last = Noonan | first = Laura | publisher = Independent.ie[/tpl]

Currently there is a steam railway which runs between Douglas and Port Erin, an electric railway which runs between Douglas and Ramsey and an electric mountain railway which climbs Snaefell.

===Space commerce===

==Culture==

The culture of the Isle of Man is influenced by its Celtic, and to a lesser extent its Norse, origins. Proximity to the UK, popularity as a UK tourist destination, and mass immigration by British migrant workers has meant that British influence has been dominant since the Revestment period. Revival campaigns have attempted to preserve the surviving vestiges of Manx culture after a long period of Anglicisation, and significant interest in the Manx language, history and musical tradition has been the result.

===Language===

The official language of the Isle of Man is English, while Manx Gaelic has also had official status since 1985.[tpl]cite web | title = World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – United Kingdom : Manx | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,488f25df2,49749c8f5,0.html | publisher = UNHCR / Minority Rights Group International | accessdate =17 September 2011 | year = 2008[/tpl] Manx has traditionally been spoken but is now considered "critically endangered".

===Symbols===

For centuries, the island's symbol has been the so-called "three legs of Mann" ([tpl]lang-gv|Tree Cassyn Vannin[/tpl]), a triskelion of three legs conjoined at the thigh. The Manx triskelion, which dates with certainty to the late 13th century, is of an uncertain origin. It has been suggested that its origin lies in Sicily, an island which has been associated with triskelions since ancient times.[tpl]Cite book|title=Archeologia del Mediterraneo: studi in onore di Ernesto De Miro |author=De Miro, Ernesto |year=2003 |publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider |isbn=978-88-8265-134-3 |pages=735–736|editor=Fiorentini, Graziella|editor2=De Miro, Ernesto |editor3=Calderone, Anna |editor4=Caccamo Caltabiano, Maria|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] Another possibility is that its origin lies with the emblem of the 10th century Norse-Gaelic dynasty which ruled the island at the time.
The symbol appears in the island's official flag and official coat of arms, as well as its currency. The Manx triskelion may be reflected in the island's motto, [tpl]lang-la|Quocunque jeceris stabit[/tpl], which appears as part of the island's coat of arms. The Latin motto translates into English as "whichever way you throw, it will stand" or "whithersoever you throw it, it will stand".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml |title=Island Facts |accessdate=15 September 2011 |publisher=Isle of Man Public Services (www.gov.im) |ref=harv |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] It dates to the late 17th century when it is known to have appeared on the island's coinage.[tpl]Cite book |last=Kinvig |first=R.H. |title=The Isle of Man: A social, cultural and political history |year=1975 |publisher=Charles E.

===Religion===

The predominant religious tradition of the island is Christianity. Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of Catholic Christendom, and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the Church of England. It has also come under the influence of Irish religious tradition. The island forms a separate diocese called Sodor and Man, which once comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Isles ("Sudrys" in old Norse).  It now consists of 16 parishes,A full list is given on the Diocesan Registry website. and since 1541[ref]
Act of Parliament (1541) 33 Hen.8 c.31
[/ref] has formed part of the Province of York.See official entry in the Anglican Communion directory.
Other Christian churches also operate on the Isle of Man. The second largest denomination is the Methodist Church, which is close in size to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Roman Catholic parish churches, included in the Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool. Additionally there are five Baptist churches, four Pentecostal churches, the Salvation Army, a ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, two congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses, two United Reformed churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small Muslim community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small Jewish community.Many religious organisations on the island are listed on the Isle of Man government site "Religious Faiths and Organisations".

===Myth, legend and folklore===

In Manx mythology, the island was ruled by Manannán mac Lir, a Celtic sea god, who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal theories about the origin of the name Mann is that it is named after Manannan.
In the Manx tradition of folklore, there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the [tpl]lang|gv|Buggane[/tpl], a malevolent spirit who according to legend blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the [tpl]lang|gv|Fenodyree[/tpl]; the [tpl]lang|gv|Glashtyn[/tpl]; and the [tpl]lang|gv|Moddey Dhoo[/tpl], a ghostly black dog who wandered the walls and corridors of Peel Castle.
The Isle of Man is also said to be home to fairies, known locally as the little folk or themselves. There is a famous Fairy Bridge and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the [tpl]lang|gv|Mi'raj[/tpl] and the [tpl]lang|gv|Arkan Sonney[/tpl].
An old Irish story tells how Lough Neagh was formed when Ireland's legendary giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the Irish Sea, thus creating the island.
Peel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian AvalonAvalon's LocationIsle of Man or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of Lancelot's encounter with the sword bridge of King Melegaunt.King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318

===Music===

The music of the Isle of Man reflects Celtic, Norse and other influences, including from its neighbours, Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales. A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called [tpl]lang|gv|Yn Çhruinnaght[/tpl] in Ramsey.Cliff McGann (1996) Traditional Music on the Isle of Man This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.

===Food===

Traditionally the national dish of the island is Spuds and Herrin, boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish is chosen because of its role supporting the subsistence farmers of the island, who crofted the land and fished the sea for centuries.
A more recent claim for the title of national dish would be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to poutine, is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut chips, covered in shredded Cheddar cheese and topped with a thick gravy.Isle of Man – Factfile – Daily Life
Seafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx kippers (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries in Peel on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from North Sea herring these days.[tpl]cite book|author=American Motorcyclist Assoc|title=American Motorcyclist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ffYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22|accessdate=12 September 2011|date=November 1971|publisher=American Motorcyclist Assoc|page=22|issn=02779358[/tpl] The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.

===Manx animals===

There are two domestic animals specifically connected to the Isle of Man, though they are also found elsewhere.
The Manx cat is a breed of cat noted for having a genetic mutation that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a "stumpy", to being completely nonexistent, or "rumpy". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.
The Manx Loaghtan sheep is a breed native to the island. It has dark brown wool and four, or sometimes six horns. The meat is considered to be a delicacy. There are several flocks on the island and others have been started in England and Jersey.
