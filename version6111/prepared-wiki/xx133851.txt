==History==

The name 'Sippy' is derived from the Aboriginal word Dhippi or Jippi, a generic name for 'winged creatures' and believed to be 'a place of birds.'
Sippy Downs was a part of the Moolooloo Plains pastoral run leased by John Westaway & Sons in the 1860s. In 1870 all runs ceased, and the land became available for lease.  It was not occupied until 1938, when it was occupied as a perpetual lease selection until 1957.[tpl]cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.maroochy.qld.gov.au/maroochylibraries/sitePage.cfm?code=hlsiphist|title=Sippy Downs|publisher=Maroochy Shire[/tpl] Sippy downs was then purchased by Alfred Grant.  A portion was then sold onto Frank Cunning who raised cattle there until it was sold to the INVESTA property group in 2002. Brahman cattle were still on the property at is was being surveyed for the housing development.   
Sippy Downs was established as a suburb in 1993 following the decision by the Shire of Maroochy to rezone the area. This cleared the way for the creation of the University of the Sunshine Coast which opened on 26 February 1996 with 542 students.
Sippy Downs is home to schools Siena Catholic College, Chancellor State College and a Montessori College.
Sippy Downs has been designated as a 'Knowledge Hub' in the Queensland Government's South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program and is master planned as Australia's first university town with the potential for over 6,000 workers in knowledge based businesses.$290m will give us 1000 workers.
