The park originated as the 1200 km2 Paney Station pastoral lease, which was acquired in 2000 by the South Australian Government with assistance from the Australian Government. In 2001 some 420 km2 of the adjacent Scrubby Peak Station was purchased and added to the park.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/nrs/getting-involved/case-studies/gawler-ranges.html|title=Gawler ranges: Eco-tourism|accessdate=2011-06-24 |work= National Reserve System|first= |last= |publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia|date=2011-05-09 [/tpl]
