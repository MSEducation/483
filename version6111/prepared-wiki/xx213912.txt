Intra and inter-specific agonistic behavior is documented, but varies greatly among slug species. Slugs often resort to aggression, attacking both conspecifics and individuals from other species when competing for resources. This aggressiveness is also influenced by seasonality, because the availability of resources such as shelter and food may be compromised due to climatic conditions. Slugs are prone to attack during the summer, when the availability of resources is reduced. During winter, the aggressive responses are substituted by a gregarious behavior.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rollo|first=C. D.|coauthors=Wellington, W.

==Human relevance==

The great majority of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but a small number of species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make individual items unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lovethegarden.com/product-details/slugclear-ultra |title=SlugClear Ultra: Highly efficient protection against slugs and snails | Gardening tips and advice |publisher=LoveTheGarden.com |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl]
As control measures, baits are the norm in both agriculture and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may be exposed to the bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate has been shown to be at least as effective as baits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/node/995 |title=Less toxic iron phosphate slug bait proves effective |publisher=Extension.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl] Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Beneficial nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gardening-guru.co.uk/2010/04/11/slugs-traps-death-by-beer/ |title=~ Slug Traps ~ Death by Beer Offers and Reviews |publisher=Gardening-guru.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-16[/tpl] diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis (demonstration)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen06/gen06261.htm |title=Slugs and Osmosis |publisher=Newton.dep.anl.gov |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl] but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Garden-Slugs |title=How to Get Rid of Garden Slugs: 17 steps (with pictures) |publisher=Wikihow.com |date=2012-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl]
In a few rare cases, humans have contracted parasite-induced meningitis from eating raw slugs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://abc.net.au/science/news/health/HealthRepublish_969551.htm |title=Health and Medicals News - Man's brain infected by eating slugs |accessdate=2006-03-15[/tpl] Live slugs that are accidentally eaten with improperly cleaned vegetables (such as lettuce), or improperly cooked slugs (for use in recipes requiring larger slugs such as banana slugs), can act as a vector for a parasitic infection in humans.Senanayake, S.
