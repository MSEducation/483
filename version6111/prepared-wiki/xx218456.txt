ISBN 0-300-09607-0 All Saints' parish church was described in the Early English Era as a "grand church of great local importance", however: the north and south aisles, transept and porch were taken down in the middle of the 18th century due to a significant reduction in the local population and the resulting loss of wealth. The church's tall tower still stands and was renovated for the Millennium. The church's set of corbels reflects the previous grandeur. Inside the church there is a stone font with an oak cover, designed and locally carved and donated to celebrate the year 2000.
