[[Abruzzo regional election, 2008]]

CATEGORIES: Elections in Abruzzo, 2008 elections in Italy

A regional election took place on 14–15 December 2008 in Abruzzo, due to the early resignation (the last election was held in 2005) of President Ottaviano Del Turco, after his indictment for alleged corruption.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/15/Tangenti_per_milioni_Del_Turco_co_9_080715096.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/18/Del_Turco_lascia_guardate_miei_co_9_080718101.shtml The election was to take place on 30 November–1 December but was postponed because of legal issues over the ammission of the list of For the Common Good.http://www.agi.it/ultime-notizie-page/200811251228-pol-rom1077-art.html
The candidate of The People of Freedom (PdL) was Gianni Chiodi, a former mayor of Teramo.http://www.agi.it/l-aquila/notizie/200810161229-pol-raq0029-art.html The PdL rejected any alliance with the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) and The Right in order to strengthen its goal of becoming a majority force free from the blackmails of small "old politics" parties.http://www.agi.it/l-aquila/notizie/200810171340-pol-raq0027-art.html
On the centre-left, local and national leaders of Democratic Party (PD) tried to produce a joint candidate with Italy of Values (IdV) and UDC, but IdV said that an alliance with the PD was possible only if the PD would have supported their own candidate, Carlo Constantini. IdV was even tempted by running a solitary campaign: Abruzzo was in fact a stronghold for the party, whose leader Antonio Di Pietro comes from neighbouring Molise. However, in late October, the PD agreed to support Costantini at the head of a large centre-left coalition, comprising also the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI), the Federation of the Greens and the Socialist Party (PS).http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=786879&canale=ORA&articolo=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI:%20IL%20CENTROSINISTRA%20PUNTA%20TUTTO%20SU%20COSTANTINI%20(IDV)
The PD tried to woo also the UDC in the centre-left coalition, but the UDC refused any alliance with populist IdV and decided to run its own candidate, Rodolfo De Laurentiis.http://www.repubblica.it/ultimora/24ore/ABRUZZO-CESA-IDV-E-PD-OK-MA-CON-NOSTRO-CANDIDATO/news-dettaglio/3361495 Teodoro Buontempo was the candidate of The Right.http://www.iltempo.it/politica/2012/12/14/e-la-destra-candida-buontempo-1.258077
On election day Gianni Chiodi defeated Carlo Costantini. The election was a major defeat for the PD, while IdV had a very good result, despite the poor showing of its candidate, who won less votes than its supporting parties.
