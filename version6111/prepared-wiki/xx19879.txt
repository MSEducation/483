 [[File:Paper Tape Canister, Tampered With.jpg|thumb|paper tape canister, tampered with|left]]
The paper tape canister to the left has clearly been tampered with. The paper tape has been withdrawn from the canister and an attempt to reinsert the tape has failed. The encrypted keys have been disrupted; therefore they could be misrepresented or exploited.  The paper tape canister has several tamper-proof design features:	
Hugh V. Hayes, the inventor, wrote [tpl]quote|1=Every paper tape canister  is unique. This uniqueness is accomplished during the manufacturing process, the plastic flowing into the mold creates unique flow patterns throughout the entire paper tape canister thereby making it impossible to duplicate eliminating the possibility of substitution.[/tpl]
The welded seam ensures that the paper tape canister cannot be pried open without being detected. 
Is a unique seam that is hard to duplicate thereby making it difficult to duplicate.
The paper path will not allow the reinsertion of tape.

==Limitations==

The three biggest problems with paper tape were:

==Advantages==

Punched tape does have some useful properties:

==Punched tape in art==

A computing or telecommunications professional depicted in the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow (1964) holds what appears to be a punched tape with three rows of rectangular holes.

==Current use==

Use of punched tape today is rare to nonexistent.[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl] No systems built new today still use punched paper tape.[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl] In CNC machining applications, what few existing installations remained in grandfathered use are now quickly disappearing as the temporary advantages for new orders of old part designs (i.e., not rewriting programs or retooling machines) are being superseded by natural economic evolution (fewer such orders as decades go by; part design revisions required reprogramming anyway; newer, higher-capability machines now successfully poaching the orders; etc.).
