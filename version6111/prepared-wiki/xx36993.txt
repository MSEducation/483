In 2002, Rhino Records remastered the album, filled out the disc's length with demos, and added another disc of live tracks and a radio interview for a 20th anniversary special edition, with liner notes by Michael Azerrad.
Violent Femmes is the band's most successful album to date and went platinum eight years after its release.  The album achieved what is believed to be a unique feat by going gold, four years after its release, without having yet made an appearance on Billboard's Top 200 album chart.
Slant Magazine listed the album at #21 on its list of "Best Albums of the 1980s".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/best-albums-of-the-1980s/308/page_8 |title=The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s | Feature |publisher=Slant Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]

==Album==

Most of the songs on both this album and its follow-up were written when the songwriter, Gordon Gano, was still in high school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[tpl]cite web|author=James Christopher Monger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hallowed-ground-mw0000195423 |title=Hallowed Ground - Violent Femmes | Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl] Violent Femmes peaked at #171 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430985/violent-femmes |title=Violent Femmes |publisher=Billboard |date=1994-06-04 |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl]

==Reception==

J. D. Considine in a 23 June 1983 review in Rolling Stone felt that the debut was precocious yet dynamic, with a good balance between Gano's direct lyrics and the full sound of the music.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/violentfemmes/albums/album/99584/review/6068109/violent_femmes |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211211102/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/violentfemmes/albums/album/99584/review/6068109/violent_femmes |archivedate= 2007-02-11 |title=Rolling Stone : Violent Femmes: Violent Femmes : Music Reviews |author=J.

Both Robert Christgau in an undated Consumer Guide Review and Steve Huey in an AllMusic retrospective, compared the album and singer Gordon Gano with Jonathan Richman of The Modern Lovers;[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=violent+femmes |title=Robert Christgau: CG: violent femmes |author=Robert Christgau |work=robertchristgau.com |year=2012 |quote=Gordon Gano |accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/violent-femmes-mw0000192210 |title=Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes: AllMusic |author=Steve Huey |work=allmusic.com |year=2012 |quote=Steve Huey |accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] a comparison which Gano was sick of by May 1983, as he was trying to sound like Steve Wynn.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.violentfemmesrecords.com/articles/noise.html|title=Violent Femmes |journal=LA Weekly|author=Robert Lloyd|date=20 May 1983|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]
