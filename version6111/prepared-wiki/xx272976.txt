Butta Benny is an area of Bhuts populated by the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community, who migrated from southern areas such as Kateel. They included Kamaths, Nayaks, Pai and other groups who were converted to Roman Catholicism by Portuguese missionaries and were offered lands in remote areas such as Butta Benny. This area now has Christians with surnames such as D'Souza and Aroza.  The place is known by the name Girijana Colony, since the northern half has been distributed among the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by the government.
