==Career==

===Defection===

Dresnok's first military service was two years in West Germany. After returning to the United States to find that his wife had left him for another man, he reenlisted and was sent to South Korea. He was a Private First Class with a U.S. Army unit along the Korean Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea in the early 1960s. Soon after his arrival, he found himself facing a court martial for forging signatures on paperwork that gave him permission to leave base and which, ultimately, led to his going AWOL (Absent Without Official Leave).
Unwilling to face punishment, on August 15, 1962, while his fellow soldiers were eating lunch, he ran across a minefield in broad daylight into North Korean territory, where he was quickly apprehended by North Korean soldiers. Dresnok was taken by train to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and interrogated.

===Life in North Korea===

"I was fed up with my childhood, my marriage, my military life, everything. I was a goon. The Reluctant communist, page 64 There's only one place to go," Dresnok said in an interview. "On August 15th, at noon in broad daylight when everybody was eating lunch, I hit the road. Yes I was afraid. Am I gonna live or die? And when I stepped into the minefield and I seen it with my own eyes, I started sweating. I crossed over, looking for my new life.”
Dresnok met Larry Allen Abshier, another American defector, soon after his arrival. Eventually there were four of them: Abshier, Jerry Parrish, Charles Robert Jenkins, and Dresnok. The men lived together and participated in several propaganda efforts on behalf of the North Korean government. They appeared on magazine covers and used loudspeakers to try to persuade more American soldiers at the border to defect. But they did not wish to remain in North Korea indefinitely at first. In 1966, the four men tried to leave North Korea by seeking asylum at the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang, but the embassy immediately turned them over to North Korean authorities. After that, Dresnok decided to settle in North Korea. 
Beginning in 1978, he was cast in several North Korean films, including the 20-part series Unsung Heroes (as an American villain), and became a celebrity in the country as a result. He is called "Arthur" by his Korean friends, after the character he played in the series. He also translated some of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung’s writings into English.[tpl]cite news|date=2007-01-23|accessdate=2009-05-01|title=Last US defector in North Korea|publisher=BBC News|last=Spiller|first=Penny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6267645.stm[/tpl]
According to Jenkins's book The Reluctant Communist, Dresnok was something of a bully, betraying the other Americans' confidences to the North Koreans, and enthusiastically beat up Jenkins 30 or more times on the orders of their Korean handlers.Charles Robert Jenkins, The Reluctant communist, page 64 In the documentary Crossing the Line,  Dresnok vehemently denies these allegations.

==Personal life==

===In the United States===

In Crossing the Line Dresnok explains that after marrying an American woman at a young age, he was deployed in West Germany for two years while she remained in the U.S. He prided himself on "truly loving her and being loyal to her". But when he returned, he found she was already in another relationship. He was quoted as saying, "The good thing was that she did not get pregnant by me because I had promised that I would never abandon my children."

===In North Korea===

He has been married twice more since defecting to North Korea. The first was to a Romanian woman, Doina Bumbea (referred to as "Dona" in Jenkins's autobiography), with whom he had two sons, Theodore "Ted" Ricardo Dresnok and James Gabriel Dresnok. Bumbea supposedly worked at the Romanian Embassy, but some accounts claim she never worked there and was an abductee taken by the North Korean secret service.“Romanian Woman Kidnapped by N.Korea in 1978”, The Chosun Ilbo, March 22, 2007. Accessed November 13, 2010.“Romanian brother of Pyongyang abductee visits”, The Japan Times, April 21, 2007. Accessed November 13, 2010. 
Jenkins's book also mentions this, but claims she was abducted to be the wife of one of the American deserters. The Romanian Foreign Office's website says Romania asked North Korea in 2007 to explain Bumbea's abduction but did not receive an answer.Romanian Foreign OfficeRealitatea Bumbea died of lung cancer.
After Bumbea's death, Dresnok married his third wife, the daughter of a North Korean woman and a Togolese diplomat. They had a son in 2001. The family lives in a small apartment in Pyongyang, provided along with a monthly stipend by the North Korean government. Dresnok is in failing health, with a bad heart and liver (Dresnok describes his liver as "full of fat"), which he attributes to smoking and drinking too much.
His elder son from his second marriage, James Dresnok, was a student at Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, where his father taught English in the 1980s. James speaks English with a Korean accent and considers himself Korean but reportedly does not wish to marry a Korean woman. James intends to enter the diplomatic service.
Dresnok has stated that he intends to spend the rest of his life in North Korea, and that no amount of money could entice him back to the West. Now retired, Dresnok occasionally gives lectures in North Korea and goes fishing “just to pass the time.” He sporadically tweets under the handle @JamesDresnok, first posting back in September 2009.[tpl]cite web|title=Is An American Defector Tweeting From Pyongyang?|url=http://www.nknews.org/2013/02/an-american-defector-to-north-korea-is-tweeting-from-pyongyang/|work=www.nknews.org|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl]
