[[Comma splice]]

CATEGORIES: Punctuation, English grammar

A comma splice is the use of a comma to join two independent clauses. For example:
Although acceptable in some languages and compulsory in others (e.g. Bulgarian), comma splices are usually considered style errors in English.  Some English style guides consider comma splices appropriate in certain situations, such as when being poetic or with short, similar phrases.

==Prescriptive view==

Comma splices are condemned in The Elements of Style, a popular American English style guide by E.B. White and William Strunk, Jr.[tpl]cite book |last=Strunk |first=William, Jr. |authorlink=William Strunk, Jr. |year=1918 |title=The Elements of Style |edition=1st |chapter=Do not join independent clauses by a comma |chapterurl=http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style2.html#5 |accessdate=2007-09-04[/tpl]
According to Joanne Buckley,Buckley, Joanne. Checkmate: A Writing Reference for Canadians.  Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson. 2003. comma splices often arise when writers use conjunctive adverbs to separate two independent clauses instead of using a coordinating conjunction. A coordinating conjunction is one of the seven words: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. A conjunctive adverb is a word like furthermore, however, or moreover. A conjunctive adverb and a comma (or a conjunctive adverb between two commas) is not strong enough to separate two independent clauses and creates a comma splice; only semicolons and periods are strong enough to separate two independent clauses without a conjunction. For example, the following sentence contains a comma splice with a conjunctive adverb:
Grammarians disagree as to whether a comma splice also constitutes a run-on sentence. Some run-on sentence definitions include comma splices,[tpl]cite web |title=Run-on Sentences, Comma Splices |url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/runons.htm |accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] but others limit the term to independent clauses that are joined without punctuation, thereby excluding comma splices.[tpl]cite web |last1=Berry |first1=Chris |last2=Brizee |first2=Allen |title=Run-ons – Comma Splices – Fused Sentences |date=2006-08-31 |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/598/02/ |accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite document |last1=Hairston |first1=Maxine |last2=Ruszkiewicz |first2=John J. |last3=Friend |first3=Christy |title=The Scott, Foresman Handbook for Writers |edition=5th |publisher=Longman |year=1998 |location=New York |page=509[/tpl]

==Acceptable uses==

Strunk & White notes that splices are sometimes acceptable when the clauses are short and alike in form, such as:
The famous sentence I came, I saw, I conquered falls into the same category.
Fowler (third edition, 1996)[tpl]cite book |last=Burchfield |first=R. W. |authorlink=R. W. Burchfield |editor-last=Fowler |editor-first=H. W. |editor-link=Henry Watson Fowler | title=Fowler's Modern English Usage | isbn=0-19-869126-2 | edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford[/tpl] notes a number of examples by reputable authors:
The comma splice is often considered acceptable in poetic writing. The editors of the Jerusalem Bible translate Isaiah 11:4 as:
[tpl]Quote|His word is a rock that strikes the ruthless, his sentences bring death to the wicked.[tpl]cite book |editor=Alexander Jones|title=Jerusalem Bible (Reader's Edition)|year=1966|isbn=0-385-49918-3|publisher=Doubleday[/tpl][/tpl]
The British author Lynne Truss[tpl]cite book |last=Truss |first=Lynne |authorlink=Lynne Truss |isbn=1-86197-612-7 |year=2003 |title=Eats, Shoots & Leaves |chapter=That'll do, comma | publisher=Profile Books |location=London[/tpl] observes: "so many highly respected writers observe the splice comma that a rather unfair rule emerges on this one: only do it if you're famous." She cites Samuel Beckett, E. M. Forster, and Somerset Maugham. "Done knowingly by an established writer, the comma splice is effective, poetic, dashing. Done equally knowingly by people who are not published writers, it can look weak or presumptuous. Done ignorantly by ignorant people, it is awful."
Comma splices are considered acceptable by some in passages of spoken (or interior) dialogue, and are sometimes used deliberately to emulate spoken language more closely.

==Correction==

Simply removing the comma does not correct the error, but results in a run-on sentence. There are several ways to correct a comma splice:
