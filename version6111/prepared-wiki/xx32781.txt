===Poetic Edda===

The Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál mentions Garmr:
One of the refrains of Völuspá uses Garmr's howling to herald the coming of Ragnarök:
After the first occurrence of this refrain the Fimbulvetr is related; the second occurrence is succeeded by the invasion of Jötnar (giants) in the world of gods; after the last occurrence, the rise of a new and better world is described.
Baldrs draumar describes a journey which Odin makes to Hel. Along the way he meets a dog.
Although unnamed, this dog is normally assumed to be Garmr.Lincoln (1991:97) Alternatively, Garmr is sometimes assumed to be identical to Fenrir. Garmr is sometimes seen as a hellhound, comparable to Cerberus.

===Prose Edda===

The Prose Edda book Gylfaginning assigns him a role in Ragnarök:

==Etymology==

Bruce Lincoln brings together Garmr and the Greek mythological dog Cerberus, relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root *ger- "to growl" (perhaps with the suffixes -*m/*b and -*r).[tpl]cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Bruce|title=Death, war, and sacrifice: studies in ideology and practice|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-48199-9|pages=289[/tpl] However, as Ogden (2013)[tpl]cite book|last=Ogden|first=Daniel|title= Drakon: Dragon Myth and Serpent Cult in the Greek and Roman Worlds|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199557322|pages=105[/tpl] notes, this analysis actually requires Cerberus and Garmr to be derived from two different Indo-European roots (*ger- and *gher- respectively), and in this opinion does not establish a relationship between the two names. However, the two roots are similar enough that a connection can still be argued.
