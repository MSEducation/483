Bossiaea buxifolia (Matted Bossiaea) is a species of flowering plant in the pea family (Fabaceae). It usually has a prostrate to procumbent habit, though some forms may have an erect habit, growing up to 1.3 metres high. The leaves are ovate to rounded, 2 to 5 mm long and have a short petiole. Flowers are produced between October and November in its native range. These 
have dark-coloured standards, yellow and orange wings and purplish keels. The seed pods are narrow-oblong in shape and around 20 mm long.
The species was first formally described by Allan Cunningham who found it growing "upon rocky, brushy hills" in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. His description was published in 1825 in Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales.
It occurs in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.
