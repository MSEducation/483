Pontypridd [tpl]IPAc-en|p|ɒ|n|t|ə|ˈ|p|r|iː|ð[/tpl] is both a community and a principal town of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales and is situated 12 miles/19 km north of the Welsh capital city of Cardiff. Pontypridd is often abbreviated "Ponty" by local residents.

==Geography==

Pontypridd comprises the electoral wards of Cilfynydd, Glyncoch, Graig, Graigwen, Hawthorn, Pontypridd Town, 'Rhondda', Rhydyfelin Central/Ilan (Rhydfelen), Trallwng (Trallwn) and Treforest (Trefforest).
The town sits at the junction of the Rhondda and Taff / Cynon valleys, where the River Rhondda flows into the Taff immediately south of the town at Ynysangharad War Memorial Park.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg692 ISBN 978-0-7083-1953-6 Pontypridd community had a population of 29,781 according to census figures gathered in 2001.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] while Pontypridd town itself was recorded as having a population of 2,919 also as of 2001.Office of National Statistics
The town lies alongside the dual carriageway north-south A470, between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil. The A4054, running north and south of the town, was the former main road, and like the A470, follows the Taff Valley. South of the town is the A473, for Llantrisant and Pencoed. To the west is the A4058, which follows the River Rhondda to Porth and the Rhondda Valley beyond.

==History==

The name Pontypridd is from "Pont-y-tŷ-pridd" the Welsh for "bridge by the earthen house", a reference to a succession of wooden bridges that formerly spanned the River Taff at this point.

===Old Bridge===

Pontypridd is noted for its Old Bridge, a stone construction across the River Taff built in 1756 by William Edwards. This was Edward's third attempt and at the time of construction was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in the world. Rising [tpl]convert|35|ft[/tpl] above the level of the river, the bridge forms a perfect segment of a circle, the chord of which is [tpl]convert|140|ft[/tpl]. Notable features are the three holes of differing diameters through each end of the bridge, the purpose of which is to reduce weight. On completion, questions were soon raised as to the utility of the bridge, the steepness of the design making it difficult to get horses and carts across. As a result a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge paid for by public subscription, was built adjacent to the old one in 1857.  Pontypridd was known as Newbridge from shortly after the construction of the Old Bridge until the 1860s.

===Coal===

The history of Pontypridd is closely tied to the coal and iron industries, prior to the developments of these Pontypridd was largely a rural backwater comprising a few farmsteads, with Treforest initially becoming the main urban settlement in the area.  Sited as it is at the junction of the three valleys, it became an important location for the transportation of coal from the Rhondda and iron from Merthyr Tydfil, first via the Glamorganshire Canal and later via the Taff Vale Railway, to the ports at Cardiff, Barry and to Newport.  Because of its role in transporting coal cargo, its railway platform is thought to have once been the longest in the world during its heyday.Pontypridd Town Website  Pontypridd was in the second half of the 19th century a hive of industry, and was once nicknamed the ‘Wild West’.[tpl]cite web|author=http://www.pontytown.co.uk |url=http://www.pontytown.co.uk/history.html |title=Official Pontypridd Town web site & mesage board |publisher=Pontytown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23[/tpl]  There were several collieries within the Pontypridd area itself, including:
As well as the deep mined collieries there were many coal levels and trial shafts dug into the hill sides overlooking the town from Cilfynydd, Graig, Graigwen and Hafod. The Albion Colliery in the village of Cilfynydd in 1894 was the site of one of the worst explosions within the South Wales coalfield, with the death of 290 colliers (see Keir Hardie).

===Iron and Steel===

Other instrumental industries in Pontypridd were the - Brown Lenox/Newbridge Chain & Anchor Works south east of the town, and Crawshay’s Forest Iron, Steel & Tin Plate Works and the Taff Vale Iron Works, both in Treforest near the now University of South Wales.

===Buildings===

The town is also home to a large hospital, Dewi Sant Hospital.

==Pontypridd community==

Pontypridd community is made up of the town of Pontypridd and its immediate suburbs, settlements and villages.

==Transport links==

Pontypridd came into being because of transport, as it was on the drovers route from the south Wales coast and the Bristol Channel, to Merthyr and onwards into the hills of Brecon. Although initial expansion in the valleys occurred at Treforest due to the slower speed of the River Taff at that point, the establishment of better bridge building meant a natural flow of power to Pontypridd.

===Railway===

The establishment of Pontypridd over Treforest was finally confirmed with the building of the Glamorganshire Canal to serve the coal mines of the Rhondda valley. However, the volumes of coal extraction soon brought about the construction of the Taff Vale Railway, which, at its peak, resulted in a train passing through Pontypridd railway station every two or three minutes.'Pontypridd and The Taff Vale Railway', E. Mountford, in The Railway and Industrial Heritage of Pontypridd & District p.16 (1985), Taff-Ely BC The station is a long single island, at one point the world's longest platform, a reflection of both the narrow available geography of the steep valley side, as well as the need to accommodate many converging railways lines on what became the nineteenth-century hub of the valleys.
Due to the restrictive geography, only parcels and mail were handled at Pontypridd, while heavy freight was handled at [tpl]Stnlnk|Treforest[/tpl]. The station today, as operated by Arriva Trains Wales, reflects the reduced coal mining activity, with one up (valley) and one down platform, and only one passing loop.

===Trams/Trolleybuses/Buses===

A tram service began on 6 March 1905, running from Cilfynydd, through Pontypridd, to Treforest. It was replaced on 18 September 1930 by trolleybuses, which on 31 January 1957 were replaced by buses which replicated an almost exact route.  Today, bus services are principally provided by Veolia Transport Cymru (on the local town services and longer distance routes to Cardiff, Beddau and Talbot Green) and Stagecoach in South Wales (on long distance routes to Cardiff, Rhondda, Cynon Valley, Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly etc.).

===Twinning===

Pontypridd is twinned with Nürtingen, Esslingen, south Germany
Initial contact between the two communities occurred in 1965 with a visit by Côr Meibion Pontypridd Welsh male voice Choir to visit a choir called "Liederkranz" based in the Oberensingen area of Nürtingen. The Liederkranz returned the visit to Pontypridd one year later. On the occasion of the next visit of Côr Meibion to Nürtingen the partnership between the two communities was formally established - on 26 July 1968. Since then reciprocal visits between the two choirs has taken place on a regular basis.  It was as a result of this successful partnership that Pontypridd Urban District Council decided to have a formal Twinning link at a civic level and to join in partnership with Nürtingen. In July 1968 an agreement was signed by John Cheesman J.P., mayor of Pontypridd and Karl Gonser mayor of Nürtingen. This resulted in the first twinning link in Rhondda Cynon Taf and the longest established twinning links with Nürtingen.The History of Twinning in Rhondda Cynon Taf RCT Website
Pontypridd is also twinned with Mbale, Uganda
Pontypridd town council held an official twinning ceremony in 2005, to consolidate links with Mbale, Uganda, already established by local churches and healthcare workers, under the auspices of charity PONT, the Partnerships Overseas Networking Trust.Are Pontypridd and Rhondda Cynon Taf really twinned with places in Uganda?, PONT FAQS and PONT Background
