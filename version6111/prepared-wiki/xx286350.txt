Some scholars believe that, like Bruriah, Ima Shalom was the composite of several people. 
Ima Shalom is mentioned by name in four traditions. Three of them appear in the Babylonian Talmud (bShabbat 116a, bNedarim 20a-b, bBaba Mezia 49b).[tpl]cite journal|last=Ilan|first=Tal|title=The Quest for the Historical Beruriah, Rachel, and Imma Shalom|journal=AJS Review|year=1997|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1-17|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
