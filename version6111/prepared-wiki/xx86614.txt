==History==

Wellington School is situated to the south of the centre of the small town of Wellington. It was founded in 1837[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wellington-school.org.uk/senior/index.html|title=Welcome to Wellington School|publisher=Wellington School|accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl] as an all-boys school by Benjamin Frost (Headmaster 1837–1848). It was later purchased and run by Frost's wife and William Corner (Headmaster 1848–1879). The school first came into existence on its present site in 1837, as a private boys school. Girls were accepted in 1972.
The school's arms consist of one quarter of the Duke of Wellington's arms, the dragons represent the County of Somerset and the open book represents learning. The school  is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.
The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over. In 2003 the Princess Royal opened the Princess Royal Sports Complex, a £2.65 million indoor sports facility.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wellington-sport.org.uk/|title=Princess Royal Sports Complex|publisher=Wellington School Trading Ltd|accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wellington-school.org.uk/senior-school/prospective-parents/general-info/facilities|title=Facilities|publisher=Wellington School|accessdate=2010-11-11[/tpl]
Since September 2007, there have been no lessons on a Saturday. This has been replaced with activities that incorporate music, drama and sport as well as compulsory activities for the boarders.

==Sports==

The school has rugby pitches, cricket squares, football pitches, an all-weather pitch, all-weather training areas, tennis courts, squash courts, climbing wall and an indoor swimming pool.

Hockey is the most prestigious sport at Wellington.

==Chapel==

The Chapel is within the 'central' tradition of the Church of England, and the College has a full-time Chaplain. Assembly takes place there on Mondays and Wednesdays. There are Sunday services throughout term time for boarders and members of the public. The Chaplain prepares pupils for Confirmation annually. Confirmation and all the other occasional offices of the church (weddings, funerals etc.) are open to all members of the school community on request. Wellington School Chapel was built as a memorial to the pupils and staff who died during the two world wars and their names are commemorated around the walls. Each year a pupil from each boarding house remembers one former pupil specifically, researching how and where they died and a basket of flowers is laid in their memory. The chapel is a Grade II listed building.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-487378-wellington-school-war-memorial-chapel-we

==Combined Cadet Force==

The school has its own marching band and active Combined Cadet Force, founded in 1901. The Combined Cadet Force is open to senior school pupils, and boasts upwards of 170 cadets across the Royal Navy, Army and Air Force sections.
The cadets learn military based skills such as drill, weapons handling, map and compass, battlecraft, climbing, abseiling and leadership development. There are various CCF camps, military training weekends and cadet competitions each year, during which the cadets go on field manoeuvres in order to apply the skills they have learned in a practical situation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wellingtonacf.org.uk/|title=Wellington Army Cadet Force|publisher=Wellington Army Cadet Force|accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl] Wellington School is unique in having three field exercises a year, each lasting three days and two nights. There is a commissioned officer who is a full-time member of staff at Wellington School who runs the CCF. He is assisted by an experienced warrant officer. The cadets are required to present themselves for inspection by the masters in charge of each section on a weekly basis.
