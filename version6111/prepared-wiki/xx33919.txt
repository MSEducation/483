==History==

 

Alde Burgh means "old fort" although this structure, along with much of the Tudor town, has now been lost to the sea. In the 16th century, Aldeburgh was a leading port, and had a flourishing ship-building industry. Sir Francis Drake's ships Greyhound and Pelican (later renamed Golden Hind) were both built in Aldeburgh. The flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture is believed to have been built there in 1608. When the River Alde silted up and was unable to accommodate larger ships, the area went into decline. Aldeburgh survived principally as a fishing village until the nineteenth century, when it became popular as a seaside resort. Much of its distinctive and whimsical architecture derives from this period. The river is now home to a yacht club and a sailing club.

==Geography==

Aldeburgh is on the North Sea coast and is located around [tpl]convert|87|mi|km[/tpl] north-east of London, [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] north-east of Ipswich and [tpl]convert|23|mi|km[/tpl] south of Lowestoft. Locally it is [tpl]convert|4|mi|km[/tpl] south of the town of Leiston and [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] south of the village of Thorpeness. It lies just to the north of the River Alde with the narrow shingle spit of Orford Ness all that stops the river meeting the sea at Aldeburgh - instead it flows another [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] to the south-west.
The beach is mainly shingle and wide in places with fishing boats able to be drawn up onto the beach above the high tide. The beach was awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005 and becomes narrower at the neck of Orford Ness. The shingle bank allows access to the Ness from the north, passing a Martello tower and two yacht clubs at the site of the former village of Slaughden. Aldeburgh was flooded during the North Sea flood of 1953 and flood defences around the town were strengthened as a result.Alde and Ore estuary gets new flood defence partnership, BBC Suffolk news website, 2012-05-17.

Aldeburgh has its own Town Council and is within the Suffolk Coastal Non-metropolitan district.
It is also within the Suffolk Coastal parliamentary constituency and is represented by Therese Coffey and had from 1983 to 2010 been represented by John Gummer. It is often regarded as a safe seat for the Conservative Party.
Aldeburgh was a Parliamentary Borough from 1571, and returned two Members of Parliament, the right to vote being vested in the Freemen of the town. Latterly it was considered a rotten borough, and lost its representation in the Great Reform Act of 1832.
Aldeburgh was the first British town to elect a female mayor: Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, in 1908.
At the age of 15, Sam Wright became Aldeburgh's town crier and mace barer - the youngest in the world.

===Lifeboat Station===

===Moot Hall===

The Aldeburgh Moot Hall is a Grade I listed timber-framed building which has been used for council meetings for over 400 years. The Town Clerk's office is still there and it also houses the local museum. It was built in about 1520 and altered in 1654. The brick and stone infilling of the ground floor is later. The hall was restored and the external staircase and gable ends were rebuilt in 1854-5, under the direction of R. M. Phipson, the chief architect of the Diocese of Norwich, in which Aldeburgh then stood. There are 64 other listed historic buildings and monuments in the town.The English Heritage site gives an architectural description of each: Retrieved 30 July 2011.

===Martello Tower===

A unique quatrefoil Martello Tower stands at the isthmus leading to the Orford Ness shingle spit. It is the largest and northernmost of 103 English defensive towers built between 1808 and 1812 to resist a Napoleonic invasion. The Landmark Trust now runs it as holiday apartments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bookings.landmarktrust.org.uk/BuildingDetails/Overview/199/Martello_Tower |title=The Landmark Trust | Martello Tower |publisher=Bookings.landmarktrust.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]
The Martello Tower is the only surviving building of the fishing village of Slaughden, which had been washed away by the North Sea by 1936. Near the Martello Tower at Slaughden Quay are the barely visible remains of the fishing smack Ionia. It had become stuck in the treacherous mud of the River Alde, and was then used as a houseboat. In 1974 it was burnt, as it had become too unsafe.

===Fort Green Mill===

A four-storey windmill at the southern end of the town has been converted to residential use. It was built in 1824 and converted into a house in 1902.

===WW2 Tank Trap===

A WW2 tank trap can be seen next to Slaughden Road.[tpl]cite web|title=Tank Barrier Aldeburgh|url=http://en.tracesofwar.com/article/23964/Tank-Barrier-Aldeburgh.htm|work=tracesofwar.com|accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl]

===The Scallop===

On Aldeburgh's beach, a short distance north of the town centre, stands a sculpture, The Scallop, dedicated to Benjamin Britten, who used to walk along the beach in the afternoons. Created from stainless steel by Suffolk-based artist Maggi Hambling, it stands four metres high, and was unveiled in November 2003. The piece is made up of two interlocking scallop shells, each broken, the upright shell being pierced with the words: "I hear those voices that will not be drowned", which are taken from Britten's opera Peter Grimes. The sculpture is meant to be enjoyed both visually and tactilely, and people are encouraged to sit on it and watch the sea. Approached along the road from the Thorpeness direction it has a totally different silhouette appearing to be a knight on a rearing charger.
The sculpture is controversial in the local area.[tpl]cite web|title=The Aldeburgh Scallop: Have your say!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2004/11/08/scallop_aldeburgh_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Suffolk|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl]  Some people consider that it is inappropriate for a man-made object to spoil a beautiful natural setting. It has been vandalised with graffiti and paint on thirteen occasions, as of January 2012,[tpl]cite web|title=Aldeburgh: Scallop vandal fails to cover their tracks|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/aldeburgh_scallop_vandal_fails_to_cover_their_tracks_1_1168800|publisher=East Anglian Daily times|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl] and there have been petitions to have it removed.

==Notable people==

In recent years the town and region have attracted a number of artists including Young British Artists members Sarah Lucas, who now lives in the former residence of Benjamin Britten, Abigail Lane, Gary Hume and Gavin Turk.

==Culture==

Outside the town, the Snape Maltings is the venue for the Aldeburgh Festival held every June.
The town of Aldeburgh or "Owlbarrow" is the setting of a series of children's illustrated books centred on Orlando (The Marmalade Cat) written by Kathleen Hale, who spent holidays in the town. Many of the illustrations in the books feature landmarks in the town, most notably the Moot Hall. The town also features prominently in the thriller Cross of Fire written by novelist Colin Forbes, as well as the nearby villages of Dunwich, Snape Maltings.[tpl]cite web|last=Diwekar |first=Rujuta |url=http://www.flipkart.com/cross-fire-colin-forbes/0330322419-4tw3f9a26g |title=Cross of Fire 0330322419: Book: COLIN FORBES (9780330322416) |publisher=Flipkart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]
Aldeburgh is also notable for its fish and chip shop. Owned and run by the Cooney family since the 1970s, it has been described in The Times as "possibly the finest on the east coast".
The Suffolk Craft Society hold an annual themed exhibition in the Peter Pears Gallery over July and August.  This is the annual showcase for the finest and most recent work made by members.
Aldeburgh Carnival takes place annually in August, with a continuous history dating back to at least 1892 and possibly as far back as 1832 when "Ye Olde Marine Regatta" was mentioned. The focal point of the carnival today is the Carnival Procession featuring locals and visitors dressed in home-made costumes and on floats, often with a topical or local theme. In the evening, a parade with Chinese lanterns and a firework display are traditional.  The Procession has been led for over 30 years by Chief Marshal Trevor Harvey, also a Carnival Committee member for over 50 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aldeburghcarnival.com/ |title=Aldeburgh, Suffolk |publisher=Aldeburgh Carnival |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]

===Fishing===

Aldeburgh is notable for its line fishing for amateur anglers; "a great spot for bass, flounders, sole, dabs, cod, whiting and eels".[tpl]cite web|title=A guide to fishing in Suffolk|url=http://suffolk.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/guide-to-fishing-on-the-suffolk-coast-cook-eat-23661/|publisher=East Anglian Daily Times|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl] However, the East Anglian Daily Times says "countless years of commercial over-fishing has all but destroyed many of our Suffolk's offshore sea fisheries" and traditional, sustainable inshore fishing is under threat, with likely knock-on effects for the coastal community.[tpl]cite web|title=2011 Conference: An Appetite for Change: Suffolk & the Sea|url=http://www.aldeburghfoodanddrink.co.uk/conference/programme/|publisher=Aldeburgh Food & Drink Festival|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl] Local fishermen have featured in the "Fish Fight" campaigns of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Greenpeace, supporting small scale inshore fishermen.[tpl]cite web|title=The Last Fishermen|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/last-fishermen-film|publisher=Greenpeace UK|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl]"Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's Fish Fight and Greenpeace in association with NUTFA (the New Under Ten Fishermen's Association) are campaigning to support the UK inshore fishing industry."[tpl]cite web|title=From ship to Shaw|url=http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/1015/from-ship-to-shaw.html|publisher=Places & Faces Magazine|accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl]
