==Biography==

Balboni started working for Lamborghini on April 21, 1968 as a mechanic apprentice in the company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/lamborghini/07/valentino_balboni/2307.html|title=Legendary Lamborghini Test Driver Valentino Balboni Celebrates 40 Years With The Bull|work=italiaspeed.com|date=July 23, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2010[/tpl] Eventually he was personally asked by the founder of the company, Ferruccio Lamborghini, to test-drive the newly built cars alongside Bob Wallace. Valentino Balboni has reportedly driven about 80% of all Lamborghinis ever built. Among the marque aficionados, Balboni has risen to cult status. In 2008, Balboni was still active for the company as the chief test-driver and ambassador. Fluent in English and German, he often appeared at different Lamborghini-related events, such as the unveiling of new models.
In July 2009, Lamborghini announced a special edition run of 250 Gallardo LP550-2 "Valentino Balboni edition" supercars; the company stated that the new car was to be rear-wheel driven in accordance with Balboni's preference for the thrill of cornering a rear-wheel driven vehicle. These vehicles were also made special with a white and gold stripe that runs the center of the car, inspired by sports cars of the 1970s.
Balboni, even though officially retired as chief test driver, has signed a two year contract with Lamborghini as a consultant through 2010 that can be renewed multiple times.
Valentino Balboni said that the first car that got him excited about cars was a silver Bizzarrini GT 5300 that he saw at the Turin car show in 1966.http://mycarquest.com/2011/08/valentino-balboni-and-the-silver-bizzarrini-gt-5300.html

In the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, one of the characters asks a salesman at a Lamborghini dealer "...is that a Balboni?", referring to the special edition vehicle.
