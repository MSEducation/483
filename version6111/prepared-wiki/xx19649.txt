[[Hangman's knot]]

CATEGORIES: Execution equipment, Hanging, Running knots

The hangman's knot or hangman's noose (also known as a collar during the Elizabethan era) is a well-known knot most often associated with its use in hanging a person. For a hanging, the knot of the rope is typically placed under or just behind the left ear. When the condemned drops to the end of the rope, the force is supposed to break the neck. The knot is non-jamming but tends to resist attempts to loosen it. 

==Number of coils==

Each additional coil adds friction to the knot, which makes the noose harder to pull closed or open. The number of coils should therefore be adjusted depending on the intended use, the type and thickness of rope, and environmental conditions such as wet or greasy rope. Six to eight loops are normal when using natural ropes. One coil makes it equivalent to the simple slip knot.
The number thirteen was thought to be unlucky.  Consequently, thirteen coils were found in a hangmanâ€™s noose, a foreboding sign for those convicted to be hanged.
Woody Guthrie sings of the hangman using thirteen coils:
 Did you ever see a hangman tie a hangknot?
 I've seen it many a time and he winds, he winds,
After thirteen times he's got a hangknot.

==Other uses==

A variation of this knot is used in fishing and is called the Uni-knot. It is used to tie fishing line to terminal tackle, join two pieces of line, or for snelling hooks. It is especially useful when used with slick braided line as more coils can be added to increase the friction of the knot and will not let the knot pull out. It is also useful in that the knot can be pulled down tight to the lure or it can be left with a larger loop that gives the lure more freedom of movement. The hangman's noose can also be used in boating to secure an eyelet on a rope or sheet without splicing it.
