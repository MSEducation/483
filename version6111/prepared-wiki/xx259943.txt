CATEGORIES: Drymaeus, Endemic fauna of Dominica

Drymaeus laticinctus is a species of  tropical air-breathing land snail, a pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Bulimulidae. 

==Distribution==

Drymaeus laticinctus is endemic to Dominica. This appears to be a relatively rare species, only observed in some isolated localities.

==Description==

There are spirally banded and unicoloured forms. In collections the colour of the latter usually fades away and becomes white, as already observed by Henry Augustus Pilsbry (1899). His variety dominicanus of Drymaeus virginalis – a mainland taxon – appears a white specimen. This species is part of the Drymaeus multifasciatus species complex, of which a revision is pending (Breure, in preparation).

==Ecology==

Live animals were collected among fallen leaves and detritus on the ground.
