[[Sunwapta River]]

CATEGORIES: Jasper National Park, Rivers of Alberta

The Sunwapta River is a major tributary of the Athabasca River in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. 

==Course==

The headwaters of the Sunwapta River are near the Columbia Icefield in the valley west northwest of Sunwapta pass, which divides Jasper National Park from Banff National Park.  Several kilometres down the valley from the pass is Sunwapta Lake, at the toe of the Athabasca Glacier, which is considered the nominal source for the river.  The Sunwapta river then continues to run northwest through Jasper National Park, following the Icefields Parkway, and finally joins the Athabasca River shortly after Sunwapta Falls.Mussio Ventures.
