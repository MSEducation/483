==History==

The Turkic Sakha people, also known as the Yakuts, migrated to the area in the 13th and 14th centuries from other parts of Siberia due to the rising military power of the Mongols. When they arrived they mixed with other indigenous Siberians in the area.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.203.3886&rep=rep1&type=pdf
Russian Yakutsk was founded in 1632 as an ostrog (fort) by Pyotr Beketov. In 1639, it became the center of a voyevodstvo. The Yakutsk Voyevoda quickly became the most important Russian official in the region and directed expansion to the east and south.
Yakutsk did not grow into a city until the discovery of large reserves of gold and other minerals in the 1880s and 1890s. These reserves were developed extensively during industrialization under Stalin. The rapid growth of forced labor camps in Siberia was also a major factor encouraging Yakutsk's development.

As an inhabited locality, Yakutsk is classified as a city under republic jurisdiction.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with the settlement of Zhatay and eleven rural localities, incorporated as the city of republic significance of Yakutsk—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts.

==Transportation==

Yakutsk is a destination of the Lena Highway. The city's connection to the highway is only accessible by ferry in the summer, or in the dead of winter, directly over the frozen Lena River, as Yakutsk lies entirely on its western bank, and there is no bridge anywhere in the Sakha Republic that crosses the Lena. The river is impassable for long periods of the year when it contains loose ice, when the ice cover is not thick enough to support traffic, or when the water level is too high and the river turbulent with spring flooding. The highway ends on the eastern bank of Lena in Nizhny Bestyakh (Нижний Бестях), an urban-type settlement of some four thousand people. Yakutsk is connected with Magadan by the Kolyma Highway.
A road bridge over the Lena is scheduled to be built by 2020."Lena River Bridge to Provide Hope and Fruit" Link accessed March 15, 2014.

The railway reached the settlement of Nizhny Bestyakh, on the opposite bank of the Lena from Yakutsk, in November 2011.Russian Berkakit-Tommot-Nizhny Bestyakh line completed
The bridge will be over [tpl]convert|3|km|sp=us[/tpl] long and constructed [tpl]convert|40|km|sp=us[/tpl] upriver at Tabaga, where the river narrows and does not create a wide flooded area in spring. In the dead of winter, the frozen Lena makes for a passable highway for ice truckers using its channel to deliver provisions to far-flung outposts. Yakutsk is also connected to other parts of Russia by Yakutsk Airport.

==Education and research==

M.K.Ammosov North-Eastern Federal University is situated in the city. There is also a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which contains, among other things, the Institute of Cosmophysical Research, which runs the Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower installation (one of the largest cosmic-ray detector arrays in the world), and the Yakutsk Permafrost Institute developed with the aim of solving the serious and costly problems associated with construction of buildings on frozen soil.
At the primary and secondary levels, the city has a number of UNESCO Associated Schools, including the Sakha-Turkish College, Sakha-French School, Sakha-Korean School, and School #16.[tpl]Cite news |periodical=Yakutia Today|title=The Most Valuable Possession of a Society is Education |first= Michael E.|last=Nikolaev|date=January 7, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2009 |url= http://www.yakutiatoday.com/region/education_article_nikolaev.shtml[/tpl]

==Climate==

With an extreme subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfd), Yakutsk has the coldest winter temperatures for any city. Average monthly temperatures range from [tpl]convert|+19.5|C[/tpl] in July to [tpl]convert|-38.6|C[/tpl] in January, and only Norilsk has a lower mean annual temperature for any settlement of over 100,000.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] The coldest temperatures ever recorded on the planet outside Antarctica occurred in the basin of the Yana River to the northeast of Yakutsk. Although winters are long and extremely cold, summers are warm (though rather short), with daily maximum temperatures occasionally exceeding [tpl]convert|+30|C[/tpl], making the seasonal temperature differences for the region among the greatest in the world. The lowest temperature recorded in Yakutsk was [tpl]convert|-64.4|C[/tpl] and the highest was [tpl]convert|+38.4|C[/tpl]. Yakutsk is the biggest city built on continuous permafrost, and most houses there are built on concrete piles. Yakutsk has a distinct inland location, being almost 1000 kilometres from the Pacific Ocean, which coupled with the high latitude means exposure to severe winters and also lack of temperature moderation, which sees July temperatures soar to an above-normal average for this parallel, with the July average being comparable to summer temperatures in Paris, Moscow, Sydney, Cape Town and on average warmer than the Los Angeles coastline.
The climate is quite dry, with maximum precipitation occurring in the summer months, due to the intense Siberian High forming around the very cold continental air during the winter. Even during the summer, precipitation is not heavy since the moist southeasterly winds from the Pacific Ocean lose their moisture over the coastal mountains well before reaching the Lena valley.
With the Lena River navigable in the summer, there are various boat cruises offered, including upriver to the Lena Pillars, and downriver tours which visit spectacular scenery in the lower reaches and the Lena delta.

==Culture==

The cultural life of Yakutsk is developing constantly.
There are several theatres: the State Russian drama theatre, named after A. S. Pushkin; the Sakha Theater, named after P. A. Oiyunsky; the Suorun Omoloon Young Spectator's Theatre; and the State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre, named after D. K. Sivtsev.
There are a number of interesting museums as well: the National Fine Arts Museum of Sakha; the Museum of Local Lore and History, named after E. Yaroslavsky; and the only museums in the world dedicated to the khomus and permafrost.
