The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is an American multinational investment banking firm that engages in global investment banking, securities, investment management, and other financial services primarily with institutional clients.
Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 and is headquartered at 200 West Street in the Lower Manhattan area of New York City, with additional offices in international financial centers. The firm provides mergers and acquisitions advice, underwriting services, asset management, and prime brokerage to its clients, which include corporations, governments and individuals. The firm also engages in market making and private equity deals, and is a primary dealer in the United States Treasury security market. It is recognized as one of the premier investment banks in the world,"Goldman Named 'The Most Prestigious European Bank' by Vault.com"."Goldman Number 1 in Prestige Rankings by Vault.com". but has sparked a great deal of controversy over its alleged improper practices, including the loosening of financial industry underwriting guidelines which had been intact since the 1930s, and in particular its actions since the 2007–2012 global financial crisis."'Since the Depression, there were strict underwriting guidelines that Wall Street adhered to when taking a company public,' says one prominent hedge-fund manager. 'The company had to be in business a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash.' Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks. 'Their analysts were out there saying Bullshit.com is worth $100 a share.' The problem was, nobody had told investors that the rules had changed. 'Everyone on the inside knew,' the manager said. 'Bob Rubin sure as hell knew what the underwriting standards were. They had been intact since the 1930s.'" Taibbi, Matt. The Great American Bubble Machine, Rolling Stone, July 9–23, 2009; posted online April 5, 2010; accessed December 27, 2013.
Former Goldman executives who moved on to government positions include: Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson who served as United States Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively; Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank; Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada 2008–13 and Governor of the Bank of England from July 2013.

==History==

===1869–1930===

Goldman Sachs was founded in  New York in 1869 by the German-born Marcus Goldman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/our-firm/locations/united-states/history-growth.html|title=History and Growth|publisher=Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.|accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Leah Nathans |last=Spiro |first2=Stanley|last2=Reed |title=Inside the Money Machine–In a big-is-all business, Goldman vows to go it alone |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/51/b3558118.htm |work=BusinessWeek |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. |date=December 22, 1997 |accessdate=January 17, 2007[/tpl] In 1882, Goldman's son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined the firm.[tpl]cite news|author=Monday, Nov. 09, 1936 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770464-1,00.html |title=Business & Finance: Cash & Comeback |publisher=Time.com |date=1936-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090627093154/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770464-1,00.html |archivedate=2009-06-27 |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] In 1885, Goldman took his son Henry and his son-in-law Ludwig Dreyfuss into the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co.[tpl]Cite book|last=Endlich|first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Endlich|title=Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success |publisher=A.A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-679-45080-1|page=34[/tpl] The company made a name for itself pioneering the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1896.[tpl]cite book|author=William D. Cohan|title=Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-241-95406-5[/tpl] By 1898, the firm's capital stood at $1.6 million, and was growing rapidly.
Goldman entered the IPO market in 1906 when it took Sears, Roebuck and Company public. The deal occurred due to Henry Goldman's personal friendship with the owner of Sears, Julius Rosenwald. Other IPOs followed, including F. W. Woolworth and Continental Can.
In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-family member and non-Jew to become partner.
In 1917, under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned. Control of the firm was now in the hands of the Sachs family.
Waddill Catchings joined the company in 1918.
In 1920, the firm moved from 60 Wall Street to $1.5 million 12-storey premises on 30-32 Pine Street.
By 1928, Catchings was the Goldman parter with the single largest stake in the firm.
On December 4, 1928, the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp. a closed-end fund. The fund failed during the Stock Market Crash of 1929, amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading. Fortunately for the firm, insider trading would not be made illegal in the United States until 1934.

===1930–1980===

In 1930, the firm ousted Catchings, and Sidney Weinberg assumed the role of senior partner and shifted Goldman's focus away from trading and towards investment banking.[tpl]cite book|author=William D. Cohan|title=Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-241-95406-5[/tpl] It was Weinberg's actions that helped to restore some of Goldman's tarnished reputation. On the back of Weinberg, Goldman was lead advisor on the Ford Motor Company's IPO in 1956, which at the time was a major coup on Wall Street. Under Weinberg's reign the firm also started an investment research division and a municipal bond department. It also was at this time that the firm became an early innovator in risk arbitrage.
Gus Levy joined the firm in the 1950s as a securities trader, which started a trend at Goldman where there would be two powers generally vying for supremacy, one from investment banking and one from securities trading. For most of the 1950s and 1960s, this would be Weinberg and Levy. Levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance. Due to Weinberg's heavy influence at the firm, it formed an investment banking division in 1956 in an attempt to spread around influence and not focus it all on Weinberg.
In 1969, Levy took over as Senior Partner from Weinberg, and built Goldman's trading franchise once again. It is Levy who is credited with Goldman's famous philosophy of being "long-term greedy", which implied that as long as money is made over the long term, trading losses in the short term were not to be worried about. At the same time, partners reinvested almost all of their earnings in the firm, so the focus was always on the future.[tpl]Cite book|last=Endlich|first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Endlich|title=Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success |publisher=A.A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-679-45080-1|page=18[/tpl] That same year, Weinberg retired from the firm.
Another financial crisis for the firm occurred in 1970, when the Penn Central Transportation Company went bankrupt with over $80 million in commercial paper outstanding, most of it issued through Goldman Sachs. The bankruptcy was large, and the resulting lawsuits, notably by the SEC, threatened the partnership capital, life and reputation of the firm.
It was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings being created for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][/ref]
During the 1970s, the firm also expanded in several ways. Under the direction of Senior Partner Stanley R. Miller, it opened its first international office in London in 1970, and created a private wealth division along with a fixed income division in 1972. It also pioneered the "white knight" strategy in 1974 during its attempts to defend Electric Storage Battery against a hostile takeover bid from International Nickel and Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. This action would boost the firm's reputation as an investment advisor because it pledged to no longer participate in hostile takeovers.
John L. Weinberg (the son of Sidney Weinberg), and John C. Whitehead assumed roles of co-senior partners in 1976, once again emphasizing the co-leadership at the firm. One of their initiatives[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] was the establishment of 14 business principles that the firm still claims to apply.

===1980–1999===

On November 16, 1981, the firm acquired J. Aron & Company, a commodities trading firm which merged with the Fixed Income division to become known as Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities. J. Aron was a player in the coffee and gold markets, and the current CEO of Goldman, Lloyd Blankfein, joined the firm as a result of this merger. In 1985 it underwrote the public offering of the real estate investment trust that owned Rockefeller Center, then the largest REIT offering in history. In accordance with the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments.
In 1986, the firm formed Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which manages the majority of its mutual funds and hedge funds today. In the same year, the firm also underwrote the IPO of Microsoft, advised General Electric on its acquisition of RCA and joined the London and Tokyo stock exchanges. 1986 also was the year when Goldman became the first United States bank to rank in the top 10 of mergers and acquisitions in the United Kingdom. During the 1980s the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deep-discount bond.
Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman assumed the Co-Senior Partnership in 1990 and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm and strengthening the Merger & Acquisition and Trading business lines. During their reign, the firm introduced paperless trading to the New York Stock Exchange and lead-managed the first-ever global debt offering by a U.S. corporation. It also launched the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) and opened a Beijing office in 1994.
Also in 1994, Jon Corzine assumed leadership of the firm as CEO, following the departure of Rubin and Friedman.
Another momentous event in Goldman's history was the Mexican bailout of 1995. Rubin drew criticism in Congress for using a Treasury Department account under his personal control to distribute $20 billion to bail out Mexican bonds, of which Goldman was a key distributor. On November 22, 1994, the Mexican Bolsa stock market had admitted Goldman Sachs and one other firm to operate on that market.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/22/business/bolsa-admits-2-foreign-firms.html |work=New York Times |date=November 22, 1994 |title=Bolsa Admits 2 Foreign Firms |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl] The 1994 economic crisis in Mexico threatened to wipe out the value of Mexico's bonds held by Goldman Sachs.
The firm joined David Rockefeller and partners in a 50–50 joint ownership of Rockefeller Center during 1994, but later sold the shares to Tishman Speyer in 2000. In 1996, Goldman was lead underwriter of the Yahoo! IPO and in 1998 it was global coordinator of the NTT DoCoMo IPO.
In 1999, Henry Paulson took over as Senior Partner.

===Since 1999===

One of the largest events in the firm's history was its own IPO in 1999. The decision to go public was one that the partners debated for decades. In the end, Goldman decided to offer only a small portion of the company to the public, with some 48% still held by the partnership pool. 22% of the company was held by non-partner employees, and 18% was held by retired Goldman partners and two longtime investors, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Hawaii's Kamehameha Activities Assn (the investing arm of Kamehameha Schools). This left approximately 12% of the company as being held by the public. With the firm's 1999 IPO, Paulson became Chairman and  CEO of the firm. As of 2009, after further stock offerings to the public, Goldman is 67% owned by institutions (such as pension funds and other banks).[tpl]cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/ownership?Symbol=GS |work=MSN Money |publisher=Microsoft |date=July 13, 2009 |title=Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Ownership |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070418054553/http://moneycentral.msn.com/ownership?Symbol=GS |archivedate=2007-04-18 |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl]
In 1999, Goldman acquired Hull Trading Company, one of the world's premier market-making firms, for $531 million. More recently, the firm has been busy both in investment banking and in trading activities. It purchased Spear, Leeds, & Kellogg, one of the largest specialist firms on the New York Stock Exchange, for $6.3 billion in September 2000. It also advised on a debt offering for the Government of China and the first electronic offering for the World Bank. In 2003 it took a 45% stake in a joint venture with JBWere, the Australian investment bank. In 2009 The Private Wealth Management arm of JBWere was sold into a joint venture with National Australia Bank. Goldman opened a full-service broker-dealer in Brazil in 2007, after having set up an investment banking office in 1996. It expanded its investments in companies to include Burger King, McJunkin Corporation,Merger Transaction Closes, Forming Mcjunkin Red Man Corporation With Co-Headquarters In Charleston, Wv And Tulsa, Ok. Mrcglobal.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-16. and in January 2007, Alliance Atlantis alongside CanWest Global Communications to own sole broadcast rights to the all three CSI series. The firm is also heavily involved in energy trading, including oil, on both a principal and agent basis.
In May 2006, Paulson left the firm to serve as U.S. Treasury Secretary, and Lloyd C. Blankfein was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Former Goldman employees have headed the New York Stock Exchange, the World Bank, the U.S. Treasury Department, the White House staff, and firms such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.

====Actions in the 2007–2008 mortgage crisis====

During the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman was able to profit from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in the summer of 2007 by short-selling subprime mortgage-backed securities. Two Goldman traders, Michael Swenson and Josh Birnbaum, are credited with being responsibile for the firm's large profits during the crisis."Goldman’s uneasy subprime short". Financial Times.Subprime star Josh Birnbaum leaves Goldman. The Telegraph. The pair, members of Goldman's structured products group in  New York, made a profit of $4 billion by "betting" on a collapse in the sub-prime market, and shorting mortgage-related securities. By summer 2007, they persuaded colleagues to see their point of view and convinced skeptical risk management executives.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/dec/21/goldmansachs.useconomy |title=Success shines unwelcome spotlight on to Goldman Sachs|work=The Guardian |date=December 21, 2007 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Clark |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] The firm initially avoided large subprime writedowns, and achieved a net profit due to significant losses on non-prime securitized loans being offset by gains on short mortgage positions. Its sizable profits made during the initial subprime mortgage crisis led the New York Times to proclaim that Goldman Sachs is without peer in the world of finance.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/goldman-sachs-marches-on-with-bushs-candidate-for-world-bank-451094.html |title=Goldman Sachs marches on with Bush's candidate for World Bank |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=May 15, 2008 | first=Leonard | last=Doyle | date=May 31, 2007[/tpl] The firm's viability was later called into question as the crisis intensified in September 2008.
On October 15, 2007, as the crisis had begun to unravel, Allan Sloan, a senior editor for Fortune magazine, said:[tpl]cite news |title=Junk mortgages under the microscope |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/10/15/markets/junk_mortgages.fortune/index.htm |date=October 16, 2007 |first=Allan |last=Sloan |authorlink=Allan Sloan |publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 24, 2010[/tpl]
 So let's reduce this macro story to human scale. Meet GSAMP Trust 2006-S3, a $494 million drop in the junk-mortgage bucket, part of the more than half-a-trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities issued last year. We found this issue by asking mortgage mavens to pick the worst deal they knew of that had been floated by a top-tier firm – and this one's pretty bad.
  It was sold by Goldman Sachs – GSAMP originally stood for Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products but now has become a name itself, like AT&T and 3M.
  This issue, which is backed by ultra-risky second-mortgage loans, contains all the elements that facilitated the housing bubble and bust. It's got speculators searching for quick gains in hot housing markets; it's got loans that seem to have been made with little or no serious analysis by lenders; and finally, it's got Wall Street, which churned out mortgage "product" because buyers wanted it. As they say on the Street, "When the ducks quack, feed them."
 
On September 21, 2008, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last two major investment banks in the United States, both confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies, bringing an end to the era of investment banking on Wall Street.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSNWEN838420080922 |title=Goldman Sachs to be regulated by Fed |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=September 21, 2008 | first=Jessica | last=Hall | date=September 22, 2008[/tpl]Wall Street in crisis: Last banks standing give up investment bank status, The Guardian, September 22, 2008 The Federal Reserve's approval of their bid to become banks ended the ascendancy of the securities firms, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America Corp.Goldman, Morgan Stanley Bring Down Curtain on an Era, bloomberg, September 22, 2008Duke, Simon Goldman Sachs ready to hand out £7bn salary and bonus package... after its £6bn bail-out Mail on line.
According to a 2009 BrandAsset Valuator survey taken of 17,000 people nationwide, the firm's reputation suffered in 2008 and 2009, and rival Morgan Stanley was respected more than Goldman Sachs, a reversal of the sentiment in 2006. Goldman refused to comment on the findings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae3d459a-7f8e-11de-85dc-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss |title=Goldman Sachs Reputation Tarnished|work=Financial Times|date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2011-11-02[/tpl]

====TARP and Berkshire Hathaway investment====

On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway agreed to purchase $5 billion in Goldman's preferred stock, and also received warrants to buy another $5 billion in Goldman's common stock, exercisable for a five-year term.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/press/press-releases/archived/2008/berkshire-hathaway-invest.print.html |title=Berkshire Hathaway to Invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs |publisher=.goldmansachs.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2011-11-02[/tpl] Goldman also received a $10 billion preferred stock investment from the U.S. Treasury in October 2008, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/15/AR2007101501435.html | work=The Washington Post | title=An Unsavory Slice of Subprime | first=Allan | last=Sloan | date=October 16, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl]

====Use of Federal Reserve's Emergency Liquidity Programs====

During the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of short-term credit and liquidity facilities to help stabilize markets. Some of the transactions under these facilities provided liquidity to institutions whose disorderly failure could have severely stressed an already fragile financial system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20101201a.htm |title="FRB: Press Release – Federal Reserve releases detailed information about transactions conducted to stabilize markets during the recent financial crisis".

Goldman Sachs was one of the heaviest users of these loan facilities, taking out numerous loans from March 18, 2008 – April 22, 2009. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the first Fed facility ever to provide overnight loans to investment banks, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $589 billion against collateral such as corporate market instruments and mortgage-backed securities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_pdcf.htm |title="Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)".

====Twitter IPO====

Goldman Sachs was the lead underwriter (lead left) for Twitter’s initial public offering in 2013. At the time, Goldman’s position as lead underwriter was considered “one of the biggest tech prizes around”.[tpl]cite web|title=Goldman Sachs wins prime role in Twitter IPO|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/095fd274-1c59-11e3-8894-00144feab7de.html#axzz2xXQJNABL|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=1 April 2014|author=Arash Massoudi|coauthors=Tracy Alloway|date=September 13, 2013|quote=Goldman has now scored one of the biggest tech prizes around.[/tpl]

According to regulatory filings the underwriting banks received 3.25 percent of the $1.82 billion raised by Twitter’s IPO. That came to approximately $59.2 million which was shared among the underwriters, with the lead left bank, Goldman Sachs, receiving a larger, proportionate share. Of the 70 million shares offered on November 7 in Twitter’s IPO, Goldman Sachs was responsible for placing 27 million, entitling them to 39 percent of the entire fee pool, or about $22.8 million. Chief economist and strategist at ZT Wealth said, “Goldman being the first name on the S-1 has little to do with fees. This is about Goldman rebalancing itself as a serious leader and competing with Morgan Stanley’s dominant position in technology.”[tpl]cite news|title=Goldman-Led Twitter Underwriters Share $59.2 Million in IPO Fees|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/goldman-led-twitter-underwriters-to-make-59-2-million-from-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=1 April 2014|author=Lee Spears|coauthors=Leslie Picker|date=November 7, 2013[/tpl]

Investors have been complaining that the bank has near 11,000 more staffers than it did in 2005, but performances of workers were drastically in decline. In 2011, Goldman's 33,300 employees generated $28.8 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in profit, but it represents a 25 percent decline in revenue per worker and a 71 percent decline in profit per worker compared with 2005. The staff cuts in its trading and investment banking divisions are possible as the company continues to reduce costs to raise profitability. In 2011, the company reduced its workforce by 2,400 positions.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-goldman-jobcuts-idUSBRE82I11A20120319 |title=Goldman Sachs cuts staff in annual review process |date=March 19, 2012 | work=Reuters[/tpl]

===Organization===

====Investment banking====

Investment banking is divided into two divisions and includes Financial Advisory (mergers and acquisitions, investitures, corporate defense activities, restructuring and spin-offs) and Underwriting (public offerings and private placements of equity, equity-related and debt instruments). Goldman Sachs is one of the leading M&A advisory firms, often topping the league tables in terms of transaction size. The firm gained a reputation as a white knight in the mergers and acquisitions sector by advising clients on how to avoid hostile takeovers, moves generally viewed as unfriendly to shareholders of targeted companies. Goldman Sachs, for a long time during the 1980s, was the only major investment bank with a strict policy against helping to initiate a hostile takeover, which increased the firm's reputation immensely among sitting management teams at the time. The investment banking segment accounts for around 17 percent of Goldman Sachs' revenues.Based on SEC filings for the last twelve months ending May 31, 2008.
The firm has been involved in brokering deals to privatize major highways by selling them to foreign investors, in addition to advising state and local governments – including Indiana, Texas, and Chicago – on privatization projects.

====Trading and principal investments====

Trading and Principal Investments is the largest of the three segments, and is the company's profit center.[tpl]cite news|last=Harper |first=Christine |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=akv.Eg65H9DI&refer=home |title=Goldman Had More Trading-Loss Days Than Morgan Stanley, Lehman |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2008-04-09 |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] The segment is divided into four divisions and includes Fixed Income (The trading of interest rate and credit products, mortgage-backed securities, insurance-linked securities and structured and derivative products), Currency and Commodities (The trading of currencies and commodities), Equities (The trading of equities, equity derivatives, structured products, options, and futures contracts), and Principal Investments (merchant banking investments and funds). This segment consists of the revenues and profit gained from the Bank's trading activities, both on behalf of its clients (known as flow trading) and for its own account (known as proprietary trading).
Most trading done by Goldman is not speculative, but rather an attempt to profit from bid-ask spreads in the process of acting as a market maker.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]  On average, around 68 percent of Goldman's revenues and profits are derived from trading. Upon its IPO, Goldman predicted that this segment would not grow as fast as its Investment Banking division and would be responsible for a shrinking proportion of earnings. The opposite has been true however, resulting in now-CEO Blankfein's appointment to President and Chief Operating Officer after John Thain's departure to run the NYSE and John L. Thornton's departure for an academic position in China.

=====Distressed-debt investment=====

In June 2013, Goldman Sachs's Special Situations Group, the proprietary investment unit of the investment bank, purchased a $863 million portion of Brisbane-based Suncorp Group Limited's loan portfolio.[tpl]cite news|title=Distressed-Debt Investors Eye Asia|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/08/07/distressed-debt-investors-look-toward-asia/?mod=e2tw|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013[/tpl] The finance, insurance, and banking corporation is one of Australia's largest banks (by combined lending and deposits) and its largest general insurance group.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.suncorp.com.au/suncorp/about/corporate_profile/overview.html | title=Group Overview | accessdate=2007-02-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] In 2013, distressed-debt investors, seeking investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in Australia, acquired discounted bonds or bank loans of companies facing distressed debt, with the potential of profitable returns if the companies' performance or their debt-linked assets improves. In 2013, Australia was one of the biggest markets for distressed-debt investors in the region.

====Asset management and securities services====

As the name suggests, the firm's Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services. The Asset Management division provides investment advisory and financial planning services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=GS.N|title=Company Overview (GS)|agency=Reuters |accessdate=November 21, 2009[/tpl] The unit primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees. The Securities Services division provides clearing, financing, custody, securities lending, and reporting services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, and pension funds. The division generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees.

On September 14, 2011, Goldman Sachs stated it was shutting down the Global Alpha fund, once the firm's largest hedge fund. The announcement followed a reported decline in fund balances to less than $1.7 billion in June 2011 from $11 billion in 2007. The decline was caused by investors withdrawing from the fund following earlier substantial market losses. The firm said it expected most of the fund assets to be liquidated by mid-October 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-15/goldman-sachs-shuts-global-alpha-fund-as-clients-withdraw-money.html |title=Goldman Sachs Shuts Down Global Alpha Fund After Investors Withdraw Money|first=Christine|last=Harper |date=September 16, 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.[/tpl]

Goldman Sachs expected in December 2008 to pay $14 million in taxes worldwide for 2008 compared with $6 billion the previous year, after making $2.3 billion profit and paying $10.9 billion in employee pay and benefits.

But it has also been harshly criticized, particularly in the aftermath of the 2007–2012 global financial crisis where some alleged that it misled its investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market.

Goldman has denied wrongdoing in these cases.

===Sale of Dragon Systems to Lernout & Hauspie===

In 2000, Goldman Sachs advised Dragon Systems on its sale to the Belgian company, Lernout & Hauspie. L&H later collapsed due to accounting fraud. Jim and Janet Baker, founders and together 50% owners of Dragon, filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, alleging that the firm did not warn Dragon or the Bakers of the accounting problems of the acquirer, and that this led to the loss of their portion of the sale price of $580 million, which was paid entirely in the form of the acquirer's stock. On January 23, 2013 a federal jury rejected the Bakers’ claims and found Goldman Sachs not liable to the Bakers for negligence, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-goldman-dragon-trial-idUSBRE90M1GX20130123 | work=Reuters | first=Tim | last= McLaughlin | title=Goldman cleared of all charges in doomed Dragon sale | date=January 23, 2013[/tpl]

===Involvement in the European sovereign debt crisis===

Goldman is being criticized for its involvement in the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis.

Mario Draghi, the new head of the European Central Bank, is the former managing director of Goldman Sachs International. António Borges, Head of the European Department of the International Monetary Fund in 2010-2011 and responsible for most of enterprise privatizations in Portugal since 2011, is the former Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Carlos Moedas, a former Goldman Sachs employee, is the current Secretary of State to the Prime Minister of Portugal and Director of ESAME, the agency created to monitor and control the implementation of the structural reforms agreed by the government of Portugal and the troika composed of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Peter Sutherland, former Attorney General of Ireland is a non-executive director of Goldman Sachs International. These ties between Goldman Sachs and European leaders are an ongoing source of controversy.

===Ex-employee criticism===

====Greg Smith resignation letter====

In his March 2012 resignation letter, printed as an op-ed in The New York Times, the former head of Goldman Sachs US equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) attacked the company's CEO and president for losing the company's culture, which he described as "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years". Smith said that advising clients "to do what I believe is right for them" was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a "toxic and destructive" environment in which "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as "muppets" and colleagues callously talked about "ripping their clients off".[tpl]cite news | title = Top Goldman executive quits over culture of 'toxic' greed | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9142641/Top-Goldman-executive-quits-over-culture-of-toxic-greed.html |date = 14 March 2012|deadurl=no | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/669gNQxNi | archivedate =March 14, 2012 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all | newspaper = New York Times|date=March 14, 2012| page = A27 | first=Greg|last=Smith |deadurl=no| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/669giq2le | archivedate =March 14, 2012[/tpl]
In reply, Goldman Sachs said that "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming "this fundamental truth lies at the heart of how we conduct ourselves" and that "we don't think comments reflect the way we run our business."[tpl]cite news | url = http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/14/goldman-sachs-banker-quits-toxic-firm/ | title = Goldman Sachs banker quits 'toxic' firm | first= Irene|last=Chapple | publisher = CNN | date = March 14, 2012|deadurl=no| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/669lz9cha | archivedate =March 14, 2012[/tpl] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs."An insider’s take on Goldman Sachs strikes a nerve", The Economist, October 27, 2012.

====Steven Mandis criticism====

In 2014 a book by former Goldman portfolio manager Steven George Mandis was published entitled What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider’s Story of Organizational Drift and Its Unintended Consequences.[tpl]cite web|title=What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider's Story of Organizational Drift and Its Unintended Consequences|url=http://hbr.org/product/what-happened-to-goldman-sachs-an-insider-s-story-of-organizational-drift-and-its-unintended-consequences/an/11798E-KND-ENG?referral=01240|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider's Story of Organizational Drift and Its Unintended Consequences|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290912-what-happened-to-goldman-sachs|publisher=goodreads (reviews)|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]  Mandis also has a PhD dissertation about Goldman at Columbia University.

With nostalgia, Mandis laments the deterioration of a “culture of teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing right by our clients”.

===California bonds===

On November 11, 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that Goldman Sachs had both earned $25 million from underwriting California bonds, and advised other clients to short those bonds."Goldman Sachs urged bets against California bonds it helped sell", Sharona Coutts, Marc Lifsher and Michael A.

===Personnel "revolving-door" with US government===

During 2008 Goldman Sachs received criticism for an apparent revolving door relationship, in which its employees and consultants have moved in and out of high level U.S. Government positions, creating the potential for conflicts of interest. The large number of former Goldman Sachs employees in the US government has been jokingly referred to "Government Sachs".[tpl]cite news|last=CRESWELL|first=JULIE|title=The guys from Government Sachs|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/business/19gold.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=%22government%20sachs%22&st=cse&gwh=38E33B0DB1A7BA4ADEEAD81B79101272&gwt=pay|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 17, 2008|author2=BEN WHITE[/tpl]  Former Treasury Secretary Paulson was a former CEO of Goldman Sachs. Additional controversy attended the selection of former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark Patterson as chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, despite President Barack Obama's campaign promise that he would limit the influence of lobbyists in his administration."Another Lobbyist Headed Into Obama Administration", Justin Rood and Emma Schwartz, ABCNews.com, January 27, 2009 In February 2011, the Washington Examiner reported that Goldman Sachs was "the company from which Obama raised the most money in 2008" and that its "CEO Lloyd Blankfein has visited the White House 10 times."Carney, Timothy (2011-02-23) Obama's top funder also leads the nation in White House visits[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl], Washington Examiner

====Former New York Fed Chairman's ties to the firm====

Stephen Friedman, a former director of Goldman Sachs, was named Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in January 2008. Although he had retired from Goldman in 1994, Friedman continued to own stock in the firm. Goldman's conversion from a securities firm to a bank holding company in September 2008 meant it was now regulated by the Fed and not the SEC. When it became apparent that Timothy Geithner, then president of the New York Fed, would leave his role there to become Treasury Secretary, Friedman was granted a temporary one-year waiver of a rule that forbids "class C" directors of the Fed from direct interest with those it regulates. Friedman agreed to remain on the board until the end of 2009 to provide continuity in the wake of the turmoil caused by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Had the waiver not been granted, the New York Fed would have lost both its president and its chairman (or Friedman would have had to divest his Goldman shares). This would have been highly disruptive for the New York Fed's role in the capital markets, and Friedman later said he agreed to stay on the NY Fed board out of a sense of public duty, but that his decision was "being mischaracterised as improper".Friedman, Stephen (May 7, 2009)."Letter to William Dudley and Ben Bernanke". FT Alphaville. Retrieved July 22, 2010.
Media reports in May 2009 concerning Friedman's involvement with Goldman, and in particular, his purchase of the firm's stock when it traded at historical lows in the fourth quarter of 2008,Farrell, Greg (May 8, 2009). "Friedman taken to task over Goldman deal". Financial Times (registration required). Retrieved October 5, 2009. fueled controversy and criticism over what was seen as a conflict of interest in Friedman's new role as supervisor and regulator to Goldman Sachs. These events prompted his resignation on May 7, 2009. Although Friedman's purchases of Goldman stock did not violate any Fed rule, statute, or policy, he said that the Fed did not need this distraction. He also stated his purchases, made while approval of a waiver was pending, were motivated by a desire to demonstrate confidence in the company during a time of market distress."NY Fed statement: Stephen Friedman Resigns as Chairman of the New York Fed’s Board of Directors".

In April 2010, Goldman director Rajat Gupta was named in an insider-trading case. It was said Gupta had "tipped off a hedge-fund billionaire", Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group, about the $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman in September, 2008. According to the report, Gupta had told Goldman the month before his involvement became public that he wouldn't seek re-election as a director.James, Frank, "Goldman Sachs Director Tied To Insider-Trading Scandal", NPR, April 23, 2010 12:47 pm.

===First Quarter 2009 and December 2008 financial results===

In April 2009, there was controversy that Goldman Sachs had "puffed up" its Q1 earnings by creating a December "orphan month" into which it shifted large writedowns, so they did not appear in any "quarterly number"Alloway, Tracy (April 16, 2009), "Goldman creates orphans and other conspiracies", FT.com,—a notification that was legal but some felt misleading. In its first full quarter as a bank holding company, the firm reported a $780M net loss for the single month of December alongside Q1 net earnings of $1.81B (Jan–Mar)"Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2009 Earnings Release". Goldman Sachs Investor Relations. Retrieved April 22, 2009.

Option Hustler. Retrieved April 22, 2009. However, their lack of reaction and reporting of what was a widely expected result may have contributed to the surprise attributing this as a sign that the firm was trying to hide losses in December.

In March 2009, it was reported that, in 2008, Goldman Sachs, (alongside other major US and international financial institutions), had received billions of dollars during the unwind of credit default swap (CDS) contracts purchased from AIG, including $12.9 billion from funds provided by the US Federal Reserve to bail out AIG.[tpl]cite web|last=Mandel |first=Michael |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/03/german_and_fren.html#more |title=German and French banks got $36 billion from AIG Bailout |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=November 24, 2009[/tpl]AIG ships billions in bailout abroad, The Politico, March 15, 2009A.I.G. Lists Firms It Paid With Taxpayer Money, The New York Times, March 15, 2009 (As of April, 2009, US Government loans to AIG totaled over $180 billion). The money was used to repay customers of its security-lending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from AIG. However, due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks, including Goldman Sachs, may have benefited materially from the bailout and if they had been overpaid."Dimming the Aura of Goldman Sachs", New York Times, April 17, 2009[tpl]cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/inspector-to-audit-aigs-counterparty-payouts/ |title=Inspector to Audit A.I.G.’s Counterparty Payouts – DealBook Blog |publisher=Dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 24, 2009[/tpl] The New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced in March 2009 that he was investigating whether AIG's trading counterparties improperly received government money.[tpl]cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/cuomo-widens-his-aig-investigation/?hp |title=Cuomo Widens His A.I.G.

====Firm's response to criticism of AIG payments====

Goldman Sachs has maintained that its net exposure to AIG was 'not material', and that the firm was protected by hedges (in the form of CDSs with other counterparties) and $7.5 billion of collateral.[tpl]cite news|author=E-mail This |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/goldman-maintains-it-had-no-aig-exposure/ |title=Goldman Maintains It Had No A.I.G. Exposure – DealBook Blog |publisher=Dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 24, 2009[/tpl] The firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over $100M."Goldman Protected Its Clients From AIG's Weakness ", letter from Lucas van Praag, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs & Co, Wall St. Journal, April 13, 2009 According to Goldman, both the collateral and CDSs would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an AIG bankruptcy (however, because AIG was bailed out and not allowed to fail, these hedges did not pay out.)Section of SIGTARP Report Related to Goldman Sachs[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] CFO David Viniar stated that profits related to AIG in Q1 2009 "rounded to zero", and profits in December were not significant. He went on to say that he was "mystified" by the interest the government and investors have shown in the bank's trading relationship with AIG.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aVJT1NtIY3DQ&refer=home |title=Goldman Sachs’s Viniar ‘Mystified’ by Interest in AIG (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 24, 2009[/tpl]
Considerable speculation remains that Goldman's hedges against their AIG exposure would not have paid out if AIG was allowed to fail. According to a report by the United States Office of the Inspector General of TARP, if AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at discounts, and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that "might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default."[tpl]cite web|author=Neil Barofsky |url=http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2009/SIGTARP_Initial_Report_to_the_Congress.pdf |title=SIGTARP Initial Report to Congress |publisher=United States Department of Treasury |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations.
Goldman argues that CDSs are marked to market (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their positions netted between counterparties daily. Thus, as the cost of insuring AIG's obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs. The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock-on defaults, had AIG been allowed to fail. However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] As with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, wider and longer-term systemic and economic turmoil brought on by an AIG default would probably have affected the firm and all other market participants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

====Final AIG meetings on September 15 at the New York Federal Reserve====

Some have said, incorrectly according to others,"Another Dishonest NYT Editorial on AIG", Economics of Contempt (blog). Retrieved April 29, 2009. that Goldman Sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only Wall Street firm to have participated in the crucial September meetings at the New York Fed, which decided AIG's fate. Much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted New York Times article.Morgenson, Gretchen (September 27, 2008), "Behind Insurer’s Crisis, Blind Eye to a Web of Risk", The New York Times The article was later corrected to state that Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, was "one of the Wall Street chief executives at the meeting" (emphasis added). Bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the September AIG meetings.Goldman, Merrill Collect Billions After Fed's AIG Bailout Loans. Bloomberg.

It is also a lesser known fact that Morgan Stanley was hired by the Federal Reserve to advise them on the AIG bailout.AIG Seeks Funds From JPMorgan, Goldman After Fed Balks at Loan. Bloomberg.

According to the New York Times, Paulson spoke with the CEO of Goldman Sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout, though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/business/09paulson.html?pagewanted=all|title=Paulson’s Calls to Goldman Tested Ethics|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|first2=Don, Jr.|last=van Natta|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2009 | work=The New York Times[/tpl] While it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence, particularly in a crisis, the Times noted he spoke with Goldman's Blankfein more frequently than with other large banks.

===$60 million settlement for Massachusetts subprime mortgages===

On May 10, 2009, the Goldman Sachs Group agreed to pay up to $60 million to end an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general’s office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state. The settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of 714 Massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by Goldman Sachs. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, said it was “pleased to have resolved this matter,” and declined to comment further. This settlement may open the door to state government actions against Goldman throughout the United States aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices."Goldman Pays to End State Inquiry Into Loans ", Leslie Wayne, New York Times, May 11, 2009

===Abacus mortgage-backed CDOs===

In April 2010, the SEC charged Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents, Fabrice Tourre, with securities fraud. The SEC alleged that Goldman had told buyers of one of its investment deals (a type called a "synthetic CDO"), that the underlying assets in the deal had been picked by an independent CDO manager, ACA Management. In fact, a short investor betting that the CDO would default (Paulson & Co. hedge fund group) had played a “significant role” in the selection,Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011, p.192) and the package of securities turned out to become "one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis".[tpl]cite news|last=Lucchetti|first=Aaron  and|title=Abacus Deal: As Bad as They Come|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703757504575194521257607284|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=April 20, 2010|author2=Serena Ng|quote=Abacus 2007-AC1, the mortgage deal at the center of Friday's civil-fraud lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., ... also boasts another dubious distinction: It was one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis, based on one measure of rating-firm downgrades. Less than a year after the deal was completed, 100% of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded, according to a February 2008 report by Wachovia Capital Markets, since acquired by Wells Fargo & Co.[/tpl] On July 15, 2010, Goldman settled, agreeing to pay the SEC and investors $550 million. In August 2013 Tourre was found liable on six of seven counts by a federal jury.[tpl]cite news|last=Raymond|first=Nate|title=SEC wins as ex-Goldman executive Tourre found liable for fraud|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/01/us-sec-goldman-tourre-idUSBRE96G19720130801|work=August 1, 2013|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=August 1, 2013[/tpl]
Unlike many investors and investment bankers, Goldman Sachs anticipated the Subprime mortgage crisis that developed in 2007-8. Some of its traders became "bearish" on the housing boom beginning in 2004 and developed mortgage-related securities, originally intended to protect Goldman from investment losses in the housing market. In late 2006, Goldman management changed the firm’s overall stance on the mortgage market, from positive to negative. As the market began its downturn, Goldman "created even more of these securities", no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but "enabling it to pocket huge profits" from the mortgage defaults,(according to business journalists Gretchen Morgenson, Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/business/24trading.html?_r=4&ref=business|title=Banks Bundled Bad Debt, Bet Against It and Won|author=Gretchen Morgenson|author2=Louise Story|date=23 December 2009|publisher=New York Times|quote=Goldman used the C.D.O.’s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes[/tpl]
[tpl]cite book|author=McLean and Nocera |title=All the Devils Are Here |page=271 |quote=But the firm's later insistence that it was merely a `market maker`in these transactions -- implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients -- became less true over time.[/tpl]
The complex securities were known as synthetic CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).   They were called synthetic because unlike regular CDOs, the principle and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans, but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as "credit default swaps". Goldman and some other hedge funds held a "short" position with the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the "long" position. The longs were responsible for paying the insurance "claim" to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted.
Through April 2007 Goldman issued over 20 CDOs in its "Abacus" seriesBloomberg says 23: Abacus Let Goldman Shuffle Mortgage Risk Like Beads. NY Times says 25 deals: S.E.C. Accuses Goldman of Fraud in Housing Deal worth a total of $10.9 billion.  All together Goldman packaged, sold, and shorted a total of 47 synthetic CDOs, with an aggregate face value of $66 billion between July 1, 2004, and May 31, 2007.FCIR p.145
But while Goldman was praised for its foresight, some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly (for the long investors) and by April 2010, Bloomberg reported that at least $5 billion worth of the securities either carried "junk" ratings, or had defaulted.[tpl]cite news|title=Abacus Let Goldman Shuffle Mortgage Risk Like Beads|authors=Jody Shenn and Bob Ivry|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-16/goldman-used-abacus-to-shuffle-debt-risk-like-beads.html |work=April 17, 2010|accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl]  One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against, but also sold to investors, was the $800 million Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006.  Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings. Unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics (McLean and Nocera) complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as "`assets sourced from the Street`, making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book."[tpl]cite book|author=Bethany McLean, Joe Nocera|title=All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis |page=274|quote=The CDO had been constructed, Goldman executives later told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee, while the company was trying to remove triple-B assets from its books. Among those assets was a long position in the ABX index that Goldman had gotten `stuck` with while putting together deals for hedge fund clients that wanted to go short. Unable to find counterparties to take the long position off its hands, Goldman used Hudson as a means by which it hedged its long position. ... None of which was clear from the Hudson prospectus. Instead, the disclosure merely said that the CDO's contents were `assets sourced from the Street,` making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its won book.[/tpl] 
The CDO did not perform well and by March 2008 -- just 18 months after its issue -- so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out "about $310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it."  Goldman's head of European fixed-income sales lamented in an email made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the `real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients` who had invested in the CDO. `The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant.`[tpl]cite book|author=Bethany McLean, Joe Nocera|title=All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis |page=274|quote=`Real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients` wrote Ysuyf Aliredha, Goldman's head of European fixed-income sales, in an e-mail to Dan Sparks of Goldman's Mortgage Desk.  `The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant.`[/tpl]
Critics also complain that while Goldman's investors were large, ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers, at least some of the CDO securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies — "money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets"[tpl]cite book|author=Bethany McLean, Joe Nocera|title=All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis |pages=280–1|quote= ... IKB also created a structured investment vehicle called Rhinebridge. Rhinebridge, like other SIVs, issued debt that it then used to buy mortgage-backed securities and CDOs like Abacus.

This was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets ....

In public statements Goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the CDOs to fail. It also  denied that its investors were unaware of Goldman's bets against the products it was selling to them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/business/24trading.html?_r=4&ref=business|title=Banks Bundled Bad Debt, Bet Against It and Won|author=Gretchen Morgenson|author2=Louise Story|date=23 December 2009|publisher=New York Times[/tpl] This article describes the intricate links between Goldman Sachs trader, Jonathan M.

====2010 SEC civil fraud lawsuit====

The particular synthetic CDO that the SEC's 2010 fraud suit  charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1.

The SEC alleged that Goldman "materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents" about the financial security, including the fact that it had "permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market hedge fund manager Paulson & Co. to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party," ACA Management.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21489.pdf|date = April 16, 2010|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|title=Securities and Exchange Commission vs Goldman Sachs & Co & Fabrice Tourre, Complaint (Securities Fraud)|accessdate =April 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=SEC Charges Goldman Sachs With Fraud in Structuring and Marketing of CDO Tied to Subprime Mortgages (Press release)|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm|work=April 16, 2010|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]  The SEC further alleged that "Tourre also misled ACA into believing ... that Paulson's interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with ACA's, when in reality Paulson's interests were sharply conflicting."
In reply Goldman issued a statement saying the SEC's charges were "unfounded in law and fact", and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money, that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the CDO, that it had also lost money ($90 million), that ACA selected the portfolio without Goldman suggesting Paulson was to be a long investor, that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker,  and that ACA was itself the largest purchaser of the Abacus pool, investing $951 million.

Some experts on securities law (such as Duke University law professor James Cox), believed the suit had merit because Goldman was aware of the relevance of Paulson's involvement and took steps to downplay it.

Critics of Goldman Sachs point out that Paulson went to Goldman Sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank, Bear Stearns who he had asked to build a CDO for him. Ira Wagner, the head of Bear Stearns’s CDO Group in 2007, told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal Paulson was proposing encouraged Paulson to pick the worst assets.Federal Crisis Inquiry Report, p.193[tpl]cite news|last=Fiderer|first=David|title=The Moral Compass Missing From The Greatest Trade Ever|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-fiderer/the-moral-compass-missing_b_358856.html|work=November 16, 2009|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=November 16, 2009[/tpl] Describing Bear Stearns's reasoning, one author compared the deal to "a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team."[tpl]cite web|last=Zuckerman|first=Gregory|title=Inside Paulson's Deal with Goldman|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/04/19/inside-paulsons-deal-with-goldman.html|work=04.19.10|publisher=Daily Beast|quote=Scott Eichel, a senior Bear Stearns trader, was among those at the investment bank who sat through a meeting with Paulson but later turned down the idea.

===Alleged commodity price manipulation===

A provision of the 1999 financial deregulation law, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is "complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally."[tpl]cite journal|last=Taibbi|first=Matt|title=The Vampire Squid Strikes Again: The Mega Banks' Most Devious Scam Yet  |journal=Rolling Stone|date=February 12, 2014|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-vampire-squid-strikes-again-the-mega-banks-most-devious-scam-yet-20140212|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] In the years since the laws passing, Goldman Sach and other investment banks (Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase) have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials, such as food products, zinc, copper, tin, nickel and, aluminum.
Some critics (such as Matt Taibbi) believe that allowing a company to both "control the supply of crucial physical commodities, and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets," is "akin to letting casino owners who take book on NFL games during the week also coach all the teams on Sundays."
New York Times journalist David Kocieniewski accused Goldman Sachs (and other Wall Street firms) of "capitalizing on loosened federal regulations" to manipulate "a variety of commodities markets", citing "financial records, regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities." (The commodity highlighted by Kocieniewski and also mentioned Taibbi also mentioned was aluminum.[tpl]cite news|last=KOCIENIEWSKI|first=DAVID|title=A Shuffle of Aluminum, but to Banks, Pure Gold|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 20, 2013[/tpl])

====Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the 2005–2008 Food Bubble====

Goldman Sachs' creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has been implicated by some in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis.
In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman argued that Goldman's creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity IndexThe Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is composed of 18 commodities, such as cattle coffee, cocoa, corn, hogs and varieties of wheat. helped passive investors (pension funds, mutual funds and others) enter the markets, through its own fund and through other commodity funds (sponsored by JPMorgan, Chase, AIG, etc.) following Goldman's lead. These funds disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand, making prices more volatile and defeating the purpose of the exchanges (price stabilization) in the first place."The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and got away with it", by Frederick Kaufman| Harper's| 2010 JulyDemocracy Now (radio show), Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales, Interview with Frederick Kaufman, 2010 7 17[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6154-a-global-food-bubble.pdf |title=Global Food Bubble?

====Aluminum price and supply====

In August 2013, Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission as part of an investigation into  complaints that Goldman-owned metals warehouses had "intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum."[tpl]cite news|last=KOCIENIEWSKI|first=DAVID|title=U.S. Subpoenas Goldman in Inquiry of Aluminum Warehouses|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/business/us-subpoenas-goldman-in-inquiry-of-aluminum-warehouses.html|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 12, 2013[/tpl]    
In December 2013 it was announced that 26 cases accusing the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- along with  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the two investment banks' warehousing businesses, and the London Metal Exchange in various combinations—of violating U.S. antitrust laws, would be assigned to U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest in Manhattan.[tpl]cite news|last=Harris|first=Andrew|title=Goldman Sachs Aluminum Antitrust Suits Shipped to NYC|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-16/goldman-sachs-aluminum-antitrust-suits-shipped-to-nyc.html|work=December 16, 2013|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 February 2014[/tpl]
Following Goldman's purchase of the aluminum warehousing company Metro InternationalMetro International Trade Services LLC (website) in 2010, the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans, home siding and other products—went from an average of six weeks to more than 16 months, "according to industry records."
The cause of this was alleged to be Goldman's ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of 27 Metro International warehouses Goldman owns in Detroit, Michigan.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Marcus|title=The Goldman Sachs Guide To Manipulating Commodities|journal=US News|date=July 24, 2013|url=http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/07/24/how-goldman-sachs-and-wall-street-manipulate-alumnimum-and-other-commodities|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]
"Aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at Metro International since Goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since 2010." The price increase has cost "American consumers more than $5 billion"from 2010 to 2013 according to former industry executives, analysts and consultants.
To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that "at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day". Goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories, but "from one warehouse to another"—according to the Times.
According to Lydia DePillis of Wonkblog, when Goldman bought the warehouses it "started paying traders extra to bring their metal" to Goldman's warehouses "rather than anywhere else. The longer it stays, the more rent Goldman can charge, which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium.""Premium" being the logistical cost of getting the metal to their plants[tpl]cite news|last=DePillis|first=Lydia|title=Here’s how Goldman Sachs is making your beer more expensive (Wonk blog)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/22/heres-how-goldman-sachs-is-making-your-beer-more-expensive/|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 22, 2013[/tpl] The effect is "amplified" by another company in the Netherlands (Glencore) is "doing the same thing in its warehouse in Vlissingen".
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, has said the cases are without merit

===Oil futures speculation===

Investment banks, including Goldman, have also been accused of driving up the price of petrol/gasoline by speculating in the oil futures market. In August 2011, "confidential documents" were leaked "detailing the positions" in the oils futures market of several investment banksWall Street speculators—including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays—including Goldman Sachs—on one day (June 30, 2008), just before the peak in high petrol/gasoline prices. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. It was "a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude" according to Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Kate|title=$4 Gas: Brought to You by Wall Street|journal=Mother Jones|date=September 8, 2011|url=http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/09/oil-speculators-goldman-sachs|accessdate=8 February 2014[/tpl] However another source states "Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world’s largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data...."[tpl]cite news|last=Leising|first=Matthew|title=Big Banks Bet Crude Oil Prices Would Fall in 2008 Run-Up, Leaked Data Show|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-29/big-banks-bet-crude-would-fall-in-2008-run-up-leaked-data-shows.html|work=August 28, 2011|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=23 February 2014|coauthors=Silla Brush|quote=Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world’s largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data released by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. The net positions of the banks undermine arguments made by Sanders that speculative trades on Wall Street drove oil prices in 2008, said Craig Pirrong, director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston. Retail gasoline reached a record $4.08 a gallon on July 7, 2008, and oil peaked at $147.27 a barrel on July 11 that year.[/tpl]
In April 2011, a couple of observers—Brad Johnson of the blog Climate Progress and Alain Sherter of CBS News MoneyWatch—noted that Goldman Sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil. Climate Progress quoted Goldman as warning "that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation” in petroleum futures, and that “net speculative positions are four times as high as in June 2008.” when the price of foil peaked.[tpl]cite news|last=Leising|first=Matthew|title=Big Banks Bet Crude Oil Prices Would Fall in 2008 Run-Up, Leaked Data Show|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-29/big-banks-bet-crude-would-fall-in-2008-run-up-leaked-data-shows.html|work=August 28, 2011|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=23 February 2014|coauthors=Silla Brush|quote=oil peaked at $147.27 a barrel on July 11 that year 2008.[/tpl]

According to Joseph P. Kennedy II, by 2012, prices on the oil commodity market has become influenced by "hedge funds and bankers" pumping "billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price". The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when  just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.
 The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades. Other exemptions followed and "by 2008, eight investment banks accounted for 32% of the total oil futures market."[tpl]cite news|last=KENNEDY II|first=JOSEPH P.|title=The High Cost of Gambling on Oil|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/opinion/ban-pure-speculators-of-oil-futures.html|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 10, 2012[/tpl] 

===Initial public offering kickback bribes===

Goldman Sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which Goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting.
Documents under seal in a decade-long lawsuit concerning eToys.com's initial public offering (IPO) in 1999 but released accidentally to the New York Times show that IPOs managed by Goldman were underpriced and that Goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it.

Goldman Sachs came under criticism in 2013 for entering into a three year consulting agreement with the Russian direct investment fund and Russia's economy ministry of Vladimir Putin's government to "attract foreign investment".

===Danish utility sale===

Goldman Sachs’s purchase of an 18% stake in state-owned Dong Energy -- Denmark's largest electric utility—set off a "political crisis" in Denmark. The sale—approved in January 30, 2014—sparked protest in the form of the resignation of six cabinet ministers and the withdrawal of a party (Socialist People’s Party) from Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt's leftist governing coalition.[tpl]cite web|last=Levring|first=Peter|title=In Denmark, Goldman Sachs Deal Ignites Political Crisis|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-06/in-denmark-goldman-sachs-deal-ignites-political-crisis|work=February 06, 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=12 February 2014|coauthors=Christian Wienberg[/tpl]  According to Bloomberg Businessweek, "the role of Goldman in the deal struck a nerve with the Danish public, which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the global financial crisis." Protesters in Copenhagen gathered around a banner "with a drawing of a vampire squid—the description of Goldman used by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone in 2009". Opponents expressed concern that that Goldman would have some say in Dong's management, and that Goldman planned to manage its investment through "subsidiaries in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, and Delaware, which made Danes suspicious that the bank would shift earnings to tax havens."
