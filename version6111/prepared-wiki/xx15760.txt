Crucifixion is a form of slow and painful execution in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden cross and left to hang until dead. It is principally known from antiquity, but remains in occasional use in some countries.
The Crucifixion of Jesus is a central event in Christianity and the crucifix is the main religious symbol for many churches. 

==Terminology==

Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: ana-stauro (ἀνασταυρόω), from stauros, "stake", and apo-tumpanizo (ἀποτυμπανίζω) "crucify on a plank," LSJ apotumpanizo ἀποτυμπα^ν-ίζω (later ἀποτύμπα^ν-τυπ- UPZ119 (2nd century BC), POxy.1798.1.7), A. crucify on a plank, D.8.61,9.61:—Pass., Lys.13.56, D.19.137, Arist. Rh. 1383a5, Beros. ap. J.Ap.1.20. 2. generally, destroy, Plu.2.1049d. together with anaskolopizo (ἀνασκολοπίζω "impale").

==Details==

Crucifixion was often performed to terrorize and dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating particularly heinous crimes. Victims were left on display after death as warnings to others who might attempt dissent. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term excruciating, literally "out of crucifying"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.
The Greek and Latin words corresponding to "crucifixion" applied to many different forms of painful execution, from impaling on a stake to affixing to a tree, to an upright pole (a crux simplex) or to a combination of an upright (in Latin, stipes) and a crossbeam (in Latin, patibulum).Seneca the Younger wrote: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet" (Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", 6.20.3).
In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam on his shoulders to the place of execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 135 kilos (300 lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45 kilos (100 lb).[tpl]cite journal|last=Ball|first=DA|title=The crucifixion and death of a man called Jesus|journal=Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association|year=1989|volume=30|issue=3|pages=77–83|accessdate=13 March 2013[/tpl]  The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann2.shtml#32 |title=Annales 2:32.2 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann15.shtml#60 |title=Annales 15:60.1 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.
The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian Josephus, where he states that at the Siege of Jerusalem (70), "the soldiers out of rage and hatred, nailed those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest."Jewish War V.II Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as amulets with perceived medicinal qualities.Mishna, Shabbath 6.10, quoted in Crucifixion in Antiquity
While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals. Writings by Seneca the Younger state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin.Seneca, Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", in Moral Essays, 6.20.3, trans. John W. Basore, The Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946) 2:69[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia#XX. |title=Of Consolation: To Marcia date=Aug 2011 |website=wikisource.org |publisher=Wikisource |accessdate=20 September 2013[/tpl] Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape mention by some of their eminent orators. Cicero for example, described crucifixion as "a most cruel and disgusting punishment",[tpl]cite book |last=Licona |first=Michael |title=The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach |year=2010 |publisher=InterVarsity Press,|isbn=978-0-8308-2719-0 |oclc=620836940 |authorlink=Michael Licona |page=304[/tpl] and suggested that "the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen's body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears."[tpl]cite book  |last=Conway |first=Colleen M. |title=Behold the Man: Jesus and Greco-Roman Masculinity |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532532-4 |page=67[/tpl] (citing Cicero, pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo 5.16).
Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called crurifragium, which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Koskenniemi | first = Erkki | coauthors = Kirsi Nisula and Jorma Toppari | title = Wine Mixed with Myrrh (Mark 15.23) and Crurifragium (John 19.31-32): Two Details of the Passion Narratives | journal = Journal for the Study of the New Testament | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–391 | publisher = SAGE Publications | year = 2005 | url = http://jnt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/379 | doi = 10.1177/0142064X05055745 | accessdate = 2008-06-13[/tpl] This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to deter those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.

===Cross shape===

The gibbet on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. Josephus describes multiple tortures and positions of crucifixion during the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus crucified the rebels;Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 5.11.1 and Seneca the Younger recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."
At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin crux simplex.William Barclay, The Apostles' Creed 1998 ISBN 978-0-664-25826-9, p. 78 This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (crux commissa) or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (crux immissa)."The ... oldest depiction of a crucifixion ... was uncovered by archaeologists more than a century ago on the Palatine Hill in Rome. It is a second-century graffiti scratched into a wall that was part of the imperial palace complex. It includes a caption — not by a Christian, but by someone taunting and deriding Christians and the crucifixions they underwent. It shows crude stick-figures of a boy reverencing his "God," who has the head of a jackass and is upon a cross with arms spread wide and with hands nailed to the crossbeam. Here we have a Roman sketch of a Roman crucifixion, and it is in the traditional cross shape" (Clayton F. Bower, Jr: Cross or Torture Stake?). Some second-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person would have his or her arms stretched out, not connected to a single stake: Lucian speaks of Prometheus as crucified "above the ravine with his hands outstretched" and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter tau) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its "evil significance" because of the "evil instrument" which had that shape, an instrument which tyrants hung men on (ibidem). Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a crux simplex, and that the crux immissa was an invention of Emperor Constantine.[tpl]cite web|title=Why do Watch Tower publications show Jesus on a stake with hands over his head instead of on the traditional cross?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989219|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania[/tpl]   Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.   Apparently the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late first century to early second century AD).  The cross is the T shape.  An inscription over the individual's left shoulder identifies her as "Alkimila." [tpl]cite journal|last=Cook|first=John Granger|title=Crucifixion as Spectacle in Roman Campania|journal=Novum Testamentum|year=2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=60-100, esp. 92-98[/tpl]
The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year 100 AD on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau)Epistle of Barnabas, Chapter 9. The document no doubt belongs to the end of the first or beginning of the second century.http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas-intro.html or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright."The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which last the person rests who is fixed by the nails" (Irenaeus (c. 130–202), Adversus Haereses II, xxiv, 4 http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm).Justin Martyr (c. 100-165) Dialogue with Trypho "Chapter XC - The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross",  "Chapter XCI" "For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn."  "Chapter CXI"  "stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross"

===Nail placement===

In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of [tpl]bibleverse||John|20:25[/tpl] the wounds are described as being "in his hands"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word "χείρ", usually translated as "hand", referred to arm and hand together,In the Iliad XX, 478-480, a spear-point is said to have pierced the χεῖρ "where the sinews of the elbow join" (ἵνα τε ξενέχουσι τένοντες / ἀγκῶνος, τῇ τόν γε φίλης διὰ χειρὸς ἔπειρεν / αἰχμῇ χακλκείῃ). and to denote the hand as distinct from the arm some other word was added, as "ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα" (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., he wounded her hand).Liddell and Scott on χείρ. Cf. The Science of the Crucifixion.
A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the radius and the ulna).[tpl]Cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Wynne-Jones |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/16/nrowan216.xml |work= |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-16 | location=London[/tpl]
An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the National Geographic Channel's Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion,[tpl]Cite web|author=5:35 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued/ |title=a brief news article |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-03-25 |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] showed that a person can be suspended by the palm of the hand. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.
Another possibility, suggested by Frederick Zugibe, is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the carpal tunnel.
A foot-rest (suppedaneum) attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.[tpl]Cite book|title=The beauty of the cross: the passion of Christ in theology and the arts, from the catacombs to the eve of the Renaissance |last=Viladesau |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518811-0 |oclc=58791208 |page=21 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=cTFh4tm9cMwC |accessdate=2009-05-04 [/tpl]  Ancient sources also mention the sedile, a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&letter=C |title=Crucifixion |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] which could have served a similar purpose.
In 1968, archaeologists discovered at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem the remains of one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5 cm (4.53 inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf |title=Some Notes on Crucifixion |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl]David W.

A theory attributed to Pierre Barbet holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation.Columbia University page of Pierre Barbet on Crucifixion He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by his arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain,[tpl]Cite book|last=Zugibe|first=Frederick T|authorlink=Frederick Zugibe|title=The cross and the shroud: a medical inquiry into the crucifixion|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=0-913729-75-2[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Zugibe, Frederick T. |title=The Crucifixion Of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry |publisher=M. Evans and Company |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59077-070-6[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death.

===Survival===

Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year as a devotional practice to be non-lethally crucified.
There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered."The Life Of Flavius Josephus, 75 Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.

==Ancient practice==

Although the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources, refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a crucified body dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus.  This was discovered in Jerusalem in 1968. It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.
The remains were found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, the son of Hagakol'.Haas, Nicu. "Anthropological observations on the skeletal remains from Giv'at ha-Mivtar", Israel Exploration Journal 20 (1-2), 1970: 38-59; Tzaferis, Vassilios.

Maier |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2009-12-19|isbn=978-0-8254-3329-0|year=1997[/tpl] Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.
Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death as described in [tpl]bibleverse||John|19:31-35|NIV[/tpl]. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.
Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, much of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic — and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion —, while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.[tpl]cite news |authors=Zias J. & Sekeles, E. |year=1985 |title=The Crucified Man from Giv'at ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal. |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |issue=35 |pages=22–27[/tpl]

==History and religious texts==

===Pre-Roman states===

Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by Persians, Carthaginians, Macedonians, and Romans. Death was often hastened. "The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim."
The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.Stavros, Scolops (σταῦρός, σκόλοψ). The cross; encyclopedia Hellinica However, in his Histories, ix.120–122, the Greek writer Herodotus describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this Artayctes who suffered death by crucifixion."Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt. The original, "σανίδα προσπασσαλεύσαντες, ἀνεκρέμασαν ... Τούτου δὲ τοῦ Ἀρταύκτεω τοῦ ἀνακρεμασθέντος ...", is translated by Henry Cary (Bohn's Classical Library: Herodotus Literally Translated. London, G. Bell and Sons 1917, pp. 591–592) as: "They nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft ... this Artayctes who was hoisted aloft". The Commentary on Herodotus by How and Wells remarks: "They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling."W.W. How and J. Wells, A Commentary on Herodotus (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1912), vol. 2, p. 336
Some Christian theologians, beginning with Paul of Tarsus writing in Galatians [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Gal|3:13[/tpl], have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in Deuteronomy [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Deut|21:22-23[/tpl]. This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with lynching or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.See Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1, translated in Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation 591 (1988), supra note 8, at 595-96 (indicating that court ordered execution by stoning, burning, decapitation, or strangulation only) The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: "God ... (partially legible)-will set ... right errors.  ... (partially legible)-He will judge ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-crucifixion ... Let not the nail touch him."Levi,Aramaic Testament of Levi 4Q541 column 6

===Ancient Rome===

The hypothesis that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html |title=Livy I.26 and the Supplicium de More Maiorum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&yr=200&aa=AA&at=AA&ref=tertullian&URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm |title=Apologia, IX, 1 |publisher=Grtbooks.com |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross.After quoting a poem by Maecenas that speaks of preferring life to death even when life is burdened with all the disadvantages of old age or even with acute torture ("vel acuta si sedeam cruce"), Seneca disagrees with the sentiment, saying death would be better for a crucified person hanging from the patibulum: "I should deem him most despicable had he wished to live to the point of crucifixion ... Is it worth so much to weigh down upon one's own wound, and hang stretched out from a patibulum? ... Is anyone found who, after being fastened to that accursed wood, already weakened, already deformed, swelling with ugly weals on shoulders and chest, with many reasons for dying even before getting to the cross, would wish to prolong a life-breath that is about to experience so many torments?" ("Contemptissimum putarem, si vivere vellet usque ad crucem ... Est tanti vulnus suum premere et patibulo pendere districtum ... Invenitur, qui velit adactus ad illud infelix lignum, iam debilis, iam pravus et in foedum scapularum ac pectoris tuber elisus, cui multae moriendi causae etiam citra crucem fuerant, trahere animam tot tormenta tracturam?" - Letter 101, 12-14) Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.Titus Maccius Plautus Miles gloriosus  Mason Hammond, Arthur M. Mack - 1997 Page 109 , "The patibulum (in the next line) was a crossbar which the convicted criminal carried on his shoulders, with his arms fastened to it, to the place for ... Hoisted up on an upright post, the patibulum became the crossbar of the cross"
Crucifixion was used for slaves, pirates, and enemies of the state. It was considered a most shameful and disgraceful way to die. Condemned Roman citizens were usually exempt from crucifixion except for major crimes against the state, such as high treason.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
Notorious mass crucifixions followed the Third Servile War in 73–71 BC (the slave rebellion under Spartacus), other Roman civil wars in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Crassus crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions. In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die.
Under ancient Roman penal practice, crucifixion was also a means of exhibiting the criminal's low social status. It was the most dishonourable death imaginable, originally reserved for slaves, hence still called "supplicium servile" by Seneca, later extended to citizens of the lower classes (humiliores).[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The citizen class of Roman society were almost never subject to capital punishments; instead, they were fined or exiled. Josephus mentions Jews of high rank who were crucified, but this was to point out that their status had been taken away from them. The Romans often broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
A cruel prelude was occasionally scourging, which would cause the condemned to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (stipes) could even be permanently embedded in the ground.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The condemned was usually stripped naked—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.[tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|27:35[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Mark|15:24[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Luke|23:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||John|19:23-25[/tpl]
The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately [tpl]convert|5|to|7|in|cm[/tpl] long, with a square shaft [tpl]convert|3/8|in|mm|0[/tpl] across. In some cases, the nails were gathered afterward and used as healing amulets.

===In Islam===

The Qur'an mentions crucifixion several times. In Surah 7:124, Firaun (Arabic for Pharaoh) says that he will crucify his chief wizards.Surat Al-'A'rāf (The Heights) Also, Surah 12:41 mentions Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) prophesying that the king (the current ruler of the land he was stranded in) would crucify one of his prisoners.Surat Yūsuf (Joseph)
In Surah 5:33, The Qur'an mentions crucifixion as a form of punishment. There are four different punishments for the different severities of crime. Crucifixion is the punishment for the robber who kills his victim after robbing him.

===Japan===

Crucifixion was introduced into Japan during the Sengoku period (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Japanese mind: essentials of Japanese philosophy and culture|last=Moore |first=Charles Alexander |coauthors= Aldyth V.

Known in Japanese as [tpl]Nihongo|haritsuke|磔[/tpl], crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Several related crucifixion techniques were used. Petra Schmidt, in "Capital Punishment in Japan", writes:[tpl]Cite book|title=Capital Punishment in Japan|url=http://books.google.no/books?id=8fZKH4cbcmQC|last=Schmidt|first=Petra|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-12421-9|pages=14–15|url=|accessdate=2013-04-24 [/tpl][tpl]quote|Execution by crucifixion included, first of all, hikimawashi (i.e, being paraded about town on horseback); then the unfortunate was tied to a cross made from one vertical and two horizontal poles. The cross was raised, the convict speared several times from two sides, and eventually killed with a final thrust through the throat. The corpse was left on the cross for three days. If one condemned to crucifixion died in prison, his body was pickled and the punishment executed on the dead body. Under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the great 16th century unifiers, crucifixion upside down (i.e, sakasaharitsuke) was frequently used. Water crucifixion (mizuharitsuke) awaited mostly Christians: a cross was raised at low tide; when the high tide came, the convict was submerged under water up to the head, prolonging death for many days[/tpl]
In 1597 twenty-six Christians were nailed to crosses at Nagasaki, Japan. Among those executed were Saints Paulo Miki, Philip of Jesus and Pedro Bautista, a Spanish Franciscan who had worked about ten years in the Philippines. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of persecution of Christianity in Japan, which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.
Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during World War II. Ringer Edwards, an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

===Europe===

During World War I, there were persistent rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier on a tree or barn door with bayonets or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division.

==Contemporary use==

Crucifixion is still used as a rare method of execution in some countries. The punishment of crucifixion (șalb) imposed in Islamic law is variously interpreted as exposure of the body after execution, crucifixion followed by stabbing in the chest, or crucifixion for three days, survivors of which are allowed to live.Rudolph Peters, Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law (Cambridge University Press 2005 ISBN 978-1-139-44534-4), pp. 37–38

==As a devotional practice==

The Catholic Church frowns on self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: "Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged."Directory on Popular Piety 144 Nevertheless the practice is not unknown.
In the Philippines, some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for a limited time on Good Friday to imitate the suffering of Jesus Christ. Nails are driven through the palm of the hand, a step is used to stand on, and the period is short. Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://religiousfreaks.com/2006/04/12/man-crucifies-himself-every-good-friday/ |title=Man Crucifies Himself Every Good Friday |publisher=Religious Freaks |date=2006-04-12 |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] In San Pedro Cutud, devotee Ruben Enaje has been crucified 27 times during Passion Week celebrations.[tpl]cite news|title=Filipino devotees reenact Christ's crucifixion on Good Friday |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/filipino-devotees-reenact-christ-crucifixion-good-friday-article-1.1302347 |accessdate=January 22, 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News |date=March 29, 2013 |agency=Associated Press[/tpl] Although the country's dominant Catholic Church disapproves of the ritual, the Filipino government says it cannot stop the devotees from crucifying and whipping themselves; while the health department insists that those taking part in the rituals should have tetanus shots and that the nails used to pierce their limbs should be sterilized.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-540453/Boy-15-nailed-cross-Filipinos-whip-crucify-gory-Good-Friday-ritual.html |title=Boy, 15, nailed to a cross as Filipinos whip and crucify themselves in gory Good Friday ritual |accessdate = November 6, 2010 | location=London |work=Daily Mail |date=2008-03-22[/tpl]
In other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a passion play, as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of Iztapalapa, on the outskirts of Mexico City, since 1833,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257 |title=Religion-Mexico: The Passion According to Iztapalapa |publisher=Ipsnews.net |accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl] and in the more famous Oberammergau Passion Play. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of flagellants in New Mexico, called Hermanos de Luz ("Brothers of Light"), have annually conducted reenactments of Jesus Christ's crucifixion during Holy Week, in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
