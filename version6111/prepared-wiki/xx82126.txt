Kushi may be made of steel, bamboo, or wood.  The steel and wooden varieties are reusable, while those made from bamboo are usually only used once and discarded.  Bamboo kushi are usually the type that customers purchasing food from street vendors would be given.   
The Japanese kanji for kushi is 串, which is an example of a pictogram describing the meaning of the kanji.
