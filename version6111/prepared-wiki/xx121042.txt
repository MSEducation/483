Akbar Mohammadi ([tpl]lang-fa| اکبر محمدی [/tpl], 1972 – July 30, 2006) was an Iranian student at Tehran University involved in the 18th of Tir crisis, also known as the July 1999 Iran student protests, Iran's biggest pro-democracy demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He later died at Evin prison, causing an international outcry.

==Background and imprisonment==

Akbar Mohammadi was from the city of Amol in northern Iran. The son of Muhammad Mohammadi, Akbar had a brother, Manuchehr, and a sister, Simin. During the July 1999 protests, Manuchehr was arrested and accused of taking a "leading role". Apparently due to his connection with Manuchehr, Akbar was also arrested and reportedly given a death sentence for his role in the protest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/42ae98bd0.pdf |title=Five Years of injustice and ill treatment: Akbar Mohammadi – case sheet |author= |date=7 July 2004 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl] In an appeal in November 2000, Akbar's sentence was reduced to seven years' imprisonment. Three years later, an additional two years were added to Akbar's sentence following charges that he had given interviews to foreign media and made "political statements".
Akbar and Manuchehr's family was for sometime unaware of their location. When the family discovered that Akbar and Manuchehr had been arrested, their father Muhammad and their sister Simin began to lobby on their behalf; both were themselves arrested and sent to Evin prison, with Simin reportedly being beaten before her father.

==Death==

On July 30, 2006, Akbar Mohammadi died in Evin prison. He had been on a hunger strike for more than a week, reportedly protesting the refusal by the authorities to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture.  Mr. Mohammadi's attorney, Khalil Bahramian, said that according to fellow detainees of his client, he "had been savagely beaten by prison guards in the past few days and that he was carrying the signs of the beatings"."Iran: Student Leader Dies in Jail" Rah/Aki 31 July 2006"In Memory of Akbar Mohammadi" Iranian News 31 July 2006
