The A3, known as the Portsmouth Road in sections, is a major road connecting London and Portsmouth passing close to Kingston upon Thames, Guildford, Haslemere and Petersfield. For much of its [tpl]convert|67|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] length, it is classified as a trunk road and therefore managed by the Highways Agency. Almost all of the road has been built to dual carriageway standards.  Apart from brief sections in London the road travels from that city SW and, after Liss, SSW.
Close to its southerly end, traffic for Portsmouth is routed via the A3(M), A27 and M275 — the A3 becomes a single carriageway through some south Hampshire settlements (as exceptionally through Battersea, Clapham and Stockwell towards the northern end).right|thumb|The A3(M) at the Portsdown Hill Road Bridge nearing Junction 5 with the A27right|thumb|Northbound near the Wisley Interchange with the M25

==History==

The historic Portsmouth Road once had great strategic significance as the major link between the capital city and what became the settled main port of the Royal Navy as well as a non-military port. Many of the towns and villages that it passed through gained income and prestige as a result — such as Kingston upon Thames, Esher, Guildford, Godalming, Haslemere and Petersfield. The modern A3 follows the general route of the Portsmouth Road, but bypasses many of the towns and villages along the way, leaving the various stretches of the old Portsmouth Road for local traffic — for instance, the A307, its original course through Kingston-upon-Thames and Esher is also known as the Portsmouth Road.
A programme of road improvements starting in the 1920s transformed the road so that is now predominantly a two or three lane carriageway, bypassing the town centres, south of the South Downs National Park it includes a section of motorway, the A3(M), just before the road reaches the A27 at Havant. The construction of the Kingston and Guildford bypasses in the 1920s and 1930s made use of temporary narrow gauge railways to move the construction materials. The Esher bypass, between Hook from the first mentioned bypass to the M25, is three lanes with a motorway-standard hard shoulder; from here to Guildford the road has three lanes.
Government proposed the Kingston By-pass in 1912 but, with the onset of World War I, plans were shelved.  By the early 1920s, traffic in Kingston town centre had increased by over 160% in 10 years in the coaching town and the decision was taken to revive the plans. Work finally started in 1924 on what was to become one of the first arterial roads in Britain.  It was opened by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Stanley Baldwin MP, on 28 October 1927.  It ran for [tpl]convert|8.5|mi|km[/tpl] from the Robin Hood Gate of Richmond Park to the near outskirts of Esher.  The opening ceremony concluded with refreshments for 800 guests in marquees near what is now the Merton fly-over (off this the Merton Spur travels [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl], finishing close to Wimbledon Chase railway station).
The construction of the Kingston By-pass immediately attracted developments of housing where access was easiest.  The Restriction of Ribbon Development Act 1935 came too late to prevent this private housing, which is apparent where the A3 winds through Tolworth and New Malden where the architecture includes concrete to art nouveau apartments[tpl]#tag:ref|Main examples are Shelley Court and Byfield Court as to art nouveau by this stretch.|group= n[/tpl], Mock-Tudor gabled houses and gabled Arts and Crafts movement-inspired houses.
The road was once the haunt of highwaymen, for example, the legendary Jerry Abershawe terrorised the area around Kingston and led a gang based at the Bald Faced Stag Inn on the Portsmouth Road. Another particularly dangerous location was in the vicinity of the wooded crest skirting the Devil's Punch Bowl, Hindhead, about [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] south-west of Guildford.
In 2011 the Hindhead Tunnel became the centre of the Hindhead Bypass around the winding road of the small town, which provided the only urban set of traffic lights outside of London and so a bottleneck. Until 2011 the road through Hindhead was the last single carriageway section of the route, outside of London and Portsmouth.

==Route==

The road follows a similar route to the Portsmouth Direct Line railway, which goes through rather than past all of the towns which it serves and serves Havant and Woking [tpl]convert|2|mi[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|3|mi[/tpl] off the road, respectively.

===Greater London===

The A3 starts at King William Street at its junction with Gracechurch Street in the City of London, crosses London Bridge while entering the London Borough of Southwark and goes south-west along Borough High Street and Newington Causeway to the Elephant and Castle roundabout. It continues along Newington Butts, and bounds then enters the London Borough of Lambeth on Kennington Park Road which becomes Clapham Road and Clapham High Street. The A3 then turns west (leaving as its straight continuation the A24) as Clapham Common North Side.  Along this road it enters the London Borough of Wandsworth after which it runs concurrently with the A205 'South Circular' and goes through Wandsworth, then the A205 carries on west towards Richmond. On West Hill, just east of the Tibbets Corner junction with the A219 near Putney Heath, the road increases from 1 lane each way to a 3 lanes each way dual-carriageway and the speed limit increases from 30 mph (48 km/h) to 40 mph (64 km/h). The A3 then continues south-west between Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common before beginning to bypass Kingston upon Thames while going through Roehampton Vale. The A3 enters The Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames just before Kingston Vale where there is a junction with the A308 for Kingston upon Thames and Richmond Park. The speed limit then increases to 50 mph (80 km/h) before going under the Coombe Flyover. The A3 then goes on a flyover by Shannon Corner in Raynes Park, before having junctions for New Malden, Tolworth and Hook along the Kingston By-pass.
Brief features of a section of road contribute to a traffic pinch-point during peak hours around the Hook underpass. The road reduces from three lanes to two in the underpass. The speed limit at this point reduces from [tpl]convert|70|mph|km/h[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|50|mph|km/h[/tpl], with the first of a handful of GATSO speed enforcement cameras. If returning to London traffic from the A309 also joins just before the underpass.[tpl]#tag:ref|This section except on bank holidays is busy weekdays from about 7:50am to 8:30am and from 5:15pm to 5:50pm.|group= n[/tpl]

===Surrey===

The A3's Kingston By-pass now ends sooner leaving a spur junction the A309 to the Scilly Isles junction near Sandown Park, Esher, its route instead becoming the Esher By-pass on the border of Hook, London and Long Ditton, Surrey.
After passing Claygate the motorway-standard section has junctions with the A244 between Esher and Oxshott, then the A245 between Cobham and Hersham.[tpl]#tag:ref|Along this road are Painshill Park, Brooklands, West Byfleet and western Woking|group= n[/tpl] The road's Wisley Interchange with the M25 enables a flyover still with a 70 mph (112 km/h) speed limit.[tpl]#tag:ref|Hard shoulders, and outer barriers of the section thereafter are 'dual carriageway standard'.|group= n[/tpl] It bypasses Wisley, Ockham, Ripley (and Burpham which is a suburb of Guildford) before cutting through the major town itself as a dual carriageway and changing to a 50 mph (80 km/h) speed limit."Signs to remind drivers to stick to the 50 mile an hour speed limit". Surrey Herald and Surrey Advertiser (getsurrey.co.uk) 6 April 2010. Retrieved 6 Jan 2013. It returns to 70 mph (112 km/h) at the A31 and A246 junction before bypassing Godalming and Milford. It continues through the 2011-completed tunnel at Hindhead before leaving Surrey.

===Hampshire===

The A3 enters Hampshire just after exiting the Hindhead Tunnel before passing Liphook, Bramshott, turns permanently SSW past Liss then passes Petersfield.  Over the South Downs past Clanfield and Horndean the road passes, from just north of Horndean (still heading towards Portsmouth) the A3 separates from the A3(M) (below) and continues as London Road as far as Hilsea, south of which it is Northern Parade[tpl]#tag:ref|London Road continues as the A2047|group= n[/tpl]. It runs along the west side of Portsea Island which forms Portsmouth proper, roughly parallel with the M275, into the nearly waterfront centre of the city where, after passing the Catholic cathedral, it meets with the A2030. Here it reaches Old Portsmouth passing the Anglican cathedral and the 15th century harbour where it comes to an end at Portsmouth Point.

==Hindhead tunnel==

The Hindhead Tunnel is a [tpl]convert|1830|m|mi|adj=on[/tpl] twin bore tunnel, which cost £371 million to construct, and is the longest non-estuarial road tunnel in the UK. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond conducted the opening ceremony on 27 July 2011, though the northbound tunnel opened to traffic two days later than the southbound one, on 29 July.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/3832.aspx|publisher=Highways Agency|title=A3 Hindhead Improvement[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=237687&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False|publisher=Government News Network |title=£371 million A3 improvements will go ahead|date=2006-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=type&id=3402|title=A3 Hindhead Tunnel|publisher=Mott MacDonald[/tpl]
The short largely built-up southern stretch of old A3 (now bypass), running up from the Grayshott exit into Hindhead remains in use, but has been renumbered from A3 to A333.

==Proposed developments==

===Ham Barn roundabout, Liss===

Although – with the Hindhead Tunnel now open – the entire route is at least dual-carriageway between London and Portsmouth, at Liss there remains an at-grade roundabout; the only such junction on the route. Widely considered the main traffic pinch-point, and an accident hotspot (due to its unusual egg-shape and camber angle causing lorries to tip over), there have been wide calls for its removal,[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] particularly with the projected increase in traffic with the completion of the tunnel. Eventually, in November 2010, the Highways Agency announced it would discuss three options for the roundabout's future:http://www.messenger-online.co.uk/News.cfm?id=39382&headline=Ham%20Barn%20Options%20Outlined [tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In December 2010 the Highways Agency announced that no changes would be made before 2015.[tpl]cite web|author=Published on 29/12/2010 12:08 |url=http://www.petersfieldpost.co.uk/news/bordon/no_changes_for_a3_roundabout_1_2215626 |title=No changes for A3 roundabout - News |publisher=Petersfield Post |date=2010-12-29 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]

===Cathedral Exit, Guildford===

The slip road exiting the A3 leading to the Royal Surrey County Hospital and the Surrey Research Park regularly creates congestion on the main A3 during peak times when the traffic queue reaches onto the main carriageway. This is due to be resolved with new improvements to the traffic system directly adjacent to the A3 with work funded jointly by the University of Surrey and Surrey County Council[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2092594_end_in_sight_for_guildford_traffic_hotspot |title=End in sight for Guildford traffic hotspot - News |publisher=getsurrey |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]

==A3(M)==

This section of the road was opened in 1979[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m27scmstat.htm |title=The Motorway Archive – M27 Dates Page |publisher=Iht.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] and acts as a bypass of the A3 road in this part of Hampshire.

===Junctions===

Information above gathered from Advanced Direction Signs April/May 2012

==Cycle and footpaths==

There are shared pedestrian and cycle paths by or on the A3.

===Dedicated paths===

One cycle path links Liss with larger Petersfield on the Portsmouth-bound (south) side.
From the former, a cycle path runs alongside between adjoining villages Greatham and West Liss. The path is on the London-bound side, linking to a minor road bridge over the A3 to West Liss which is close to the centre of Liss.
Using the above routes together, cyclists and pedestrians from Petersfield and Liss (and points further south) can pass over the A3 at Liss and safely pass the Ham Barn roundabout to access various roads from Greatham: towards London from this village is an eastward path (alongside the A3) to Liphook via the northern perimeter of Longmoor Camp and Griggs Green, Liphook.  From here a single carriageway that is not a trunk road runs to Guildford.  From the Burpham junction a track facilitates access to Woking which has good access to the RideLondon–Surrey Classic route.
Nearer Portsmouth there is a cycle path between Clanfield and the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, a large forest and downsland in the South Downs National Park. There is, however, no cycle path between Petersfield and the Queen Elizabeth Country Park.  Instead there are footpaths for pedestrians only from the nearest village, Buriton.

===On-road lanes===

Between Thursley and Milford (near Guildford), cycle crossings of the slip roads have been constructed on both sides of the carriageway for the few cyclists travelling along the cycle lanes incorporated into the dual carriageway.
In Portsmouth, the A3 where it is bypassed by the A3(M) (south Hampshire) and London where speed limits are 30 to 40 mph cycling is often marked in various ways on the route or alongside.
