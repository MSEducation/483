==Eddie==

The son of Laudanum and Florinda Dickens (referred to as Mr and Mrs Dickens throughout), Eddie is usually a victim of circumstances in a Victorian world populated by absurd relatives, including Mad Uncle Jack, Even Madder Aunt Maud and her stuffed stoat named Malcolm (or according to Mad Uncle Jack, Sally). He also has an identical cousin named Fabian, but is unaware of his existence until the fifth book, Horrendous Habits. Eddie’s father is the only one to know that they are all simply characters in Mr Ardagh’s books.
