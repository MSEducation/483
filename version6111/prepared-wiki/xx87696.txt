CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Melbourne, Railway stations opened in 1889

Merlynston railway station is located on the Upfield line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the northern Melbourne suburb of Coburg North opening on 8 October 1889 as North Coburg. It closed on 13 July 1903, reopening on 1 October 1914 as Merlynston.Merlynston Vicsig
A level crossing formerly located at Shorts Road, south of the station, was closed in the late 1990s, and a dead-end street was created on either side of the railway line. Until the track was duplicated to Gowrie in 1998, the line north of the station had only a single track, apart from the island platform at Gowrie, which had two platforms. However one platform was a dead-end one, meaning trains couldn't cross at Gowrie, and had to cross at Merlynston. Boom barriers were provided at the Boundary Road level crossing in 1984.VR Website by Andrew Waugh
