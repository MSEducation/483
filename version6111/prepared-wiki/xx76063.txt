Harry Mason Reid (born December 2, 1939) is the senior United States Senator from Nevada and a member of the Democratic Party serving since 1987. He has been the Senate Majority Leader since January 2007, having previously served as Minority Leader and Minority and Majority Whip.
Previously, Reid was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Nevada's 1st congressional district, and served in Nevada local and state government as city attorney of Henderson, a state legislator, the 25th Lieutenant Governor, and chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission.
As Senate Majority Leader and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Reid has achieved a more senior elected position in the United States government than any other Mormon in history. Also, if he completes a full term as Senate Majority Leader of the 113th United States Congress, he will be one of only three Senators to serve at least eight years as Majority Leader along with Alben W. Barkley and Mike Mansfield. Reid's current term ends in January 2017 and is seeking re-election in 2016.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Reid was born in Searchlight, Nevada, the third of four sons of Inez Orena (née Jaynes), a laundress, and Harry Vincent Reid, a miner who committed suicide with a gunshot to the head in 1972 at the age of 58 when Harry was 32 years old.[tpl]cite web|title=Sen.

While at Basic High he met future Nevada governor Mike O'Callaghan, who was a teacher there and served as Reid's boxing coach. Reid attended Southern Utah University and graduated from Utah State University where he double majored in political science and history.[tpl]cite web|title=Alumni in Politics: From Old Main Hill to Capitol Hill|url=http://www.usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=47507|publisher=Utah State University|accessdate=April 28, 2012[/tpl] He minored in economics from the Jon M.

==Early political career==

===State politics===

He returned to Nevada after law school and served as Henderson city attorney before being elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1968. In 1970, at age 30, Reid was chosen by O'Callaghan as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. Reid and his mentor O'Callaghan won the race and Reid served as lieutenant governor from 1971 until 1974, when he ran for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Alan Bible. He lost by fewer than 600 votes to former Governor Paul Laxalt. In 1975, Reid ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost to Bill Briare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nevadalabor.com/barbwire/barb99/barb8-29-99.html|title=Dustbusters, sex appeal and Sen.

Reid served as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. When Jack Gordon, La Toya Jackson's future agent and husband, offered Reid a $12,000 bribe to approve new games for casinos, Reid brought in the FBI to tape Gordon's bribery attempt and arrest him. After FBI agents interrupted the transaction, as prearranged, Reid lost his temper and began choking Gordon, saying "You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!" Gordon was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to six months in prison. In 1981, Reid's wife found a bomb attached to the family station wagon; Reid suspected it was placed by Gordon.

===U.S. Representative===

Prior to the 1980 Census, Nevada had only a single at-large member in the United States House of Representatives, but population growth in the  1970s resulted in the state picking up a second district. Reid won the Democratic nomination for the 1st district, based in Las Vegas, in 1982, and easily won the general election. He served two terms in the House, from 1983 to 1987.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

In 1986, Reid won the Democratic nomination for the seat of retiring two-term incumbent Republican Senator Paul Laxalt. He defeated former at-large Congressman Jim Santini, a Democrat who had turned Republican, in the November election. He coasted to reelection in 1992. However, he barely defeated 1st District Congressman John Ensign in 1998 in the midst of a statewide Republican sweep. In 2004, Reid won reelection with 61 percent of the vote, gaining the endorsement of several Republicans. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Ensign was elected to Nevada's other Senate seat in 2000. He and Reid have a very good relationship, despite their bruising contest in 1998. The two frequently worked together on Nevada issues until Ensign was forced to resign his Senate seat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://reid.senate.gov/about/index.cfm|title=Biography |publisher=Reid.senate.gov |date=February 13, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl]
While Reid won the Democratic nomination with 75% of the vote in the June 8 primary, he faced a competitive general election for the 2010 Senate race in Nevada. Reid engaged in a $1 million media campaign to "reintroduce himself" to Nevada's voters.The Nevada plan: Reintroduce Reid – Manu Raju. Politico.Com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. He defeated Republican challenger Sharron Angle in the general election despite losing 14 of Nevada's 17 counties.

===Leadership===

From 1999 to 2005, Reid served as Senate Democratic Whip, as minority whip from 1999 to 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005, then as majority whip from 2001 to 2003 (except for a brief period from January–May 2001). From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Reid succeeded Tom Daschle as minority leader in 2005 and became majority leader after the 2006 elections. He was re-elected majority leader without opposition by the Democratic caucus on November 18, 2008, winning all 57 votes. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Reid has also been criticized for several potentially self-enriching tactics. In 2005, Reid earmarked a spending bill to provide for building a bridge between Nevada and Arizona that would make land he owned more valuable. Reid called funding for construction of a bridge over the Colorado River, among other projects, "incredibly good news for Nevada" in a news release after passage of the 2006 transportation bill. He owned [tpl]convert|160|acre[/tpl] of land several miles from the proposed bridge site in Arizona.

Reid apologized on January 9, 2010, for racially tinged comments he had made when Obama was campaigning for president. In private conversations, Reid had remarked that Obama could win the Presidency because the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama—to whom he referred as being "light-skinned" and "with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one". These comments had been recently revealed by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann in Game Change, their book about the 2008 election.

Should he say goodbye on the phone when he's done talking to you? Probably. But those are things you'd assume are part and parcel of a polished figure in Washington. That is not Harry Reid."

===Koch brothers===

Reid has excoriated the Koch brothers, who contribute to Republican, conservative and/or libertarian political causes and candidates. On one occasion, Reid used the term "un American" to describe the brothers, prompting comparisons to McCarthyism. Conservatives, such as MSNBC talk show host Joe Scarborough, who compared Reid's comments to "McCarthyism",http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/morning-joe-reid-koch-brothers, talkingpointsmemo.com; accessed April 9, 2014. and National Review editor Rich Lowry,"The Un-American Anti-Koch Campaign", March 12, 2014; accessed April 9, 2014. among others, condemned Reid's comments.
