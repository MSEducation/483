 (refer to 'Highest Scoring Game')
(round 17) (Citizen 0–1 Rangers; South China 1–1 Kitchee)

The attendance was 8,426 and the matches were played in Mong Kok Stadium. It was the first time in 11 eleven years that Mong Kok Stadium is full for a First Division League match. (The full capacity of the stadium is 8,500. The unoccupied seats are due to unattended reserve tickets owners) It is also the first time since 1996 Senior Shield semi-final of Instant-Dict against South China where there is a full house in local Hong Kong football matches.www.GoalGoalGoal.com 二零零七年/民國九十六年四月十六日/丁亥年二月二十九 香港足球新聞 :  南華鬥傑志 逾八千人觀戰 旺角球場爆棚 墟冚場面11年來首見 One possible reason for the high attendance is that the result of the South China-Kitchee match may decide the champion of the season. Either South China won or Kitchee won by 3–0 or more, the winner would be granted champion. However, the match ended 1–1, which means that the league champion would be decided after the last round matches.www.GoalGoalGoal.com 二零零七年/民國九十六年四月十五日/丁亥年二月二十八 香港足球新聞  王者之戰 南華空襲VS傑志反擊
