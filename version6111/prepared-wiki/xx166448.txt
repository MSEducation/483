The Boston Daily Advertiser (est. 1813) was the first daily newspaper in Boston, and for many years the only daily paper in Boston.[tpl]Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Hale, John|year=1892[/tpl]

==History==

The Advertiser was established in 1813, and in March 1814 it was purchased by journalist Nathan Hale. Hale was its chief editor until his death in 1863. Under Hale's supervision, the paper was first Federalist in politics, then Whig, and finally Republican, and it became very influential. It opposed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, and was the first paper to recommend the free colonization of Kansas. The principle of editorial responsibility, as distinct from that of individual contributions, was established in its columns. From 1841 until 1853, Hale's son Nathan Hale, Jr., was associated with his father in the editorial management of the paper.
In 1832 the Advertiser took over control of The Boston Patriot, and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed The Boston Gazette.
In 1885 Elihu B. Hayes took over control of the Advertiser.[tpl]Cite document| title = Death List of A Day.; Elihu Burritt Hayes. | page =  9. | publisher = The New York Times | location = New York | date = April 2, 1903| postscript = [/tpl]
