All of these schools provide pick and drop services to students. Most of the students study until Matriculation and stop because of lack of access and high cost of going to nearby towns.

The first big accident on the under-construction road occurred in Ramadan 2012. A resident of Chakdara along with his sister and her family including her husband and three children fell from the under-construction bridge to the Swat river. Unfortunately, no one survived in the accident and the car was also completely destroyed.Lower Dir: Seven members of a family killed in accident This sad incident occrred because of poor management of the contractor who did not indicate that the bridge was still under-construction. The river was diverted during the construction of the bridges which resulted in huge costs for the residents of Badwan in terms of land erosion and loss of crops. The completion of the project was delayed because of floods in the river and lack of funds.
