==Early life==

Robby Krieger was born in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guitarinternational.com/2011/03/08/robby-kriegerinterview-the-doors-gibson-guitars-and-jim-morrison/|publisher=Guitar International Group, LLC.|accessdate=2011-10-10|title=Robby Krieger Interview: The Doors, Gibson guitars and Jim Morrison[/tpl] His first exposure to music was mostly classical, as his father was a big fan of marching music, until he heard Peter and the Wolf, which was the first music that really caught him. When he was seven, Krieger accidentally broke his record player, but the radio began to reach his ears playing the likes of Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and the Platters. At 10, he tried the trumpet, but found it was not for him. He began playing the blues on his parents' piano with much more success than the trumpet.
While Krieger was attending a private school, there was study time at night that allowed him to teach himself to play the guitar. He began by learning flamenco, borrowing a friend's guitar. When Krieger was 18, he got his own flamenco guitar and took lessons for a few months. He bounced around genres, including flamenco, folk, blues, and jazz. After high school, Krieger attended the University of California, Santa Barbara.The Official John Densmore Forum > The Lore Of The Doors. Forum.johndensmore.com.

==The Doors==

Krieger was a member of the Doors along with keyboard player Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and vocalist Jim Morrison. At an early Doors rehearsal Morrison heard Krieger playing bottleneck guitar and initially wanted the technique featured on every song on the first album.Robby Krieger, an interview of Ray Manzarek (@40") http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQUbqHbwT64 Krieger's fingerstyle approach to the electric guitar, broad musical tastes, and songwriting helped establish the Doors as a successful rock band in the 1960s.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Krieger occasionally sang for the Doors. His only singing with the early Doors can be heard on the album The Soft Parade, on the song "Runnin' Blue". He also sang on the last two Doors albums, recorded after Morrison's death, Other Voices and Full Circle.
