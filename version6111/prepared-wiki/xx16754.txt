[[Four Pillars of the Green Party]]

CATEGORIES: Green political parties, Liberalism

The Four Pillars of the Green Party are a foundational statement of Green politics and form the basis of many worldwide Green parties. Different Green Parties that list the Four Pillars phrase them somewhat differently.  In general, the four pillars define a Green Party as a political movement that interrelates its philosophy from four different social movements: the environmental movement, the labour movement, the civil rights movement, and the peace movement.
The Four Pillars are:

==History of the Four Pillars==

The practice of describing Green philosophy via Four Pillars began with the German Green Party in 1979-1980. At its founding meeting in 1984, the Green Committees of Correspondence in the United States expanded these into the Ten Key Values.[tpl]cite web |title=Ten Key Values on www.gp.org|url=http://www.gp.org/tenkey.shtml[/tpl]
For the Australian Greens, they are known as "Ecological sustainability", "Social and economic justice", "Peace and nonviolence", and "Grassroots democracy".
For the German Greens (Die Grünen/Bündnis 90), they are known as "ökologisch", "sozial", "basisdemokratisch" and "gewaltfrei" (latter is non-violent).
For the Swedish Greens (Miljöpartiet de Gröna), in the 1980s they were called the Four Solidarities: "Solidarity with the ecological systems", "Solidarity with the people throughout the world", "Solidarity with future generations", and "Solidarity with the underprivileged people in our own country".  Today they omit the pillar of Solidarity with the underprivileged, leaving them with the Three Solidarities: "Solidarity with animals, nature and the ecological system", "Solidarity with future generations", and "Solidarity with all the world’s people."
On the global level, the Six Principles of the Global Greens Charter - which at the Global Greens conference of 2001 were arrived upon as a compromise of the North American and European traditions - added Respect for diversity and Sustainability. The Green Party of Canada, in 2002 adopted the Six Principles of the Global Greens as its official doctrine.http://www.greenparty.ca/party/values www.greenparty.ca
