[[Socialist Party USA]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1973, Socialist Party USA, Democratic socialism

The Socialist Party USA (SPUSA) is a multi-tendency democratic-socialist party in the United States. The party states that it is the rightful continuation and successor to the tradition of the Socialist Party of America, which had lasted from 1901 to 1972.
The party is officially committed to left-wing democratic socialism. The Socialist Party USA, along with its predecessors, has received varying degrees of support when its candidates have competed against those from the Republican and Democratic parties. Some attribute this to the party having to compete with the financial dominance of the two major parties, as well as the limitations of the United States' legislativelyWinger, Richard.

The Party supports third-party candidates, particularly socialists, and opposes the candidates of the two major parties.
Opposing both capitalism and "authoritarian Communism", the Party advocates bringing big business under public ownership and democratic workers' self-management. The party opposes unaccountable bureaucratic control of industry, as it claims was the case in the Soviet Union.[tpl]cite web |author=|url=http://socialistparty-usa.org/principles.html  |title=Socialist Party USA: Statement of Principles | date = | publisher = Socialist Party USA |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Background===

In 1958, the Independent Socialist League led by Max Shachtman dissolved to join the Socialist Party of America. Shachtman 2008, pp. 63. had written that Soviet communism was a new form of class society, bureaucratic collectivism, in which the ruling class exploited and oppressed the population, and therefore he opposed the spread of communism.[tpl]harvtxt|Drucker|1994[/tpl]: [tpl]cite book |title=Max Shachtman and his left: A socialist's odyssey through the "American Century"|first=Peter|last=Drucker|publisher=Humanities Press|year=1994|isbn=0-391-03816-8|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Beichman|first=Arnold|authorlink=Arthur Beichman|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/jul/28/20020728-035033-3037r/?feat=article_related_stories|title=Communism to anti-communism in lives of two rival editors (review two ISI books, James Burnham and the struggle for the world: A life by Daniel Kelly and Principles and heresies: Frank S. Meyer and the shaping of the American conservative movement by Kevin J. Smant)|publisher= |date=July 28, 2002 | newspaper=The Washington Times|accessdate=14 July 2011[/tpl] Shachtman also argued that democratic socialists should work with activists from labor unions and civil-rights organizations  to help build a social-democratic "realignment" of the Democratic Party. He died on 4 November 1972.
 In its 1972 Convention, the Socialist Party changed its name to "Social Democrats, USA" by a vote of 73 to 34.[ref]
The New York Times reported on the Convention for other days, e.g.,
[/ref] The change of name was supported by the two Co-Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman (of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union, ILGWU),Gerald Sorin, The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 155. and by the First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser; these three were re-elected by acclamation.
Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be "realistic". The New York Times observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored Darlington Hoopes as its candidate for President in the 1956 election, who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name "party" had been "misleading"; "party" had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according the majority report. The name "Socialist" was replaced by "Social Democrats" because many American associated the word "socialism" with Soviet communism. Also, the Party wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties.[tpl]cite news |title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=New York Times |date=December 27, 1972 |ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70B10FF3B5C177B93C5AB1789D95F468785F9&scp=7&sq=Young+socialists&st=p|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf[/tpl]

Friedman,[tpl]cite news |title='Firmness' urged on Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=New York Times |date=January 1, 1973 |page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv[/tpl] who also had opposed the name change.
The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote, with the majority caucus winning every vote. On foreign policy, the program called for "firmness toward Communist aggression". However, on the Vietnam War, the program opposed "any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission" and to work for a peace agreement that would protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for an immediate cease fire and an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces was defeated. Harrington complained that, after its previous convention, the Socialist Party had endorsed George McGovern with a  statement of "constructive criticism" and had not mobilized enough support for McGovern.
After their defeat at the Convention, members of two minority caucuses helped to found new socialist organizations. At most 200 members of the Coalition Caucus joined Michael Harrington in forming the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which later became the Democratic Socialists of America.[tpl]cite news |author=Mitgang, Herbert |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/obituaries/michael-harrington-socialist-and-author-is-dead.html?pagewanted=all |title=Michael Harrington, Socialist and Author, Is Dead |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 2, 1989 |accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl] At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.[ref][tpl]harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993|pp=195–196[/tpl]:  [tpl]cite book |last=O'Rourke|first=William|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&pg=PA195|chapter=L: Michael Harrington|title=Signs of the literary times: Essays, reviews, profiles, 1970-1992'|pages=192–196|publisher=SUNY Press|series=The Margins of Literature (SUNY Series)|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1681-X|id=ISBN 9780791416815|ref=harv[/tpl]

===Subsequent History===

Since 1989, a member of the party was elected to the city council of Iowa City and several members have won tens of thousands of votes when losing elections for statewide offices. In 1992, Socialist Iowa City Councilwoman Karen Kubby won her re-election with the highest vote in a contested election in the history of the Iowa City Council, and was re-elected  until retiring from the Council in 2000.[tpl]cite news |author=Lowenstein, Adam |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CR&z=CRGB&p_theme=cr&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFE9EDA6CDFD4B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Kubby won't run again for City Council|date=May 26, 1999 | work = The Gazette |accessdate=February 7, 2010[/tpl] In 2000, Socialist Wendell Harris received 19% of the vote for Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the primary."Norquist, Watts Win Mayoral Primary Election in Milwaukee" ''St. Paul Pioneer Press February 16, 2000; p. 2B In 2008, Socialist Jon Osborne pulled in 22% of the vote for Rhode Island's 34th District State Senate seat, while listed on the ballot under the Socialist Party USA label.[tpl]cite web |author=|url=http://www.elections.state.ri.us/elections/results/2008/general_election/races/400.php |title=2008 General Election Results - Senator in General Assembly District 34|date= | publisher= State of Rhode Island: Board of Election |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl] During the 2010 United States Senate elections Dan La Botz of the Socialist Party of Ohio received 25,368 (0.68%) votes in Ohio.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vote.sos.state.oh.us/pls/enrpublic/f?p=130:6:0|title=State of Ohio 2010 General Election November 2, 2010 Unofficial Results|work=Ohio Secretary of State|date=November 2, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2010[/tpl] In 2011, Socialist Matt Erard was elected to a three-year term on the city of Detroit’s Downtown District Citizens’ District Council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://erard2011.spmichigan.org/?page_id=56|title=Socialist Candidate Elected To City Of Detroit Downtown Citizens District Council|work=Detroit's Downtown District Citizens’ District Council|date=April 16, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2011[/tpl] In 2012, Socialist Pat Noble unseated his incumbent opponent in winning election to the Red Bank Regional High School Board of Education,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2012/11/07/new-jersey-socialist-party-secretary-elected-to-regional-high-school-board-of-education/|title=New Jersey Socialist Party Secretary Elected to Regional High School Board of Education | work=Ballot Access News|date=November 7, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012[/tpl] Socialist John Strinka received 10% of the vote while running with the party's ballot label for  Indiana's 39th district State House seat,[tpl]cite web |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/state_sen_house/IN.html?SITE=KYLOUELN&SECTION=POLITICS|title=Election Results | work=Courier Journal|date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012[/tpl] and Socialist Troy Thompson received 27% of the vote for Mayor of Floodwood, Minnesota.[tpl]cite web |url=http://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/ENR/Results/GetMunicipalOfficesResults/1?districtid=21338&officelist=O%3A1156%2CO%3A1157%2C|title=MN Election Results |date=November 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 28, 2013[/tpl] Also in 2012, candidate Mary Alice Herbert received 13.1% of the vote for Vermont Secretary of State while running with the dual nomination of both the Socialist and  Vermont Liberty Union parties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vermont-elections.org/elections1/2012ElectionResults/2012GeneralElectionResults/2012GEStatewideCanvass.pdf#page=3|title=Official Report of the Canvassing Committee United States and Vermont Statewide Offices General Election, November 6, 2012|work=Vermont Secretary of State Elections Division | date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.commonsnews.org/site/site03/story.php?articleno=5743&page=1|title=Support a skatepark in Home Depot | work=The Commons|date=July 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012[/tpl]

===Membership===

According to the party's first chairman, Frank Zeidler, the party had around 500 members nationwide in 1975. The Socialist Party experienced substantial growth during the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s, expanding from only around 600 dues-paying members to around 1,700.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/may2009/db20090522_329825_page_2.htm |title=Socialism?

==Ideology==

===Positions===

While some SP members favor a more gradual approach to socialism, most others envision a more sweeping or revolutionary  transformation of society from capitalist to socialist through the decisive victory of the working class in the class struggle. Some SP members also advocate revolutionary nonviolence  or pacifism, while some consider armed struggle a possible necessity. The Party's Statement of Principles rejects equating socialism with a "welfare state" and calls for democratic social revolution from below. The party is strongly committed to principles of socialist feminism and strives to further embody such commitment in its organizational structure. Its national constitution requires gender parity among its national co-chairs and co-vice chairs, its national committee members and alternates, and seated members of its branch- and region-elected delegations to the Party's biennial national conventions.[tpl]cite web |author=|url=http://socialistparty-usa.org/platform/ |title=2010-2011 Platform |date= | publisher=Socialist Party USA |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=|url=http://socialistparty-usa.org/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the Socialist Party USA |date= | publisher=Socialist Party USA |accessdate=June 5, 2010[/tpl] The Socialist Party also rejected the new healthcare reform law of 2010 approved by the Obama administration, with SP National Co-Chair Billy Wharton claiming it to be "a corporate restructuring of the health insurance industry created to protect the profit margins of private insurance companies".[tpl]cite news |author= Mcauliff, Michael |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2010/03/tea-party-head-spinner-sociali.html |title=Tea Party Head Spinner: Socialists Oppose Health Bill |date=March 22, 2010| work=New York Daily News |accessdate=March 28, 2010[/tpl]

He concluded with; "The time for slick public relations campaigns has ended - the time for building our grassroots movements is more urgent than ever. The Socialist Party USA stands ready to join in such a political revitalization".[tpl]cite news | title = Socialist Party response to Obama's state of the union speech | url = http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2010/01/socialist-party-response-to-ob.html | author = Altimari, Daniela | date = January 28, 2010 | work = Hartford Courant |accessdate=February 7, 2010| language = [/tpl]

====International affairs====

The Party's National Action Committee condemned the Israeli actions during the Gaza War. The party demands that the Federal government of the United States cease providing military aid to the State of Israel as a precondition for peace.

During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.
