[tpl]nihongo|Emperor Go-Reizei|後冷泉天皇|Go-Reizei-tennō|August 28, 1023 – May 22, 1068[/tpl] was the 70th emperor of Japan,Imperial Household Agency (Kunaichō): 後冷泉天皇 (70) according to the traditional order of succession.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 76.
Go-Reizei's reign spanned the years 1045–1068.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 162–166;  Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukanshō, pp. 311–314; ; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki. p. 197-198.
This 11th century sovereign was named after the 10th century Emperor Reizei and go- (後), translates literally as "later;" and thus, he is sometimes called the "Later Emperor Reizei". The Japanese word "go" has also been translated to mean the "second one;" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Reizei, the second," or as "Reizei II."

==Traditional narrative==

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina)Brown, pp. 264; prior to Emperor Jomei, the personal names of the emperors were very long and people did not generally use them.  The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign. was Chikahito-shinnō (親仁親王).Titsingh, p. 162; Brown, p. 311, Varley, p. 197.
He was the eldest son of Emperor Go-Suzaku.  His mother was Fujiwara no Kishi (藤原嬉子), formerly Naishi-no kami, daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga.
Go-Reizei had three Empresses and no Imperial sons or daughters.Brown, p. 311.

===Events of Go-Reizei's life===

The actual site of Go-Reizei's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.
The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Reizei's mausoleum.  It is formally named Enkyo-ji no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 421.
Go-Reizei is buried amongst the "Seven Imperial Tombs" at Ryoan-ji Temple in Kyoto.The "Seven Imperial Tombs" at Ryoan-ji are the burial places of Uda, Kazan, Ichijō, Go-Suzaku, Go-Reizei, Go-Sanjō, and Horikawa.
The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Go-Reizei is today named Shu-zan.  The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Go-Reizei died.Moscher, Gouveneur. (1978). Kyoto: A Contemplative Guide, pp. 277–278.
These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (misasagi) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===

[tpl]nihongo|Kugyō|公卿[/tpl] is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Reizei's reign, this apex of the ''Daijō-kan included:
