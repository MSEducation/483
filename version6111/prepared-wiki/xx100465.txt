The Citizens' Action Party ([tpl]lang-es|Partido Acción Ciudadana[/tpl]; commonly abbreviated as PAC) is a left-leaning political party in Costa Rica. In 2014, PAC presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Solís earned the most votes in the general election, causing his main rival to cease campaigning, making Solís the de facto president elect.
Its platform is based on encouraging citizen participation and involvement in politics.  One of its guiding ideals is to fight against corruption, arguing that it is one of the main causes of under development and voter apathy. The party took a leading role in the failed campaign against Costa Rica's membership of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

==History and elections==

===Founding and 2002 election===

PAC was founded in December 2000 by several dissidents from Costa Rica's two traditional parties, the National Liberation Party and the Social Christian Unity Party. Originally an anti-corruption party, it startled the Costa Rican political arena with a very strong showing in the 2002 general elections.  In the presidential vote, party founder and candidate Ottón Solís was able to secure 26% of the votes – an unprecedented amount for a third party in Costa Rica – and force a runoff between the PLN and PUSC.
The party won 21.9% of the popular vote and 14 out of 57 seats in the Legislative Assembly, making it the third strongest political force in the legislature.  A few months later, however, after a series of internal disputes, six of the party's 14 deputies resigned from the party, leaving PAC with only eight seats.

===2006 election===

In the February 5, 2006 parliamentary election, the party won 17 out of 57 seats. Ottón Solís ran for president again, losing to the PLN's Oscar Arias Sanchez by less than .2% of the votes. Arias only won by a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff.  The number of spoiled ballots was larger than the margin between Solís and Arias.
After the 2006 election, Ótton Solís took a year away from politics to teach in the United States. Former PAC Secretary General Luis Guillermo Solís' name began being circulated at meetings of the "ungroup," an informal gathering of PAC officials, led by former deputy Alberto Salom.[tpl]cite news|last=Oviedo|first=Estaban|title=Luis Guillermo Solís: El profesor desconocido que, en tres años, llegó a ser el presidente|trans_title=Luis Guillermo Solís: The unknown professor who, in three years, became president|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-desconocido-presidente_0_1407059351.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=La Nación (San Jose)|date=8 April 2014|location=San José|language=Es[/tpl] Several PAC officials wanted Luis Guillermo Solís to run as a deputy in San José and as a vice presidential candidate in 2010.

===2010 election===

In the 2010 election, Ottón Solís ran for his third and final time as president. Laura Chinchilla of the PLN won, but Ottón Solís finished with 25.2% of the votes.

Six candidates won municipal elections in the rural communities of Aserrí, Matina, Hojancha, Cañas, Los Chiles y Guatuso.

===2014 election===

In 2013, PAC held its second national convention. It was an open convention in which any citizen could vote, despite party affiliation. For candidates vied for the primary to represent PAC in the 2014 national elections: Epsy Campbell Barr, Juan Carlos Mendoza, Luis Guillermo Solís, and Ronald Solís Bolaños, with Luis Guillermo Solís winning 35% of the votes.
On 6 April 2014, Luis Guillermo Solís became the president elect of Costa Rica.

==Platform==

While cleaning up corruption has been one of PAC's main goals since its creation, Solís has added to the party's platform. He wants to build infrastructure, bolster Costa Rica's universal health care and social security systems[tpl]cite news |last=Dyer |first=Zach |title=Costa Rican presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Solís: 'It's not going to be business as usual' |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2013/11/04/costa-rican-presidential-candidate-luis-guillermo-solis-it-s-not-going-to-be-business-as-usual |accessdate=3 February 2014 |newspaper=The Tico Times |date=3 November 2013[/tpl] and push for environmentally friendly policies.[tpl]cite news |last=Díaz |first=Luis Edo. |title=Luis Guillermo Solís llama a sus seguidores a 'cambiar la historia' patria |trans_title=Luis Guillermo Solís calls on his supporters to 'change history' for the country |language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-seguidores-historia_0_1393060748.html |accessdate=3 February 2014 |newspaper=La Nación |place=San José |date=27 January 2014[/tpl] Historically, PAC has opposed free trade agreements such as CAFTA, which Solís claims is improperly implemented.[tpl]cite news |last=Sequeira |first=Aaron |title=Luis Guillermo Solís propone evitar firma de nuevos tratados comerciales |trans_title=Luis Guillermo Solís proposes avoiding the signing of new free trade agreements |language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-tratados-comerciales_0_1397860268.html |accessdate=20 February 2014 |newspaper=La Nación |place=San José |date=20 February 2014[/tpl] In addition, PAC claims that the country's tax system is inadequate, saying that more "progressive" system is needed.[tpl]cite news |last=Leiton| first=Patricia |title=PAC haría reforma fiscal, impuesto por impuesto| trans_title=PAC will make fiscal reforms, tax by tax| language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/economia/politica-economica/PAC-haria-reforma-fiscal-impuesto_0_1404259568.html| accessdate=24 March 2014| newspaper=La Nacion| place=San José| date=24 March 2014[/tpl]

===International relations===

Unlike other Costa Rican parties, PAC is not affiliated with an international organization. Nevertheless, it maintains informal relations with other progressive parties. Ottón Solís has independently met with Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist Party of Chile during a visit to Costa Rica, Cristina Fernández, and members of the Democratic Party of the United States.[tpl]cite news|title=Felicita Argentina a presidente-electo de Costa Rica|trans_title=Argentina congratulates president-elect of Costa Rica|url=http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&idioma=1&id=2556281&Itemid=1|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=La Prensa Latina|date=7 April 2014|location=Havana|language=Es[/tpl]
