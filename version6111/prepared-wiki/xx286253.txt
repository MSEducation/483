===Athabaska===

She was particularly enthusiastic about the Athabaska region and the Athabaska tar sands which included photos of Count Alfred Von Hammerstein's oil drill works along the Athabasca River. "While the Count was unsuccessful drilling for "elephant pools of oil," Cameron’s book and its images became a best seller and made her a media celebrity."[tpl]harv|Gismondi|2012|71[/tpl] "In all Canada there is no more interesting stretch of waterway than that upon which we are entering. An earth-movement here has created a line of fault clearly visible for seventy or eighty miles along the river-bank, out of which oil oozes at frequent intervals. … Tar there is … in plenty. … It oozes from every fissure, and into some bituminous tar well we can poke a twenty foot pole and find no resistance.[tpl]harv|1909|Cameron|71[/tpl] cited in [tpl]harv|Gismondi|2012|71[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Imagining the Tar Sands: 1880 -1967 and Beyond|author1=Mike Gismondi|author2=Debra J.
