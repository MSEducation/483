==Reception==

Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! gave the film 6 out of 10, saying: "Overall, it's a beautiful, well-acted work packed with gorgeous art design, but one that falls prey to the occasional indulgence - bloated scenes, garish synthesizer music - that detracts from the film's impact".[tpl]cite web|first=Scott A.|last=Gray|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/TIFFRetrospective/makioka_sisters-directed_by_kon_ichikawa|title=The Makioka Sisters - Directed by Kon Ichikawa|publisher=Exclaim!|date=January 24, 2013[/tpl]
