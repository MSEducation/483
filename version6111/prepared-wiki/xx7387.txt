[[Malpighiales]]

CATEGORIES: Malpighiales, Angiosperm orders

Malpighiales is one of the largest orders of flowering plants, containing about 16000 species, approximately 7.8% of the eudicots.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). Malpighiales At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website The order is very diverse, containing plants as different as the willow, violet, Poinsettia and coca plant, and hard to recognize except with molecular phylogenetic evidence. It is not part of any of the classification systems that are based only on plant morphology. Molecular clock calculations estimate the origin of stem group Malpighiales at around 100 Mya (million years ago) and the origin of crown group Malpighiales at about 90 Mya.[tpl]citation | author = Susana Magallón and Amanda Castillo | year = 2009 | title = Angiosperm diversification through time | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 349–365 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.0800060 | pmid = 21628193 [/tpl]
Malpighiales is divided into 32 to 42 families, depending upon which clades in the order are given the taxonomic rank of family.[tpl]citation | author = Kenneth J. Wurdack and Charles C.

The largest family, by far, is Euphorbiaceae, with about 6300 species in about 245 genera.Alan Radcliffe-Smith. 2001. Genera Euphorbiacearum. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Richmond, England.
In a 2009 study of DNA sequences of 13 genes, 42 families were placed into 16 groups, ranging in size from one to ten families. Almost nothing is known about the relationships among these 16 groups. Malpighiales and Lamiales are the two large orders whose phylogeny remains mostly unresolved.[tpl]citation | author = Douglas E. Soltis, Pamela S. Soltis, Peter K. Endress, and Mark W.

==History==

The great French botanist Charles Plumier named the genus Malpighia in honor of Marcello Malpighi's work on plants; Malpighia is the type genus for the Malpighiaceae, a family of tropical and subtropical flowering plants.
The family Malpighiaceae was the type family for one of the orders created by Jussieu in his 1789 work Genera Plantarum.[tpl]citation | author = Antoine Laurent de Jussieu | year = 1789 | title = Genera Plantarum | page = 252 | publisher = Herrisant and Barrois | place = Paris | url = http://books.google.com/?id=qjUhAAAAYAAJ&dq=antonii+laurentii+genera+plantarum&printsec=frontcover&q= [/tpl] Friedrich von Berchtold and Jan Presl described such an order in 1820.[tpl]citation | author = James L. Reveal | date = 2008 onward | contribution = A Checklist of Family and Suprafamilial Names for Extant Vascular Plants | title = Home page of James L Reveal and C. Rose Broome | url = http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal | contribution-url = http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/fam/supgennames.html [/tpl] Unlike modern taxonomists, these authors did not use the suffix "ales" in naming their orders. The name "Malpighiales" is attributed by some to Carl von Martius. In the twentieth century, it was usually associated with John Hutchinson, who used it in all three editions of his book, The Families of Flowering Plants.John Hutchinson The Families of Flowering Plants 3rd edition. 1973. Oxford University Press. The name was not used by those who wrote later, in the nineteen seventies, eighties, and nineties.
The taxon was largely presaged by Hans Hallier in 1912 in an article in the Archiv. Néerl. Sci. Exact. Nat. titled "L'Origine et le système phylétique des angiospermes," in which his Passionales and Polygalinae were derived from Linaceae (in Guttales), with Passionales containing 7 (of 8) families that also appear in the current Malpighiales, namely Passifloraceae, Salicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Achariaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Malesherbiaceae, and Turneraceae, and  Polygalinae containing 4 (of 10) families that also appear in the current Malpighiales, namely Malpighiaceae, Violaceae, Dichapetalaceae, and Trigoniaceae.Lawrence, George. 1960. Taxonomy of Vascular Plants, p. 132. Macmillan, New York
The first semblance of Malpighiales as we now know it came from a phylogeny of seed plants published in 1993 and based upon DNA sequences of the gene rbcL.Mark W. Chase et alii (42 authors). 1993. "Phylogenetics of seed plants: An analysis of nucleotide sequences from the plastid gene rbcL". Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 80(3):528-580. This study recovered a group of rosids unlike any group found in any previous system of plant classification. In order to make a clear break with classification systems being used at that time, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group resurrected Hutchinson's name, even though his concept of Malpighiales included much of what is now in Celastrales and Oxalidales.[tpl]citation | author = The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group | year = 2003 | title = An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 141 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118872219/PDFSTART | doi = 10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x [/tpl]

==Circumscription==

Malpighiales is monophyletic and in molecular phylogenetic studies, it receives strong statistical support. Since the APG II system was published in 2003, minor changes to the circumscription of the order have been made. The family Peridiscaceae has been expanded from two genera, to three, and then to four, and transferred to Saxifragales.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Soltis | first1 = Douglas E. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Joshua W. | last3 = Davis | first3 = Charles C. | last4 = Gitzendanner | first4 = Matthew A. | last5 = Cheek | first5 = Martin | last6 = Savolainen | first6 = Vincent | last7 = Amorim | first7 = André M. | last8 = Soltis | first8 = Pamela S. | year = 2007 | title = Monophyly and relationships of the enigmatic family Peridiscaceae | url = | journal = Taxon | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 65–73 [/tpl]
The genera Cyrillopsis (Ixonanthaceae), Centroplacus (Centroplacaceae), Bhesa (Centroplacaceae), Aneulophus (Erythroxylaceae), Ploiarium (Bonnetiaceae), Trichostephanus (Samydaceae), Sapria (Rafflesiaceae), Rhizanthes (Rafflesiaceae), and Rafflesia (Rafflesiaceae) had been either added or confirmed as members of Malpighiales by the end of 2009.
Some family delimitations have changed as well, most notably, the segregation of Calophyllaceae from Clusiaceae sensu lato when it was shown that the latter is paraphyletic. Some differences of opinion on family delimitation exist as well. For example, Samydaceae and Scyphostegiaceae may be recognized as families or included in a large version of Salicaceae.Mac H. Alford. 2007. "Samydaceae". Version 6 February 2007". In: The Tree of Life Web Project.
The group is difficult to characterize phenotypically although members often have dentate leaves, with the teeth having  a single vein running into a congested and often deciduous apex (i.e., violoid, salicoid, or theoid).Judd, W.S. & Olmstead, R.G. 2004. A survey of tricolpate(eudicot) phylogenetic relationships. Amer. J. Bot. 91: 1627–1644. Also, zeylanol  has recently been discovered in Balanops and Dichapetalum Darbah V. F., Oppong, E. K. & Eminah, J. K. 2012.Chemical investigation of the stem bark of Dichapetalum magascariennse Poir. International Journal of Applied Chemistry 8 (3), 199-207. which are in the balanops clade (so-called Chrysobalanaceae s. l.). The so-called parietal suborder (the clusioid clade and Ochnaceae s. l. were also part of Parietales) corresponds with the traditional Violales as 8 (Achariaceae, Violaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lacistemataceae, Scyphostegiaceae, Turneraceae, Malesherbiaceae, and Passifloraceae) of the order's 10 families along with Salicaceae, which have usually been assigned as a related order or suborder,Brummitt, 1992. Vascular Plant Families and Genera. Kew. are in this most derived malpighian suborder, so that 8 of the 10 families of this suborder are Violales. The Flacourtiaceae family has proven to be polyphyletic as the cyanogenic members have been placed in Achariaceae and the ones with salicoid teeth were transferred to Salicaceae.

==Phylogeny==

As we know it in 2009, the phylogeny of Malpighiales is, at its deepest level, an unresolved polytomy of 16 clades. It has been estimated that complete resolution of the phylogeny will require at least 25000 base pairs of DNA sequence data per taxon.[tpl]citation | author = Shuguang Jian, Pamela S.

The statistical support for each branch is 100% bootstrap percentage and 100% posterior probability, except where labeled, with bootstrap percentage followed by posterior probability.

In 2012, Xi et al. managed to obtain a more resolved phylogenetic tree than previous studies through the use of data from a large number of genes. They included analyses of 82 plastid genes from 58 species (they ignored the problematic Rafflesiaceae), using partitions identified a posteriori by applying a Bayesian mixture model. Xi et al. had identified 12 additional clades and three major, basal clades.Catalogue of Organisms: Malpighiales: A Glorious Mess of Flowering Plants[tpl]Cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1205818109[/tpl]
