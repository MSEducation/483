AT&T Teleholdings, Inc., formerly known as Ameritech Corporation (and before that American Information Technologies Corporation), was a U.S. telecommunications company that arose out of the 1984 AT&T divestiture. Ameritech was one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies that was created following the breakup of the Bell System. Ameritech was acquired by SBC Communications in 1999 which subsequently acquired AT&T Corporation in 2006, becoming the present-day AT&T Inc.

==Overview==

Ameritech was created as a holding company; under its umbrella were:
For Ameritech's first nine years, it maintained these Bell brands inherited from the Bell Systemâ€”though public displays of the Bell companies' names were often captioned "An Ameritech Company". In January 1993, Ameritech officially retired the Bell brands and marketed itself with solely the Ameritech name across all five states in its territory. It added "d/b/a Ameritech (state)" to the names of its Bells to communicate brand unity.
Ameritech also owned Ameritech Cellular, a wireless company that operated cellular networks in many of the major cities of these states. Ameritech Cellular was previously called Ameritech Mobile Communications.
Prior to its merger with SBC Communications, Ameritech's corporate headquarters were in a leased space above the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on floors 34 through 39 of 30 S Wacker Dr, Chicago IL. Further corporate offices were located at 225 W Randolph St, Chicago IL (formerly "The Illinois Bell Building") and 2000 W. Ameritech Center Drive, Hoffman Estates, IL ("The Ameritech Center"). It was traded on the NYSE under the "AIT" symbol.

==Merger with SBC Communications==

In May 1998, Ameritech announced its intent to merge with SBC Communications. This brought great concern to Federal and state regulators, who in turn didn't approve the merger until SBC and Ameritech agreed to several conditions to ensure adequate competition.FCC conditions Most notably, regulators required:
SBC and Ameritech officially merged on 1999-10-08. Prior to the merger, Ameritech's Chairman and CEO was Richard Notebaert, who later (in 2002) became CEO of competitor Qwest.

===The end of the Ameritech name===

On January 15, 2003, SBC Communications changed its d/b/a names, changed the legal name of Ameritech Corp. to SBC Teleholdings, Inc., which began doing business as SBC Midwest. On January 15, 2006, d/b/a names were again changed, and Ameritech was again renamed, becoming AT&T Teleholdings, Inc.[tpl]cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=169415 |title=AT&T Teleholdings, Inc.: Private Company Information - BusinessWeek |accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl] and began doing business as AT&T Midwest.
Several Ameritech subsidiaries remain legally named "Ameritech", such as Ameritech Advanced Services; however, they do business as "AT&T Advanced Solutions".
In 2006, the holding companies Pacific Telesis and Southern New England Telecommunications were legally merged into AT&T Teleholdings. The company then became a holding company for Pacific Bell (and its subsidiary Nevada Bell) and Southern New England Telephone.

==Cultural reference==

The Ameritech name was used in the storyline of the U.S. television miniseries Amerika to refer to one of the "sovereign" autonomous regions--Ameritech's regional operating area, the Great Lakes area of North America--that the former United States was divided into in result of the fictional Soviet occupation that is the base premise of the miniseries' plot.
