==Song information==

The first track, "Intro", contains a sample from the documentary 'Hoop Dreams (1994)'.  William Gates, one of the basketball players followed in the movies speaks from his recover room after surgery. The commentary forms the lyrics to the track. The "Cold Water Music" contains a sample of "Maureen in the Desert" written by Carter Burwell, and taken from the soundtrack to the film Psycho III (1986). The track "Ain't Got Time to Waste" is featured on the soundtrack of the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The extended dialogue in the track "Demonique" was sampled from the John Carpenter horror movies, Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981). It features (primarily) the exchanges between the characters of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers). The song was mimicked for a television advertisement for the Toyota RAV4 in the UK in 2006.
