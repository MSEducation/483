[[Monoceros]]

CATEGORIES: Monoceros (constellation), Constellations, Equatorial constellations

Monoceros (Greek: Μονόκερως) is a faint constellation on the celestial equator. Its name is Greek for unicorn. Its definition is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius. It is bordered by Orion to the west, Gemini to the north, Canis Major to the south and Hydra to the east. Other bordering constellations include Canis Minor, Lepus and Puppis.

==Notable features==

===Stars===

Monoceros is a constellation that is not very easily seen with the naked eye, with only a few fourth magnitude stars. Alpha Monocerotis has a visual magnitude of 3.93, slightly brighter than Gamma Monocerotis at 3.98.
However, Monoceros does have some interesting features to observe with the aid of a small telescope. Beta Monocerotis is an impressive triple star system, the three stars forming a triangle which seems to be fixed. The visual magnitudes of the stars are 4.7, 5.2 and 6.1. William Herschel discovered it in 1781 and commented that it is "one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens".
Epsilon Monocerotis is a fixed binary, with visual magnitudes of 4.5 and 6.5.
S Monocerotis, or 15 Monocerotis, is a bluish white variable star and is located at the center of NGC 2264. The variation in its magnitude is slight (4.2–4.6). It has a companion star of visual magnitude 8.
V838 Monocerotis, a variable red supergiant star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased by a factor of 10,000 in one day. After the outburst was over, the Hubble Space Telescope was able to observe a light echo, which illuminated the dust surrounding the star.[tpl]cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3[/tpl]
Monoceros also contains Plaskett's Star, which is a massive binary system whose combined mass is estimated to be that of almost 100 Suns put together.

===Planets===

Monoceros contains two super-Earth exoplanets in one planetary system: COROT-7b was detected by the COROT satellite and COROT-7c was detected by HARPS from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, COROT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's). Both planets in this system were discovered in 2009.

===Deep-sky objects===

Monoceros contains many clusters and nebulae, most notable among them:

==History==

Monoceros is a relatively modern constellation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius in 1612 or 1613Le costellazioni di Petrus Plancius on atlascoelestis.com and it was later charted by Jakob Bartsch as Unicornus in his star chart of 1624.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert|title=Illustrated Guide to Astronomical Wonders: From Novice to Master Observer|year=2007|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=9780596526856|page=314|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ymt9nj_uPhwC&dq=Jakob+Bartsch+monoceros&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]

Joseph Scaliger is reported[tpl]cite book | last = Allen | first = Richard Hinckley | title = Star Names - their lore and meaning, online link | publisher = Dover | year = 1899 | page = 290 [/tpl] to have found Monoceros on an ancient Persian sphere. Flammarion believed that a former constellation, Neper (the "Auger"), occupied the area of the sky now home to Monoceros and Microscopium, but this is disputed. Allen, p. 290.
Chinese asterisms Sze Fūh, the Four Great Canals; Kwan Kew; and Wae Choo, the Outer Kitchen, all lay within the boundaries of Monoceros. Allen, p. 290.
