It was created by an international agreement as the International Office of Epizootics (still known by its French acronym  'Office International des Epizooties'' â€“ OIE''') on 25 January 1924. It is recognised as a reference organisation by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and maintains permanent relations with 35 other international and regional organisations. Its headquarters are in Paris, France.
