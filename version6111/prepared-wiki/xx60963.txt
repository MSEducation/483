[[Image:Cornu Spiral.svg|250px|thumb|
Euler spiral (x, y) = (C(t), S(t)). The spiral converges to the centre of the holes in the image as t tends to positive or negative infinity.]]
The Euler spiral, also known as Cornu spiral or clothoid, is the curve generated by a parametric plot of S(t) against C(t). The Cornu spiral was created by Marie Alfred Cornu as a nomogram for diffraction computations in science and engineering.
From the definitions of Fresnel integrals, the infinitesimals dx and dy are thus:
Thus the length of the spiral measured from the origin can be expressed as:
And the rate of change of curvature with respect to the curve length is:
An Euler spiral has the property that its curvature at any point is proportional to the distance along the spiral, measured from the origin.  This property makes it useful as a transition curve in highway and railway engineering.
If a vehicle follows the spiral at unit speed, the parameter [tpl]math| t[/tpl] in the above derivatives also represents the time. That is, a vehicle following the spiral at constant speed will have a constant rate of angular acceleration.
Sections from Euler spirals are commonly incorporated into the shape of roller-coaster loops to make what are known as "clothoid loops".

===Evaluation===

The limits of C and S as the argument tends to infinity can be found by the methods of complex analysis. This uses the contour integral of the function
around the boundary of the sector-shaped region in the complex plane formed by the positive x-axis, the half-line y = x, x ≥ 0, and the circle of radius R centered at the origin.
As R goes to infinity, the integral along the circular arc tends to 0, the integral along the real axis tends to the Gaussian integral
and after routine transformations, the integral along the bisector of the first quadrant can be related to the limit of the Fresnel integrals.

==Generalization==

The integral
is a confluent hypergeometric function and also an incomplete Gamma function
which reduces to Fresnel integrals if real or imaginary parts are taken:
The leading term in the asymptotic expansion is
and therefore
For m=0, the imaginary part of this equation in particular is
The Kummer transformation of the confluent hypergeometric function is
with

==Applications==

The Fresnel integrals were originally used in the calculation of the field intensity in an environment related to the bending of light around opaque objects.[tpl]cite web|last=Beatty|first=Thomas|title=How to evaluate Fresnel Integrals|url=http://www.thomasbeatty.com/MATH%20PAGES/ARCHIVES%20-%20NOTES/Complex%20Variables/How%20to%20evaluate%20Fresnel%20Integrals.pdf|work=FGCU MATH - SUMMER 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl] More recently, they have been used in the design of highways and railways, specifically their curvature transition zones and roller coasters.
Another application is for calculating the transitions on a velodrome track to allow rapid entry to the bends and gradual exit.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
