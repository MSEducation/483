[[Aggflow]]

CATEGORIES: Industrial software

AggFlow is a software application that calculates and analyzes aggregate plant data. AggFlow is intended to be used by aggregate engineers to calculate both the Mass Aggregate Balance and the Mass Water Balance flowing through a rock crushing plant to optimize and maximize production of desired products.

==Overview==

AggFlow is a software application that calculates and analyzes aggregate plant data. AggFlow is intended to be used by aggregate engineers to calculate both the Mass Aggregate Balance and the Mass Water Balance flowing through a rock crushing plant to optimize and maximize production of desired products.
AggFlow is developed and distributed by BedRock Software, Inc. (BedRock. Designed to reduce the calculation time aggregate engineers need to optimize quarry operations and to establish a benchmark by which future changes and results can be compared. The program seeks to improve two main aspects of aggregate operations: identify inefficiencies in the operation and track resources such as emissions that are regulated, fuel consumption and equipment operating capacity. AggFlow is also used in mining operations and other applications (i.e. water processing) where extensive mass balance calculations are required.

==Operating platform==

AggFlow runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows operating systems. However Linux/Unix and Macintosh Mac OS X based computers can operate the program using a virtual machine capable both of running Windows and passing the license information from the USB dongle to the "Guest" operating system.
