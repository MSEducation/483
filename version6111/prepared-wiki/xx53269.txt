Located on the northern edge of the town of Fleet in northeastern Hampshire, the 'pond', at [tpl]convert|21|ha|acre|abbr=off[/tpl], is Hampshire's largest freshwater lake. The Reserve’s reed beds, marshes, heathland and woodland provide sanctuary for a rich and diverse community of animal and plant life, including many that are no longer to be found in an ordered, farmed countryside. The lake is extremely shallow, with a maximum depth of 0.82 metres (2.69 ft) bathymetrically recorded in 2008.
The total area of the Reserve is [tpl]convert|141|acre|km2[/tpl] of which [tpl]convert|118|acre|km2[/tpl] is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This applies to the wetlands, the lake and the dry heathland.
