[[List of electronic music genres]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic music genres, Lists of music genres

This is a list of electronic music genres, consisting of genres of electronic music, primarily created with electronic musical instruments or electronic music technology. A distinction has been made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 6. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the Theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 8.
In its early development electronic music was associated almost exclusively with Western art music, but from the late 1960s on the availability of affordable music technology, particularly of synthesisers, meant that music produced using electronic means became increasingly common in the popular domain of rock and pop music, resulting in major electronically based sub-genres.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 1. After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio, the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler.[tpl]Citation |author=M.

As a result synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s.[tpl]Citation |author=N.

In the late 1980s, dance music records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, resulting in a proliferation of electronic genres, sub-genres and scenes.A. Verderosa, The Techno Primer: The Essential Reference for Loop-Based Music Styles (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2002), ISBN 0634017888, pp. 18-19. In the new millennium, as computer technology became even more accessible and music software advanced, interacting with music production technology made it possible to create music that has no relationship to traditional musical performance practices, leading to further developments and rapidly evolving sub-genres.S. Emmerson, Living Electronic Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0-7546-5548-2, pp. 111-13.
