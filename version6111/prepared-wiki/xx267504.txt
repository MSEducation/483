The larvae feed on Deschampsia cespitosa and Melica nutans uniflora. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow gallery that ascends from the lower third of the leaf up to the leaf tip, where it reverses direction. After changing direction, the mine widens and finally takes up the full width of the leaf. The mine it is filled with a string of frass grains.
