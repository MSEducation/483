CATEGORIES: New Japan Pro Wrestling teams and stables

CHAOS is a Japanese professional wrestling stable formed by Shinsuke Nakamura and Toru Yano in New Japan Pro Wrestling.

==History==

===Formation===

In April 2009, Toru Yano turned on Great Bash Heel leader Togi Makabe, costing Makabe the match against Shinsuke Nakamura. As Nakamura continued the attack on Makabe, Tomoaki Honma tried to help Makabe, but Yano attacked Honma, forging an alliance with Nakamura. Later that month, more members of GBH turned their backs on Makabe and Honma, joining Nakamura and Yano. Soon after, the new group is called CHAOS, with Nakamura as their leader, with the common goal of resurrecting the Strong Style, which Nakamura felt was abandoned after the departures of bearers Antonio Inoki and Shinya Hashimoto.

===Feuds===

As CHAOS originally was the only heel group in New Japan Pro Wrestling, they feuded with every group within New Japan. Some of their feuds include Hiroshi Tanahashi, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Yuji Nagata, Tiger Mask IV, and Togi Makabe. In 2013, CHAOS started feuds with two other heel groups, Suzukigun and Bullet Club, which led to the stable being portrayed in a more sympathetic way.

===Associates===

CHAOS also has some allies from different promotions, including Masato Tanaka from Pro Wrestling Zero1, who had history with Jado and Gedo from their days in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and together they wrestle under the team name The Complete Players.
