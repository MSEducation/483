[[Metallic hydrogen]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrogen, Hydrogen physics, Allotropy

Metallic hydrogen is a phase of hydrogen in which it behaves as an electrical conductor. This phase was predicted theoretically in 1935,[tpl]cite journal|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|last2=Huntington|first2=H.B.|title=On the possibility of a metallic modification of hydrogen|journal=Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=3|issue=12|page=764|year=1935|doi=10.1063/1.1749590|bibcode=1935JChPh...3..764W[/tpl] but has not been reliably produced in laboratory experiments due to the requirement of high pressures, on the order of hundreds of gigapascals. At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some of the newly discovered extrasolar planets.

====Metallization of hydrogen under pressure====

Though at the top of the alkali metal column in the periodic table, hydrogen is not, under ordinary conditions, an alkali metal. In 1935 however, physicists Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington predicted that under an immense pressure of around [tpl]val|25|ul=GPa[/tpl] ([tpl]val|fmt=commas|250000|ul=atm[/tpl] or [tpl]val|fmt=commas|3500000|ul=psi[/tpl]), hydrogen atoms would display metallic properties, losing hold over their electrons. Since then, metallic hydrogen has been described as "the holy grail of high-pressure physics".[tpl]cite press |publisher=Cornell News|date=6 May 1998|title=High-pressure scientists 'journey' to the center of the Earth, but can't find elusive metallic hydrogen|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May98/misbehaving.hydrogen.deb.html|accessdate=2010-01-02[/tpl]
The initial prediction about the amount of pressure needed was eventually proven to be too low.[ref]
