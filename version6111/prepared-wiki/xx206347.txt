Stake Out was a game show which originally aired on Challenge TV between 12 November and 21 December 2001. It was hosted by Anthony Davis.

==Gameplay==

Billed as TV's ruthless and compelling game show, up to four players entered the game by bringing £250 of 'their own money' to play the game. The players then 'pick' on each other and attempt to win their money by answering questions correctly. Players are eliminated from the game when they are bankrupted and the winner is the person who wins all of the money. The winner can then pay another £250 to play again and attempt to win even more money.
Stakeout ran for 30 episodes in its first series in 2001 and has been repeated every year for almost a decade on Challenge TV, Ftn and Virgin 1 in the UK. The presenter Anthony Davis is a successful talk radio presenter and often quips that ten years on he still hasn't got his head round the rules of Stake Out.
