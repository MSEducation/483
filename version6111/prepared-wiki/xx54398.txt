[[Andantino (game)]]

CATEGORIES: Board games introduced in 1995, Abstract strategy games

Andantino is a two-player dynamic board game of abstract strategy, invented by David Smith. The players take turns placing hexagonal tiles on an empty surface, creating the "board" as the game progresses.
Andantino can be played on Richard's PBeM Server. Statistics have shown that the game is flawed as the first player wins about 92.5% of all games.
The rules are as follows:
Like many connection games, where pieces typically do not move or become captured, Andantino lends itself well to play as a pencil and paper game.  It can be considered a considerably deeper replacement for Tic-Tac-Toe. Irensei provides a similar mix of line-building and capturing goals, and is played on a go board.
David Smith's games commonly use a dynamic board, as is the case in Spangles and Trax.

==Analysis==

The first three plays of the game are forced.  After the third move the game will always consist of a triangle of two white hexes and one black. This may be rotated, but gameplay is identical
White apparently has a considerable advantage in Andantino, so it is common to play games in pairs with color roles reversed.
