===Controversy===

The government of the Philippines filed a diplomatic protest with the government of Spain, the European Commission and the then manufacturer Nabisco Iberia in 1999. The protest objected to the use of the name "Filipinos", a term which can refer to the people of the Philippines, to market cookie and pretzel snacks and demanded that Nabisco stop selling the product until the brand name was changed.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_1999_August_30/ai_55759591| title=Philippines protests 'Filipinos' as cookie brand| accessdate=19 November 2006| date=27 August 1999| work=Kyodo News[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]
The resolution's author, the Philippine Congressman Heherson Alvarez, claimed that the name of the cookie was offensive due to the apparent reference to their color, "dark outside and white inside".[tpl]Cite news|title=Philippine ratings board targeted|last=Jazmines|first=Tessa|date=October 25–31, 1999|page=18|work=Variety|publisher=Reed Elsevier|quote=Alvarez ... also spoke out against the naming of a Nabisco chocolate cookie as "Filipinos"[/tpl]  His resolution stated "These food items could be appropriately called by any other label, but the manufacturers have chosen our racial identity, and they are now making money out of these food items."  On August 26, 1999, the Philippine president Joseph Estrada called the brand "an insult".
The protest was filed despite Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon's initial reluctance on the matter. Siazon had reportedly said he saw nothing wrong with the use of 'Filipinos' as a brand name, noting Austrians do not complain that small sausages are called 'Vienna sausages'.
