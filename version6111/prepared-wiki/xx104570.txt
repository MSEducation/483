The RT-21 Temp 2S was a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  It was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-16 Sinner and carried the industry designation 15Zh42.
The RT-21 was the first mobile ICBM developed by the Soviet Union, it's innovative concept and design created by Alexander Nadiradze. The RT-21M Pioner (SS-20 Saber)'s, as well as their succeeding missile complexes would rely on the SS-16 base concept and was used by Nadiradze for many of his later projects. The program became mired in a series of treaty complications, including questions regarding its use of theatre missile launchers. Ultimately, it is unlikely that the RT-21 reached deployment, and by the mid-1980s, the program had been scrapped. Period of storage on launcher 5 years, preparation time for launch 40 minuteshttp://inbsite.com/missiles1.html
