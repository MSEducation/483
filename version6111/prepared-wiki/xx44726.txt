Sweet Honey in the Rock is an all-woman, African-American a cappella ensemble. They are an American Grammy Award–winning (and many times nominated) troupe who express their history as African-American women through song, dance, and sign language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sweet-honey-in-the-rock-p3179/biography|title=Sweet Honey in the Rock/Biography|last=Post|first=Laura|year=2011|work=Allmusic biography|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=20 December 2011[/tpl]  Originally a four-person ensemble, the group have expanded to five-part harmonies, with a sixth member acting as a sign-language interpreter. Although the members have changed over 3 decades, they continue to sing and have helped to produce several children's records as well as those intended for adults.

==Musical career==

Sweet Honey in the Rock was founded in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, who was teaching a vocal workshop with the Washington, D.C. Black Repertory Company. Reagon retired from the group in 2004. The name of the group was derived from a song, based on Psalm 81:16, which tells of a land so rich that when rocks were cracked open, honey flowed from them. Johnson has said that this first song in which four women blended their voices was so powerful, that there was no question what the name of the group should be. The ensemble's most powerful messages are proclaimed through an enormous catalog of songs addressing the world's woes. They are currently occupied with immigration injustices, congressional greed and lack of compassion for hurting citizens, the environmental imbalance, racial issues and women's issues.
Sweet Honey in the Rock has received several Grammy Award nominations, including one for their children's album, Still the Same Me which received the Silver Award from the National Association of Parenting Publications. They won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album for their version of Lead Belly's "Grey Goose" from the compilation album Folkways: A Vision Shared.
Their vocals appeared in a number of animated counting cartoons on the long-running PBS series Sesame Street.

==Influences==

Sweet Honey in the Rock has been producing music for more than 30 years. Although the members of the group have changed over time, their music has consistently combined contemporary rhythms and narratives with a musical style rooted in the Gospel music, spirituals and hymns of the African-American Church. The ensemble tackles difficult five-part harmonies and composes much of their own music. They have addressed topics including motherhood, spirituality, freedom, civil rights, domestic violence, immigration issues, and racism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/music/2011/12/sweet-honey-rock-spreads-holiday-cheer/1965681|title=Sweet Honey in the Rock spreads holiday cheer  Read more at the Washington Examiner: http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/music/2011/12/sweet-honey-rock-spreads-holiday-cheer/1965681#ixzz1hbZP1XOX|last=Cary|first=Emily|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=The Washington Examiner|accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl]

=="Are We A Nation?"==

On June 22, 2010, Sweet Honey released “Are We A Nation?,” their response to Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB-1070. An official music video of the song was released online on July 2, 2010.   Directed by James Lester, the video was shot in New York City at Tainted Blue Recording Studio during a live recording session of the song. Amanda Navarro researched and provided the video’s archival images and Russel Soder was the cinematographer. Ramon Hervey II served as the project’s executive producer.  The band donated a portion of the proceeds from the sales of "Are We A Nation?" to The Center for Community Change, an organization founded in 1968 to honor the life of Robert F. Kennedy and to assist low-income communities.  Sweet Honey In The Rock also joined The SOUND STRIKE boycotting performances within Arizona in protest of the law.
