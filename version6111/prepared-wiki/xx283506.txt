The Later Lê Dynasty early period (Vietnamese Nhà Lê sơ) from 1428-1527 is a distinction current in writing on the history of Vietnam to distinguish the 100 year long early period of the Later Lê, when the emperor-kings both ruled and held real power, from the 256 year long Later Lê Dynasty warlord period (Vietnamese: Nhà Lê trung hưng; 1533-1789) when, following a six year civil war, the emperor-kings were restored as figureheads, but power was held by a succession of warlords.Keat Gin Ooi Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East ...  Volume 1 2004 - Page 780 "1533-1789). The Le Dynasty was one of the long-term dynasties of premodern Vietnam. It is usually divided into two terms — 1428 to 1527 and 1533 to 1789 — and is also called the Hau Le (latter Le) dynasty to distinguish it from the Ly Le dynasty of the tenth century."
