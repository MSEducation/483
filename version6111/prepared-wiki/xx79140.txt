[[Ideal norm]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory, Commutative algebra, Ideals

In commutative algebra, the norm of an ideal is a generalization of a norm of an element in the field extension. It is particularly important in number theory since it measures the size of an ideal of a complicated number ring in terms of an ideal in a less complicated ring. When the less complicated number ring is taken to be the ring of integers, Z, then the norm of a nonzero ideal I of a number ring R is simply the size of the finite quotient ring R/I.

By convention, the norm of the zero ideal is taken to be zero.
