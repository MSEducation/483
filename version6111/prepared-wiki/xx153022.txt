Romero Britto (6 October 1963)  is a Brazilian Neo-pop artist, painter, serigrapher, and sculptor. He combines elements of cubism, pop art and graffiti painting in his work. Britto has lived in Miami, Florida since 1989. Shortly after Britto arrived in the United States, Michel Roux, founder of Absolut Vodka's Absolut Art Ad Campaign, happened by Britto's first studio in Coconut Grove, Florida. Roux quickly asked Britto to reinterpret the famous bottle, which would be published and seen by millions. Consistently challenging himself, Britto has completed other corporate works for Movado, Disney, Enrico Coveri, Pepsi, the United Nations, BMW and Royal Caribbean Cruises.Minkara 2004 Britto has one main art gallery in Miami, on South Beach on Lincoln Road.
