Oslo  ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɒ|z|l|oʊ[/tpl], [tpl]respell|OZ|loh[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oslo|title=dictionary.com|accessdate=6 August 2011[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-sv|²uʃlu|no|Oslo.ogg[/tpl] or, rarer [tpl]IPA-sv|²uslu|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-sv|¹uʃlu|[/tpl]) is the capital of and most populous city in Norway. Oslo constitutes a county and a municipality.
Founded around 1000 AD, and established a "kaupstad" or trading place in 1048 by King Harald III, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Castle during the reign of King Christian IV and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, when its original Norwegian name was restored.
Oslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission intercultural cities programme.
Oslo is considered a global city and ranked "Beta World City" in studies performed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2008 |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl] It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi Magazine.[tpl]cite web|author=Rachel Craig |url=http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/Europe/European-Cities-and-Regions-of-the-Future-2012-13 |title=European Cities and Regions of the Future 2012/13 |publisher=fDiIntelligence.com |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] A survey conducted by ECA International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eca-international.com/news/press_releases/7355/Sydney_rockets_up_the_list_of_the_world_s_most_expensive_cities|title=Sydney rockets up the list of the world's most expensive cities|publisher=ECA International |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011[/tpl] In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive city in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study.[tpl]cite news|title=The world's most expensive cities|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2014/feb/14/most-expensive-cities|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 February 2014|author=George Arnett|author2=Chris Michael[/tpl]

==Urban region==

As of January 2013, the population of the municipality of Oslo in excess of 623,000. The urban area extends beyond the boundaries of the municipality into the surrounding county of Akershus, (municipalities of Bærum, Asker, Røyken, Lørenskog, Skedsmo, Gjerdrum, Sørum, Oppegård) its agglomeration total 951,581 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/02/folkendrkv_en/2012k4/kvart00-en.html |work=Statistics Norway|publisher=www.ssb.no|title=Statistics from the SSB[/tpl] The metropolitan area of Oslo, also referred to as the Greater Oslo Region ([tpl]lang-no|Stor-Osloregionen[/tpl]), has a land area of [tpl]convert|8900|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/|title=Statistisk sentralbyrå – Forside |work=Statistics Norway |publisher=www.ssb.no |language=Norwegian[/tpl] with a population of 1,422,442 as of 1 April 2010. The Inner Oslo Fjord Region, or the Capital Region made up by the five counties of Oslo, Akershus, Buskerud, Vestfold (west bank of the Oslo fjord) and Østfold (east bank) has a population of 1,980,116 people (as of January 2013). The city centre is situated at the end of the Oslofjord, from which point the city sprawls out in three distinct "corridors" from its centre; inland north-eastwards, and southwards along both sides of the fjord, which gives the urbanized area a shape reminiscent of an upside-down reclining "Y" (on maps, satellite pictures, or from high above the city).
To the north and east, wide forested hills (Marka) rise above the city giving the location the shape of a giant amphitheatre. The urban municipality (bykommune) of Oslo and county of Oslo (fylke) are two parts of the same entity, making Oslo the only city in Norway where two administrative levels are integrated. Of Oslo's total area, [tpl]convert|115|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] is built-up and [tpl]convert|7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] is agricultural. The open areas within the built-up zone amount to [tpl]convert|22|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].
The city of Oslo was established as a municipality on 3 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It was separated from the county of Akershus to become a county of its own in 1842. The rural municipality of Aker was merged with Oslo on 1 January 1948 (and simultaneously transferred from Akershus county to Oslo county). Furthermore, Oslo shares several important functions with Akershus county.

==General information==

===Toponymy===

The origin of the name Oslo has been the subject of much debate. It is certainly derived from Old Norse and was—in all probability—originally the name of a large farm at Bjørvika, but the meaning of that name is disputed. Modern linguists generally interpret the original Óslo or Áslo as either "Meadow at the Foot of a Hill" or "Meadow Consecrated to the Gods", with both considered equally likely.cf. Bjorvand, Harald (2008): "Oslo." I: Namn och bygd 2008;Volum 96.
Erroneously, it was once assumed that "Oslo" meant "the mouth of the Lo river", a supposed previous name for the river Alna. However, not only has no evidence been found of a river "Lo" predating the work where Peder Claussøn Friis first proposed this etymology, but the very name is ungrammatical in Norwegian: the correct form would have been Loaros (cf. Nidaros).[tpl]Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Peder_Clauss%C3%B8n_Friis/utdypning |title=Peder Claussøn Friis |encyclopedia=Store Norske Leksikon |language=Norwegian |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |last=Jørgensen |first=Jon G. |authorlink=Jon Gunnar Jørgensen |location=Oslo |editor=Helle, Knut |editor-link=Knut Helle[/tpl] The name Lo is now believed to be a back-formation arrived at by Friis in support of his spurious etymology for Oslo.Alna – elv i Oslo, Store Norske Leksikon (in Norwegian)

===City seal===

Oslo is one of very few cities in Norway, besides Bergen and Tønsberg, that does not have a formal coat of arms, but which uses a city seal instead.Government – Oslo kommune[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] The seal of Oslo shows the city's patron saint, St. Hallvard, with his attributes, the millstone and arrows, with a naked woman at his feet. He is seated on a throne with lion decorations, which at the time was also commonly used by the Norwegian Kings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/o/oslo.htm |title=Oslo byvåpen |last=Heraldry of the World|work=ngw.nl |year=2010 |accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl]

==History==

According to the Norse sagas, Oslo was founded around 1049 by King Harald Hardråde.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g190479-s1/Oslo:Norway:Inside.html |title=Inside Oslo : Inside |publisher=TripAdvisor |accessdate=25 March 2010[/tpl] Recent archaeological research has uncovered Christian burials which can be dated to prior to AD 1000, evidence of a preceding urban settlement. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] This called for the celebration of Oslo's millennium in 2000.
It has been regarded as the capital city since the reign of King Haakon V (1299–1319), the first king to reside permanently in the city. He also started the construction of the Akershus Castle. A century later, Norway was the weaker part in a personal union with Denmark, and Oslo's role was reduced to that of provincial administrative centre, with the monarchs residing in Copenhagen. The fact that the University of Oslo was founded as late as 1811 had an adverse effect on the development of the nation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Oslo was destroyed several times by fire, and after the fourteenth calamity, in 1624, King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway ordered it rebuilt at a new site across the bay, near Akershus Castle and given the name Christiania. Long before this, Christiania had started to establish its stature as a centre of commerce and culture in Norway. The part of the city built starting in 1624 is now often called Kvadraturen because of its orthogonal layout.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The last plague outbreak in Oslo occurred in 1654.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dnms.no/index.php?seks_id=110569&a=1 |title=DNMS.NO : Michael: 2005 : 03/2005 : Book review: Black Death and hard facts |publisher=Norwegian Medical Society |author=Øivind Larsen |accessdate=11 March 2014[/tpl] In 1814 Christiania once more became a real capital when the union with Denmark was dissolved.
Many landmarks were built in the 19th century, including the Royal Palace (1825–1848); Stortinget (the Parliament) (1861–1866), the University, Nationaltheatret and the Stock Exchange. Among the world-famous artists who lived here during this period were Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun (the latter was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature). In 1850, Christiania also overtook Bergen and became the most populous city in the country. In 1877 the city was renamed Kristiania. The original name of Oslo was restored in 1925.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/tobias/tobiasartikler/tob2001-1_01.htm |title=Oslo kommune byarkivet (Oslo City Archives) |publisher=Oslo Kommune |author=Bård Alsvik |accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]

===1000–1600===

Under the reign of King Olav Kyrre, Oslo became a cultural centre for Eastern Norway. St. Hallvard became the city's patron saint and is depicted on the city's seal.
In 1174, Hovedøya Abbey (Hovedøya kloster) was built. The churches and abbeys became major owners of large tracts of land, which proved important for the city's economic development, especially before the Black Death.
During the Middle Ages, Oslo reached its heights in the reign of King Haakon V. He started the building of Akershus Castle and was also the first king to reside permanently in the city, which helped to make Oslo the capital of Norway.
In the end of the 12th century, Hanseatic traders from Rostock moved into the city and gained major influence in the city. The Black Death came to Norway in 1349 and, like other cities in Europe, the city suffered greatly. The churches' earnings from their land also dropped so much that the Hanseatic traders dominated the city's foreign trade in the 15th century.

===1600s===

Over the years, fire destroyed major parts of the city many times, as many of the city's buildings were built entirely of wood. After the last fire in 1624, which lasted for three days, King Christian IV decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again. His men built a network of roads in Akershagen near Akershus Castle. He demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city of Christiania.
The transformation of the city went slowly for the first hundred years. Outside the city, near Vaterland and Grønland near Old Town, Oslo, a new, unmanaged part of the city grew up with citizens of low status.

===1700s===

In the 18th century, after the Great Northern War, the city's economy boomed with shipbuilding and trade. The strong economy transformed Christiania into a trading port.

===1800s===

In the 19th century, several state institutions were established and the city's role as a capital intensified. Christiania expanded its industry from 1840, most importantly around Akerselva. The expansion prompted the authorities to construct several important buildings, most of which remain as tourist attractions. There was a brief building boom from 1880, with many new houses, but the boom collapsed in 1889.

===1900–present===

The municipality developed new areas such as Ullevål Hageby (1918–1926) and Torshov (1917–1925). City Hall was constructed in the former slum area of Vika, from 1931–1950. The municipality of Aker was incorporated into Oslo in 1948, and suburbs were developed, such as Lambertseter (from 1951). Aker Brygge was constructed on the site of the former shipyard Akers Mekaniske Verksted, from 1982–1998.
In the 2011 Norway terror attacks, Oslo was hit by a bomb blast that ripped through the Government quarter, damaging several buildings including the building that houses the Office of the Prime Minister. Eight people were killed in the bomb attack.

==Geography==

Oslo occupies an arc of land at the northernmost end of the Oslofjord. The fjord, which is nearly bisected by the Nesodden peninsula opposite Oslo, lies to the south; in all other directions Oslo is surrounded by green hills and mountains. There are 40 islands within the city limits, the largest being Malmøya ([tpl]convert|0.56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]), and scores more around the Oslofjord. Oslo has 343 lakes, the largest being Maridalsvannet ([tpl]convert|3.91|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]). This is also a main source of drinking water for large parts of Oslo.
Although Eastern Norway has a number of rivers, none of these flow into the ocean at Oslo. Instead Oslo has two smaller rivers: Akerselva (draining Maridalsvannet, which flows into the fjord in Bjørvika), and Alna. The waterfalls in Akerselva gave power to the first modern industry of Norway in the 1840, and later in the century, the river became the symbol of the stable and consistent economic and social divide of the city into an East End and a West End; the labourers' neighbourhoods lie on both sides of the river, and the divide in reality follows Uelands street a bit further west. River Alna flows through Groruddalen, Oslo's major suburb and industrial area. The highest point is Kirkeberget, at [tpl]convert|629|m[/tpl]. Although the city's population is small compared to most European capitals, it occupies an unusually large land area, of which two-thirds are protected areas of forests, hills and lakes. Its boundaries encompass many parks and open areas, giving it an airy and green appearance. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Climate===

Oslo has a humid continental climate (Dfb according to the Köppen climate classification system). Because of the city's northern latitude, daylight varies greatly, from more than 18 hours in midsummer, when it never gets completely dark at night, to around 6 hours in midwinter.[tpl]cite web|title=Oslo Daylight|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=187[/tpl] Despite its high latitude and northerly location, the climate is not severely cold due to the onshore air-masses in winter and the coastal location of the city.
Oslo has mild to warm summers with average high temperatures of around [tpl]convert|19|-|24|C|F[/tpl] and lows of around [tpl]convert|12|C|F|0[/tpl]. The highest temperature ever recorded was [tpl]convert|35|C|F|0[/tpl] on 21 July 1901. Winters are cold and snowy with temperatures between [tpl]convert|-7|C|F|0[/tpl] up to [tpl]convert|-1|C|F|0[/tpl]. The coldest temperature recorded is [tpl]convert|-27.1|°C|°F|1[/tpl] in January 1942.Oslo temperatures Temperatures have tended to be higher in recent years.Geography of Norway#Climate
Annual precipitation is [tpl]convert|763|mm|in|1[/tpl] with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall can occur from October to May, but snow accumulation occurs mainly from January through March. Almost every winter, ice develops in the innermost parts of the Oslofjord, and during some winters the whole inner fjord freezes. As it is far from the mild Atlantic water of the west coast, this large fjord can freeze over completely, although this has become rare.[tpl]cite web|author=Avknut A. Nygaard|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3497775.ece |title=Aftenposten: Oslofjord frozen |publisher=Aftenposten.no |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] Oslo receives around 1,650 hours of sunshine annually and is average for the northern half of Europe.

==Parks and recreation areas==

Oslo has a large number of parks and green areas within the city core, as well as outside it.
Oslo (with neighbouring Sandvika-Asker) is built in a horseshoe shape on the shores of the Oslofjord and limited in most directions by hills and forests. As a result, any point within the city is relatively close to the forest. There are two major forests bordering the city: Østmarka (literally "Eastern Forest", on the eastern perimeter of the city), and the very large Nordmarka (literally "Northern Forest", stretching from the northern perimeter of the city deep into the hinterland).
The municipality operates eight public swimming pools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idrettsetaten.oslo.kommune.no/oslobadene/ |title=Municipal swimming pools |publisher=Idrettsetaten.oslo.kommune.no |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl]
Tøyenbadet is the largest indoor swimming facility in Oslo and one of the few pools in Norway offering a 50-metre main pool. The outdoor pool Frognerbadet also has the 50-metre range.

==Cityscape==

Oslo's cityscape is being redeveloped as a modern city with various access-points, an extensive metro-system with a new financial district and a cultural city. In 2008, an exhibition was held in London presenting the award-winning Oslo Opera House, the urban regeneration scheme of Oslo's seafront, Munch/Stenersen and the new Deichman Library.
Most of the buildings in the city and in neighbouring communities are low in height with only the Plaza, Postgirobygget and the highrises at Bjørvika considerably taller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2011/06/23/oslos-developing-waterfront-in-a-photo-collage/ |title=:::[/tpl]

===Architecture===

Oslo's architecture is very diverse. The architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), who was educated in Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway around the turn of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major achievement was the renovation of the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semicircular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.
When Christiania was made capital of Norway in 1814, there were practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of economic constraints. The first major undertaking was the Royal Palace, designed by Hans Linstow and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned Karl Johans gate, the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for University, the Parliament (Storting) and other institutions. Only the university buildings were realised according to this plan. Christian Heinrich Grosch, one of the first architects educated completely within Norway, designed the original building for the Oslo Stock Exchange (1826–1828), the local branch of the Bank of Norway (1828), Christiania Theatre (1836–1837), and the first campus for the University of Oslo (1841–1856). For the university buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. German architectural influence persisted in Norway, and many wooden buildings followed the principles of Neoclassicism.
In Oslo, the German architect Alexis de Chateauneuf designed Trefoldighetskirken, the first neo-gothic church, completed by von Hanno in 1858.
A number of landmark buildings, particularly in Oslo, were built in the Functionalist style (better known in the US and Britain as Modernist), the first being Skansen restaurant (1925–1927) by Lars Backer, demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at Ekeberg, which opened in 1929. Kunstnernes Hus art gallery by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas (1930) still shows the influence of the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s.
The redevelopment of Oslo Airport (by the Aviaplan consortium) at Gardermoen, which opened in 1998, was Norway's largest construction project to date.

==Politics and government==

Oslo is the capital of Norway, and as such is the seat of Norway's national government. Most government offices, including that of the Prime Minister, are gathered at Regjeringskvartalet, a cluster of buildings close to the national Parliament—the Storting.
Constituting both a municipality and a county of Norway, the city of Oslo is represented in the Storting by seventeen members of parliament. Six MPs are from the Labour Party; the Conservative Party and the Progress Party have three each; the Socialist Left Party and the Liberals have two each; and one is from the Christian Democrats.[tpl]Update inline|General Election 2013|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The combined municipality and county of Oslo has had a parliamentary system of government since 1986. The supreme authority of the city is the City Council (Bystyret), which currently has 59 seats. Representatives are popularly elected every four years. The City Council has five standing committees, each having its own areas of responsibility. The largest parties in the City Council after the 2011-elections are the Conservatives and the Labour Party, with 22 and 20 representatives respectively.
The Mayor of Oslo is the head of the City Council and the highest ranking representative of the city. This used to be the most powerful political position in Oslo, but following the implementation of parliamentarism, the Mayor has had more of a ceremonial role, similar to that of the President of the Storting at the national level. The current Mayor of Oslo is Fabian Stang.
Since the local elections of 2003, the city government has been a coalition of the Conservative Party and the Progress Party. Based mostly on support from the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, the coalition maintains a workable majority in the City Council. After the 2007 local elections on 10 September, the conservative coalition remained in majority. After the elections in 2011 the Conservative Party remained in power after a strong election. The Progress Party chose to leave the city government after losing support in the election and a dispute over the new Munch Museum. The Liberals and the Christian Democrats replaced the Progress Party in the city government.
The Governing Mayor of Oslo is the head of the City government. The post was created with the implementation of parliamentarism in Oslo and is similar to the role of the prime minister at the national level. The current governing mayor is Stian Berger Røsland.

==Economy==

Oslo has a varied and strong economy and was ranked number one among European large cities in economic potential in the fDi Magazine report European Cities of the Future 2012. It was ranked 2nd in the category of business friendliness, behind Amsterdam.
Oslo is an important centre of maritime knowledge in Europe and is home to approximately 1980 companies and 8,500 employees within the maritime sector, some of which are the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers, and insurance brokers.Oslo Teknopol Mal Det Norske Veritas, headquartered at Høvik outside Oslo, is one of the three major maritime classification societies in the world, with 16.5% of the world fleet to class in its register.Dnv.com  The city's port is the largest general cargo port in the country and its leading passenger gateway. Close to 6,000 ships dock at the Port of Oslo annually with a total of 6 million tonnes of cargo and over five million passengers.
The gross domestic product of Oslo totalled NOK268.047 billion ( billion) in 2003, which amounted to 17% of the national GDP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/09/01/fnr_en/ |title=Regional accounts |publisher=Ssb.no |accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl] This compares with NOK165.915 billion ( billion) in 1995. The metropolitan area, bar Moss and Drammen, contributed 25% of the national GDP in 2003 and was also responsible for more than one quarter of tax revenues. In comparison, total tax revenues from the oil and gas industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf amounted to about 16%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skatteetaten.no/upload/skd%20sm03_engelsk.pdf |title=Norwegian Tax Administration Annual Report 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl]
