Red and white blood cell production is regulated with great precision in healthy humans, and the production of leukocytes is rapidly increased during infection. The proliferation and self-renewal of these cells depend on Growth factors. One of the key player in self-renewal and development of haematopoietics cells is stem cell factor (SCF).[tpl]cite journal|last=Broudy|first=VC|title=Stem cell factor and hematopoiesis.|journal=Blood|date=Aug 15, 1997|volume=90|issue=4|pages=1345–64|pmid=9269751[/tpl]  Absence of this factor is lethal. But there are other important Glycoprotein growth factors, which regulate the proliferation and maturation, these are for example IL-2,3,6,7. There are three more examples of factors that stimulate the production of committed stem cells. So called colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and include granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and macrophage CSF (M-CSF).[tpl]cite journal|last=Ketley|first=N. J.|author2=A. C.

These stimulate granulocyte formation and are active on either progenitor cells or end product cells.

ISBN 0-7167-4366-3 On the other hand, thrombopoietin makes myeloid progenitor cells differentiate to megakaryocytes (thrombocyte-forming cells).
Examples of cytokines and the blood cells they give rise to, is shown in the picture to the right.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hauke|first=Ralph|author2=Stefano R. Tarantolo|title=Hematopoietic Growth Factors|journal=Laboratory Medicine|date=November 2000[/tpl]

===Transcription factors in hematopoiesis===

Growth factors initiate signal transduction pathways, which leads to activation of transcription factors. Signal, which is received by cells, is not digital. Its mean, that cells can distinguish time, amount, and frequency. For example long-term expression of PU.1 resulted in myeloid commitment, short-term induction of PU.1 activity led to the formation of immature eosinophils.[tpl]cite journal|last=Engel|first=I|coauthors=Murre, C|title=Transcription factors in hematopoiesis.|journal=Current opinion in genetics & development|date=Oct 1999|volume=9|issue=5|pages=575–9|pmid=10508690[/tpl]
First key player of differentiation from HSC to multipotent progenitor (MPP) is transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alfa (C/EBP alfa). Mutations in C/EBP alfa are associated with acute myeloid leukaemia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ho|first=PA|coauthors=Alonzo, TA; Gerbing, RB; Pollard, J; Stirewalt, DL; Hurwitz, C; Heerema, NA; Hirsch, B; Raimondi, SC; Lange, B; Franklin, JL; Radich, JP; Meshinchi, S|title=Prevalence and prognostic implications of CEBPA mutations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML): a report from the Children's Oncology Group.|journal=Blood|date=Jun 25, 2009|volume=113|issue=26|pages=6558–66|pmid=19304957[/tpl]  Than the way is divided to Erythroid-megakaryocyte lineage or lymphoid and myeloid lineage, which have common progenitor, called lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor. There are two main transcription factors. Pu.1 for Erythroid-megakaryocyte lineage and GATA-1 lead to lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fiedler|first=Katja|coauthors=Cornelia Brunner|title=Mechanisms Controlling Hematopoiesis|url=http://www.intechopen.com[/tpl]
Among other factors are Ikaros, Gfi1 or IRF8. What is of greater significance is the occurrence of the same factors multiple times in the haematopoiesis tree. For example, CEBP alfa in neutrophil development or Pu.1. in monocytes and dendritic cells development. It is important to note that processes are not unidirectional.
As example I would like to introduce PAX5 factor. 
It was Known, that it is important factor in B-cell development and thus associated with lymphomas.[tpl]cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=P|coauthors=Morin P, Jr; Ouellette, RJ; Robichaud, GA|title=The Pax-5 gene: a pluripotent regulator of B-cell differentiation and cancer disease.|journal=Cancer research|date=Dec 15, 2011|volume=71|issue=24|pages=7345–50|pmid=22127921[/tpl]  But It has been big surprise, when pax5 conditional knock out in mouse allowed peripheral mature B cells dedifferentiate to early bone marrow progenitors. So it completely change point of view on transcription regulation, because now we are looking on transcription factors as a care keepers of differentiation level and not as only the iniciators.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cobaleda|first=C|coauthors=Jochum, W; Busslinger, M|title=Conversion of mature B cells into T cells by dedifferentiation to uncommitted progenitors|journal=Nature|date=Sep 27, 2007|volume=449|issue=7161|pages=473–7|pmid=17851532|bibcode=2007Natur.449..473C|doi=10.1038/nature06159[/tpl]
Mutations in transtription factors are tightly connected to blood cancers, as acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (All). For example Ikaros is known to be regulator of numerous biological events. Mice with no Ikaros lack B cells, Natural killer and T cells.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wang|first=JH|coauthors=Nichogiannopoulou, A; Wu, L; Sun, L; Sharpe, AH; Bigby, M; Georgopoulos, K|title=Selective defects in the development of the fetal and adult lymphoid system in mice with an Ikaros null mutation.|journal=Immunity|date=Dec 1996|volume=5|issue=6|pages=537–49|pmid=8986714[/tpl]  Ikaros has six zinc fingers domains, four are conserved DNA-binding domain and two are for dimerization.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sun|first=L|coauthors=Liu, A; Georgopoulos, K|title=Zinc finger-mediated protein interactions modulate Ikaros activity, a molecular control of lymphocyte development.|journal=The EMBO journal|date=Oct 1, 1996|volume=15|issue=19|pages=5358–69|pmid=8895580[/tpl] Very important finding is, that different zinc fingers are involved in binding to different place in DNA and this is the reason for pleiotropic effect of Ikaros and different involvement in cancer, but mainly are mutations associated with BCR-Abl patients and it is bad prognostic marker.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schjerven|first=H|coauthors=McLaughlin, J; Arenzana, TL; Frietze, S; Cheng, D; Wadsworth, SE; Lawson, GW; Bensinger, SJ; Farnham, PJ; Witte, ON; Smale, ST|title=Selective regulation of lymphopoiesis and leukemogenesis by individual zinc fingers of Ikaros.|journal=Nature immunology|date=Oct 2013|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1073–83|pmid=24013668[/tpl]

===The myeloid-based model===

For a decade now, the evidence is growing that HSC maturation follows a myeloid-based model instead of the 'classical' schoolbook dichotomy model. In the latter model, the HSC first generates a common myeloid-erythroid progenitor (CMEP) and a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CLP produces only T or B cells. The myeloid-based model postulates that HSCs first diverge into the CMEP and a common myelo-lymphoid progenitor (CMLP), which generates T and B cell progenitors through a bipotential myeloid-T progenitor and a myeloid-B progenitor stage. The main difference is that in this new model, all erythroid, T and B lineage branches retain the potential to generate myeloid cells (even after the segregation of T and B cell lineages). The model proposes the idea of erythroid, T and B cells as specialized types of a prototypic myeloid HSC. Read more in Kawamoto et al. 2010.Kawamoto, Wada, Katsura.
