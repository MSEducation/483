[[Xanthopsia]]

CATEGORIES: Vision

Xanthopsia is a color vision deficiency in which there is a predominance of yellow in vision due to a yellowing of the optical media of the eye. The most common cause is digoxin's inhibitory action on the Sodium pump, and the development of cataracts which can cause a yellow filtering effect. 
It has been suggested that Digitalis-derived digoxin, used to treat heart failure, induced xanthopsia responsible for the yellow tinting exhibited by many of Van Gogh's  works. http://www.psych.ucalgary.ca/PACE/VA-Lab/AVDE-Website/VanGogh.html
Xanthopsia is also a rare side-effect of jaundice, in which bilirubin may be deposited into the eye in sufficient quantity to produce a yellow tint to the vision.Weatherall, D. J.; Ledingham, J. G.
