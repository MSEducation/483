The Stocksbridge Railway was a subsidiary of Samuel Fox and Company and linked the company's works at Stocksbridge, near Sheffield, South Yorkshire with the main line of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Deepcar.

==History==

The line was authorised by The Stocksbridge Railway Act of 1874 (37 & 38 Vict. c.4).[tpl]citation| url = http://www.donvalleyrailway.org/localhistory/railwayact.php | title = The Stocksbridge Railway Act 1874 (copy of)| archiveurl  =http://web.archive.org/web/20081014033204/http://www.donvalleyrailway.org/localhistory/railwayact.php| archivedate = 14 October 2008|work = www.donvalleyrailway.org[/tpl] 
The line was opened in 1876 and became a subsidiary of the steel company, under various ownerships, until 1992 when it ended its separate existence. 
Passenger services on the line commenced on 14 April 1877, making use of the bay platform of  Deepcar station, to a platform in Stocksbridge, on the edge of the works complex. The passenger service ceased in 1931.
As of 2012 the line is still open and handles regular traffic to and from the works carrying scrap in and finished steel outwards.
