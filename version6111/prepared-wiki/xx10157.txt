Omissi, Published 1 January 1990, Retrieved 1 February 2014. Page 8. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.BBC: Fact File : The RAF, retrieved 1 February 2014
The RAF's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence (MoD), which are to "provide the capabilities needed: to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories, including against terrorism; to support the Government’s foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security." The RAF describe its mission statement as "... provide An agile, adaptable and capable Air Force that, person for person, is second to none, and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission."[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/role/ |title=Role of the RAF |publisher=Royal Air Force |year=2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] The mission statement is supported by the RAF's definition of air power, which guides its strategy. Air power is defined as: "The ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events."[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/role/airpower.cfm |title=Role of Air Power |publisher=Royal Air Force |year=2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
Today the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft,[tpl]cite hansard |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120131/text/120131w0002.htm#120131143001971 | house=House of Commons | date=31 January 2012 |speaker= Nick Harvey|position=Minister of State for the Armed Forces[/tpl] described by the RAF as being "leading-edge" in terms of technology.Royal Air Force: Our high-tech gear, retrieved 1 February 2014 This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft, including: fighter and strike aircraft, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft, aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft. The majority of the RAF's rotary aircraft form part of the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command in support of ground forces. Most of the RAF's aircraft and personnel are based in the UK, with many others serving on operations (principally Afghanistan) or at long-established overseas bases (Ascension Island, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands). Although the RAF is the principal British air power arm, the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and the British Army's Army Air Corps also deliver air power which is integrated into the maritime, littoral and land environments.

==History==

===Origins===

While the British were not the first to make use of heavier-than-air military aircraft, the RAF is the world's oldest independent air force: that is, the first air force to become independent of army or navy control. It was founded on 1 April 1918, with headquarters located in the former Hotel Cecil, during the First World War, by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). At that time it was the largest air force in the world. After the war, the service was drastically cut and its inter-war years were relatively quiet, with the RAF taking responsibility for the control of Iraq and executing a number of minor actions in other parts of the British Empire. The RAF's naval aviation branch, the Fleet Air Arm, was founded in 1924 but handed over to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939.
The RAF developed its doctrine of strategic bombing which led to the construction of long-range bombers and became the basic philosophy in the Second World War.Tami Davis Biddle, "British and American Approaches to Strategic Bombing: Their Origins and Implementation in the World War II Combined Bomber Offensive," Journal of Strategic Studies, March 1995, Vol. 18 Issue 1, pp 91–144; Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914–1945 (2002)

===Second World War===

The RAF underwent rapid expansion prior to and during the Second World War. Under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan of December 1939, the air forces of British Commonwealth countries trained and formed "Article XV squadrons" for service with RAF formations. Many individual personnel from these countries, and exiles from occupied Europe, also served with RAF squadrons. By the end of the war the Royal Canadian Air Force had contributed more than 30 squadrons to serve in RAF formations, similarly, approximately a quarter of Bomber Command's personnel were Canadian.RCAF Archives[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Additionally, the Royal Australian Air Force represented around nine percent of all RAF personnel who served in the European and Mediterranean theaters.Royal Australian Air Force
In the Battle of Britain in 1940, the RAF (supplemented by 2 Fleet Air Arm Squadrons, Polish, Czech and other multinational pilots and ground personnel) defended the skies over Britain against the numerically superior German Luftwaffe. In what is perhaps the most prolonged and complicated air campaign in history, the Battle of Britain contributed significantly to the delay and subsequent indefinite postponement of Hitler's plans for an invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Sealion). In the House of Commons on 20 August, prompted by the ongoing efforts of the RAF, Prime Minister Winston Churchill eloquently made a speech to the nation, where he said "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/quotations/famous-quotations-and-stories |title=The Few |publisher=The Churchill Centre |accessdate=29 April 2011|quote="The gratitude of every home in our island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."[/tpl]
The largest RAF effort during the war was the strategic bombing campaign against Germany by Bomber Command. While RAF bombing of Germany began almost immediately upon the outbreak of war, under the leadership of Air Chief Marshal Harris, these attacks became increasingly devastating from 1942 onward as new technology and greater numbers of superior aircraft became available. The RAF adopted night-time area bombing on German cities such as Hamburg and Dresden, and developed precision bombing techniques for specific operations, such as the "Dambusters" raid by No. 617 Squadron,Paul Brickhill, The Dambusters or the Amiens prison raid known as Operation Jericho.

===Cold War era===

Following victory in the Second World War, the RAF underwent significant re-organisation, as technological advances in air warfare saw the arrival of jet fighters and bombers. During the early stages of the Cold War, one of the first major operations undertook by the Royal Air Force was in 1948 and the Berlin Airlift, codenamed Operation Plainfire. Between 26 June and the lifting of the Russian blockade of the city on 2 May, the RAF provided 17% of the total supplies delivered during the event, using Avro Yorks, Douglas Dakotas flying to Gatow Airport and Short Sunderlands flying to Lake Havel.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline194549.cfm |title=RAF Timeline 1945–1949 |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=15 August 2012 [/tpl]
Before Britain developed its own nuclear weapons the RAF was provided with American nuclear weapons under Project E. However following the development of its own arsenal, the British Government elected on 16 February 1960 to share the country's nuclear deterrent between the RAF and submarines of the Royal Navy, first deciding on 13 April to concentrate solely on the air force's V bomber fleet. These were initially armed with nuclear gravity bombs, later being equipped with the Blue Steel missile. Following the development of the Royal Navy's Polaris submarines, the strategic nuclear deterrent passed to the navy's submarines on 30 June 1969.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline196069.cfm |title=RAF Timeline 1960–1969 |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] With the introduction of Polaris, the RAF's strategic nuclear role was reduced to a tactical one, using the WE.177 gravity bombs. This tactical role was continued by the V bombers into the 1980s and until 1998 by Tornado GR1s.
For much of the Cold War the primary role of the RAF was the defence of Western Europe against potential attack by the Soviet Union, with many squadrons based in West Germany. With the decline of the British Empire, global operations were scaled back, and RAF Far East Air Force was disbanded on 31 October 1971. Despite this, the RAF fought in many battles in the Cold War period. In June 1948 the RAF commenced Operation Firedog against Malayan terrorists during the Malayan Emergency. Operations continued for the next 12 years until 1960 with aircraft flying out of RAF Tengah and RAF Butterworth. The RAF played a minor role in the Korean War, with flying boats taking part. From 1953 to 1956 the RAF Avro Lincoln squadrons carried out anti-Mau Mau operations in Kenya using its base at RAF Eastleigh. The Suez Crisis in 1956 saw a large RAF role, with aircraft operating from RAF Akrotiri and RAF Nicosia on Cyprus and RAF Luqa and RAF Hal Far on Malta as part of Operation Musketeer. The Konfrontasi against Indonesia in the early 1960s did see use of RAF aircraft, but due to a combination of deft diplomacy and selective ignoring of certain events by both sides, it never developed into a full scale war.
One of the largest actions undertook by the RAF during the cold war was the air campaign during the 1982 Falklands War, in which the RAF operated alongside the Fleet Air Arm. During the war, RAF aircraft were deployed in the mid-Atlantic at RAF Ascension Island and a detachment from No. 1 Squadron was deployed with the Royal Navy, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes.Ashworth 1989, p.26.Evans 1998, pp. 74–75. RAF pilots also flew missions using the Royal Navy's Sea Harriers in the air-to-air combat role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/F64argaircraftlost.htm |title=Argentine Aircraft Lost - Falklands War 1982 |publisher=Naval-history.net |date=1982-06-15 |accessdate=2010-03-23[/tpl] Following a British victory, the RAF remained in the South Atlantic to provide air defence to the Falkland Islands, based at RAF Mount Pleasant (built 1984).

===Recent history===

With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the RAF's focus has returned to delivering expeditionary air power.Royal Air Force: Expeditionary Air Force, raf.mod.uk Since 1990 the RAF has been involved in several large-scale operations, including: the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War,  the 2001–present War in Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion and war in Iraq and most recently the 2011 intervention in Libya.
The RAF's 90th anniversary was commemorated on 1 April 2008 by a flypast of 9 Red Arrows and four Typhoons along the Thames, in a straight line from just south of London City Airport Tower Bridge, the London Eye, the RAF Memorial and (at 13.00) the Ministry of Defence building.News ArchivesBBC News Media PlayerBBC News
Four major defence reviews have been conducted since the end of the Cold War: the 1990 Options for Change, the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the 2003 Delivering Security in a Changing World and the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. All four defence reviews have resulted in steady reductions in manpower and numbers of aircraft, especially combat aircraft such as fast-jets. As part of the latest 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft was cancelled due to over spending and missing deadlines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4934263&c=EUR&s=TOP |title=Lots of Losers in U.K. Defense Review |publisher=DefenseNews |accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl] Other reductions saw total RAF manpower reduced by 5,000 personnel to a trained strength of 33,000 and the early retirement of the Joint Force Harrier aircraft, the Harrier GR7/GR9.
In recent years fighter aircraft on Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) have been increasingly required to scramble in response to efforts made by the Russian Air Force to approach British airspace.RAF Typhoons intercept Russian bombers (flightglobal.com), 27 October 2011 On 24 January 2014 in the Houses of Parliament, Conservative MP and Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Andrew Robathan, announced that the RAF's QRA force had been scrambled almost thirty times in the last three years: eleven times during 2010, ten times during 2011 and eight times during 2012.Hansard (publications.parliament.uk), 24 January 2014
RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and RAF Leuchars in Fife both provide Quick Reaction Alert, or QRA, and scramble their fighter jets within minutes to meet or intercept aircraft which give cause for concern. Leuchars generally covers the northern sector, while Coningsby provides QRA in the south. Typhoon pilot Flight Lieutenant Noel Rees describes how QRA duty works. "At the start of the scaled QRA response, civilian air traffic controllers might see on their screens an aircraft behaving erratically, not responding to their radio calls, or note that it’s transmitting a distress signal through its transponder.
Rather than scramble Typhoons at the first hint of something abnormal, a controller has the option to put them on a higher level of alert, ‘a call to cockpit’. In this scenario the pilot races to the hardened aircraft shelter and does everything short of starting his engines." UK Ministry of Defence press release 20th September 2012 

==Structure==

The professional head of the RAF is the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford. The CAS heads the Air Force Board, which is a committee of the Defence Council. The Air Force Board is the management board of the RAF and consists of several high-ranking officers.

===Command===

Authority is delegated from the Air Force Board to the RAF's command. While there were once individual commands responsible for bombers, fighters, training, etc., now only the Air Command exists, headquartered at RAF High Wycombe.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/rafcommand.cfm |title=RAF Command |accessdate=15 August 2012 |publisher=Royal Air Force[/tpl]

===Groups===

Groups are the subdivisions of operational commands; these are responsible for certain types of operation or for operations in limited geographical areas. As from 1 April 2007, three groups exist:
In addition, No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group, under the command of the Permanent Joint Headquarters, based at RAF Al Udeid, is active in the Middle East, currently supporting operations over Afghanistan (Operation Herrick). The expeditionary air group also supported operation over Iraq (Operation Telic).

===Stations===

An RAF station is ordinarily subordinate to a group and it is administratively sub-divided into wings. Since the mid to late 1930s RAF stations have controlled a number of flying squadrons or other units at one location by means of a station headquarters.

===Wings===

A wing is either an operational sub-division of a group or an administrative sub-division of an RAF station.
Independent Wings are a grouping of two or more squadrons, either flying squadrons or ground support squadrons. In former times, numbered flying wings have existed, but recently they have been created only when required. For example during Operation Telic, Tornado GR4 wings were formed to operate from Ali Al Salem and Al Udeid air bases and the Tornado F3 equipped Leuchars Fighter Wing at Prince Sultan Air Base; each of these were made up of aircraft and crews from several squadrons.
On 31 March 2006, the RAF formed nine Expeditionary Air Wings (EAWs) to support operations. They were established at the nine main operating bases; RAF Coningsby, RAF Cottesmore, RAF Kinloss, RAF Leeming, RAF Leuchars, RAF Lossiemouth, RAF Lyneham, RAF Marham and RAF Waddington numbered Nos 121, 122, 325, 135, 125, 140, 38, 138 and 34 EAWs respectively. These units are commanded by a Group Captain who is also the parent unit's Station Commander. The EAW comprises the non-formed unit elements of the station that are required to support a deployed operating base, i.e. the command and control, logistics and administration functions amongst others. They are designed to be flexible and quickly adaptable for differing operations. They are independent of flying squadrons, Air Combat Support Units (ACSU) and Air Combat Service Support Units (ACSSU) who are attached to the EAW depending on the task it has been assigned.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/rafcommand.cfm |title=RAF Command |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
A wing is also an administrative sub-division of an RAF station. Historically, for a flying station these were normally Operations Wing, Engineering Wing and Administration Wing and each wing was commanded by an officer of wing commander rank. Early in the 21st century, the model changed, with Engineering Wing typically being split into Forward Support Wing and Depth Support Wing, while Administration Wing was redesignated Base Support Wing.

===Squadrons===

A flying squadron is an aircraft unit which carries out the primary tasks of the RAF. RAF squadrons are somewhat analogous to the regiments of the British Army in that they have histories and traditions going back to their formation, regardless of where they are based, which aircraft they are operating, etc. They can be awarded standards and battle honours for meritorious service. Whilst every squadron is different, most flying squadrons are commanded by a wing commander and, for a fast-jet squadron, have an establishment of around 100 personnel and 12 aircraft.
The term squadron can be used to refer to a sub-unit of an administrative wing or small RAF station, e.g. Air Traffic Control Squadron, Personnel Management Squadron etc. There are also Ground Support Squadrons, e.g. No 2 (Mechanical Transport) Squadron which is located at RAF Wittering. Administrative squadrons are normally commanded by a squadron leader.

===Flights===

A flight is a sub-division of a squadron. Flying squadrons are often divided into two flights, e.g. "A" and "B", each under the command of a squadron leader. Administrative squadrons on a station are also divided into flights and these flights are commanded by a junior officer, often a flight lieutenant. Because of their small size, there are several flying units formed as flights rather than squadrons. For example No. 1435 Flight is based at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands, maintaining air defence cover with four Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft.

==Personnel==

At its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 1,100,000 personnel were serving in the RAF. The longest-lived founding member of the RAF was Henry Allingham, who died on 18 July 2009 aged 113.[tpl]cite news |title=Fly-past for Britain's oldest man |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/5044206.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 June 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2011[/tpl]
As of 1 December 2013, the Royal Air Force numbered some 35,660 Regulardasa.mod Regular personnel, table 2 page 8. 1 December 2013. and 1,540 Royal Auxiliary Air Forcedasa.mod - reserves and cadet strengths, table 4 page 14. See note 4. April 2013. personnel, giving a combined component strength of 37,200 personnel. In addition to the active elements of the Royal Air Force, (Regular and Royal Auxiliary Air Force), all ex-Regular personnel remain liable to be recalled for duty in a time of need, this is known as the Regular Reserve. In 2007 there were 33,980 Regular Reserves of the Royal Air Force, of which 7,950 served under a fixed-term reserve contract.dasa.mod - reserves and cadet strengths, table 4 page 6. April 2012. Publications since April 2013 no-longer report the entire strength of the Regular Reserve, instead they only give a figure for Regular Reserves who serve under a fixed-term reserve contract. They had a strength of 7,160 personnel in 2013.
The RAF Volunteer Reserve (Training) is another reserve element of the RAF, however unlike the ones described above, they have no call-up liability. Instead, they are responsible for the management and operation of the Air Training Corps, Combined Cadet Force RAF Sections (CCF(RAF)), Volunteer Gliding Squadrons, Air Experience Flights, University Air Squadron and the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme.
Figures from 2010 showed that Royal Air Force pilots achieve a relatively high number of flying hours per year when compared with other major NATO allies such as France and Germany. RAF fast jet pilots achieve 210 flying hours per year, while RAF transport and aerial refuelling pilots achieve 290 flying hours per year. In addition, RAF pilots on transport and support helicopters achieve 240 flying hours per year.IISS 2010, pp. 169 French and German Air Force pilots achieved only 180 and 150 flying hours across their fleets respectively.IISS 2010, pp. 127–134

===Officers===

Officers hold a commission from the Sovereign, which provides the legal authority for them to issue orders to subordinates. The commission of a regular officer is granted after successfully completing the 32-week-long Initial Officer Training course at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire. Other officers also train at RAF Cranwell, but on different courses, such as those for professionally qualified officers.
The titles and insignia of RAF officers were chiefly derived from those used by the Royal Navy, specifically the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) during World War I. For example, the rank of Squadron Leader derived its name from the RNAS rank of Squadron Commander. RAF officers fall into three categories: air officers, senior officers and junior officers.

===Other ranks===

Other ranks attend the Recruit Training Squadron at RAF Halton for basic training, with the exception of the RAF Regiment, which trains its recruits at RAF Honington.
The titles and insignia of other ranks in the RAF were based on that of the Army, with some alterations in terminology. Over the years, this structure has seen significant changes: for example, there was once a separate system for those in technical trades, and the ranks of Chief Technician and Junior Technician continue to be held only by personnel in technical trades. RAF other ranks fall into four categories: Warrant Officers, Senior Non-Commissioned Officers, Junior Non-Commissioned Officers and Airmen.
All Warrant Officers in the RAF are equal in terms of rank, but the most senior Non-Commissioned appointment is known as the  Chief of the Air Staff's Warrant Officer.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/caswo.cfm |title=Chief of the Air Staff's Warrant Officer |publisher=Royal Air Force |year=2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]

===Branches and trades===

The majority of the members of the RAF serve in support roles on the ground.

===Specialist training and education===

The Royal Air Force operates several units and centres for the provision of non-generic training and education. These include the Royal Air Force Leadership Centre and the Royal Air Force Centre for Air Power Studies, both based at RAF Cranwell, and the Air Warfare Centre, based at RAF Waddington and RAF Cranwell. NCO training and developmental courses occur at RAF Halton and officer courses occur at the Joint Services Command and Staff College at Shrivenham.

==Aircraft==

British military aircraft designations generally comprise a type name followed by a mark number which includes an alphabetical rôle prefix. For example, the now retired Tornado F3 was designated as a fighter by the 'F', and the third variant of the type to be produced.

===Air defence and strike aircraft===

The Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 is the RAF's only air defence fighter aircraft, with a total of six squadrons based across RAF Leuchars and RAF Coningsby,[tpl]cite web|title=Typhoon FGR4|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhooneurofighter.cfm|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] following the retirement of the Panavia Tornado F3 in late March 2011.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/03/22/354597/video.html | title=UK retires last Tornado F3 fighters | journal=Craig Hoyle | publisher=Flightglobal | date=22 March 2011 | accessdate=22 March 2011| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] Their task is to defend UK airspace. In October 2007 it was announced that MoD Boscombe Down, RNAS Culdrose and RAF Marham would also be used as Quick Reaction Alert bases from early 2008, offering around-the-clock fighter coverage for the South and South West of UK airspace when a direct threat has been identified.Air base in front line [tpl]Sic|hide=y|fully|-[/tpl]armed – Salisbury Journal, 29 October 2007 The RAF has four front-line and two reserve Typhoon units; 3 Squadron, 11 Squadron, 17 Squadron (Operational Evaluation Unit) and 29 Squadron (Operational Conversion Unit) based at RAF Coningsby, with 6 Squadron and 1 Squadron based at RAF Leuchars.
The mainstay of the strike fleet are the six squadrons of Tornado GR4s.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Tornado GR4/GR4A|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornado.cfm|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=15 August 2012|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] These supersonic aircraft can carry a wide range of weaponry, including Storm Shadow cruise missiles, laser-guided bombs and the ALARM anti-radar missile. Since June 2008, the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 has also been capable of being deployed operationally in the air-to-ground role.AirForcesMonthly.August 2008.p9 The RAF has five operational Tornado units, with 9 Squadron, 31 Squadron and 2 Squadron based at RAF Marham. RAF Lossiemouth is home to No. 12 Squadron RAF with 617 Squadron 'Dambusters' and the reserve 15 Squadron.
The Tornado was previously supplemented by the Harrier GR7/GR9 in the strike and close air support roles, and to counter enemy air defences. The Harrier fleet was withdrawn in December 2010 following the Strategic Defence and Security Review; the Tornado GR4 is due to retire in 2019 and be replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/uk-tornado-fleet-to-retire-in-2019-says-bae-375014/ |title=UK Tornado fleet to retire in 2019, says BAE |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-21925225 |title=BBC News - RAF Marham base for Joint Strike Fighter |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl]

===Airborne early warning and reconnaissance aircraft===

The Sentry AEW1, based at RAF Waddington, provides airborne early warning to detect incoming enemy aircraft and to co-ordinate the aerial battlefield. The Sentinel R1 (also known as ASTOR – Airborne STand-Off Radar) provides a ground radar-surveillance platform based on the Bombardier Global Express long range business jet. These were supplemented in 2009 by four Beechcraft Shadow R1 aircraft equipped for the ISTAR role over Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defence-solutions.co.uk/Public/News/news_view.aspx?articleid=52 |title=UK converts King Air 350s into ISTAR platforms |date=13 January 2009 |work=defence-solutions.co.uk |accessdate=16 February 2009[/tpl] The Tornado GR4A is fitted with cameras and sensors in the visual, infra-red and radar ranges of the spectrum.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornadogr4a.cfm |title=Tornado GR4A |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]

===Support helicopters===

An important part of the work of the RAF is to support the British Army by ferrying troops and equipment at the battlefield. However, RAF helicopters are also used in a variety of other roles, including support of RAF ground units and heavy-lift support for the Royal Marines. The support helicopters are organised into the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command (JHC), along with helicopters of the British Army and Royal Navy. The only helicopters not coordinated by the JHC are the search and rescue helicopters of the RAF and RN, and those RN helicopters that are normally based on board a ship such as a destroyer or frigate.
The large twin-rotor Chinook HC2/HC2A, based at RAF Odiham provides heavy-lift support and is supported by the Merlin HC3 and the smaller Puma HC1 medium-lift helicopters, based at RAF Benson and RAF Aldergrove.

===Transport and air-to-air refuelling aircraft===

The RAF operate the C-17 Globemaster III in the heavy strategic airlift role, originally leasing four from Boeing. These were purchased, followed by a fifth delivered on 7 April 2008 and a sixth delivered on 8 June 2008. The new aircraft entered frontline use within days rather than weeks. The MoD said there was "a stated departmental requirement for eight" C-17s and a seventh was subsequently ordered, to be delivered in December 2010.[tpl]cite web |last=Pike |first=John |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/12/mil-091217-boeing01.htm |title=Royal Air Force to Acquire 7th Boeing C-17 Globemaster III |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl] In February 2012 the purchase of an eighth C-17 was confirmed;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/uk-to-buy-eighth-c-17-transport-367960/ |title=UK to buy eighth C-17 transport |work=Flight International  |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2012[/tpl] the aircraft arrived at RAF Brize Norton in May 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-raf-c-17-aircraft-touches-down-in-the-uk |title=New RAF C-17 aircraft touches down in the UK |date=24 May 2012 |publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl]
More routine strategic airlift transport tasks are carried out by the  Airbus A330 MRTT, known as the Voyager in RAF service.

Shorter range, tactical-airlift transport is provided by the Hercules, the fleet including both older C-130K (Hercules C1/C3) and newer C-130J (Hercules C4/C5) variants, based at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. All C-130s will be withdrawn by 2022.
No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron replaced the Queen's Flight in 1995 and operate the BAe 125 CC3, Agusta A109 and BAe 146 CC2 in the general air transport and VIP transport roles. The squadron is based at RAF Northolt in west London. Aircraft operate with a priority for military needs over VIP transport. Two additional BAe 146s were purchased in March 2012 from TNT Airways and were refitted by Hawker Beechcraft on behalf of BAE Systems for tactical freight and personnel transport use.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_051960/bae-systems-wins-155-million-mod-contract-for-bae-146-conversions-for-the-royal-air-force |title=BAE Systems wins £15.5 million MOD contract for the Royal Air Force |date=21 June 2012 |publisher=BAE Systems |accessdate=25 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_157813/bae-146-cmk-3-aircraft-delivered-to-the-uk-royal-air-force?_afrLoop=179059053612000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null&baeSessionId=11pTR4PFm4mL0ThX7zy0jGfBqYRCpbhqgL3hpcDV4Nblnw8gphr2!-1041743781#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26baeSessionId%3D11pTR4PFm4mL0ThX7zy0jGfBqYRCpbhqgL3hpcDV4Nblnw8gphr2%2521-1041743781%26_afrLoop%3D179059053612000%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D2udv6o2zw_4 |title=BAe 146 C.Mk 3 aircraft delivered to the UK Royal Air Force |date=19 April 2013 |publisher=BAE Systems |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl] The aircraft, designated as the BAe 146 C Mk 3, arrived in Afghanistan in April 2013.[tpl]cite web |title=BAe146 C Mk 3 |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/bae146-c-mk-3-29042013 |publisher=Royal Air Force |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl]

===Search and rescue aircraft===

Three squadrons of helicopters exist with the primary role of military search and rescue; the rescuing of aircrew who have ejected or crash-landed their aircraft. These are 22 Squadron and 202 Squadron with the Sea King HAR.3/HAR3A in the UK and 84 Squadron with the Griffin HAR2 in Cyprus. Although established with a primary role of military search and rescue, most of their operational missions are spent in their secondary role of conducting civil search and rescue; that is, the rescue of civilians from the sea, on mountainsides and other locations. Both rescue roles are shared with the Sea King helicopters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, while the civil search and rescue role is also shared with the helicopters of HM Coastguard. The Operational Conversion Unit is 203 Squadron RAF based at RAF Valley equipped with the Sea King HAR3.
The related Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service comprises four teams of trained mountaineers stationed in the mainland United Kingdom, first established in 1943.

===Training aircraft===

Elementary flying training is conducted on the Tutor T1. The Tutor is also used, along with the Viking T1 and Vigilant T1 gliders, to provide air experience training for air cadets and elementary flying training for trainee RAF pilots. Basic pilot training for fixed-wing and helicopter pilots is provided on the Tucano T1 and Squirrel HT1. Weapon systems officer and weapon systems operator training was conducted in the Dominie T1 until the decommissioning of the last six Dominie T1 in January 2011. Advanced flying training for fast-jet, helicopter and multi-engine pilots is provided using the Hawk T1, Griffin HT1 and B200 King Air respectively. At the more advanced stage in training, variants of front-line aircraft have been adapted for operational conversion of trained pilots, such as the Typhoon T1.

The F-35B Lightning II is intended to enter service around 2020 under the Joint Combat Aircraft programme. Although the Short Take Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) F-35B version had been selected initially, in October 2010, David Cameron announced that the UK would change their order to the F-35C CATOBAR carrier variant for both the RAF and Navy, citing greater range and the ability to carry a larger and more diverse payload than the F-35B.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/8121214/Babcock-says-Aircraft-carrier-changes-will-add-up-to-800m-to-taxpayer-bill.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Amy | last=Wilson | title=Babcock says Aircraft carrier changes will add up to £800m to taxpayer bill | date=10 November 2010[/tpl] However, in May 2012, it was announced that the UK government had reverted to the previous government's plan to operate the F-35B STOVL variant, due to rising estimated shipbuilding costs associated with the F-35C, and an earlier estimated in-service date for the F-35B."U.K. Makes F-35 U-Turn to Cut Costs, Narrow Carrier-Defense Gap." Bloomberg News, 10 May 2012. On 19 July 2012 the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, in a speech in the USA, indicated that the UK would initially receive 48 F-35B and would announce at a later date what the final numbers would be. Jon Thompson, MOD Permanent Secretary, told the House of Commons Defence Select Committee, in late 2012: "Our commitment over the first 10 years is for 48 F-35B. "An order for the first 14 aircraft on top of the four already procured for operational test and evaluation is expected later in 2013. The F-35 is expected to replace the Eurofighter and become Britain's only manned jet fighter from 2030.[tpl]cite web|last=Glancey |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9780450/Inside-the-F-35-the-futuristic-fighter-jet.html |title=Inside the F-35, the world's most futuristic fighter jet. |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl]

==Symbols, flags, emblems and uniform==

Following the tradition of the other British fighting services, the RAF has adopted symbols to represent it, act as a rallying point for its members and encourage esprit de corps.
The RAF Ensign is flown from the flagstaff on every RAF station during daylight hours. The design was approved by King George V in 1921, after much opposition from the Admiralty, who have the right to approve or veto any flag flown ashore or on board ship.
British aircraft in the early stages of the First World War carried the Union Flag as an identifying feature, however this was easy to confuse with Germany's Iron Cross motif. Therefore in October 1914 the French system of three concentric rings was adopted, with the colours reversed to a red disc surrounded by a white ring and an outer blue ring. The relative sizes of the rings have changed over the years and during World War II an outer yellow ring was added. Aircraft serving in the Far East during World War II had the red disc removed to prevent confusion with Japanese aircraft. Since the 1970s, camouflaged aircraft carry low-visibility roundels, either red and blue on dark camouflage, or washed-out pink and light blue on light colours. Most uncamouflaged training and transport aircraft retain the traditional red-white-blue roundel.
The Latin motto of the RAF, "Per Ardua ad Astra", is usually translated as "Through Adversity to the Stars",Air Ministry Orders A.666/49, 15 September 1949 but the RAF's official translation is "Through Struggle to the Stars".[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/links/faqs.cfm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Royal Air Force |year=2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] The choice of motto is attributed to a junior officer named J S Yule, in response to a request from a commander of the RFC, Colonel Sykes, for suggestions. The RAF inherited the motto from the RFC.
The Badge of the Royal Air Force was first used in August 1918. In heraldic terms it is: "In front of a circle inscribed with the motto Per Ardua Ad Astra and ensigned by the Imperial Crown an eagle volant and affronte Head lowered and to the sinister." Although there have been debates among airmen over the years whether the bird was originally meant to be an albatross or an eagle, the consensus is that it was always an eagle.[tpl]cite web|author=by W/C F.H.

In 2006 the RAF adopted a logotype featuring a roundel and the Service's unabbreviated name (shown at the top of this article). The logotype is used on all correspondence and publicity material and aims to provide the Service with a single, universally recognisable brand identity.

==Ceremonial functions and display==

===Red Arrows===

The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Scampton, with under-review plans to move to RAF Waddington. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-RAF team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands.
The Red Arrows badge shows the aircraft in their trademark Diamond Nine formation, with the motto Éclat, a French word meaning "brilliance" or "excellence".
Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at 65 shows across Europe. In 1966, the team was increased to nine members, enabling them to develop their Diamond Nine formation. In late 1979, they switched to the BAE Hawk trainer. The Red Arrows have performed over 4,000 displays worldwide in 53 countries.Official Red Arrows website. "Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, The Red Arrows". Retrieved 15 August 2012.

===Royal Air Force music===

Headquarters Royal Air Force Music Services, located at RAF Northolt, supports 177 professional musicians who attend events around the globe in support of the RAF. RAF Music Services were established in 1921, although the first RAF Director of Music was appointed in 1918. The Music Services were expanded for World War II and in the post war years there were ten established bands. Since then, Music Services has gradually been reduced in size and today comprises:
