Accordingly, in late 1964 or early 1965, the fractionation and isolation laboratory run by Monroe E. Wall in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, began work on fresh Taxus samples,  isolating the active ingredient in September 1966 and announcing their findings at an April 1967 American Chemical Society meeting in Miami Beach.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=7850785 |year=1995 |last1=Wall |first1=ME |last2=Wani |first2=MC |title=Camptothecin and taxol: Discovery to clinic--thirteenth Bruce F. Cain Memorial Award Lecture |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=753–60 |journal=Cancer Research[/tpl] They named the pure compound taxol in June 1967.
Wall and his colleague Wani published their results, including the chemical structure, in 1971.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wani M, Taylor H, Wall M, Coggon P, McPhail A | title = Plant antitumor agents.

The NCI continued to commission work to collect more Taxus bark and to isolate increasing quantities of taxol. By 1969, 28 kg of crude extract had been isolated from almost 1,200 kg of bark, although this ultimately yielded only 10g of pure material,[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=81[/tpl] but for several years, no use was made of the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another in vitro system; two years later, a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended taxol be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process.[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=79,81[/tpl] This required increasing quantities of purified taxol, up to 600 g, and in 1977 a further request for 7,000 lbs of bark was made.
In 1978, two NCI researchers published a report showing taxol was mildly effective in leukaemic mice.[ref]

In November 1978, taxol was shown to be effective in xenograft studies.[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=95[/tpl]
Meanwhile, taxol began to be well known in the cell biology, as well as the cancer community, with a publication in early 1979 by Susan B. Horwitz, a molecular pharmacologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,  showing taxol had a previously unknown mechanism of action involving the stabilization of microtubules. Together with formulation problems, this increased interest from researchers meant that, by 1980, the NCI envisaged needing to collect 20,000 lbs of bark.[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=97[/tpl]
Animal toxicology studies were complete by June 1982, and in November NCI applied for the IND necessary to begin clinical trials in humans.

===Early clinical trials, supply and the transfer to BMS===

Phase I clinical trials began in April 1984, and the decision to start Phase II trials was made a year later.[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=115[/tpl] These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin by the end of 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.
The first public report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed an effect in melanoma patients and a remarkable response rate of 30% in patients with refractory ovarian cancer.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal | author = Rowinsky, EK and others | title = Phase II study of taxol in advanced epithelial malignancies | journal =  Proceedings of the Association of Clinical Oncology | volume = 7  | pages = 136 | year = 1988  [/tpl][/ref]
At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration was given to the problem of supply.
Because of the practical and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate taxol, and fund a large proportion of clinical trials. In the words of Goodman and Welsh, authors of a substantial scholarly book on taxol,  
 NCI was thinking, not of collaboration, ... but of a hand-over of taxol (and its problems)
[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=120[/tpl]

Although the offer was widely advertised, only four companies responded to the CRADA, including the American firm Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS),
which was selected as the partner in December 1989. The choice of BMS later became controversial and was the subject of Congressional hearings in 1991 and 1992. While it seems clear the NCI had little choice but to seek a commercial partner, there was also controversy about the terms of the deal, eventually leading to a report by the General Accounting Office in 2003, which concluded the NIH had failed to ensure value for money.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/leg_issues/reports/taxol.pdf|format=PDF|title=Technology Transfer: NIH-Private Sector Partnership in the Development of Taxol[/tpl] In related CRADAs with the USDA and Department of the Interior,  Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive first refusal on all Federal supplies of Taxus brevifolia.
This exclusive contract lead to some criticism for giving BMS a "cancer monopoly".Nader, Ralph; Love, James. "Looting the medicine chest: how Bristol-Myers Squibb made off with the public's cancer research." The Progressive. February, 1993. Retrieved on March 9, 2007.
Eighteen months after the CRADA, BMS  filed a new drug application (NDA), which was given FDA approval at the very end of 1992.

Although there was no patent on the compound, the provisions of the Waxman-Hatch Act gave Bristol-Myers Squibb five years exclusive marketing rights.
In 1990, BMS applied to trademark the name taxol as TAXOL. This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced taxol as the generic name of the compound.  Critics, including the journal Nature, argued the name taxol had been used for more than two decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and the BMS should renounce its rights to it.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/373370a0 |title=Names for hi-jacking |year=1995 |journal=Nature |volume=373 |issue=6513 |pages=370 |pmid=7830775[/tpl] BMS argued changing the name would cause confusion among oncologists and possibly endanger the health of patients. BMS has continued to defend its rights to the name in the courts.[tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=170[/tpl]
BMS has also been criticized for misrepresentation by Goodman and Walsh, who quote from a company report saying 
 
 It was not until 1971 that ... testing ... enabled the isolation of paclitaxel, initially described as 'compound 17'Bristol-Myers Squibb, The development of TAXOL (paclitaxel), March 1997, as cited in [tpl]harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=2[/tpl]

This quote is, strictly speaking, accurate: the objection seems to be that this misleadingly neglects to explain that it was the scientist doing the isolation who named the compound taxol and it was not referred to in any other way for more than twenty years.
Annual sales peaked in 2000, reaching US$1.6 billion; paclitaxel is now available in generic form.

==Nomenclature==

The nomenclature for paclitaxel is structured on a tetracyclic 17-carbon (heptadecane) skeleton. There are a total of 11 stereocenters. The active stereoisomer is (-)-paclitaxel (shown here).

==Cost==

The cost to the NHS per patient in early breast cancer, assuming four cycles of treatment, is about £4000 (approx. $6000).[tpl]cite web|title=NICE Guidance TA108|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA108/guidance/pdf/English[/tpl]
