The village was destroyed by a hurricane in 1818Stewart, Donald F., "When the Ships' Cannon Roared off Old Worcester Coast", Maryland Beachcomber (August 24, 1979). and never rebuilt.  Its location arose in large part from its convenience to ocean-going ships: an inlet—Sinepuxent Inlet—allowed access through Assateague Island from the Atlantic Ocean to Sinepuxent Bay, until it was closed by the same hurricane that destroyed the village.
Sinepuxent was the birthplace of U.S. Navy officer Stephen Decatur in 1779.
