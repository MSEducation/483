[[Neutral monism]]

CATEGORIES: Monism, Theories of mind, Metaphysics of mind

Neutral monism, in philosophy, is the metaphysical view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical; these neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties, but these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.

==History==

Some of the first views of the neutral monism position about the mind–body relationship in philosophy can be attributed to C. D. Broad. In one of Broad's early works—known simply as "Broad's famous list of 1925" (see chapter XIV of The Mind and Its Place in Nature)C.D. Broad, The Mind and Its Place in Nature, London: Kegan Paul, 1925, http://www.ditext.com/broad/mpn/mpn-con.htm—he stated the basis of what this theory was to become. Indeed, no less than nine out of seventeen of his mind-body relationship theories are now classified as falling under the category of neutral monism. There are considerably few self-proclaimed neutral monists; most of the philosophers who are seen to have this view were classified after their deaths. Some examples of this are Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, Ernst Mach, Richard Avenarius, and Joseph Petzoldt.

==William James==

William James propounded the notion in his essay "Does Consciousness Exist?" in 1904 (reprinted in Essays in Radical Empiricism in 1912):

==Bertrand Russell==

Bertrand Russell 1921 later adopted a similar position to that of William James.Bertrand Russell, The Analysis of Mind, London, G. Allen & Unwin; New York, Macmillan, 1921. Russell quotes from James's essay "Does 'consciousness' exist?" as follows:
Russell summarizes this notion as follows:
Russell observes that the same view of "consciousness" is set forth in James's succeeding essay, "A World of Pure Experience" (ib., pp. 39-91).Russell 1921:10. The ibid refers to footnote #5 on Russell 1921:9 with regards to the quotes from James derived from Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods[tpl]'[/tpl]s," vol. i, 1904. Reprinted in "Essays in Radical Empiricism" (Longmans, Green & Co., 1912), pp. 1-38.
In addition to the role of James, Russell observes the role of two American Realists:
Russell goes on to agree with James and in part with the "American realists": 

==David Chalmers==

David Chalmers1996:293-301 "4. Is Experience Ubiquitous?" which includes subsections What is it like to be a thermostat?, Whither pansychism?, and Constraining the double-aspect principle considers the consciousness of rocks as well as thermostats, although he eschews the notion that rocks are conscious:
In his 2002 Consciousness and its Place in Nature, Chalmers carefully considers neutral monism and panpsychism, variants of what he calls "Type-F Monism".Chalmers 2002:264-267 He admits that:
