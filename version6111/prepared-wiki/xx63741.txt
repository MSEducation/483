==Early life==

He lists his influences as Joan Jett, Brian James, Brian May, and Steve Jones.

==Career==

===Germs (1977–1980)===

As a teenager in 1977, Smear and Darby Crash formed the Germs with bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Dottie Danger (the pseudonym of Belinda Carlisle, who went on to front The Go-Go's).
Carlisle was soon replaced by Don Bolles and, in 1979, the band released their first album, (GI).  Produced by Joan Jett, the record is now defined as a milestone in the history of punk rock.  The Germs endured for one more year before finally disbanding in 1980 after which Crash committed suicide.  After the Germs, Smear had a brief stint as a member of punk band The Adolescents.

===Solo work (1980–1993)===

Following the demise of the Germs, Smear played in 1981 with ex-Screamers keyboardist Paul Roessler and his sister Kira Roessler in a band called Twisted Roots."The Twisted Roots of the Punk Rock Family Tree" by Hunter Felt, 21 May 2004, PopMatters  Although short-lived, the band was the toast of the Hollywood punk scene.  Smear would go on to play with Nina Hagen and make two solo albums of his own, Ruthensmear (also recorded with Roessler), and So You Fell in Love with a Musician....
During this time, he also appeared as an extra in the television show Quincy, M.E. and in the films Blade Runner, Breakin' and Howard the Duck. While working on Breakin[tpl]'[/tpl], Smear became friends with Courtney Love.

===45 Grave (1981)===

Was briefly in deathrock band 45 Grave, the band that contains Don Bolles (Germs drummer) as part of classical training.
Smear came to record a 7" titled  Black Cross.

===Nirvana (1993–1994)===

In 1993, he received a call from Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain, asking him to join the band as a second guitarist for an upcoming tour.  Smear at first thought that it was his friend, Carlos "Cake" Nunez, playing a joke on him; however, Courtney Love had told Smear a few days prior that Cobain was going to call him.  Smear accepted immediately and played his first show with Nirvana on Saturday Night Live on September 25, 1993.  He toured with Nirvana for about six months, and appears on their live albums MTV Unplugged in New York and From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, as well as on material for the compilations Nirvana and With the Lights Out.
Smear's time with Nirvana, which brought him his first mass audience exposure, came to an end with Cobain's death in April 1994.

===Foo Fighters (1995–1997)===

Following Cobain's death, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl formed a band to support his self-titled album, the first effort from the band which would become known as Foo Fighters. Smear joined the group from its inception, but because the band's first album was a collection of demos recorded solely by Grohl, Smear did not appear on a Foo Fighters album until 1997's The Colour and the Shape. Later that year, Smear quit the band: he announced his departure during a live performance atop Radio City Music Hall (introducing his replacement Franz Stahl), right before that year's MTV Video Music Awards.

===Hiatus from the Foo Fighters (1997–2005)===

During his absence from Foo Fighters, Smear kept a fairly low profile, producing the band Harlow's debut album and making scattered television appearances.
He was employed as a creative consultant in a motion picture about the Germs and Darby Crash, entitled What We Do Is Secret, after one of the band's best-known songs. The film was released at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 23, 2007, and had a limited theatrical release in 2008. It is now available on DVD. In the film, he is depicted by actor Rick Gonzalez.
In 2005, he began performing reunion shows with the Germs, with actor Shane West (who portrays Darby Crash in the film) filling in as lead vocalist.
The previously unrecorded Germs song, "Golden Boys", which is on Smear's 1988 SST album Ruthensmear, originally appeared on the soundtrack of an early cut of the 2007 film Cthulhu, but the producers replaced it due to rights issues.

During his time in Nirvana, Smear sometimes used Fender Stratocaster models that Kurt Cobain bought for him.  In an interview, he stated he had 3 of each Strat and had to scratch them to tell the difference.  These guitars were normally used on the songs "Scentless Apprentice", "Heart-Shaped Box", "On A Plain", and "All Apologies".  Sometimes Smear used a blue Mosrite guitar that Cobain gave him as well.
For amplifiers, Smear has used Peavey 5150 and 6505 heads, but currently uses Laney Lionheart L20H or L50H heads.
