==National Football League==

After serving as a lawyer for the NFL, Tagliabue was selected by NFL owners to succeed Pete Rozelle as Commissioner of the NFL in 1989.

===Expansion of the league===

During his tenure as commissioner, the NFL expanded from 28 teams to 32.  New franchises were announced in 1993 to begin play in 1995 in Charlotte and Jacksonville.  Subsequent moves by other teams resulted in a 31st team being added at Cleveland in 1999; this team, though technically an expansion team, inherited the name, colors, and history (including all team and individual records) from the Cleveland Browns, who had relocated to Baltimore in 1996 as the Baltimore Ravens.  The 32nd franchise was the Houston Texans, added in 2002.

===Team movements===

In 1995, Los Angeles lost both its franchises, as the Rams relocated to St. Louis, and the Raiders returned to Oakland.  In 1996, the Browns moved to Baltimore, under a new name, as indicated above.  In 1997, the Houston Oilers relocated to Tennessee, for one year in Memphis and another year using Vanderbilt Stadium as their home field. (The team changed its name from the Oilers to the Titans upon moving to their permanent stadium in Nashville.)

===Response to September 11 attacks===

Two days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Tagliabue announced that the games scheduled for the upcoming weekend were cancelled, citing the magnitude of the events and security concerns.[tpl]cite news|last=Mason|first=Andrew|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/2001/decision_091301.html|title=NFL presses on after tragedy|date=2001-09-13|publisher=NFL.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010915231549/http://www.nfl.com/news/2001/decision_091301.html|archivedate=2001-09-15[/tpl]
It was the first time the league canceled an entire week's slate of games since the 1987 NFL strike.
A week later, it was announced that the postponed games would be added to the end of the regular season, pushing the Super Bowl into February for the first time.
