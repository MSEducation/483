[tpl]nihongo|Nobuo Uematsu|植松 伸夫|Uematsu Nobuo[/tpl] (born March 21, 1959) is a Japanese video game composer, best known for scoring the majority of titles in the Final Fantasy series. He is considered one of the most famous and respected composers in the video game community.[tpl]cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/594/594622p1.html |title=Dear Friends: Final Fantasy in San Francisco |author=Jeremy Dunham |date=2005-03-09 |work=IGN.com |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl] Uematsu, a self-taught musician, began playing the piano at the age of eleven or twelve, with Elton John as his biggest influence.
Uematsu joined Square (later Square Enix) in 1986, where he met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. They have worked together on many video game titles, most notably the games in the Final Fantasy series. After nearly 20 years in the company, he left Square Enix in 2004 to found his own company called Smile Please, and the music production company Dog Ear Records. He has since composed music as a freelancer for video games primarily developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker.
Soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in Final Fantasy concerts. He has worked with Grammy Award-winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these concerts. From 2002 to 2010, he was in a rock band with colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages, in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards. The band played arranged rock versions of Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions. He has since performed with the band Earthbound Papas.

Although he agreed, Uematsu considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3166165|title=A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu|publisher=1UP.com|first=James|last=Mielke|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-05-30[/tpl]

===Career with Square and The Black Mages===

The first game Uematsu composed for Square was Cruise Chaser Blassty in 1986. While working at Square, he met Hironobu Sakaguchi, who asked him if he wanted to create music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. From 1986 to 1987, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve any success, including eroge titles like Alpha.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/dave/alpha.shtml| title = Alpha |publisher = Square Enix Music Online | author = Dave| accessdate = 2008-04-17[/tpl] In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, Final Fantasy, a game that turned out to be a huge success.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=2007-12-13 |work=Develop |publisher=Intent Media |accessdate=2008-10-16[/tpl]
Final Fantasy[tpl]'[/tpl]s popularity sparked Uematsu's career in video game music, and he would go on to compose music for over 30 titles, most prominently the subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series. He scored the first installment in the SaGa series, The Final Fantasy Legend, in 1989. For the second and fifth games in the series, Final Fantasy Legend II (1990) and Romancing SaGa 2 (1993), he was assisted by Kenji Ito. Uematsu signed on to finish the soundtrack for the critically acclaimed 1995 title Chrono Trigger after the game's composer, Yasunori Mitsuda, contracted peptic ulcers.[tpl]cite book|year=2005|author=Kohler, Chris|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=BradyGames|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|authorlink=Chris Kohler[/tpl] In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to Front Mission: Gun Hazard and created the entire score for DynamiTracer. He also created music for three of the games in the Hanjuku Hero series.
Outside video games, he has composed the main theme for the 2000 animated film Ah! My Goddess: The Movie and co-composed the anime Final Fantasy: Unlimited (2001) with Final Fantasy orchestrator Shirō Hamaguchi. He also inspired the Ten Plants concept albums, and released a solo album in 1994, entitled Phantasmagoria. Feeling gradually more dissatisfied and uninspired, Uematsu requested the assistance of composers Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano for the score to Final Fantasy X in 2001. This marked the first time that Uematsu did not compose an entire main-series Final Fantasy soundtrack. For Final Fantasy XI from 2002, he was joined by Naoshi Mizuta, who composed the majority of the soundtrack, and Kumi Tanioka; Uematsu was responsible for only eleven tracks. In 2003, he assisted Hitoshi Sakimoto in scoring Final Fantasy Tactics Advance by providing the main theme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/strategy/finalfantasytacticsadvance/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Tech Info|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]
In 2002, fellow Square colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito asked Uematsu to join them in forming a rock band that focused on reinterpreting and expanding on Uematsu's compositions. He declined their offer at first because he was too busy with work; however, after agreeing to perform with Fukui and Sekito in a live performance as a keyboardist, he decided to join them in making a band.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200905/N09.0527.1612.59659.htm?Page=3|title=Nobuo Uematsu: The Man Behind The Music|work=Game Informer|first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo|date=2009-05-27|accessdate=2009-06-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090601154539/http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200905/N09.0527.1612.59659.htm?Page=3|archivedate=2009-06-01[/tpl] Another employee at Square, Mr. Matsushita, chose the name The Black Mages for their band. In 2003, Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/companies/blackmages/history.shtml|title=The Black Mages :: History|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|author=Chris|date=2007-12-21|accessdate=2009-06-30[/tpl] The Black Mages have released three studio albums, and have appeared at several concerts to promote their albums.

On August 18, 2013, whilst headlining the Fantasy Rock Festival in Kawasaki[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl], Japan with the Earthbound Papas he revealed to the audience that he had originally intended to name their second album "Dancing Mad" after the Final Fantasy VI track which also appears on the album. However, referring to Square Enix indirectly, he told the audience that "a certain company 'S'" had phoned and informed him that he "could not use the name". Consequently instead of backing down he decided to name the album "Dancing Dad", as a nod to the band's name. He also told the audience that he wanted to make an album of wholly original songs, but lamented that "it's just that if there are no game songs on it, it probably wouldn't sell!".

==Musical style and influences==

The style of Uematsu's compositions is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to New Age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=1694|title=Lost Odyssey Review|publisher=GameTrailers|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] Uematsu has stated that he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/529/529490p1.html|title=Nobuo Uematsu Interview|publisher= IGN|author=Spence D.|coauthors=Schneider, Peer; Dunham, Jeremy|date=2004-07-09|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat.[tpl]cite web|url= http://music.ign.com/articles/741/741101p1.html|title=Twelve Days of Final Fantasy XII: Nobuo Uematsu Interview|publisher=IGN|date=2006-10-23|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is "Aerith's Theme" from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nichibeitimes.com/?p=5759|title=Nobuo Uematsu: An Interview with Video Game Music’s Premier Composer|work=Nichi Bei Times|first=Ben|last=Hamamoto|date=2009-09-08|accessdate=2009-09-12[/tpl] He has been named one of the "Innovators" in Time Magazine[tpl]'[/tpl]s "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" feature.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/innovators_v2/music/profile_uematsu.html|title=In Fantasy's Loop|work=Time|first= Christopher John|last=Farley|accessdate=2008-06-10 | date=2001-05-19 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081231083900/http://www.time.com/time/innovators_v2/music/profile_uematsu.html | archivedate=2008-12-31[/tpl] He has also been called the "John Williams of the video game world"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/bio.html|title=Biography|publisher= nobuouematsu.com|first= Michael|last=Huang|accessdate=2008-06-04[/tpl] and been credited for "increasing the appreciation and awareness" of video game music.
A lot of Uematsu's musical influences come from the United Kingdom and the United States.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/nobxe360.html|title=Interview by Xbox Evolved|publisher=nobuouematsu.com|work=Xbox Evolved|first=John|last=Olin|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence, and he has stated that he wanted to be like him. Other major inspirations include The Beatles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/bob.html|title=Interview by Bob Rork|publisher=nobuouematsu.com|accessdate=2008-05-30[/tpl] Simon & Garfunkel, and progressive rock bands. In the classical genre, he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence. Uematsu has said that 1970s bands, such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson, had an impact on his Final Fantasy compositions. The intro to the piece "One-Winged Angel" from Final Fantasy VII was inspired by the Jimi Hendrix song "Purple Haze"; the lyrics were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata Carmina Burana, specifically the songs "Estuans Interius", "O Fortuna", "Veni, Veni, Venias" and "Ave Formosissima".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/text/info/owainfo.txt|title=One Winged Angel Translation and Background|publisher=RPGamer|first=Patrick|last=Ashmore| accessdate=2009-07-087[/tpl] In turn, Nobuo Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video games industry as well. For example, "Liberi Fatali" from Final Fantasy VIII was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women's synchronized swimming event.[tpl]cite web | author=Suds | title=Video Game Music In the Olympics! | year=2004 | url=http://vgmusic.com/news/older/2004/q3.shtml | publisher=Video Game Music Archive | accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=The Culture of Videogame Music | year=2005 | url=http://www.empirearcadia.com/community/com-016.htm | publisher=Empire arcadiA | accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] From the same game, "Eyes on Me", featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, sold a record 400,000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards,[tpl]cite web|title=Nobuo Uematsu|url=http://na.square-enix.com/uematsu/profile/index.html|publisher=Square Enix|accessdate=2011-07-06[/tpl] where it won "Song of the Year (International)" in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2000.html |title=Japan Gold Disc Award 2000 |publisher=Riaj.or.jp |date=1998-01-21 |accessdate=2012-02-02[/tpl] In a July 2010 interview, Uematsu revealed, "Rather than getting inspiration from listening to other music, I get inspiration while I'm walking my dog."[tpl]cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?the_music_of_distant_worlds_interview_with_nobuo_uematsu_and_arnie_roth_15584.aspx | title = The Music of Distant Worlds: interview with Nobuo Uematsu and Arnie Roth | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2010-08-27[/tpl]
