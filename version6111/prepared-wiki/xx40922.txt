[[Automotive industry]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive industry

The automotive industry is a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url= http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/45050/automotive-industry|title=automotive industry |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]
It is one of the world's most important economic sectors by revenue. The automotive industry does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles following delivery to the end-user, such as automobile repair shops and motor fuel filling stations.
The term automotive was created from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. This term was proposed by SAE member Elmer Sperry.[tpl]cite book|title=Scientific and Technical Societies of the United States |year=1968 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences|location=Washington DC |page=164 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pS8rAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=%22Society+of+Automobile+Engineers%22+-inauthor:%22Society+of+Automotive+Engineers%22&source=bl&ots=GPYxVdf2Gv&sig=-Qiz_agHsvXxF4LkOAtNS_b8YJ8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YB0YUMHdLcPV0QHIuoHAAg&ved=0CGEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Society%20of%20Automobile%20Engineers%20-inauthor%3A%22Society%20of%20Automotive%20Engineers%22&f=false |edition=Eighth |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]

==History==

The automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84&dq=U.S.+makes+ninety+percent+of+world's+automobiles |title=U.S. Makes Ninety Percent of World's Automobiles |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1929 |page=84 |volume=115 |issue=5 |accessdate=6 August 2013 [/tpl] After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.[tpl]cite web|publisher=OICA |url= http://oica.net/category/production-statistics/ |title=2012 Production Statistics |accessdate=6 August 2013 [/tpl]

==Safety==

Safety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automotives themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.
Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54591 |title= ISO 26262-10:2012 Road vehicles -- Functional safety -- Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl] is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive functional safety.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.sgs.com/en/Automotive/Electrical-Components/Power-Electronics/Vehicle-PE/Functional-Safety.aspx |publisher=SGS |title=Functional Safety |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]
In case of safety issues, danger, product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.
Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls,[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.sgs.com/en/Our-Company/News-and-Media-Center/News-and-Press-Releases/2013/03/SGS-Informs-Customers-about-Product-Recalls-in-the-Automotive-Industry.aspx |publisher= SGS |title=Product Recalls in the Automotive Industry |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl] which cause considerable financial consequences.

==Economy==

Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over [tpl]convert|260|e9USgal|m3[/tpl] of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Plunkett Research| url= http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx |title=Automobile Industry Introduction|year=2008 |accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicts that, by 2014, one-third of world demand will be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.Paul A. Eisenstein Building BRIC's: 4 Markets Could Soon Dominate the Auto World at TheDetroitBureau.com
Emerging auto markets already buy more cars than established markets. According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study expects this trend to accelerate.[tpl]cite web|publisher=The Truth About Cars|author=Bertel Schmitt|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/02/auto-industry-sets-new-world-record-in-2010-will-do-it-again-in-2011 |title=Auto industry sets new world record|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=J.D.
