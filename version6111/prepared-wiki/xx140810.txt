Randolph was born in Santa Barbara, California. He learned the game of golf from his father, Sam Randolph Sr., who was the head professional at La Cumbre Country Club for 38 years. As a teen, Randolph and fellow future PGA Tour player, Billy Andrade, won the Junior World Cup in 1981. He attended the University of Southern California and was a member of the golf team – a three-time first-team All-American with 13 collegiate wins. After finishing as runner-up in 1984, in 1985, he won the U.S. Amateur. He also won the California State Amateur, the Haskins Award, and was low amateur at The Masters in 1985. In 1986, Randolph was the low amateur at both The Masters and the U.S. Open. He turned pro and joined the PGA Tour in 1986.
Randolph played on the PGA Tour from 1987 – 1992, and won one PGA Tour event in his career: the 1987 Bank of Boston Classic. His best finish in a major championship occurred during his amateur career — T-18 at The Masters in 1985.[tpl]cite web|title=Golf Major Championships|url=http://golfmajorchampionships.com/players?player=667|accessdate=2008-01-21[/tpl] From 1993 to 2002, Randolph split his playing time between the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour, mostly on the Nationwide Tour.
