[[Woolage Green]]

CATEGORIES: Hamlets in Kent

Woolage Green is a small hamlet, situated about [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-east of Canterbury, Kent, England, 1 mile to the east of the A2 road. Together with Womenswold and Woolage Village, it forms Womenswold parish.
Originally a downland farming community, Woolage Green consists of some 36 dwellings including one pub, the Two Sawyers. The Two Sawyers changed its name from the Rose and Crown in the 1820s, possibly due to its notoriety as a poachers' haunt. A small chapel has in recent years been converted into a holiday letting.
The village was heavily wooded until the destruction of Woolwich Wood in the 1960s, to make way for farmland.
Historical maps and records also show the village as Woollage Green and Woolwich Green.
