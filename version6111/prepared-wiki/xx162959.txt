Sidney Leslie Goodwin (9 September 1910 – 15 April 1912) was a 19-month-old English boy who died during the sinking of the RMS Titanic. His unidentified body was recovered after the sinking by the Mackay-Bennett, and for decades referred to as the unknown child; it was identified as his in 2008 by the Armed Forces lab. He is the only member of his family whose body has been recovered and subsequently identified.

==Early life==

Sidney was born on 9 September 1910 in Melksham, Wiltshire, England. He was the youngest child born to Frederick Joseph Goodwin and his wife Augusta (née Tyler). He had five older siblings named Lillian, Charles, William, Jessie, and Harold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/839/|title=Master Sidney Leslie Goodwin|publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica|accessdate=2007-08-04[/tpl]

==RMS Titanic==

Frederick's brother, Thomas, had already left England and was living in Niagara Falls, New York. Thomas wrote to Frederick, telling him about the opening of a power station there. It has been speculated that the famed Schoellkopf Hydroelectric Power Station (Station A), due to open in 1912, would have been his employer had he lived. He, a compositor, packed up his wife and six children to prepare for the move. They booked third-class passage on the S.S. New York out of Southampton, but due to a coal strike that year its passage was delayed and they were transferred to the Titanic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/832/|title=Mr Frederick Joseph Goodwin|publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica|accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] They boarded the Titanic in Southampton as third-class passengers.
Not much is known about the Goodwins activities during the voyage, except that they may have been separated by sex in opposite ends of the ship, Frederick and his older sons in the bow, and Augusta with Sidney and the girls in the stern. Harold also met and spent some time with Frank Goldsmith, who survived. 
By the time the Goodwins received a warning about the collision with the iceberg, all the lifeboats had been launched. The entire family perished in the sinking. 
In his book, The Night Lives On, historian Walter Lord devoted a chapter ("What Happened to the Goodwins?") to the Goodwins, using the fact that they were English to challenge the White Star Line's implication that such high numbers of third-class passengers perished because they could not understand the English language.

==The unknown child==

The body of a fair-haired toddler was the fourth pulled from the ocean by the recovery ship CS Mackay-Bennett, on 17 April 1912. The description read:

The sailors aboard the Mackay-Bennett, who were very upset by the discovery of the unknown boy's body, paid for a monument, and he was buried on 4 May 1912 with a copper pendant placed in his coffin by recovery sailors that read "Our Babe."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/5510/ |title=RMS Titanic: The Funerals, Memorials and Legacy of the Lost Passengers and Her Crew |publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica |first=Brandon C. |last=Holm |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl] Before 2002 (when he was first, though mistakenly, identified through DNA testing) he was known simply as "The Unknown Child". His body, identified as that of a child around two years old, was initially believed to be that of either a two-year-old Swedish boy, Gösta Pålsson; or a two-year-old Irish boy, Eugene Rice, two other fair-haired toddlers who perished in the sinking.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/1516/ |title=The Last of the Lost |publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica |first1=Alan |last1=Ruffman |first2=Ryan |last2=Parr |date=3 August 2002 |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl]

==Identification and re-identification==

The American PBS television series Secrets of the Dead initially identified the body as Eino Viljami Panula, a 13-month old Finnish baby, based on DNA testing of three teeth and a small, weathered bone.

Although the bodies of two other children, both older boys, were recovered, it was Sidney who came to be a symbol of all the children lost in the sinking. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. A pair of his shoes were donated to Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in 2002 by the descendants of a Halifax police officer who guarded the bodies and clothing of Titanic victims.
