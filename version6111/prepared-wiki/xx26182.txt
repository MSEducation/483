==Ethnic groups==

In 2013, the total population of Afghanistan was 27.5 million.http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/04/30/afghan-population-set-reach-275m-year An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily living in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. This makes the estimated total Afghan population around 31,108,077. Because a systematic census has not been held in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are unvailable. The government recently began issuing computerized ID cards in which the ethnicity of each citizen is to be provided in the application.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/02/24/14m-afghans-get-computerised-id-cards-year |title=14m Afghans to get computerised ID cards in a year |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |editor=Ghulam Hussain Zakiri |date=February 24, 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-04[/tpl] This process is expected to reveal the exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups living in the country.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/03/26/senators-stress-caution-id-cards-issuance |title=Senators stress caution in ID cards issuance |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |editor=Abasin Zaheer |date=May 26, 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-04[/tpl]
An approximate distribution of the ethnic groups found today in Afghanistan is shown in the chart below:
The 2004–present suggested figures in the above chart are supported by recent national opinion polls, which were aimed at knowing how a group of about 804 to 7,760 local residents in Afghanistan felt about the current war, political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. Seven of the surveys were conducted between 2004 to 2012 by the Asia Foundation and one between 2004 to 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies NBC News, BBC, and ARD.[ref]See:

==Languages==

Pashto and Dari are both designated as the official languages of Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|title=Article Sixteen of the Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#preamble |quote=From among the languages of Pashto, Dari, Uzbeki, Turkmani, Baluchi, Pashai, Nuristani, Pamiri (alsana), Arab and other languages spoken in the country, Pashto and Dari are the official languages of the state.|year=2004 |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl] Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the lingua franca in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and other cities in northern and north-western Afghanistan. It is the language resorted to when people of different ethnic groups need to conduct business or otherwise communicate. Pashto is widely used in southern and eastern areas of the country where ethnic Pashtuns are the majority. The Afghan National Anthem is recited in Pashto.
Sources before 1996 stated that Pashto is the native tongue of 50-55% of the population and Dari being of 25-50%.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afghanistan-v-languages|title=AFGHANISTAN v. Languages|quote=A. Official languages. Paṧtō (1) is the native tongue of 50 to 55 percent of Afghans... Persian (2) is the language most spoken in Afghanistan. The native tongue of twenty five percent of the population, it is split into numerous dialects.|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|work=Ch. M. Kieffer|accessdate=2010-10-10[/tpl] Uzbeki and Turkmeni are spoken in certain northern provinces, but mainly among the Uzbek and Turkmen tribes. Smaller number of Afghans are also fluent in Urdu, Balochi, Arabic and other languages. After the US-led invasion in late 2001, English language began to take hold in the country. Many Afghans are learning English in schools.  
An approximate distribution of languages spoken in the country is shown in the line chart below:
Based on information from the latest national opinion polls, up to 49% stated that Pashto is their first language or mother tongue and Dari being the mother tongue of about 25%. Uzbeki was spoken or understood by up to 11% and Turkmen by up to 3%. Other languages that can be spoken are English (up to 5%), Urdu (3%), Arabic (1%) and Balochi (2%). Almost 76% of the people can speak Dari.

==Religions==

Almost the entire Afghan population is Muslim, with less than 1% being non-Muslim. Despite attempts to secularize Afghan society, Islamic practices pervade all aspects of life. Likewise, Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional practices, provide the principal means of controlling personal conduct and settling legal disputes. Islam was used as the main basis for expressing opposition to the modernization of Afghanistan by King Amanullah in the 1920s. It was also used by the mujahideen during the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan and by the Taliban today.
