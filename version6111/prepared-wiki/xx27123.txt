The Queen's Plate is Canada's oldest thoroughbred horse race, having been founded in 1860. It is also the oldest continuously run race in North America. http://www.thoroughbredreport.com/faq.html It is run at a distance of 1¼ miles for a maximum of 17 three-year-old thoroughbred horses foaled in Canada. The race takes place each summer, in June or July, at Woodbine Racetrack, Etobicoke, Ontario, and is the first race in the Canadian Triple Crown.

==History==

Initiated in 1859 by the then president of the Toronto Turf Club, Sir Casimir Gzowski, the Queen's Plate was inaugurated on June 27, 1860, at the Carleton racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, with the prize of 50 guineas awarded by Queen Victoria. Woodbine Racetrack hosted the race in 1876 and 1881 and then continuously from 1883 to 1955. The Queen's Plate has been running at Woodbine since 1956. 
The record time for the race since 1957, the year in which the track was set at its current length of 1¼ miles, is 2:01 4/5, set by Kinghaven Farms Izvestia in 1990.
Nick Eaves, President and CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group, announced during the 2012 Queen's Plate post position draw that Woodbine Racetrack may be forced to close in April 2013 due to the cancellation of Slots at Racetrack program partnerships between Ontario's racetracks and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. Eaves said that if Woodbine is not open, "there won't be a Queen's Plate."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/70734/eaves-closure-of-woodbine-possible-in-2013|title=Eaves: Closure of Woodbine Possible in 2013|author=Campbell, Alex|date=21 June 2012|publisher=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=22 June 2012[/tpl] A new funding agreement was put in place in March 2013, which ensured the continuation of horse racing at Woodbine for the next 2 years and affirmed the 154th running of the Queen's Plate.

==Royal patronage==

Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, is patron of the event and various other members of the Canadian Royal Family have been in attendance through the years, beginning with the Duke of Argyll and his wife, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, in 1881, when the Duke was serving as Governor General of Canada and the couple was touring Ontario.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.woodbineentertainment.com/queensplate/History.aspx| title=History > History of Queen's Plate| publisher=Woodbine Entertainment Group| accessdate=2 July 2009[/tpl] Elizabeth II's most recent visit to the race was in early July 2010.
