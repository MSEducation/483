==History==

===Dummy (1994)===

Portishead's first album Dummy was released in 1994. The cover features a still from the band's own short film To Kill a Dead Man. The credits indicate that at this juncture, Portishead was a duo of Geoff Barrow and Beth Gibbons. Adrian Utley, who co-produced the album with them (and who played on 9 of the tracks and co-wrote 8), became an official band member shortly after its release.
Despite the band's aversion to press coverage, the album was successful in both Europe and the United States (where it sold more than 150,000 copies even before the band toured there).Biography AllMusic.

The album is often considered one of the greatest Trip hop albums to date and is a milestone in the definition of the genre.

===Portishead (1997)===

After their initial success, Portishead withdrew from the spotlight for three years until their eponymous second album, Portishead, was released in 1997. The album's sound differed from Dummy, characterised as "grainy and harsher."[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] Three singles, "All Mine", "Over" and "Only You" were released, the first one achieving a Top 10 placing in the UK.
In 1997, the band performed a one-off show with strings at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. A live album primarily featuring these new orchestral arrangements of the group's songs was released in 1998. There was also a long-form VHS video of the performance, and a DVD followed in 2002, with substantial extra material including many early music videos.

===Hiatus (1999–2005)===

In 1999, Portishead recorded the song "Motherless Child" with Tom Jones for his album Reload. For the next few years, the band members concentrated on solo and other pursuits. In February 2005, the band appeared live for the first time in seven years at the Tsunami Benefit Concert in Bristol.Tsunami benefit concert review BBC Music.
