The Colorado Rockies are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Denver, Colorado.  They are currently members of the National League West Division.  Their home venue is Coors Field.  Their manager is Walt Weiss.
The Colorado Rockies have won one National League championship (2007).

However, they lost to the American League champion Boston Red Sox four games to none.

==History==

Denver had long been a hotbed of minor league baseball and many in the area desired a major league team.  Following the Pittsburgh drug trials, an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the Pittsburgh Pirates and relocate them.  However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (they also added the Florida (now Miami) Marlins), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and Michael I. Monus were granted a franchise; they took the name "Rockies" due to Denver's proximity to the Rocky Mountains, which is reflected in their logo.  They began play in 1993, sharing Mile High Stadium with the National Football League's Denver Broncos their first two seasons while Coors Field was constructed.  It was completed for the 1995 Major League Baseball season.
In 1993 they started play in the western division of the National League.  Since that date, the Rockies have reached the MLB postseason three times, each time as the National League wild card team.  Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.  In 2007 the Rockies advanced all the way to the World Series, only to be swept by the Boston Red Sox.
The Rockies play their home games at Coors Field. Their newest Spring Training home, Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, opened in March 2011 and is shared with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
