Cowboys and Aliens is the fourth studio album by British alternative rock band Kitchens of Distinction, released on October 3, 1994 in the UK by One Little Indian Records and on January 24, 1995 by A&M Records in the US.
The album was recorded in Kippford, Scotland at Pete Bartlett's Radio King studio through the summer and autumn of 1993. One Little Indian rejected the album twice, and eventually, both label and band agreed to bring in up-and-coming producer Pascal Gabriel to work on a couple of tracks. One of the label's complaints about the album as the band originally submitted it was that they felt it lacked a potential hit single, so Gabriel produced a new song ("Come on Now") that the band had written after the rest of the album had already been recorded; Gabriel also remixed two of the album's other tracks (the opener "Sand on Fire" and first single "Now It's Time to Say Goodbye"). Although the band admitted that they enjoyed working with Gabriel, the changes did nothing to help the album's dismal sales. By the end of 1995, both A&M and OLI had dropped the band.
Following the album's release, the band shortened their name to Kitchens O.D. and recorded and released the non-album single "Feel My Genie"/"To Love a Star" in May 1996 before calling it quits.
