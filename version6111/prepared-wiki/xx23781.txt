The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative.[tpl]cite web|title=Genomes to Life, Black Bag|author=|work=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/jmmbbag.pdf[/tpl] DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.[tpl]cite web|title=NSF Science and Engineering Indicators 2012|url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/|publisher=National Science Foundation[/tpl]
The agency is administered by the United States Secretary of Energy, and its headquarters are located in southwest Washington, D.C., on Independence Avenue in the James V. Forrestal Building, named for James Forrestal, as well as in Germantown, Maryland.

==History==

In 1942, during World War II, the United States started the Manhattan Project, a project to develop the atomic bomb, under the eye of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. After the war, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created to control the future of the project.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to support the transfer of responsibility for atomic weapons from the US Army to the AEC and as the AEC DOE's predecessor?|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The AEC was reinstated and gave way to Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry, and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon, naval reactor, and energy development programs.
The 1973 oil crisis called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy. On August 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 ([tpl]USStatute|95|91|91|565|1977|08|04[/tpl]), which created the Department of Energy.[tpl]cite book|last=Relyea|first=Harold|title=The executive branch, creation and reorganization|year=2003|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=29|coauthors=Thomas P. Carr|accessdate=October 18, 2011[/tpl] The new agency, which began operations on October 1, 1977, consolidated the Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Federal Power Commission, and programs of various other agencies.

===Weapon plans stolen===

In December 1999, The FBI was investigating how China obtained plans for a specific nuclear device. Wen Ho Lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People's Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime. The U.S. Congress held hearings to investigate the Department of Energy's mishandling of his case. Republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues, not the Department of Energy.[tpl]cite news| last =Plotz| first =David| title =Energy Secretary Bill Richardson| publisher =Slate.com| date =June 23, 2000| url =http://www.slate.com/id/84864/| accessdate =November 7, 2008[/tpl] All but one of the 59 charges against Lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the Chinese obtained could not have come from Lee. Lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies.[tpl]cite news| last =Mears| first =Bill| title =Deal in Wen Ho Lee case may be imminent|publisher=CNN| date =May 22, 2006| url =http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/05/22/scotus.wenholee/| accessdate =November 7, 2008[/tpl]

==Organization==

==Budget==

President Barack Obama unveiled on May 7, 2009, a $26.4 billion budget request for DOE for fiscal year (FY) 2010, including $2.3 billion for the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The budget aims to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure. It also makes significant investments in hybrids and plug-in hybrids, in smart grid technologies, and in scientific research and innovation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12509 |title=EERE News: DOE Requests $2.3 Billion for Efficiency, Renewable Energy in FY 2010 |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl]
As part of the $789 billion economic stimulus package in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congress provided Energy with an additional $38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, adding about 75 percent to Energy's annual budgets. Most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts.
For fiscal year 2011, each of the operating units of the Department of Energy operate with the following budgets:Department of Energy FY2012 Budget Request, Department of Energy – Office of the Chief Financial Officer, February 2012

==Energy Savings Performance Contract==

Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) are contracts under which a contractor designs, constructs, and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project, and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency's utility bills. The contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings, and after the contract ends, all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12163 |title=EERE News: DOE Awards 16 Contracts for Energy Savings at Federal Facilities |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl]

==Loan Guarantee Program==

Title XVII of Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes the DOE to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that "avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases" and "employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lgprogram.energy.gov/features.html |title=Department of Energy – Loan Guarantee Program |publisher=Lgprogram.energy.gov |date=December 31, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201210313/http://www.lgprogram.energy.gov/features.html|archivedate=February 1, 2010[/tpl]
In loan guarantees, a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment, as well as other conditions, before the loan guarantee is closed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12360 |title=EERE News: DOE Offers $535 Million Loan Guarantee to Solyndra, Inc |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl]

==Energy Innovation Hubs==

Energy Innovation Hubs are multi-disciplinary meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies.The Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) was the first DOE Energy Innovation Hub established in July 2010, for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation (M&S) solutions for commercial nuclear reactors.
The DOE budget includes $280 million to fund eight Energy Innovation Hubs, each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge. Two of the eight hubs are included in the EERE budget and will focus on integrating smart materials, designs, and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity. Another two hubs, included in the DOE Office of Science budget, will tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes. Yet another hub will develop "smart" materials that will allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions.
In 2012, The DOE awarded $120 million to the Ames Laboratory to start a new EIH, the Critical Materials Institute, which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements, which is  controlled by China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/us-spots-120m-lab-tackle-rare-earth-shortages |title=US spots $120M for lab to tackle rare earth shortages |publisher=Networkworld.com |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]

==Polygraphs==

In 1998 the Director of Counterintelligence of the DOE announced that he believed that China had received information about the W-88. As a result from this event,McCarthy, Susan. "The truth about the polygraph." Salon. March 2, 2000. Retrieved on July 5, 2013. in 1999 U.S. Congress placed a clause in the National Defense Authorization Act that required DOE employees and contractors who had access to specific high risk programs to take counterintelligence polygraph examinations.Aftergood, Steven. "Polygraph Testing and the DOE National Laboratories." (Essays on Science and Society) Science. 3 November 2000: Vol. 290 no. 5493 pp. 939–40 DOI: 10.1126/science.290.5493.939. Retrieved on July 5, 2013. The DOE planned to require up to 13,000 DOE employees to take polygraph tests. Many DOE employees were unhappy with the proposal and referred to polygraphs as a tool which a police state would use and a witch hunt. Steven Aftergood of Science said that "As soon as the DOE announced its plans to comply with the new requirement, the response from the weapons labs was vocal and hostile." DOE employees unhappy with the polygraph plans attended hearings against polygraphs, issued reviews of scientific literature which opposed polygraphs, wrote letters protesting against plans, and created critical websites. A Congressional panel chaired by Paul Redmond, a former counterintelligence chief of the Central Intelligence Agency, concluded that "The Department of Energy has failed to gain even a modicum of acceptance of the polygraph program in the laboratories. The attitude toward polygraphs at the laboratories runs the gamut from cautiously and rationally negative to emotionally and irrationally negative." By 2000 the DOE announced that only around 800 employees, instead of 13,000, would be required to take polygraphs, and those 800 were in jobs that are in some highly sensitive categories.
Aftergood wrote that the polygraph issue involved a conflict between most scientists, who are "deeply skeptical of polygraph's usefulness in screening employees as a way to enhance security" and between security professionals who "have an equally profound commitment to the polygraph and view it as an indispensable counterintelligence tool."

==Symbolism in the seal==

Exert from the code of federal regulations, Title 10: Energy[tpl]cite web|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10- Energy, PART 1002 - OFFICIAL SEAL AND DISTINGUISHING FLAG |author=|work=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2000-title10-vol4/xml/CFR-2000-title10-vol4-part1002.xml[/tpl]
The official seal of the Department of energy "includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt, on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo. It is crested by the white head of an eagle, atop a white rope. Both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency, in gold, appears on a green background." 
"The eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the Nation's increasing demands for energy. The sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands. The rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities. The lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the Nation's challenge in harnessing the forces."
"The color scheme is derived from nature, symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man's existence. The blue field represents air and water, green represents mineral resources and the earth itself, and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme represents the Nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment."
