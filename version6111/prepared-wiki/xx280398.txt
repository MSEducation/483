==Listed buildings in England==

In England, a building or structure is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (a successor to the 1947 act).[tpl]cite web|title=Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9)|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2133903|accessdate=3 March 2010|publisher=Ministry of Justice|date=24 May 1990|work=The UK Statute Law Database[/tpl]  English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/who-we-are/how-we-are-run/history-of-english-heritage/|title=History of English Heritage|year=2010|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl]  There are three grades of listing status.  Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of "exceptional interest"; Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest"; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of "special interest".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/|title=Listed Buildings|year=2010|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=26 August 2011[/tpl]  As of July 2009, about 374,000 buildings in England were listed.  Around 92% of these had the lowest designation, Grade II; 5.5% were listed at Grade II*; and about 2.5% had the highest grade.
Listed status gives buildings a degree of protection from unapproved alteration, demolition or other changes.  Local authorities must consult English Heritage when an application for alteration of a Grade I-listed building is made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.00100200400f|title=Planning Advice|year=2008|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2010[/tpl]
