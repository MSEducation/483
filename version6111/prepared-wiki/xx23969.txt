[[Spontaneous human combustion]]

CATEGORIES: Forteana, Exploding animals, Causes of death, Combustion

Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) is a term encompassing reported cases of the burning of a living (or very recently deceased) human body without an apparent external source of ignition. In addition to reported cases, examples of SHC appear in literature and both types have been observed to share common characteristics regarding circumstances and remains of the victim.
Forensic investigations have attempted to analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption and proximity to potential sources of ignition, as well as the behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC.

==Overview==

"Spontaneous human combustion" refers to the death from a fire originating without an apparent external source of ignition.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15032614 |work=BBC News | title='First Irish case' of death by spontaneous combustion | date=23 September 2011[/tpl] Writing in the British Medical Journal, Gavin Thurston describes the phenomena as having "attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the laity" as early as 1834 (more than one hundred years prior to Thurston's 1938 article).[tpl]cite journal | last = Thurston | first = Gavin | title = Spontaneous Human Combustion | publisher = British Medical Journal | date = 18 June 1938 | volume = 1 | issue = 4041 | page = 1340 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2086726/ | accessdate = 2013-10-09 [/tpl] In his 1995 book Ablaze!, Larry E. Arnold wrote that there had been about 200 cited reports of spontaneous human combustion worldwide over a period of around 300 years.[tpl]cite book | title = Ablaze!: The Mysterious Fires of Spontaneous Human Combustion | last = Arnold | first = Larry E. | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0871317893 [/tpl]

===Characteristics===

The topic received coverage in the British Medical Journal in 1938. An article by L. A. Parry cited an 1823-published paper, "Medical Jurisprudence," which stated that commonalities among recorded cases of spontaneous human combustion included the following characteristics:
 "...the recorded cases have these things in common: 
 Alcoholism is a common theme in early SHC literary references, in part because some Victorian era physicians and writers believed spontaneous human combustion was the result of alcoholism.[tpl]cite web | title = Spontaneous human combustion: examples from fiction | last = Collins | first = Nick | work = The Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8784947/Spontaneous-human-combustion-examples-from-fiction.html | date = 23 September 2011 | accessdate = 2013-10-10[/tpl]

==Forensic investigation==

An extensive two-year research project, involving thirty historical cases of alleged SHC, was conducted in 1984 by science investigator Joe Nickell and forensic analyst John F. Fischer. Their lengthy, two-part report was published in the journal of the International Association of Arson Investigators,[tpl]cite journal|last=Nickell|first=Joe|coauthors=Fischer, John F.|title=Spontaneous Human Combustion|journal=The Fire and Arson Investigator|date=March 1984|volume=34|issue=3[/tpl][tpl]rp|3–11[/tpl] as well as part of a book.[tpl]cite book|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Secrets of The Supernatural|year=1991|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|pages=149–157, 161–171[/tpl]  Nickell has written frequently on the subject, appeared on television documentaries, conducted additional research, and lectured at the New York State Academy of Fire Science at Montour Falls, NY, as a guest instructor.
Nickell and Fischer's investigation, which looked at cases in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, showed that the burned bodies were near plausible sources for the ignition: candles, lamps, fireplaces, and so on. Sometimes these sources were left out of popular accounts of the alleged phenomenon while they were hyped as mysterious. The investigations also found that there was a correlation between alleged SHC deaths and victim's drunkenness or other incapacitation that could have caused them to be careless with fire and less able to respond properly to an accident. Where the destruction of the body was not extensive, the significant fuel source was the victim's clothing.
However, where the destruction was extensive, additional fuel sources were involved, such as chair stuffing, floor coverings, the flooring itself, and the like. The investigators described how such materials helped retain melted fat to burn and destroy more of the body, yielding still more liquified fat, in a cyclic process known as the "wick effect" (or "candle effect").
According to Nickell and Fischer's investigation, nearby objects often went undamaged because fire tends to burn upward, and it burns laterally with some difficulty. The fires in question are relatively small, achieving considerable destruction by the wick effect, and relatively nearby objects may not be close enough to catch fire themselves (much as one can get rather close to a modest campfire without burning). As with other mysteries, Nickell and Fischer cautioned against "single, simplistic explanation for all unusual burning deaths" but rather urged investigating "on an individual basis."[tpl]rp|169[/tpl]

==Suggested explanations==

Some hypotheses attempt to explain how SHC might occur without an external flame source, while other hypotheses suggest incidents that might appear as spontaneous combustion actually had an external source of ignition – and that the likelihood of spontaneous human combustion without an external ignition source is quite low.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/shc.html |title=Skeptic’s Dictionary on spontaneous human combustion, Retrieved Oct 20, 2007 "The physical possibilities of spontaneous human combustion are remote." |publisher=Skepdic.com |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] Benjamin Radford, science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine Skeptical Inquirer, casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion, "If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn’t it happen more often? There are 5 billion (editor's note: as of 2011) people in the world, and yet we don’t see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks."[tpl]cite web|url=http://bodyodd.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/26/7976119-irishman-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion-coroner-claims| title=Irishman died of spontaneous human combustion, coroner claims|publisher=MSNBC| date=26 September 2011| accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl] Paranormal researcher Brian Dunning states that SHC stories "are simply the rare cases where a natural death in isolation has been followed by a slow combustion from some nearby source of ignition." He further suggested that reports of people suddenly aflame should be called "Unsolved deaths by fire," stating that the cause being unknown did not necessarily imply that it had not resulted from an external ignition source.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4258|title=Spontaneous Human Combustion: People can catch on fire... but can it really happen when there is no external source of ignition? |author=Brian Dunning |publisher=Skeptoid: Critical Analysis of Pop Phenomena|date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011[/tpl]

==Notable examples==

Henry Thomas, a 73-year-old man, was found burned to death in the living room of his council house on the Rassau council estate in Ebbw Vale, south Wales, in 1980. His entire body was incinerated, leaving only his skull and a portion of each leg below the knee. The feet and legs were still clothed in socks and trousers. Half of the chair in which he had been sitting was also destroyed. Police forensic officers decided that the incineration of Thomas was due to the wick effect. His death was ruled 'death by burning', as he had plainly inhaled the contents of his own combustion.Heymer, John E (1996): 'The Entrancing Flame'; London; Little, Brown; ISBN 0-316-87694-1
In December 2010, the death of Michael Faherty in County Galway, Ireland, was recorded as "spontaneous combustion" by the coroner. The doctor, Ciaran McLoughlin, made this statement at the inquiry into the death: "This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation."[tpl]cite web|last=Ensor |first=Josie |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/8783929/Irish-pensioner-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion.html |title=Irish pensioner 'died of spontaneous human combustion' |publisher=Telegraph |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]
