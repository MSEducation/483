===2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil===

====Qualification====

On 4 April 2011, former Real Madrid manager Carlos Queiroz agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach the Iranian national team until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[tpl]cite news | last = Soccernet | first = Goal | title = Carlos Queiroz agrees deal to become Iran head coach | work = Sport | publisher = Soccernet | date = 4 April 2011 | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/902584/carlos-queiroz-agrees-deal-to-become-iran-coach?cc=5901 | accessdate = 4 April 2011 | location=Dubai[/tpl] Iran, under Queiroz, began their World Cup qualification campaign successfully, defeating the Maldives 4–0 in the first leg of their second round of qualifiers. After winning 5–0 on aggregate, Iran advanced to the third round of qualifiers, where they were drawn with Indonesia, Qatar and Bahrain. Iran highlighted their position at the top of their group by defeating Bahrain 6–0 at home in the Azadi Stadium, as well as inviting former German youth international, Ashkan Dejagah, who scored twice on his debut against Qatar. After a 4-1 win at Indonesia, Iran qualified for the final round of direct qualifiers, the fourth round. In the fourth round, Iran was drawn with South Korea, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Lebanon in their group. Queiroz made new foreign-based additions to his squad, adding players such as Reza Ghoochannejhad to his team. Iran started their fourth round of Asian qualifiers with a 1-0 win in Uzbekistan. Team Melli then drew Qatar and lost in Lebanon before defeating South Korea at the Azadi on 16 October with a goal from captain Javad Nekounam.

In their last qualification match, Iran defeated South Korea 1-0 in Ulsan Munsu with a goal from European-based Ghoochannejhad, resulting in their qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup as group winners with 16 points. Thus, Iran became the third team that Queiroz has managed to qualify for the World Cup, having reached the 2002 edition with South Africa and the 2010 edition with Portugal, leading the latter to a knockout stage finish. Iran continued their winning streak, securing qualification to the 2015 Asian Cup just months later as well.

====Foreign-based call-ups====

==Political protests==

===Bahrain-Iran, 21 October 2001===

The 3–1 defeat by Bahrain came as a surprise. This in turn brought upon Iran's failure to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. There were allegations that the authorities pressured the players to lose. It was later denied by Safaei. Nevertheless, up to this day, many fans of 'Team Melli' continue to speculate whether the defeat was of legitimate causes or whether some authorities behind the curtain had brought on the defeat on purpose in order to prevent celebrations in the streets.Kayhan, p14, No.881, 7 November 2001

===Presidential election protests, 2009===

During the final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against South Korea in Seoul on 17 June 2009, seven members of the team, Javad Nekounam, Ali Karimi, Hossein Kaebi, Masoud Shojaei, Mohammad Nosrati, Vahid Hashemian, and captain Mehdi Mahdavikia wore green wristbands in support of the Iranian Green Movement during the 2009 Iranian election protests. Initial reports were that all seven players were banned for life by the Iranian Football Federation, however, state-run media claimed that all seven had "retired".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2009/06/24/2009-06-24_iran_soccer_players_banned.html |title=Iran soccer players banned from national team after wearing green pro-opposition wristbands |first = Andy | last = Clayton |date=24 June 2009 |publisher=NY Daily News |accessdate=8 July 2010 |location=New York[/tpl] On 24 June 2009, FIFA wrote to Iran's Football Federation asking for clarification on the situation.

==Nicknames==

The Iranian national team has received several nicknames by supporters and media. The most common one used to refer the team is "Team Melli", which literally means "The National Team". Iranians call any national team from any country or sport a "Team Melli" and because of this it has become common for the national team to be referred to as the "Team Melli Iran" or, more specifically in the case of the national football team, the "Team Melli e Football e Iran". Although the Iranian supporters have popularized "Team Melli", other nicknames for the team include "Persian Stars"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/45657/uae-vs-iran/report |title=UAE 0-3 Iran: Team Melli Cruise Into Quarter-Finals |publisher=Goal.com|date= |accessdate=21 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/57314/iran-vs-russia/report? |title=Iran 1-0 Russia: Khalatbari Strike Sinks The Sbornaya |publisher=Goal.com |date= |accessdate=21 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ufwc.co.uk/2012/09/iran-vs-north-korea-prepare-for-the-ufwc-megaclash/ |title=Iran vs North Korea: prepare for the UFWC ‘megaclash’|publisher=UFWC|date=23 Sep 2012|accessdate=21 October 2013[/tpl] (entitled since the World Cup 2006) "Shiran e Iran",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.khabarsport.com/detail/3527/ |title= Elephants surrounded by the lions of Iran (in Persian) |publisher=khabarsport.com |date= 15 October 2013|accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.varzesh11.com/fa/soccer_news_centre/news/تمجید_سایت_AFC_از_رحمان_احمدی_دروازه_بان_شیران_ایران/2426 |title= The AFC website hailed Rahman Ahmadi the goalkeeper of Iranian lions (in Persian) |publisher=Varzesh11 |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl] meaning "The Iranian Lions" or "The Lions of Persia",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/06/sports-the-lions-of-persia.html |title= The Lions of Persia |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) |date= 12 Jun 2012|accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl] "Shirdelan", "Lion Hearts" and "Princes of Persia"[tpl]cite web | url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story/_/id/861355/john-duerden:-asian-cup-history?cc=5901| title=Traditional powers eye return to glory (Princes of Persia become Kings of Asia) |publisher=ESPN |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1389/10/9/MainPaper/3858/Page/11/MainPaper_3858_11.pdf |title=Princes of Persia Rout Qatar Army |format=PDF |publisher=Iran-daily| accessdate=December 30, 2010| accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl] (used since AFC Asian Cup 2011)[tpl]cite web | url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/157612.html |title=Princes of Persia' to begin 2011 event |publisher=Press TV | accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-534561 |title=What a despicable slogan for Iranian soccer team |publisher=CNN iReport| accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl] have been used in media as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.evi.com/q/facts_about__iran_national_football_team |title=Iran national football team |publisher=Goal.com |date= |accessdate=21 October 2013[/tpl]
