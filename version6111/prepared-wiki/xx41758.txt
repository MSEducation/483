Harvey began her career in 1988 when she joined local band Automatic Dlamini as a vocalist, guitarist, and saxophone player. The band's frontman, John Parish, would become her long-term collaborator.[tpl]cite web|title=Bio | PJ Harvey | Artists|url=http://www.islanddefjam.com/artist/bio.aspx?artistID=7333|publisher=Island Def Jam|accessdate=3 September 2011[/tpl] In 1991, she formed an eponymous trio and subsequently began her professional career. The trio released two studio albums, Dry (1992) and Rid of Me (1993) before disbanding, after which Harvey continued as a solo artist. Since 1995, she has released a further six studio albums with collaborations from various musicians including John Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick Harvey, and Eric Drew Feldman and has also worked extensively with record producer Flood.
Among the accolades she has received are the 2001 and 2011 Mercury Prize for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000)[tpl]cite news|title=Music | PJ Harvey wins Mercury Prize|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1538877.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=11 September 2001|accessdate=3 September 2011[/tpl] and Let England Shake (2011)[tpl]cite news|title=PJ Harvey wins Mercury Music Prize for the second time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14815129|publisher=BBC News|date=6 September 2011|accessdate=6 September 2011[/tpl] respectively—the only artist to have been awarded the prize twice—eight BRIT Award nominations, six Grammy Award nominations and two further Mercury Prize nominations.

==Early life==

Harvey was born in Bridport, Dorset, on 9 October 1969 as the second child to Ray and Eva Harvey,[tpl]cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Robin|last2=Harvey|first2=Eva|year=2010|title=Cover Story: Robin Hills Meets Eva Harvey in Corscombe|journal=The Marshwood Vale Magazine|issue=June 2010|page=3|url=http://www.marshwoodvale.com/images/archive/MVM135/index.html|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] who owned a stone quarrying business, and grew up on the family's farm in Corscombe.[tpl]cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.jphuntley.co.uk/pjh/FullPages/fullbiography.htm|work=pollyharvey.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2007[/tpl] During her childhood, she attended school in nearby Beaminster and her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues music, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan.
As a teenager, Harvey began learning saxophone and joined an eight-piece instrumental group Bologne, based in Dorset. She was also a guitarist with folk duo The Polekats, with whom she wrote some of her earliest material. After finishing school, Harvey attended Yeovil College and studied a visual arts foundation course.Harvey, PJ. "I always painted and have always drawn. I initially came from the visual arts background before I even began music." Extract from a transcription of an interview with Miranda Sawyer on The Culture Show.

==Music career==

===Automatic Dlamini: 1988–1991===

In July 1988, Harvey became a member of Automatic Dlamini, a band based in Bristol with whom she gained extensive ensemble-playing experience. Formed by John Parish in 1983, the band consisted of a rotating line-up that at various times included Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver,.[tpl]cite book |author= Ronald D. Lankford |title=Women singer-songwriters in rock: a populist rebellion in the 1990s |year=2009 |page=44 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-7268-4[/tpl] Harvey had met Parish in 1987 through a mutual friend—Jeremy Hogg, the band's slide guitarist.[tpl]cite web|title=John Parish|url=http://www.johnparish.com/biography.html|work=johnparish.com|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] Providing saxophone, guitars and background vocals, she travelled extensively during the band's early days, including performances in West Germany, Spain and Poland[tpl]cite web|title=Automatic Dlamini|url=http://www.groov.ie/pjh/adlamini.htm|work=groov.ie|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] to support the band's debut studio album, The D is for Drum. A second European tour took place throughout June and July 1989. Following the tour, the band recorded Here Catch, Shouted His Father, their second studio album, between late 1989 and early 1990. This is the only Automatic Dlamini material to feature Harvey and remains unreleased; however, bootleg versions of the album are circulating. In January 1991, Harvey left the band to form her own band with former bandmates Ellis and Oliver; yet she had formed lasting personal and professional relationships with certain members, especially Parish, whom she has referred to as her "musical soulmate."[tpl]cite web|title=The Quietus | Features | Three Songs No Flash | Polly Harvey, Patriotism & Protest: Let England Shake, Live in Berlin|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05751-pj-harvey-live-review-berlin|work=The Quietus|author=Stephen Dalton|date=24 February 2011|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] Parish would subsequently contribute to, and sometimes co-produce, Harvey's solo studio albums and tour with her a number of times. As a duo, Parish and Harvey have recorded two collaborative albums where Parish composed the music and Harvey penned the lyrics.[tpl]cite AV media notes|title=A Woman a Man Walked By|titlelink=A Woman a Man Walked By|others=John Paris and Polly Jean Harvey|year=2009|chapter=Words written & sung by PJ Harvey, Music written & played by John Parish|author=John Parish|pages=4–5|type=CD|publisher=Island Records|id=0252700699|location=Dorset, United Kingdom[/tpl] Additionally, Parish's girlfriend in the late 1980s was photographer Maria Mochnacz. She and Harvey became close friends and Mochnacz went on to shoot and design most of Harvey's album artwork and music videos, contributing significantly to her public image.
Harvey said of her time with Automatic Dlamini: "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy to learn how to play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was listening to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people,"[tpl]cite journal|last1=Arundel|first1=Jim|year=1992|title=P. J. Harvey: Sex and Bile and Rock and Roll|journal=Melody Maker|issue=8 February 1992[/tpl] and she also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things."

===PJ Harvey Trio: 1991–1993===

In January 1991, following her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided to name the trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound"Harvey, PJ. "We were playing around with other names but nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound or just wasn't right. And I also felt I am the songwriter in the band and I know that I'm going to be wanting to write songs and continue making music for quite a while but I can't guarantee that Rob and Steve will want to." Extracts from a transcription of an interview with PJ Harvey on 120 Minutes. Broadcast on MTV on 20 June 1993. and also to allow her to continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's "disastrous" debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'"[tpl]cite web|title=A Minimalist Effort From Rocker PJ Harvey: NPR|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4112178|work=NPR|author=Linda Wertheimer|date=16 October 2004|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl]N.B.

The band relocated to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, still undecided as to her future career. During this time, the band recorded a set of demo recordings and distributed them to record labels. Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band's debut single "Dress" in October 1991 and later signed PJ Harvey. "Dress" received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired "the way Polly Jean seems crushed by the weight of her own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being sucked out of them ... admirable if not always enjoyable."[tpl]cite journal|journal=Melody Maker|volume=February 1992|year=1992|last=Peel|first=John|title=Really the Blues|page=52|accessdate=24 January 2012[/tpl] However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that "Melody Maker had more to do with the success of the "Dress" single than Too Pure Records."[tpl]cite book|title=The Wire, Volumes 281–286|last=Parker|first=C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, United States|isbn= |page=218|page=300|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] A week after its release, the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October and recorded "Oh, My Lover," "Victory," "Sheela-Na-Gig," and "Water."[tpl]cite web|title=BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 29/10/1991 PJ Harvey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1991/Oct29pjharvey/|work=BBC Radio 1|date=October 2005|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl]
The following February, the trio released "Sheela-Na-Gig" as their equally-acclaimed second single and their debut studio album, Dry (1992), followed in March. Like the singles preceding it, Dry received an overwhelming international critical response. The album was cited by Kurt Cobain of Nirvana as his sixteenth favourite album ever in his posthumously-published Journals.[tpl]cite book|title=Journals|last=Cobain|first=Kurt|authorlink=Kurt Cobain|year=2008|publisher=Riverhead|isbn=978-1-57322-232-7|page=260|accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl] Rolling Stone also named Harvey as Songwriter of the Year[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey – Artists – Island Records|url=http://www.islandrecords.co.uk/group_artists.php?id=33#|work=Island Records|accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl] N.B.

A limited edition double LP version of Dry was released alongside the regular version of the album, containing both the original and demo versions of each track, called Dry Demonstration, and the band also received significant coverage at the Reading Festival in 1992.[tpl]cite web|title=1992 – History – Reading Festival 2011|url=http://www.readingfestival.com/2011/history/1992|work=Reading Festival|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl]
Island Records signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992 and in December 1992, the trio travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States to record the follow-up to Dry with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited," and two new songs "Me Jane" and "Ecstasy."[tpl]cite web|title=BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 22/09/1992 PJ Harvey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1992/Sep22pjharvey/|work=BBC Radio 1|date=October 2005|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut Rid of Me in May 1993. Rolling Stone wrote that it "is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song."[tpl]cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums: Rid of Me – PJ Harvey | Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/rid-of-me-pj-harvey-19691231|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl] The album was promoted by two singles, "50ft Queenie" and "Man-Size." To promote the release of the album, the band began touring in the United Kingdom in May and then in the United States in June, continuing there during the summer. However, during the American leg of the tour, internal friction started to form between the members of the trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed "an ever widening personal gulf" between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying "It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people."[tpl]cite news|last1=Frost|first1=Deborah|title=Primed and Ticking: PJ Harvey beat the sophomore jinx and get their mojo workin' with an American tour and a powerful new album, Rid of Me|newspaper=Rolling Stone|issue=663|date=19 August 1993|pages=52–55[/tpl] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993).[tpl]cite web|title=Reeling With PJ Harvey 1993 VHS: PJ Harvey: Amazon.co.uk: Video|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reeling-PJ-Harvey-VHS/dp/B000007UD2|work=Amazon|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of "Rid of Me." As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.

===Solo career: 1993–present===

====To Bring You My Love and Is This Desire?: 1993–1999====

As Harvey embarked on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995, she released her third studio album, To Bring You My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty; all of whom would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood.[tpl]cite web|title=Flood | AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/flood-p74793/credits/date-asc/100|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] Both a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, To Bring You My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers.[tpl]cite AV media notes|title=To Bring You My Love|titlelink=To Bring You My Love|others=PJ Harvey|year=1995|pages=4–6|type=CD|publisher=Island Records|id=LC 0407[/tpl] Rolling Stone said in its review that "Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. Bring You My Love was a towering goth version of grunge."[tpl]cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums: To Bring You My Love – PJ Harvey | Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/to-bring-you-my-love-pj-harvey-19691231|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl] The record generated a surprise modern rock radio hit in the United States with its lead single, "Down by the Water."[tpl]cite journal|last1=Aaron|first1=Charles|title=Artist of the Year: PJ Harvey|journal=Spin|issue=1 January 1996|pages=58–60|date=1 January 1996|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] Three consecutive singles—"C'mon Billy", "Send His Love to Me" and "Long Snake Moan"—were also moderately successful. During the successive tours for the album, Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona. The album was a commercial success selling one million copies worldwide[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=3308|title=Queen of the Night: P.J. Harvey.

In 1996, following the international success of To Bring You My Love and other collaborations, Harvey began composing material that would end up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as "an incredibly low patch."[tpl]cite web|last1=Irvin|first1=Jim|title=To Bring You Desire|work=rollingstone.com|date=21 August 1998|accessdate=2009|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pjharvey/articles/story/5920732/to_bring_you_desire|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080602160225/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pjharvey/articles/story/5920732/to_bring_you_desire|archivedate=2 June 2008[/tpl] The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song-writing. During recording sessions in 1997, original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in Is This Desire? (1998). Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998, the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance.[tpl]cite web|title=41st Annual Grammy® Awards Nominations Coverage (1999) | DigitalHit.com|url=http://www.digitalhit.com/grammy/41/nominees.shtml|work=DigitalHit|year=1998|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] The album's lead single, "A Perfect Day Elise," was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart,[tpl]cite web|title=PJ HARVEY | Artist | Official Charts|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/pj%20harvey/#singles|work=UK Singles Chart|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] her most successful single to date.

====Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea and Uh Huh Her: 2000–2006====

In early 2000, Harvey began work on her fifth studio album, Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed on themes of love that tied into Harvey's affection for New York City.[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey: Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea | Music Review | Slant Magazine|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/pj-harvey-stories-from-the-city-stories-from-the-sea/82|work=Slant Magazine|author=Sal Cinquemani|date=20 January 2001|accessdate=21 March 2010[/tpl] The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks and performed lead vocals on "This Mess We're in." Upon its release in October 2000, the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charted in both the United Kingdom[tpl]cite web|title=PJ HARVEY | Artist | Official Charts|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/pj%20harvey/#albums|work=UK Albums Chart|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] and the United States.[tpl]cite web|title=Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea - PJ Harvey | Billboard.com|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=pj harvey|chart=all[/tpl]|work=Billboard|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The album's three singles—"Good Fortune," "A Place Called Home," and "This is Love"— were moderately successful. The album also received a number of accolades including a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album's third single, "This Is Love." However, most notably, Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Music Prize.[tpl]cite web|title=2001 Shortlist – Barclaycard Mercury Music Prize|url=http://www.mercuryprize.com/aoty/shortlist.php?Year=2001|work=Mercury Music Prize|year=2001|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The awards ceremony was held on the same day as the 11 September attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: "quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day—it didn't have much importance in the grand scheme of things" and noted "it was a very surreal day."[tpl]cite news|title=BBC News – Mercury favourite PJ Harvey reflects on her 2001 win|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14312888|work=BBC News|author=Kev Geoghegan|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The same year, Harvey also topped a readers' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music.
During three years of various collaborations with other artists, Harvey was also working on her sixth studio album, Uh Huh Her, which was released in May 2004. For the first time since 4-Track Demos (1993), Harvey played every instrument—with the exception drums provided by Rob Ellis—and was the sole producer.[tpl]cite web|title=Uh Huh Her – PJ Harvey | AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/uh-huh-her-r692552/credits|publisher=Allmusic|year=2004|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The album received "generally favourable reviews"[tpl]cite web|title=Uh Huh Her Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/uh-huh-her|work=Metacritic|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] by critics, though its production was often criticised.

In November, she began recording her seventh studio album, White Chalk, with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked a radical departure from her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Stubbs |first1=D.|year=2007|title=Return of the Native|journal=The Wire|volume=283|issue=September 2007|page=34[/tpl] The album received favourable reviews,[tpl]cite web|title=White Chalk Reviews, Ratings, Credit and More at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/white-chalk|work=Metacritic|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] its style being described by one critic as containing "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds."[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey: White Chalk – Music Review – No Ripcord|url=http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/music/pj-harvey/white-chalk|work=No Ripcord|author=Craig Thompson|date=25 October 2007|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] Harvey herself said of the album: "when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future.

Harvey has also recorded two studio albums with long-time collaborator John Parish. Dance Hall at Louse Point (1996) was written collectively with Parish with the exception of the song "Is That All There Is?", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The album also listed her as Polly Jean Harvey, which in part affected the album's sales. Harvey has also reflected on how the album was "an enormous turning point" and "lyrically, it moved me into areas I'd never been to before."[tpl]cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=PJ|year=2001|title=Harvey's Happy to Be an Outsider|journal=Chicago Sun-Times|issue=10 May 2001|page=49|accessdate=4 December 2012[/tpl] In 1998, she also performed lead vocals on "Airplane Blues," as a soundtrack accompaniment to the Wingwalkers art exhibition by Rebecca Goddard and Parish's wife, Michelle Henning.

Aside from collaborations, Harvey has also embarked on a number of projects as a composer. In January 2009, a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler opened on Broadway. Directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mary-Louise Parker in the title role, the play featured an original score of incidental music written by Harvey.[tpl]cite news|title=P.J.

==Non-musical endeavours==

Outside her better-known music career, Harvey is also an occasional artist and actress. In 1998, she appeared in Hal Hartley's film The Book of Life[tpl]cite web|title=IMDb – The Book of Life (1998)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167059/|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] as Magdalena—a modern-day character based on the Biblical Mary Magdalene— and had a cameo role as a Playboy Bunny in A Bunny Girl's Tale, a short film directed by Sarah Miles, in which she also performs "Nina in Ecstasy,"[tpl]cite web|title=The Unsolved Murder of Bunny Eve, Part 2: notes on serial killers, by Sarah Miles | APEngine|url=http://www.apengine.org/2009/12/the-unsolved-murder-of-bunny-eve-part-2-notes-on-serial-killers-by-sarah-miles/|work=APEngine|date=8 December 2009|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] an outtake from Is This Desire? (1998). Harvey also collaborated with Miles on another film, Amaeru Fallout 1972, which includes Harvey performing a cover of "When Will I See You Again." Harvey is also an accomplished sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre. In 2010, she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola's literary magazine Zoetrope: All-Story.[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey to Guest Design Francis Ford Coppola's Magazine All-Story | News | Pitchfork|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/38599-pj-harvey-to-guest-design-francis-ford-coppolas-magazine-all-story/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media|author=Ryan Dombal|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The issue featured Harvey's paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen. Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011, Harvey said: "the first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine.

==Musical style and influences==

Harvey has been noted to dislike repeating herself in her music, resulting in very different-sounding albums. In an interview with Rolling Stone in October 2004, she said: "when I'm working on a new record, the most important thing is to not repeat myself ... that's always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself. Because I'm in this for learning."[tpl]cite web|last1=Orloff |first1=Brian|title=PJ Harvey Talks Tour|work=rollingstone.com|date=5 October 2004|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pj-harvey-talks-tour-20041005[/tpl] Among the musical genres she has experimented with are alternative rock, pop, electronica, and, most recently, folk. She is also known for changing her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to all aspects of the album, from the album art to the live performances.[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey: I work so hard | Musicrooms.net|url=http://www.musicrooms.net/alternative/27582-pj-harvey-i-work-so-hard.html|work=Music Rooms|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up.[tpl]cite journal|last=Berger|first=Dorian|year=1998|title=Lipstick Traces|journal=Dazed & Confused|issue=August 1998|url=http://www.pjharvey.net/review-pop.asp?id=375|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl] She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone.[tpl]cite book|title=PJ Harvey: Siren Rising|last=Blandford|first=James R.|year=2004|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=1-84449-433-0|pages=55–57, 62|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl] She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed "Joan Crawford on acid" in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.
At an early age, she was introduced by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children."[tpl]cite book|title=Trouble Girls: The Rolling Stone Book of Women in Rock|last1=Harvey|first1=|last2=O'Dair|first2=Barbara|year=1997|publisher=Random House|location=New York, United States|isbn=978-0-679-76874-6|pages=544, 575|accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet though later stated that it was phase when she was "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection."[tpl]cite web|title=PJ Harvey – Mookychick|url=http://www.mookychick.co.uk/opinion/interviews/pj_harvey.php|work=Mookychick|author=Esther Haynes|date=November 2000|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint, though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as "lazy journalism."[tpl]cite web|title=10 Things You Never Knew About PJ Harvey | Clash Music Exclusive General|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/10-things-you-never-knew-about-pj-harvey|work=Clash|author=Ellie Bothwell|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing"Harvey, PJ.
