"Dégénération" (English: "Degeneration") is a 2008 song by French singer-songwriter Mylène Farmer. It was the first single from her seventh studio album Point de Suture, and was released first digitally and on radio in June 2008, then in a CD in August 2008. The song marked an important musical change in the singer's career. Despite cold critical and public reception, the single achieved success, peaking at number one in France on both physical and digital sales charts.

==Background and release==

On 21 May, Thierry Suc, one of Farmer's producers, announced that the first single from the album would be "Dégénération"[tpl]cite web |title=Une "Dégénération" signée Mylène Farmer |url=http://www.musiqueradio.com/article_news5980_une-degeneration-signee-mylene-farmer.php |publisher=Musique Radio |language=French |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2008[/tpl] and that it would be released on radio on 19 June 2008.[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer revient le 19 juin avec "Dégénération" |journal=Ouest France |date=21 May 2008 |language=French[/tpl] On 7 June 2008, a 30-second music clip was leaked to the Internet[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer : découvrez les 30 premières secondes de "Dégénération", son nouveau titre |url=http://www.news-de-stars.com/actualite/mylene-farmer-decouvrez-les-30-premieres-secondes-de-degeneration-son-nouveau-titre_art4479.html |publisher=News de Stars |language=French |accessdate=16 June 2008[/tpl] as well as the official cover art.[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer : visuel de "Dégénération" |url=http://www.musiqueradio.com/article_news6092_en-bref--mylene-farmer--visuel-de-degeneration.php |publisher=Musique Radio |date=9 June 2008 |language=French |accessdate=16 June 2008[/tpl] On 14 June, the whole song was available to the Internet. At the time, as the origins of this song were, however, unclear, it had thus led many to believe that this leaked song was actually a remix due to its lack of lyrics.
Surprisingly, on the night from 13 to 14 June, the e-compil site, the official platform for downloading of Universal Music, proposed, for a few hours only, to legally download the song, probably by mistake.Khairallah, 2007, pp. 149-50. On 16 June, "Dégénération" was aired for the first time on Radio Jeune Reims, at 8:20 pm, although it was announced that NRJ should have the exclusivity of the first broadcast, on 19 June, at 7:00 am.[tpl]cite web |title=Farmer: Extrait de "Dégénération" et pochette |url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Mylene-Farmer/news-66406.html |publisher=Chartsinfrance |first=Thierry |last=Cadet |date=7 June 2008 |language=French |accessdate=16 June 2008[/tpl] According to the French newspaper Le Parisien, the DJ Martin Solveig participated in one of the song remixes.[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer remixée |url=http://mylene.net/img_data/leparisien_17062008%2802%29.jpg |journal=Le Parisien |date=17 June 2008 |language=French |accessdate=18 June 2008[/tpl] As scheduled, on 19 June, several radio stations broadcast "Dégénération", including NRJ, Delta FM and RTL. The song was then also available digitally on musicMe, virginmega.fr and iTunes, but only one version. A few days later, an unofficial CDR promo (unknown remix) of "Dégénération" was circulated and received attention from high profile DJs. Finally, it was announced that the song would be released as a physical single on 18 August. On 4 July, certain French radio stations began to broadcast the radio edit version of the remix produced by Martin Solveig.
On the occasion of the single release, Farmer formed for the first time a partnership with a mobile phone company. So, the SFR subscribers received two SMS announcing first when the song would be available digitally on its site, then when the three excerpts of the music video would be broadcast on its site.Khairallah, 2007, p. 50. On 11 July, the newspaper Info Music Hebdo said that the CD single would be released in a limited edition (50,000 copies) and that the CD maxi would contain remixes by Tomer G and Manhattan Clique who had previously worked with Farmer for "Slipping Away (Crier la vie)". In early September, TF1 promoted the song airing some excerpts between the programmes and the fully music video in the night.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

==Lyrics, music and title==

The song has an electro[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer : "Dégénération" dérange ! |url=http://www.evous.fr/musique/Mylene-Farmer-Degeneration-derange,4242.html |publisher=Musique.evous |language=French |accessdate=20 June 2008[/tpl] and techno-sexy feel and the lyrics play with sonorities, including alliterations.Royer, 2008, p. 195. The only natural instruments audible in the song are piano and percussion; all others are effects. According to Discordance.fr, "Dégénération" is "an unstructured song, not a summer hit with an easy approach", and its music is "hypnotic".[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer - "Dégénération" |url=http://www.discordance.fr/Mylene-Farmer-Degeneration.html |publisher=Discordance |first=Arno |last=Mothra |date=11 July 2008 |language=French |accessdate=21 July 2008[/tpl]  It can be assimilated to "Psychiatric", "La Ronde triste" or "Alice"Chuberre, 2009, p. 223. because of "its short text and its rather dub". The song "amounts to a couplet repeated in buckle, a spoken bridge, and many choirs". The text "remains partially incomprehensible without reading official lyrics". The electronic sound has a "more metallic rhythmic" than Farmer's previous singles and constitutes "a remarkable artistic experiment". Psychologist Hugues Royer said that the message of the song is to "shake the boredom to find again the desire", to "promote sex therapy" to "reset the appetite for life".Royer, 2008, p. 258.
Interviewed by Claire Chazal in the news broadcasting of 31 August, 8:00 pm, on TF1, Farmer explained that the title of the song was a reference to "Désenchantée", her 1991 number-one hit, in which the word "génération" is mentioned.* [tpl]cite web |title=News broadcasting |date=31 August 2008 |url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/jt/0,,4061945,00-mylene-farmer-invitee-du-20h-je-suis-quelqu-un-du-secret-.html |publisher=TF1 LCI |language=French |accessdate=1 September 2008[/tpl]  * [tpl]cite web |title=Vidéo : Mylène Farmer au 20h |url=http://people.plurielles.fr/news-people/video-mylene-farmer-au-20h-4062208-402.html |publisher=People Plurielles |date=1 September 2008 |language=French |accessdate=4 September 2008[/tpl] On the cover of the various formats, Farmer is shown naked from the back. She has a green jade prayer beads around the neck that goes from the back to the buttocksChuberre, 2009, p. 219. and ends with a G-string-shaped crossChuberre, 2008, pp. 292-93. and has in her back an enormous scar whose threads form the letters IY'H which mean in Hebrew : "With God's will".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène à la peine |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/lepoint_04092008.jpg |journal=Le Point |first=Michel |last=Augier |date=4 September 2008 |language=French |accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl] Farmer's position on the cover resembles the subject of Man Ray's 1924 painting Le Violon d'Ingres, as well as that on the cover of her single "L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...".Chuberre, 2009, p. 220.[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer "Dégénération" - Histoire du single et News |url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/d_s_degeneration_histoire.php |publisher=Mylene.net |language=French |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]Chuberre, 2011, pp. 104,105.

==Music video==

The music video was shot over two days (9 and 10 June) in Prague, Czech Republic. Polydor[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer : Universal dévoile enfin l'envers du décor! |url=http://www.evous.fr/musique/Mylene-Farmer-Universal-devoile,4371.html |publisher=Musique.evous |language=French |accessdate=2 July 2008[/tpl] and French magazine Paris-Match announced that Bruno Aveillan, a director who has directed several television commercials for companies such as Perrier, Louis Vuitton, Orange, Nintendo, Nike and Philips, directed this 4:30 music video. About thirty actors as well as the dancers of Cave Canem troupe feature in it. According to Aveillan, extras perform "a resolutely modern choreography, full of unexpected." In addition, a Phantom camera, ordinarily devoted to the scientific research, was used for the shooting. Patricia Aveillan, Bruno Aveillan's mother, made the dress worn by Farmer in the video and explained in an interview that she was informed just ten days before the shooting. Her daughter and her son-in-law also participated in the shooting.[tpl]cite journal |title=Les costumes de Mylène Farmer viennent de Perpignan! |url=http://www.lindependant.com/articles/2008/08/03/20080803-FAITS-DU-JOUR-Les-costumes-de-Mylene-Farmer-viennent-de-Perpignan.php5 |journal=L'Indépendant |first=L. |last=C.-C. |date=3 August 2008 |language=French |accessdate=6 August 2008[/tpl] The photographer Claude Gassian attended the shooting of the video.Royer, 2008, pp. 91-92.
The video shows Farmer lying on an operating table in a laboratory, surrounded by scientists. When the music begins, she wakes up, unties her strips, gets up, and throws blue laser beams from her palms to the doctors and the militaries. Suddenly, they begin to perform choreographied sexual intercourses (men with men, women with women, women with men) which eventually end as an orgy, while Farmer goes out of the laboratory.[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer comme vous ne l'avez jamais vue |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/parismatch_03072008%2803%29.jpg |journal=Paris-Match |first=Jérôme |last=Béglé |date=3 July 2008 |language=French |accessdate=3 July 2008[/tpl]Chuberre, 2009, p. 221.
On 26 June, SFR site revealed an excerpt from the music video for "Dégénération". Two other excerpts were broadcast on 1 and 2 July. The video was eventually fully aired on television on 10 July[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer, le mystère continue |url=http://musique.sfr.fr/Varietes+Fran%E7aises/Portrait/MYLENE-FARMER-artist-1147#lien_video |publisher=Musique SFR |language=French |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and immediately available on several official websites such as TF1.fr, Music SFR and universalmusic.fr. In Russia, "MTV Russia" channel aired regularly the music video.[tpl]cite web |title=НОВЫЙ АЛЬБОМ МИЛЕН ФАРМЕР |url=http://www.universalmusic.ru/ru/artists/213/news/918/ |publisher=Universal Music |date=26 August 2008 |language=Russian |accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl]
This video was generally well received in the media. For example, Musique.evous said: "Its atmosphere is consistent with the single and the universe of its performer: cold, careful and erotic. (...) The production is impeccable and the greatest attention was paid to lighting, the texture of the bodies and the special effects".[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer: Premiers avis sur le clip "Dégénération" |url=http://www.evous.fr/musique/Mylene-Farmer-avis-clip,4488.html |publisher=Musique.evous |language=French |accessdate=13 July 2008[/tpl] Many critics have noticed that the video was "erotic" and "provocative", and some have thought it was inspired by Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element (futuristic atmosphere, red hair, body covered with strips)[tpl]cite web |title=Découvrez "Dégénération", le dernier clip de Mylène Farmer! |url=http://www.actustar.com/Actualites/23488/decouvrez-degeneration-le-dernier-clip-de-mylene-farmer |publisher=Actustar |date=11 June 2008 |language=French |accessdate=13 July 2008[/tpl] or Le Parfum.Chuberre, 2009, p. 222. According to La Meuse, gay scenes - including two soldiers who kiss and undress each otherRoyer, 2008, p. 292. - would be "a wink to the fascination that Farmer has always exerted on the gay public".[tpl]cite journal |title=Du génie ou du toc?

(...) The singer achieves the challenge of updating of the message of "Libertine" without giving the feeling of repetition."Royer, 2008, pp. 101-02.
In January 2009, when the third single from the album was released, it was revealad that the music video for "Dégénération" as well as that of "Si j'avais au moins...", were part of a short film named The Farmer Project. The action takes place in a country in Eastern Europe in the 1950s or 1960s. It begins with Farmer, who portrays a creature with supernatural powers, who is captured by two policemen and studied in a laboratory. At this point, the music video for "Dégénération" starts.Royer, 2008, pp. 334-35.

==Critical reception==

===Reviews===

"Dégénération" received generally negative reviews from the media and the public. Indeed, many Farmer's fans have criticized the lack of lyrics, and the radio stations have not taken to the song. On 29 July, Yahoo! proposed on its homepage a very critical analysis of "Dégénération", both at the level of music and video.[tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer: héroïne de clip |url=http://new.fr.music.yahoo.com/blogs/voxpop/55/mylne-farmerhrone-de-clip |publisher=Yahoo! |date=29 July 2008 |language=French |accessdate=1 August 2008[/tpl] Tribu Move deemed that this song marked a big musical change in the singer's career.[tpl]cite journal |title=Coup de cœur - Mylène Farmer - "Dégénération" |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/mylenefarmer_presse_tribumove_aout2008.jpg |journal=Tribu Move |publisher=Mylene.net |date=August 2008 |language=French |accessdate=16 August 2008[/tpl] On 18 August, French magazine Télé Star qualified "Dégénération" as a "failure", "a repetitive single without refrain, which has left perplexed fans of the first hour as well as professional people". It also stressed that the song was "poorly aired on radio due to overall negative feedbacks from listeners".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer, un retour sans éclat |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/telestar_18082008_01.jpg |journal=Télé Star |first=Jean-Rémy |last=Gaudin-Bridet |publisher=Mylene.net |date=18 August 2008 |language=French |accessdate=17 August 2008[/tpl] According to Le Monde, "Dégénération" is characterized by "rather minimalist arrangements and a curtness tone".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer signe son retour avec un album sans surprise |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/08/27/mylene-farmer-signe-son-retour-avec-un-album-sans-surprise_1088469_3246.html |journal=Le Monde |first=Sylvain |last=Siclier |date=28 August 2008 |language=French |accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl] For Le Figaro, it is a "very commercial single", with a "powerful rhythmic", a "very forward voice", and "imperturbably 'farmerian' lyrics".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer, un album massif et discret |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/lefigaro_21082008.jpg |journal=Le Figaro |first=Bertrand |last=Dicale |date=21 August 2008 |language=French |accessdate=21 August 2008[/tpl] Starac Mag deemed the song is "less melodious than Farmer's previous titles, but equally effective".[tpl]cite journal |title=Dégénération |url=http://www.devant-soi.com/Monde-de-Myl%E8ne/presse/articles-presse/2008/09/09-2008-staracmag.jpg |journal=Starac Mag |publisher=Devant-soi |date=September 2008 |language=French |accessdate=15 September 2008[/tpl] As for Le Point, "Dégénération" is "a repetitive electro pop song with naive lyrics full of muddled and mystic double meanings". More positive, Swiss newspaper Coopération stated: "Make love, not the war: such is the message of this electro-pop hit which eyes up Depeche Mode".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/cooperation_02092008.jpg |journal=Coopération |publisher=Mylene.net |date=2 September 2008 |language=French |accessdate=4 September 2008[/tpl]

However, on 30 August, when the physical formats were released, "Dégénération" jumped directly from number 33 to number one, thus becoming Farmer's third number-one hit in Belgium. It dropped rather quickly the next weeks and remained for a total of 14 weeks in the top 40.[tpl]cite web |title="Dégénération", Belgian (Wallonia) Singles Chart |url=http://www.ultratop.be/fr/showitem.asp?key=475108&cat=s |publisher=Ultratop |language=French |accessdate=4 July 2008[/tpl]
The single was first ranked for a sole week on the Swiss Singles Charts, at number 58, on 6 July, thanks to the downloads, but re-entered at number 26 on 23 August when the physical formats were available, then dropped and fell off the chart after six weeks.[tpl]cite web |title="Dégénération", Swiss Singles Chart |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?key=475108&cat=s |publisher=Hitparade |language=German |accessdate=4 July 2008[/tpl]

==Promotion and live performances==

The song was never performed on television. It was performed during the 2009 tour Mylène Farmer en tournée, as sixteenth song of the show. Farmer wore a black leather jacket with a golden cross in the back, and her dancers a beige jacket with a black cross in the back. The song was accompanied by a choreography: Farmer appeared standing on a cockroach-shaped chair, while the dancers performed a dynamic modern choreography; she then stood up and walked to a platform which then raised in the airs.
