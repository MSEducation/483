[[Puerto Rico Highway 184]]

CATEGORIES: Highways in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico Highway 184 is a main, rural highway that connects Cayey, Puerto Rico, with plans to be extended to Cidra, to Patillas. It is the main and only access to the various famous roasted-pork restaurants (lechoneras) in the area of Guavate and the access to the forest park with the same name. It borders the Carite river, where several people swim often, and like Puerto Rico Highway 181 it borders the open artificial lake Carite, and it meets its end at Puerto Rico Highway 3. The main antennas of the local TV stations Telemundo, WAPA-TV and Univision can be seen from this road. The scenic area around the road in Guavate is beautiful and the scenic view of the mountains make it a great road for internal tourism. The road passes near a point where five municipalities share a border- Cayey, Patillas, San Lorenzo, Caguas and Guayama.
