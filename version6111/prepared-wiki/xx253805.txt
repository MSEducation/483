==Background and content==

...In Black and White was recorded in January 1982 in Nashville, Tennessee and consisted of ten tracks of new material. Greg Adams of Allmusic compared the fourth track, "'Till You're Gone" to Ronnie Milsap's number one country single "Lost in the Fifties Tonight (In the Still of the Night)", saying that the track anticipated the "oily nostalgia...with its classic doo wop chord progression." The album mainly contained Country pop-influenced ballads such as "'Till You're Gone". Adams gave the album three out five stars, calling the album "uneven" in parts. He stated, "The album is marred by synthetic production and uneven material, particularly with regard to the preponderance of generic ballads that aren't rooted in any particular genre of music. Unless you're a completist, enjoy "Till You're Gone" on a greatest-hits collection and skip the rest."[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r123040/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=In Black and White > Review|last=Adams|first=Greg|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]
