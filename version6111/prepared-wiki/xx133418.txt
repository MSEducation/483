The Echuca line (also known as the Deniliquin line) is a country railway in Victoria, Australia. V/Line operates passenger services along the line.

==History==

The Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company was formed in 1853 to build a railway to Echuca via Bendigo. Work began in 1854, but the company hit financial troubles and sold out to the state government. The railway finally reached Echuca in 1864 and transformed the town into a major river port, with a famous wharf and substantial urban growth in the 1870s. In 1876 the Deniliquin and Moama Railway Company opened their [tpl]convert|71|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long private railway northwards to Deniliquin, New South Wales. This section was taken over by the Victorian Railways in 1923, as part of the 1922 Border Railways Act.
Passenger rail services from Echuca to Balranald were withdrawn on 7 November 1975, with the last train a 153hp Walker railmotor. The Echuca to Kyabram service was withdrawn on 18 December 1975. The last train was also 153 hp Walker railmotor, the service being provided for school children and paid for by the Education Department.[tpl]cite journal |date=March 1997 | title = Rail Passenger Service Withdrawals Since 1960 | author = Chris Banger | journal = Newsrail | publisher = Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division) | pages = pages 77–82 [/tpl] The Bendigo – Echuca – Deniliquin passenger service was withdrawn on 11 January 1979, with the last train being operated by a DERM. Toolamba – Echuca passenger services were withdrawn on 2 March 1981, leaving the town without any rail services.
A twice-weekly passenger service from Bendigo was reinstated in 1996. The passenger service was replaced with buses on 19 December 2004, pending an upgrade due to poor track condition, and has since re-opened in late 2006.
