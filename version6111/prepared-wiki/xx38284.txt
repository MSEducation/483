Sigur Rós ([tpl]IPA-is|ˈsɪːɣʏr ˈroːus|-|Sigur ros.ogg[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SIG|ər rohss[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/pronunci.php| title=pronunciation |accessdate=2014-03-24 |publisher=sigur-ros.co.uk[/tpl]) is an Icelandic post-rock band from Reykjavík, which has been active since 1994. Known for its ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi Birgisson's falsetto vocals, and the use of bowed guitar, the band's music is also noticeable for its incorporation of classical and minimalist aesthetic elements. The band is named after Jónsi's sister Sigurrós Elín.[tpl]cite web|title=Sigur Rós Official Website|work=sigur-ros.co.uk|url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?p=1496|accessdate=2010-02-03[/tpl]

==History==

===1997–1998: Von and Von brigði===

Jón Þór "Jónsi" Birgisson (guitar and vocals), Georg Hólm (bass) and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson (drums) formed the group in Reykjavík in January 1994. (http://instagram.com/p/iwEogVIcch/)  The band's name is Icelandic wordplay: while the individual words Sigur and Rós mean, respectively, Victory and Rose, "Victory Rose" wouldn't be grammatically correct; the name is actually borrowed from Jónsi's younger sister Sigurrós, who was born a few days before the band was formed, and then split into two words. They soon won a record deal with the local Sugarcubes-owned record label, Bad Taste. In 1997, they released Von (pronounced [tpl]IPA-is|vɔːn|[/tpl], meaning "hope") and in 1998 a remix collection named Von brigði ([tpl]IPA-is|vɔːn ˈprɪɣðɪ|[/tpl]). This name is also Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means "disappointment", but Von brigði means "variations on Von". The band was joined by Kjartan Sveinsson on keyboards in 1998. He is the only member of Sigur Rós with musical training, and has contributed most of the orchestral and string arrangements for their later work.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===1999–2000: Ágætis byrjun===

International acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis byrjun ([tpl]IPA-is|ˈau̯cai̯tɪs ˈpɪrjʏn|[/tpl] "A Good Beginning"). The album's reputation spread by word of mouth over the following two years. Soon critics worldwide hailed it as one of the great albums of all time,[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/sigur-ros/agaetis-byrjun.htm |title=Sigur Ros Agaetis-Byrjun Review |first=Keith |last=Gwillim |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=2009-08-07 |work=Stylus Magazine[/tpl] and the band was playing support to established acts such as Radiohead. Three songs, "Ágætis byrjun", "Svefn-g-englar", and a live take of the then-unreleased "Njósnavélin" (later 'unnamed' "Untitled #4") appeared in the Cameron Crowe film Vanilla Sky. The former two also subsequently appeared in the US version of the television series Queer as Folk. Their music has also appeared in the TV series 24 with "Ný batterí", and CSI with "Svefn-g-englar". In 2004, Wes Anderson used "Starálfur" in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?m=20041129 |title=eighteen seconds before sunrise |work=Sigur Rós official website |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=2009-02-16 [/tpl] as did the Emmy-winning 2005 TV film The Girl in the Café. In Enki Bilal's Immortel (Ad Vitam) the song "Hjartað hamast (bamm bamm bamm)" is used. The song "Svefn-g-englar" was also used on V on 24 November 2009 and features prominently in Café de Flore released in 2011.
After the release of Ágætis byrjun, the band became well known for Jónsi's signature style of reverb accentuated guitar work using a cello's bow.

===2001: Rímur===

In 2001, Sigur Rós christened their newly completed studio by recording an EP with an Icelandic fisherman named Steindór Andersen. The EP contains six songs, all of which feature Steindór Andersen reciting traditional Icelandic poetry called rímur. Sigur Rós accompany him on three songs. Two songs feature Steindór alone. The last song on the EP, "Lækurinn", is a duet with Sigurður Sigurðarson. A thousand copies of the EP were printed and sold during the spring tour of 2001. The EP was sold in a blank-white-paper case.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/steindor.php |title=sigur rós - discography » steindór andersen / rímur ep |accessdate=2009-01-25 |publisher=sigur-ros.co.uk[/tpl]

===2002–2004: ( )===

Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/faq.php#02 |title=sigur rós - frequently asked questions |accessdate=2009-01-25 |publisher=sigur-ros.co.uk[/tpl] In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. All of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in Vonlenska, also known as Hopelandic, a constructed language without semantic meaning, technically glossolalia, which resembles the phonology of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.
In 2002, the band also wrote an original score for the Bodyscript dance production by Wayne McGregor Random Dance in collaboration with Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Arts Council England.
Sigur Rós collaborated with Radiohead in October 2003 to compose music for Merce Cunningham's dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós’s three tracks were named Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do and released in March 2004 while Radiohead's contribution was never released. Sigur Rós' 1997 debut album Von found a US and UK release in October 2004.
"Untitled 3" (a.k.a. Samskeyti) from the album is used on the video 6AM by film maker Carmen Vidal, winner of the 2006 Student Academy Award.[tpl]cite video |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5dp2q_6-am_shortfilms | title=6AM |first=Carmen |last=Vidal |publisher=Dailymotion |accessdate=2012-11-03[/tpl]
"Untitled 3" is also used at the end credits of the indie drama movie, Mysterious Skin. It can also be heard in Skins and CSI: Miami and the British TV Documentary Protecting Our Children as well as during a section of the London 2012 summer Olympics on the BBC.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  "Untitled 4" from the album (also called "Njósnavélin") featured in the final scene of Vanilla Sky, and director Cameron Crowe commented, "We struggled to find an appropriate track to end the film with and then I went to see Sigur Rós perform in Los Angeles and they played this song, "Njósnavélin", that was just perfect. I had to have it."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theuncool.com/films/vanilla-sky/vanilla-sky-soundtrack/ |title=Vanilla Sky Soundtrack |publisher=The Uncool |accessdate=2012-08-11[/tpl]

===2005–2006: Takk...===

Their fourth album, Takk... ([tpl]IPA|ˈtʰaʰk[/tpl]; "Thanks...") employs the distinctive sound of their second album in a more rock oriented structure with greater use of the guitar, and was released in September 2005. "Hoppípolla" ([tpl]IPA|ˈhɔʰpiˌpʰɔtl̥a[/tpl] "Hopping into puddles"), the second official single from Takk..., was released in November alongside a new studio remake of "Hafsól" ([tpl]IPA|ˈhafsoʊ̯l[/tpl] "Ocean Sun"), a song that was previously released on the band's 1997 debut, Von. "Hoppípolla" was used in the trailers for the BBC's natural history series Planet Earth in 2006, as well as the closing credits for the 2006 FA Cup final, ITV's coverage of the 2006 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, advertisements for the BBC's coverage of England games during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, on television advertisements for RTÉ's Gaelic games coverage in Ireland, and on an advertisement for Oxfam. It was also used in the final scene of the movie Penelope, for the trailer of the film Children of Men and for the trailer of the film Slumdog Millionaire. Following this, demand for the single grew. It was made more widely available by EMI in consequence. This song is also used in the trailer for the Disney movie Earth as well as in the 2011 film We Bought a Zoo, in 2012 it was also the chosen music to the debut time-lapse short movie of Portuguese photographer João Pedro Jesus.
An extended Sæglópur EP ([tpl]IPA|ˈsaɪ̯ˌkloʊ̯pʏr[/tpl]) was released in July 2006 in most parts of the world and in August in the United States. Its original release was scheduled in May, but because of the sudden demand of "Hoppípolla" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs to appear on the EP ("Refur", "Ó friður", and "Kafari"). In July 2006, Sigur Rós finished a major world tour with stops in Europe, the United States (where they played a headline show at the Hollywood Bowl), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. Upon return to their homeland, Sigur Rós provided a series of free surprise outdoor concerts throughout Iceland in July and August, playing in various venues such as abandoned bunkers and community coffee shops, all of which were included in the 2007 documentary film Heima. They also performed twice in the United States in February.[ref]

===2007: Heima and Hvarf/Heim===

In August 2007, a limited DVD+CD edition of the 2002 soundtrack to the documentary Hlemmur was released. Hvarf/Heim ([tpl]IPA-is|ˈkʰvarf], [ˈhɛɪ̯m|[/tpl]) was released on 5 November (6 November in the U.S.), a double compilation album containing studio versions of previously unreleased songs — "Salka" [tpl]IPA-is|ˈsalka|[/tpl], "Hljómalind" [tpl]IPA-is|ˈ l̥joʊ̯maˌlɪnt|[/tpl] (formerly known as "Rokklagið"), "Í Gær" [tpl]IPA|ˈcaɪ̯r[/tpl] and "Von" on Hvarf, and acoustic studio versions of the songs: "Samskeyti" ([tpl]IPA|ˈsamˌscɛɪ̯tɪ[/tpl]), "Starálfur" [tpl]IPA|ˈstarˌaʊ̯lvʏr[/tpl], "Vaka" [tpl]IPA|ˈvaːka[/tpl], "Ágætis Byrjun", "Heysátan" [tpl]IPA|ˈhɛɪ̯saʊ̯tan[/tpl] and "Von", on Heim.

Just prior to the release of Hvarf/Heim, on 29 October, a single named "Hljómalind" was released.[tpl]clarify|reason=Are the IPA templates correctly formed in this paragraph?

To promote their film Heima, the band scheduled a series of premiere screenings throughout the world, featuring a short acoustic set before the film and a question-and-answer session afterwards.

===2008: Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust===

The band's fifth regular studio album ([tpl]IPA-is|mɛð sʏð i ˈeiːrʏm vɪð ˈspɪːlʏm ˈɛntaløyst|pron[/tpl], "With a Buzz in Our Ears We Play Endlessly"), recorded with producer Flood in downtown Reykjavík,[tpl]cite news |title=Sigur Ros to work with producer |work=NME |page=1 |date=15 November 2007 |url=http://www.nme.com/news/sigur-ros/32532 |accessdate=2008-01-29[/tpl] was released in June 2008 to generally positive reviews. Stylistically different from their earlier releases, it featured fewer strings and more guitar,[tpl]cite web |url=http://indielaundry.blogspot.com/2008/02/sigur-rs-to-play-roskilde-festival.html |title=Sigur Rós to play Roskilde Festival |work=Indie Laundry — danish/icelandic musicblog mp3 |accessdate=2008-03-29[/tpl] and had more pop-oriented songs, making it "the group's most accessible effort" while maintaining the "majestic beauty that defines the band's music." The final track "All Alright" is the band's first to be sung in English, though all the other lyrics are in Icelandic.
The band were announced as a headlining act for the 2008 Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay, Australia,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.splendourinthegrass.com |title=Splendour in the Grass Official Site |accessdate=2008-06-07[/tpl][tpl]failed verification |date=November 2012[/tpl] Latitude Festival 2008,[tpl]cite web |url=http://latitudefestival.com/news/story.aspx?AID=81c954b3-109e-4e7e-aeef-00a898abf773 | title=Latitude Festival 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link |date=November 2012[/tpl] and the 2008 La Route du Rock Festival in St Malo, France.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.laroutedurock.com/ |title=La Route du Rock Official Site |language=French |accessdate=2008-04-15[/tpl][tpl]failed verification |date=November 2012[/tpl] In addition, the band performed a late-night set at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bonnaroo.com/ |title=Bonnaroo Official Site |accessdate=2012-11-03[/tpl][tpl]failed verification |date=November 2012[/tpl] where they blew a speaker at the end of their second song.

In the fall of 2008 Sigur Rós embarked on a world tour supporting their newly released album. The band played as a four-piece without Amiina and the brass band, the first time the band had played as a four-piece in seven years. The tour started on 17 September 2008 in the United States, at the United Palace Theater in New York City, and finished with a concert in Reykjavík at Laugardalshöll on 23 November 2008. The majority of the tour was European with the exception of concerts in the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan.
The track "Festival" from the album features in the score of the 2010 film 127 Hours, providing the euphoric backing to the climax of the movie. It is also featured at the end of  HBO mini-series "24/7 - Flyers-Rangers".

===2009-2012: Hiatus, Inni, Valtari===

On 28 May 2009, Sigur Rós announced that they had almost completed recording their latest album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?p=1313 |title=New album near completion |publisher=sigur-ros.co.uk | date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-29 [/tpl] The band said the album was taking form as a slower and more ambient record than both Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust and Takk.... The music was also described as melodic but much less noisy and more "out there" than previous albums. The unnamed album was expected to be released sometime in 2010. However, the band later revealed that the recordings had been scrapped. In a 2010 interview, Jónsi confirmed "We haven't got another album ready", he said. "It was just a rumour. We started to record something, but then we chucked it all away. So I think we are going to have to start it all again".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/28/sigur-ros-indefinite-hiatus |work=The Guardian |title=Sigur Rós on indefinite hiatus after scrapping new album |first=Sean |last=Michaels |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] Without further word on the new album, Sigur Rós were rumoured to be on indefinite hiatus as of January 2010. However, before taking the stage at Coachella in April 2010, Jónsi commented that Sigur Rós would be getting back to work that year: "I'm gonna record some other stuff with Sigur Rós when I'm home", between a series of shows during his solo tour in summer 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spinner.ca/2010/04/20/jonsi-birgisson-sigur-ros-hiatus/ |title=Jonsi Birgisson Sheds Light on Sigur Ros Hiatus |first=Steve |last=Baltin |publisher=Spinner |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-06-07[/tpl] On 1 February 2011, Jónsi's official website announced that he would be back in the studio with the band over the spring.[tpl]cite web |url=http://culturetechreview.blogspot.com/2011/02/sigur-ros-in-studio-for-new-2011-album.html |title=Sigur Ros in the studio for a new 2011 album |publisher=Culture & Technology Review |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-07[/tpl]
On 11 August 2011 Sigur Rós's official website unveiled a trailer for a project called Inni,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thepeoplesnews.co.uk/thepeoplesnews/?p=12 |title=Sigur Ros new 2011 album |publisher=The People's News |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]dead link |date=November 2012[/tpl] a DVD and double CD of the band's live performances in London, directed by Vincent Morisset.

On 3 November 2011, following the UK premiere of Inni at the British Film Institute in London, the band members participated in a Q&A session during which Georg promised that 2012 would be a "very busy" year for Sigur Rós. The band hinted at a new album and tour in the second half of 2012. The Q&A session was curtailed when a stage light began to emit smoke and the room was evacuated.
 "The band's next album is scheduled for release in the spring. Based on excerpts presented by Mr. Sveinsson, the new music promises to be as exceptional as the best of the band's catalog. Mr. Hólm called it "introverted", while Mr. Birgisson said it was "floaty and minimal". "An ambient album" was how Mr. Dýrason described it, with "a slow takeoff toward something". For a visitor who heard a preliminary recording in which Mr. Birgisson's falsetto was surrounded by rich choral voices and what sounded like a pipe organ, the music was thrilling".[tpl]cite news |first=Jim |last=Fusilli |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204554204577023893910185890.html |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=The Return of Sigur Rós |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-03[/tpl]

==Vonlenska==

Vonlenska is the non-literal language that forms the unintelligible lyrics sung by the band on some songs, in particular by Jónsi. It is also commonly known by the English translation of its name, Hopelandic. It takes its name from "Von", a song on Sigur Rós’s debut album Von where it was first used. However, not all Sigur Rós songs are in Hopelandic; many are sung in Icelandic.
Vonlenska has no fixed syntax and differs from constructed languages that can be used for communication. It focuses entirely on the sounds of language; it lacks grammar, meaning, and even distinct words. Instead, it consists of emotive non-lexical vocables and phonemes; in effect, Vonlenska uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way, it is similar to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz. The band's website describes it as "a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music"; it is similar in concept to the 'nonsense' language often used by Cocteau Twins singer Elizabeth Fraser in the 1980s and 1990s or by Icelandic singer Björk. Most of the syllable strings sung by Jónsi are repeated many times throughout each song, and in the case of ( ), throughout the whole album.
