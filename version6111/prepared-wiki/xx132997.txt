[[Southwestern water vole]]

The southwestern water vole or southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) is a large amphibious vole found in most of France and south-westwards through Spain and Portugal.  Although historically considered to be a member of the same species as the Eurasian water vole, Musser and Carleton (2005) considered it distinct enough to warrant full species status.  It is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. It is threatened for many of the same reasons as the Northern water vole, and a campaign is currently underway to seek protection for the species, both at a national level and at European Union level.
The animal was traditionally one of the main ingredients in the Valencian dish called paella.
