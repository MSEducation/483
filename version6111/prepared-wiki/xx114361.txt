Phidippus whitmani is a species of jumping spider.

==Description==

While the male is strikingly red on top, with a black band in the frontal eye region and sometimes with white setae on the forelegs, the female is of a rather inconspicuous brown color. It is one of the species of jumping spiders which are mimics of mutillid wasps (commonly known as "velvet ants"); several species of these wasps are similar in size and coloration, and possess a very painful sting.http://www.arachnology.org/ISA/meetings/1998ISAabs.htm

==Name==

The species name is possibly a reference to poet Walt Whitman.
