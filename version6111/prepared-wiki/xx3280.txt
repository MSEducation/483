==Mobile Device Home Page (Home Screen)==

The home page of a mobile device, often called the "home screen," serves as a useful way to organize applications stored on a smartphone. An example of this would be the iPhone.

Since a home page is used to allow a user to have immediate access to their most used page, mobile devices integrated that quality in order to make a fast, easy, and user-friendly way for users to access their applications in an organized manner.

==A Changing Concept==

The home page has become increasingly complex. It used to just be one page or screen that was shown when the internet/device was launched -- now a user is shown various sites as small thumbnails. These sites are automatically added to the home page based on the websites that the user frequents.
The iPhone, for example, allows this more complex home page to be utilized. Once the iPhone is unlocked, you are able to use up to 14 screens as a home page. IPhone Home Screen
