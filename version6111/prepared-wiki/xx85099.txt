</ref> A furious Keating demanded that newly installed Liberal Party leader [[John Howard]] discipline Tuckey, but he refused.  Keating then promised to make Howard "wear his leadership like a [[crown of thorns]]".  Keating and Howard's relationship, previously a civil one, deteriorated to the point where the two men refused to speak to one another.  Reportedly, the last time the two men talked was when Keating stormed into the Opposition Leader's office, cursed him out for not disciplining Tuckey, and walked out.<ref name=Heckler/>

==Political career==

In 1989 a group of Liberal MPs, including Tuckey, plotted to depose John Howard as Liberal Party leader and replace him with Andrew Peacock. After the plan succeeded, Tuckey boasted about it in a Four Corners interview, which privately infuriated Howard.[tpl]cite web|first=Peter|last=Brent|url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/mumble/index.php/theaustralian/comments/hypothetical_polling_next_to_worthless/|title=Pointless hypothetical polling|work=Mumble|publisher=The Australian|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl]
Tuckey addressed an AIDS conference and opened by saying "you don't catch AIDS, you let somebody give it to you".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/ocon.htm |title=O'Connor: 2010 Federal Election 2010 |work=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=2010 |accessdate=10 September 2010[/tpl]

As Minister for Forestry, Tuckey angered conservation groups through his support for the forestry industry. In 2002 he blamed the environmentalist movement for Australia's severe bushfire problem, saying that their opposition to controlled burning in national parks increased the risk of fires.[tpl]Cite news|first=James |last=Woodford |title=Lessons from the burning bush |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549017550.html?from=storyrhs |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=2003-09-06[/tpl]
Tuckey's demise as a minister came in August 2003 when it was revealed that he had written to South Australian Police minister Patrick Conlon on ministerial letterhead, asking Conlon to "review" his son's conviction on a traffic charge. Prime Minister Howard said that Tuckey's actions were foolish but refused to dismiss him. Tuckey resigned as a minister shortly afterwards and returned to the backbench.[tpl]Cite news|last=Seccombe |first=Mike |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261156716.html?from=storyrhs |title=Tuckey's worrying version of family values |date=20 August 2003 |accessdate=16 December 2007[/tpl]

In 2005 when the Australian parliament passed a motion asking Singaporean authorities that Van Tuong Nguyen not be executed for drug smuggling, Tuckey was the only member of parliament not to support it.[tpl]Cite news|title=Tuckey alone against clemency for Nguyen |last=Peake |first=Ross |date=1 November 2005 |work=Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |page=2 |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl]
Tuckey was often quoted in the media as supporting free markets and less government intervention in the economy. He is also well known for criticising the National Party on a number of issues. He was the most outspoken critic of AWB in Federal Parliament and led the push for it to be stripped of its export monopoly for wheat. Tuckey labelled National Party politicians who supported the 'single desk' system as "drongos".[tpl]Cite news|first=Caroline |last=Overington |coauthors=Cath Hart |title=Coalition split on AWB monopoly |work=The Australian |publisher=News Limited |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2008[/tpl] He also labelled National Party senator Barnaby Joyce a "lightweight" for arguing in favour of foreign ownership restrictions on Medibank Private after privatization.[tpl]Cite news|first=Danielle |last=Cronin |work=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |title=Fears cost of health insurance will rise |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2008[/tpl]
In August 2006, Tuckey had a public argument with Labor leader Kim Beazley over new immigration laws, ending with Tuckey calling Beazley a "fat so and so".[tpl]Cite news|title='Iron Bar' wins on points: PM |date=10 August 2006 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/beazley-a-fat-so-and-so/2006/08/10/1154802995343.html |accessdate=16 December 2007[/tpl]
In August 2007, Tuckey sent a fax to John Howard and several Liberal MPs suggesting the Prime Minister relinquish the leadership.[tpl]Cite news|first=Phillip |last=Coorey |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/howard-says-he-trusts-costello/2007/08/15/1186857563104.html |title=Tuckey blames staff for fax |date=15 August 2007 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=16 December 2007[/tpl]
In January 2008, Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson branded Tuckey an "extreme racist" after Tuckey criticised the decision to display traditional dancers from the Aboriginal tribe, which historically resides near the Parliament House, in the opening of Federal Parliament. Watson concluded, "Mr Tuckey and his extremist racist views really do belong to another generation."[tpl]Cite news|title=Tuckey labelled racist over Indigenous dance comments |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/28/2148258.htm |date=28 January 2008 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=28 January 2008[/tpl]
On 13 February 2008, Tuckey walked out during the opening of the 42nd Australian Federal Parliament immediately after prayers, and pointedly before the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a motion of apology to the Stolen Generation. He was one of five Coalition MPs not present in the chamber, thereby boycotting the motion.[tpl]Cite news|last1=Grattan |first1=Michelle |authorlink=Michelle Grattan |last2=Schubert |first2=Misha |title=Rudd staff rebuked for shunning Nelson|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/rudd-staff-rebuked-for-shunning-nelson/2008/02/13/1202760398786.html |date=14 February 2008 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=14 February 2008[/tpl] On the steps of parliament, Tuckey was sarcastic about what the apology would achieve for indigenous people:
 "I'm there to say hallelujah. Tomorrow there'll be no petrol sniffing, tomorrow little girls can sleep in their beds without any concern â€” it's all fixed.  The Rudd spin will fix it all. I've read it, I'm convinced. I think it's wonderful." 
In May 2008, Tuckey was expelled from the house for 24 hours after breaching standards. His remarks against the speaker arose during a heated question time in relation to the Rudd Government's 'Fuel Watch Scheme'.[tpl]Cite episode |title=Fireworks as Wilson Tuckey is kicked out of the House |network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |station=ABC1 |airdate=May 2008 |transcripturl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udN4h0YzXDg [/tpl] On 24 September 2008, Tuckey was again expelled from the house, this time for one hour, for an outburst during House of Representatives Question Time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In March 2010, Tuckey said that acknowledging traditional landowners at official events was a "farce" and that he had "never thanked anyone for the right to be on the soil that is Australian".[tpl]Cite news|title=Aboriginal recognition a face: Tuckey |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/15/2845854.htm |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=10 September 2010 |first=Emma |last=Rodgers[/tpl]

===Defeat===

At the 2010 federal election, Tuckey lost his seat of O'Connor to the Nationals WA candidate Tony Crook.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/fat-lady-is-warming-up-for-wilson-tuckey/story-fn59niix-1225908302087 |title='Fat lady is warming up' for Wilson Tuckey |work=The Australian |date=21 August 2010 |last=Barrass |first=Tony |publisher=News Limited |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/tuckeys-dreams-in-ruins-20100822-13ajv.html |title=Tuckey's dreams in ruins |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 August 2010 |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl]  Results in O'Connor from 1980 had Tuckey on a two-party preferred vote of 62 to 75 percent against Labor at each election.
