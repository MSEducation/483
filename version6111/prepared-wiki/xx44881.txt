The arms are described as "left tilted dividing by silver and green, the dividing line is a curved wolf tooth pattern. The flame-like line represents the clearance of farms in the woods by the use of fire and is also a remembrance of the gruesome church fire of 1822. The colors symbolize the forests and the Glomma river.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grue.kommune.no/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=96&Itemid=63|title=Om Grues kommunevåpen|publisher=Grue Kommune|accessdate=2008-12-21[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]no icon[/tpl]
