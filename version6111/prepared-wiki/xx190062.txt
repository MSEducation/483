==Tomb of Joshua==

At the top of the hill, a giant symbolic grave stands, known to the Europeans as the "Giant's Grave". It is believed by the Muslims being the "Tomb of Saint Joshua".
A flat, rectangular earthen rise [tpl]Convert|17|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] long and [tpl]Convert|2|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] wide. It is surrounded with a high cast-iron grate, enclosed by means of an iron netting. The point is that the local inhabitants consider the grave miraculous and come here in order to be healed of their illnesses. But, the iron netting prevents the pilgrim from touching the holy ground inside the fence.
The ground is overgrown with thick grass. Several high trees grow. At the opposite end of the grave are two circular cylindrical stones, which are reminiscent of small millstones. In the center of one of them are seen a quadrangular opening and a very noticeable fissure. All this is enclosed by a stone wall, in which two doors and several windows have been made. The pilgrims enter one of the doors, pass around the grave in a circle and exit outside through a second door.

==Yuşa Mosque==

Yuşa Mosque ([tpl]lang-tr|Hazreti Yuşa Cami[/tpl]) was built by Grand Vizier Yirmisekizzade Mehmed Said Pasha in 1755 with an adjacent shrine. This small mosque had stone walls and a split roof structure because it was burnt. The mosque was restored during the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz in 1863.
