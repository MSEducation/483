The Lexus Chase is a Grade 1 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Leopardstown over a distance of about 3 miles (4,828 metres), and during its running there are seventeen fences to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year during the Christmas Festival meeting in late December.
It was first run over its present distance in 1992, when it became known as the Ericsson Chase. This replaced an earlier event, the Black and White Whisky Champion Chase, which had been run mostly over 2Â½ miles since 1986. The race's present title, named after its sponsor Lexus, was introduced in 2004.
