Lump is a 2000 greatest hits compilation album by The Presidents of the United States of America.
The album includes three covers: "Video Killed the Radio Star", originally by The Buggles, "Kick Out the Jams", originally by MC5 and "Cleveland Rocks", originally by Ian Hunter.
Unusual for a "Greatest Hits" album, Lump features only ten tracks totalling less than 30 minutes in length.  Also, one of the band's biggest hits that also gave them a Grammy Nomination, "Peaches", is missing completely, along with minor hit "Kitty".
