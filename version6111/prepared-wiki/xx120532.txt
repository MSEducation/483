Based On A True Story is the second album from American Idol finalist, Kimberley Locke. Kimberley chose this title because the songs on the album, 8 of which co-written by Kimberley herself, tell the true story of the emotions she dealt with during and after her relationship with her ex-fiance. She found that when she sat and talked with her collaborators about the issues she was working through, the songs began to write themselves.
