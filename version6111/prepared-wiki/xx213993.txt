==Music==

Estancia was once noted for its fine music program.  From 1970 until 1981 the instrumental music program was under the direction of Peter P. Fournier.  During that time the program grew from 40 musicians to over 100, and the school boasted a well rounded instrumental department that included an Intermediate Band, a Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a Jazz Ensemble, a String/Full Orchestra, and a Marching Band.
The marching band, at its peak, enjoyed many successes at SCSBOA Parade Band competitions in Southern California, including first place awards at the Colton and Santa Monica Band Reviews, as well as a well deserved appearance in the 1977 Rose Parade.
During Mr. Fournier's time at Estancia HS the concert groups enjoyed an unprecedented series of achievements in concert venues, including many unanimous superior rating ratings at both district and regional festivals for the wind ensemble, symphonic band and orchestra.  The wind ensemble performed by invitation for the CMEA Western Region Convention in Tucson, AZ in 1972, the CMEA National Convention in Anaheim in 1974 where the brass ensemble opened the exhibition hall and the wind ensemble performed with composer Dr. Brett Heisinger.  
Since the departure of Mr. Fournier in 1981, EHS, like all schools in the NMUSD has undergone a steady decline in the department due to lack of district support for music.  What used to be a vibrant and important program for the high school consisting of seven periods of instrumental performing ensembles (as well as a similarly outstanding and complete chorale program) has declined to a few students and one part time instructor.
