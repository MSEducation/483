Tehran ([tpl]pronunciation|Tehran.ogg[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-fa|Tehrān[/tpl] Tehrān; [tpl]IPA-fa|tehˈɾɒn|pron[/tpl]), is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of around 8.3 million and surpassing 14 million in the wider metropolitan area, Tehran is Iran's largest city and urban area, and the largest city in Western Asia.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tehran has been the subject of mass migration of people from all around Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran |title=Tehran (Iran) : Introduction – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2012-05-21[/tpl] The city is home to many historic mosques, churches, synagogues and Zoroastrian fire temples. However, modern structures, notably Azadi (Liberty) Tower and the Milad Tower, have come to symbolise the city. Tehran is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_2006_1.html |title=World's largest urban areas in 2006 (1) |publisher=City Mayors |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25[/tpl] Throughout Iran's history, the capital has been moved many times, and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran although it has been Iran's capital for about 220 years. Although a variety of unofficial languages are spoken, roughly 99% of the population understand and speak Persian.Mareike Schuppe, "Coping with Growth in Tehran: Strategies of Development Regulation", GRIN Verlag, 2008. pp 13: "Besides Persian, there are Azari, Armenian, Jewish and Persian afghan communities in Tehran.

==History==

An important historical city in the area of modern-day Tehran, now absorbed by it, is known as Rey, which is etymologically connected to the Old Persian and Avestan Rhages.Chahryar Adle, Bernard Hourcade, "Téhéran: capitale bicentenaire", Institut français de recherche en Iran, 1992. p. 22 The city was a major area of the Iranian speaking Medes and Achaemenids. Tehran became the capital of Iran in 1778.
In the Zoroastrian Avesta, Videvdad, i, 15, Ragha is mentioned as the twelfth sacred place created by Ahura-Mazda.V. Minorsky, C.E. Bosworth, "Al-Rayy", Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, vol 8:471–473 In the Old Persian inscriptions (Behistun 2, 10–18), Ragha appears as a province. From Ragha, Darius the Great sent reinforcements to his father Hystaspes (Vishtaspa), who was putting down the rebellion in Parthia (Behistun 3, 1–10).
The Damavand mountain located near the city also appears in the Shahnameh as the place where Freydun bounds the dragon-fiend Zahhak. Damavand is important in Persian mythological and legendary events.A. Tafazolli, "In Iranian Mythology" in Encyclopaedia Iranica Kayūmarṯ, the Zoroastrian prototype of human beings and the first king in the Shahnameh, was said to have resided in Damāvand. In these legends, the foundation of the city of Damavand was attributed to him. Arash, the archer who sacrificed his body by giving all his strength to the arrow that demarcated Iran and Turan, shot his arrow from Mount Damāvand. This Persian legend was celebrated every year in the Tiregan festival. A popular feast is reported to have been held in the city of Damavand on 7 Šawwāl 1230, or in Gregorian calendar, 31 August 1815. During the alleged feast the people celebrated the anniversary of Zahhak's death. In the Zoroastrian legends, the tyrant Zahhak is to finally be killed by the Iranian hero Garšāsp before the final days.
In some Middle Persian texts, Rey (Ragha) is given as the birthplace of ZoroasterVesta Sarkhosh Curtis, Sarah Stewart, "Birth of the Persian Empire", I.B.Tauris, 2005. p. 37 although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoraster in Khorasan. In one Persian tradition, the legendary king Manūčehr was born in Damavand.
During the Sassanid era, Yazdegerd III in 641 issued from Rey his last appeal to the nation before fleeing to Khorasan. The sanctuary of Bibi Shahr-Banu situated in modern Tehran spur and accessible only to women is associated with the memory of the daughter of Yazdegerd who, according to tradition, became the wife of al-Husayn b. Ali, the third Shi'ite Imam. Rey was the fief of the Parthian Mihran family and Siyavakhsh the son of Mihran the son of Bahram Chobin resisted the Arab invasion. Because of this resistance, when the Arabs captured Rey, they ordered the town to be destroyed and ordered Farrukhzad to rebuild the town.
In the 10th century, Rey is described in detail in the work of Islamic geographers. Despite the interest of Baghdad displayed in Rey, the number of Arabs there was insignificant, and the population consisted of Persians of all classes.(Bulddan, Yackubl, 276) The Ghuzz Turks laid Rey to waste in 1035 and in 1042, but the city recovered during the Saljuqid and Khwarazmian era. The Mongols laid Rey to complete waste and according to Islamic historians of the era, virtually all of its inhabitants were massacared. The city is mentioned in later Safavid chronicles as an unimportant city.
The origin of the name Tehran is unknown.Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes ; The Case of The Historical City of Tehran. Tehran Historical City Office. Tehran was well known as a village in the 9th century, but was less well-known than the city of Rhages (Rey) which was flourishing nearby in the early era. Najm al-Din Razi known as Dayya gives the population of Rey as 500,000 before the Mongol invasion. In the 13th century, following the destruction of Rey by Mongols, many of its inhabitants escaped to Tehran. In some sources of the early era, the city is mentioned as "Rhages's Tehran". The city is later mentioned in Hamdollah Mostowfi's Nuz'hat al-Qulub (written in 1340) as a famous village.

There is also a shrine there, dedicated to commemorate Princess Shahr Banu, eldest daughter of the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire. She gave birth to Ali Zayn al Abidin, the fourth holy Imam of the Shia faith. This was through her marriage to Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. A nearby mountain is also named after her. However, some sources attribute the shrine to the goddess of water and fertility, Anahita, claiming it was renamed in Islamic times to protect it from any possible harm after the conversion of Iranians to Islam.
Don Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, a Castilian ambassador, was probably the first European to visit Tehran, stopping in July 1404, while on a journey to Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan) the capital of Timur, who ruled Iran at the time. At this time, the city of Tehran was unwalled.
In the early 18th century, Karim Khan Zand ordered a palace, and a government office to be built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital, but later moved his government to Shiraz. Tehran finally became the capital of Iran in 1795, when the Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan was crowned in the city. It remains the capital to this day.
In the 1920s and 30s, the city essentially was rebuilt from scratch under the rule of the Shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi. Reza Shah believed that ancient buildings such as large parts of the Golestan Palace, Takieh-ye Dowlat, the Toopkhaneh Square, the city fortifications and the old citadel among others should not be part of a modern city. They were systematically destroyed and modern buildings in the pre-islamic Iranian style, such as the National Bank, the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office and the Military Academy were built in their place. The Tehran Bazaar was divided in half and many historic buildings were destroyed in order to build wide straight avenues in the capital. Many Persian gardens also fell victim to new construction projects.
During World War II, Soviet and British troops entered the city. Tehran was the site of the Tehran Conference in 1943, attended by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
In the 1960s and 70s Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. The majority of these projects were continued after the Islamic revolution of 1979 when Tehran's urbanization had reached its peak, and the new government started many other new projects, such as Milad Tower.
During the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War, Tehran was the target of repeated Scud missile attacks and air strikes.

===City development===

Up through the 1870s, Tehran consisted of the walled “arg” (royal citadel), the roofed bazaar, and “sharestan” (where the masses resided in three main neighborhoods of “Udlajan”, “Chaleh Meydan”, and “Sangelaj”). The first development plan of Tehran in 1855 emphasized the traditional spatial structure. Architecture, however, found an eclectic expression to reflect the new lifestyle.
The second major planning exercise in Tehran happened under supervision of Dar ul-Funun. The map of 1878 included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square kilometers, which mimicked the renaissance cities of Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jph.sagepub.com/content/12/1/49|author=Vahid Vahdat Zad|title= Spatial Discrimination in Tehran’s Modern Urban Planning 1906-1979| year= 2011|work= Journal of Planning History vol. 12 no. 1 49-62 |accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl]
As a response to the growing social consciousness of civil rights, on June 2, 1907, the first parliament of Persian Constitutional Revolution passed a law on local governance known as “Ghanoon-e Baladieh”. The second and third articles of the law, on “anjoman-e baladieh”, or the city council, provide a detailed outline on issues such as the role of the councils in the city, the members’ qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote.
After the First World War, Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, immediately suspended the “Ghanoon-e Baladieh” of 1907 and the decentralized and autonomous city councils were replaced by centralist/sectoralist approaches of governance and planning.
The changes in the urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933 which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. As a result of this act, the traditional texture of the city was butchered with cruciform intersecting streets creating large roundabouts, located on the major public spaces such as the bazaar or the hussainia.
As an attempt to create a network for the easy movement of goods and vehicles in Tehran, the city walls and gates were demolished in 1937 and replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron network.
The establishment of the planning organization of Iran in 1948 resulted in the first socio-economic development plan to cover 1949 to 1955. These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran but with the 1962 land reforms, that Shah called the White Revolution, Tehran's growth was further accentuated.
To bring back order to the city and resolve the problem of “hashyehneshini”, which is the Persian equivalent of marginality, the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of the Iranian consultants Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian and the American firm of Victor Gruen Associates identified the city problems to be high density, expansion of new suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the subsequent Iran-Iraq war.

==Climate==

Tehran features a semi-arid, continental climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk). Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering Alborz Mountains to its north and the central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in the spring and autumn, hot and dry in the summer, and cold in the winter. Because the city is large with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the [tpl]convert|17.3|km|abbr=on[/tpl] Vali E Asr street runs from the Tehran's railway station than, [tpl]convert|1117|m|abbr=on[/tpl] elevation above sea level, in the south of the city to the Tajrish square, [tpl]convert|1612|m|abbr=on[/tpl] elevation above sea level, in the north.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] However, the elevation can even rise up to [tpl]convert|1900|m|abbr=on[/tpl] at the end of the Velenjak street in the north of Tehran.
Summer is usually hot and dry with very little rain, but relative humidity is generally low and the nights are cool. Most of the light annual precipitation occurs from late autumn to mid-spring, but no one month is particularly wet. The hottest month is July, mean minimum temperature [tpl]convert|26|°C[/tpl]; mean maximum temperature [tpl]convert|36|°C[/tpl], and the coldest is January, mean minimum temperature [tpl]convert|−1|°C[/tpl]; mean maximum temperature [tpl]convert|8|°C[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irantour.org/Iran/Climate.html |title=Climate of Tehran |publisher=Irantour.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12[/tpl]
Although Tehran enjoys a more moderate climate than other parts of the country, the weather can sometimes be unpredictably harsh. The record high temperature is [tpl]convert|43|°C|0[/tpl] and the record low is [tpl]convert|-17|°C|0[/tpl]. On January 5 and 6, 2008, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures covered the city in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare a state of emergency and closing down the capital on January 6 and 7.Heavy Snowfall in Tehran (in Persian). irna.com
In February 2005, heavy snow covered all of part of the city. Snow depth was [tpl]convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in south part of the city and [tpl]convert|100|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in the north of city. One newspaper said it had been the worst weather for 34 years. 10,000 bulldozers and 13,000 municipal workers deployed to keep the main roads open.Heavy Snowfall in Tehran ( Feb 2005 ). bbc.comHeavy Snowfall in Tehran (In Persian).
Tehran has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation since the beginning of the 21st century. This is most likely because of the afforestation projects, which also include expanding parks and lakes. The northern parts of Tehran are still more lush than the southern parts.
Tehran's climate can be described to have some monsoon influences; the summers are very dry, and the spring and fall are rather lush, with the main precipitation occurring at this time.
On January 21, 2012, the local weather experienced a turbulence unanticipated by weather forecasts. That day, the temperate fell to [tpl]convert|-17|C[/tpl] and remained for 3 days at [tpl]convert|-10|C[/tpl].January 2012 Tehran weather forecast.

==Demographics==

The city of Tehran (not to be confused with the larger, Metropolitan Tehran) had a population of approximately 7.8 million in 2006.[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] With its cosmopolitan atmosphere, Tehran is home to diverse ethnic and linguistic groups from all over the country. The native language of the city is the Tehrani accent of Persian and the majority of people in Tehran identify themselves as Persian."Chand Darsad Tehranihaa dar Tehran Bedonyaa Amadand"(How many percent of Tehranis were born in Tehran)-actual census done by University of Tehran sociology department accessed December, 2010 http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/133668http://news.veyq.ir/news/114265/%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%81-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-67%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF4-5-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AFhttp://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8909091131lhttp://www.aftabnews.ir/vdchimnzw23nzid.tft2.htmlhttp://www.asriran.com/fa/news/147352/%DA%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%9F However, historically, the original native dialect of the Tehran–Rey region is not Persian, which is linguistically Southwest Iranian and originates in Fars in the south of the country, but a (now extinct) Northwest Iranian dialect belonging to the Central Iran group.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Central Dialects|author-last=Windfuhr|author-first=Gernot L.|authorlink=Gernot Windfuhr|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=242–252|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/central-dialects|accessdate=23 August 2013|volume=5[/tpl] and other ethnic Minority groups include Azeris, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs, Bakhtiari, Georgians, Russians, Assyrians, Talysh, Baloch and many more.

Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethno-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social and economic consequences of the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 and the years that followed, some Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran due to mounting political, social and,religious pressure. Many Iranians moved to countries such as Canada, the United States, France, Sweden and other European countries. The highest Iranian emigration has been to the United States, France, Iranians in Germany, Iranians in Sweden and Canada.
With the start of the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) following an Iraqi invasion, a second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during Iraqi air offensive on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at that time, economic isolation caused even more reasons for the inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq.
The unstable situation and the war in neighboring Afghanistan and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who came in millions, with Tehran being a magnet for modest workers who helped the city to recover from war wounds, charging far less than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of UNHCR but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their respective country of origin. Afghan refugees are mostly Persian-speaking Hazara or Tajiks, speaking a dialect of Persian, and Iraqi refugees, who are mainly Shia Muslim Mesopotamian Arabic-speakers often of Iranian origin.
The majority of Tehranis are followers of Twelver Shia Islam, which is also the state religion. Religious minorities include followers of various sects of Sunni Islam, Mystic Islam, Christianity (including the adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Roman Catholic Church, Chaldean Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church, Iranian Protestant churches like Jama'at-e Rabbani (assemblies of God), Armenian Evangelical Church, and the Presbyteran Church), Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and some from the Bahá'í Faith. Tehran also has very small number of third generation Iranian Sikh community that has a gurudwara visited by Indian Prime Minister in 2012.[tpl]cite web|last=Lakshman|first=Nikhil|title=Indian Prime Minister in Tehran|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-to-organise-a-summit-the-iranian-way/20120830.htm|work=Rediff.com|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=3 September 2012[/tpl]

==Capital relocation==

A plan to move the capital has been discussed many times in prior years. In 2010, the government of Iran announced that "for security and administrative reasons" the plan to move the capital from Tehran has been finalized.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1322.html |title=For Security and Admnistrative sic Reasons: Plan to Move Capital From Tehran Finalized |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25[/tpl] The Majlis named Shahroud, Esfahan and Semnan as three of main candidates to replace Tehran as the capital.
