Gladsaxe Kommune is a municipality (Danish, kommune) near Copenhagen in Region Hovedstaden on the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of [tpl]convert|25|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl], and has a total population of 65,962 (2012). Its mayor is Karin Søjberg Holst, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.
The site of its municipal council is the town of Buddinge. Other towns in the municipality are Gladsaxe, Bagsværd, and Mørkhøj (Søborg is often mentioned wrongly, but it is just a part of Buddinge) – but town limits are not distinguishable because the towns have grown together in an urban sprawl. 
At Gladsaxe, there is a 206.5 metres tall guyed TV mast, which was built in 1955. It was the first TV transmission site in Denmark.
Gladsaxe municipality was not merged with other municipalities by 1 January 2007 as the result of nationwide Kommunalreformen ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007).
