==Club career==

Cho joined Daegu FC as a draft player for the 2006 season.  While little more than a squad player during 2006 making only intermittent appearances during the season, Cho was a regular starter during the 2007 season.  Seeing little matchplay in 2008, Cho transferred to the Pohang Steelers for the 2009 season.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/sthkorea/2009/kleague/pohang.htm |title=Pohang Steelers 2009 squad |publisher=footballsquads.co.uk[/tpl]  Despite the move, Cho still struggled to establish himself as a first choice at the Steelers, and has made the move to Daejeon Citizen for the 2011 K-League season.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/sthkorea/2010/kleague/daejeon.htm |title=Daejeon Citizen 2011 squad |publisher=footballsquads.co.uk[/tpl]
