==Playing career==

Eliáš was drafted by the New Jersey Devils 51st overall (2nd round) in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. 
Along with Petr Sýkora and Jason Arnott, he helped lead the team to the 1999–2000 Stanley Cup championship. He assisted on Arnott's Cup-clinching goal in double overtime in Game 6 at Dallas. The following year he scored a team record 96 points in the regular season, third best in the league. He also played a key role in helping New Jersey win the 2003 Stanley Cup. 
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played hockey in the Czech Republic.
Three months into the 2005–06 season, he made his first appearance of the season on January 3, 2006, against the Florida Panthers, resuming his role as an alternate captain (replacing Alexander Mogilny). He picked up where he left off, scoring eight points in his first four games and helping the Devils win his first nine games back with the team. In the first game of the 2006 playoffs against the New York Rangers, he became the 10th player to score six points in an NHL playoff game, with two goals and four assists. Eliáš' 2006 postseason campaign was spectacular, even though the Devils were eliminated by eventual Cup champions, Carolina, in the second round. Eliáš scored 6 goals and added 10 assists for an impressive 16 points in just 9 games.
Unable to reach a deal with the Devils headed into the 2006 off-season, Elias tested unrestricted free agency. In addition to offers to from the Chicago Blackhawks and the Montreal Canadiens, Elias verbally agreed to sign with the rival New York Rangers on July 1. However, talks hit a snag when Rangers GM Glen Sather would not agree on a no-move clause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2012/06/curious-case-of-tim-thomas-nhls-drug-policy-30-thoughts.html|title=Curious case of Tim Thomas, NHL's drug policy + 30 Thoughts|work=CBC Sports|date=2012-06-04|accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120607044242/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2012/06/curious-case-of-tim-thomas-nhls-drug-policy-30-thoughts.html|archivedate=2012-06-07[/tpl] Elias called Devils GM Lou Lamoriello and the two sides agreed on a 7 year, $42 million contract that included a no-movement clause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://capgeek.com/players/display.php?id=774 |title=Patrik Elias NHL Salary Contract History |publisher=Capgeek.com |date=1976-04-13 |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl]
