Ikki Tenryou is a young boy who's obsessesed with Medabots, just like every other kid, however he doesn't have one yet. One day, his mother asks him to buy some dinner, but instead he gets talked into buying a Medabot instead with the money. However it turns out it's missing a medal, a vital part to make a Medabot work. However, a strange mysterious man called the Phantom Renegade gives a medal to Ikki's father and tells him he should give it to his son. Now Ikki will finally be able to also take part in Robattles and compete with other fellow Medafighters. But whoever loses the battle must submit one of their Medabot's Medaparts to the victor.
