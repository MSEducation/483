The Oromo Liberation Front ([tpl]lang-om|Adda Bilisummaa Oromoo[/tpl] or ABO), or OLF, is an organization established in 1973 by Oromo nationalists to promote self-determination for the Oromo people against "Abyssinian colonial rule". It was the culmination of over 70 years of uncoordinated resistance by Oromos against Amhara hegemony as well as oppression and suppression of the Oromo people and their culture.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.oromoliberationfront.org/OLFMission.htm|title = OLF Mission|year = 2005[/tpl]  It has been outlawed and labeled a terrorist organization  by the Ethiopian government.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/ethiopia|title = World Report 2012: Ethiopia|publisher = Human Rights Watch[/tpl] The OLF has offices in Asmara (military base), Washington D.C. and Berlin from where it operates Amharic and Afan Oromo radio stations.[tpl]Cite news|title = Oromo Liberation Front: Who is Fooling Who?|date = |first = Kasembeli|last = Albert|url = http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=5590[/tpl]

==History==

In 1967, the imperial regime of Haile Selassie I outlawed the Mecha and Tuluma Self-Help Association (MTSHA)   and later instigated a wave of mass arrests and killings of its members and leaders.[tpl]Cite book|title = History of Ethiopia|last = Adejumobi|first = Saheed|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2007|isbn = 0-313-32273-2|location = United States of America|pages = 112[/tpl] Prominent military officer and leader of the association, Colonel General Tadesse Birru, was also arrested. This reaction by the regime had been caused by the popularity of the organization among the Oromos and its links to the Bale Oromo resistance movement.[tpl]Cite book|title = Being and Becoming Oromo|last = Triulzi|first = Alessandro|publisher = Gotab|year = 1996|isbn = 91-7106-379-X|location = Sweden|pages = [/tpl]
One of the association's members, Hussein Sora, escaped to Somalia in 1967. Him and other Oromo refugees formed a rebel group called the Ethiopian National Liberation Front of which he was named Secretary General. The ENLF soon moved to Yemen and began training members of the Oromo diaspora.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.gadaa.com/OromoLiberationFront.html|title = The Birth of the Oromo Liberation Front[/tpl]
The first attempt to enter the country failed when Somali security forces tracked down the members and arrested them trying to enter Ethiopia through northern Somalia. The second attempt proved to be more successful and the second group of rebels made camp in the Chercher Mountains. At this point, the group decided to operate under the name of "Oromo" instead of "Ethiopia.

===Initial formation===

In 1973, the political situation of the country had changed and the Ethiopian military had ousted the imperial regime and taken control. Leaders and members of the MTSHA, who had escaped arrest, had been operating secretly within the country by stirring up activism through underground newspapers such as "Kena Bektaa" and "The Oromo Voice Against Tyranny".   They organized a secret conference which was attended by Hussein Sora, Elemo Qiltu and various other Oromo leaders. It was during this conference that the Oromo Liberation Front was officially formed and its first political program was first written out. The armed Oromo units in the Chercher Mountains were adopted as the military wing of the organization, the Oromo Liberation Army or OLA (Oromo: Waraanna Bilisummaa Oromo or WBO).
The Oromo Liberation Army in the Chercher Mountains were placed under the command of Hassen Ibrahim, more commonly known as Elemo Qiltu. In 1974, the OLA increased its activities in the mountains and caused much alarm amongst the administrators of the region especially when they killed the notorious landowner, Mulatu Tegegn.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://gadaa.com/06142007002.pdf|title = Insurrection and invasion in the southeast, 1963-78[/tpl] The military regime of Ethiopia then sent General Getachew Shibeshi to destroy the insurrection. On September 6, 1974, the first Oromo Liberation Army was obliterated by mortar fire in the Battle of Tiro in which they lost both Ahmad Taqi and Elemo Qiltu; only three OLA soldiers survived.
In an attempt to subjugate any further Oromo uprising, the Derg instigated mass arrests and killings in the surrounding urban areas of where the OLA had operated, particularly in the cities of Gelemso, Baddessa, Mechara, Boke and Balbaleti. After the short lived guerilla war, the OLF become even more disorganized and its a few of its leaders moved back to Aden in order to restructure the organization but to no avail.
General Tadesse Birru, who had escaped from prison, continued an armed struggle in the Shewa region of the Oromo nation along with Hailu Regassa. They were eventually captured and executed in 1976 but his OLA contingent continued fighting and gained an influx of recruits after the executions.[tpl]Cite web|url = https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975ADDIS03052_b.html|title = ARREST OF OROMO INSURGENT LEADERS|publisher = Wikileaks|date = 1975-03-14[/tpl]

===Official formation===

By  1976, the Oromo Liberation Army had taken up a stronghold in the Chercher Mountains and this was used as an opportunity to reorganize the Front.[tpl]Cite book|title = Evil Days: 30 Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia|last = |first = |publisher = Africa Watch|year = 1991|isbn = 1-56432-038-3|location = United States of America|pages = [/tpl] A two day secret conference was organized among Oromo leaders and the attendees hailed from all corners of Oromia and a more broadbased leadership was elected. A few members of the ENLF, who were released from custody in Somalia in 1975, and others, who had entered the country on previous occasions, as well as representatives of the underground study cells, individual Oromo nationalist and patriots were  members of what is now called the "Founding Congress". The Congress revised the 1973 OLF Political Program and issued a new detailed program.  The program called for the "total liberation of the Oromo nation from Ethiopian colonialism". The conference is now known as the Founding Congress and it marked the beginning of modern Oromo nationalism.
Another front was opened by a by a newly formed Oromo Liberation Army that was initiated in eastern Oromia by farmers. Oromo students and intellectuals in urban areas joined OLA camps by the hundreds in order to offer leadership and educational training. The first battles occurred in the rural areas around Dire Dawa such as Gara Mul'ata.

===Late 1970s and the 1980s===

The OLF subsequently spread its activities to western Oromia  and elected a new 41-member central committee along with a five-member Supreme Politico Military Command which comprised Lencho Letta, Muhee Abdo, Baro Tumsa, Magarsaa Barii and Gadaa Gamada. With its structure firmly in place, the OLF began an effective campaign to educate students and the general populace about Oromo nationalism. Its military wing also began capturing land in western Oromia, particularly in Wellega.
Between 1977 and 1978, the war between Somalia and Ethiopia proved to be a double-sided coin to the fortunes of the organization. Abandoned weaponry from both armies allowing more recruits to be armed. On the other hand, the Ethiopian, Somali and Western Somali Liberation Front forces were all against the OLF and tried their utmost to eliminate the organization.
In the 1980s, the OLF opened an office in Sudan after its office in Somalia was closed down. It was also in that time that mass killings and arrests of Oromos began as a government attempt to curb the OLF's growth, which only served to further the OLF's support amongst Oromos.
The Oromo Liberation Army at that point had grown from a few hundred to over 10,000 soldiers. Despite their numbers, the troops were poorly equipped when compared to the other rebel groups which were operating in Ethiopia at the time, namely the EPLF and the TPLF. The OLA controlled vast areas of land in southern, western and eastern Oromia and offices and military bases were set up in major cities such as Jijiga, Assosa, Dembidollo and Mendi.
It was also in that decade that the organization and the movement lost many prominent figures such as Muhee Abdo, Saartu Yousef, Kebede Demissie, Baro Tumsa, Juuki Barentoo and hundreds more. The military government increased its viciousness against the OLF by burning entire villages, massacring student activists and through mass arrests. The OLF leadership was once almost wiped out during an ambush by government troops in which the OLF Secretary General, Galassa Dilbo, was almost killed.

===1990s===

The military government was on the verge of collapse as three rebel groups were obliterating its rule of the country. The Oromo Liberation Front, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front had differing alliances with each other, the TPLF and EPLF had a strong alliance and they both had limited coordinations with the OLF. In 1990, the TPLF formed several other ethnic based political groups from prisoners it had released and put them all under an umberalla organization called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The Oromo group in the EPRDF was the Oromo People's Democratic Organization and its creation was seen as an attempt to undermine the OLF.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/5120964_interview-with-chairman-of-the-oromo-liberation-front-.html|title = Interview with Chairman of the Oromo Liberation Front[/tpl]
The EPRDF, after destroying government control in Tigray and the Amhara region, proceeded to take Nekemte, a city in Oromia. In response, the Oromo Liberation Front  said in a broadcast on the Radio Voice of Oromo Liberation (Frankfurt am Main) on 15 April 1991: "The OLF strongly opposes the phrase: liberating Wellega or the Oromo nation. It is false for any alien force to say that it will liberate the Oromo nation."
The three rebel groups along with government representatives were to meet in the London Conference in May 1991 but the government representatives withdrew after hearing news that their President, Mengistu Hailemariam, had escaped to Zimbabwe. In this meeting, it was decided that the EPLF would hold a referendum amongst Eritreans in order to secede from the rest of the country. The EPRDF insisted that the OLF should not ask to secede from the country due to the Oromia regions strategic position in the country. Instead, it was decided that a transitional government compromising of the OLF, EPRDF and various other rebel groups would be created.
Despite the tension, the two rebel groups worked together to capture the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Abeba, and bring down the remaining government forces. A national conference was convened and a transitional government was set up with the OLF having the second highest number of seats to the EPRDF.
The two groups were, however, unable to work together largely because the OLF could not handle the OPDO believing it to be an EPRDF ploy to limit the OLF's power and influence. Eventually, skirmishes began to break out between their military wings even though both groups had agreed to encamp their forces unil they could be properly transitioned into a national army. In 1992, the OLF announced that it was withdrawing from the government because of "harassment and assassinations of its members", in response, the EPRDF sent raiding parties to the encampment zones of OLA soldiers. The ensuing arrests and killings greatly reduced the Oromo Liberation Front's fighting power. 20,000 of its fighters were immediately arrested and thousands were killed in the raids on the camps. Some OLF soldiers were purposely kept out of camps by their commanders due to suspicion and mistrust of the EPRDF and those groups began to engage the EPRDF in battle. Despite initial victories, the EPRDF's superiority in numbers and weaponry eventually forced the OLF troops to wage a guerilla war instead.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38871c.html|title = Chronology for Oromo in Ethiopia[/tpl]
In the late 1990s, much of the OLF leadership escaped the country and the land controlled and administered by the OLF was given to the EPRDF. Thousands of civilians were arrested, killed and chased out of the country for suspicion of supporting or being OLF members.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.oromo.org/enocide-against-the-oromo-people-of-thiopia.html|title = Genocide against the Oromo people of Ethiopia?[/tpl] The EPRDF's success at quickly eliminating the OLF's military capability meant that the OLA could only wage a low-key struggle.

===2000s===

After the Ethiopia-Eritrean War, much of its leadership moved to Eritrea and its military wing began to get training and support from the Eritrean government. Between 2000 and 2005, the OLF membership fluctuated due to government crackdowns on Oromo student activism and general dissent. Despite this, the OLF was only further weakened when a faction broke away due to disagreements with the Secretary General Dawud Ibsa.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.oromoliberationfront.org/News/2011/OLF%20Statement%2004-06-2011.pdf|title = Statement of the OLF regarding new faction[/tpl] The fighting between these two factions, particularly in the Borana region of Oromia greatly weakened the OLF's ability to wage a war against the government.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In 2006, the OLA in southern Oromia retreated into Kenya in an attempt to regroup. That same year, Brigidier General Kemel Gelchu of the Ethiopian military took 100 of his soldiers and joined the OLF in Eritrea.[tpl]Cite news|title = Ethiopian commander joins rebels|date = 10 August 2006|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4779189.stm[/tpl] Despite initially aiding the OLF as leader of its military wing, in 2008, General Kemel Gelchu took matters into his own hands and announced that the OLF would lay down its weapons and abandon its previous goal of seceding Oromia and instead work as a political party to democratize Ethiopia.[tpl]Cite news|title = Kemal Gelchu’s faction of OLF clarifies position on Ethiopian Unity|date = January 2, 2012|url = http://www.ethiopianreview.us/35655[/tpl]  Along with this announcement, he commanded OLF soldiers in south Oromia to lay down their weapons and surrender to the government.[tpl]Cite news|title = As separatists in Ethiopia disarm, a new chapter for D.C.’s Oromo community|date = April 1, 2012|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/as-separatists-in-ethiopia-disarm-a-new-chapter-for-dcs-oromo-community/2012/04/01/gIQArnUtpS_story.html[/tpl] The central leadership of the OLF eventually announced that Kemel Gelchu had been removed from office but not before nearly half of the southern army of the OLF had surrendered. Kemel Gelchu and his troops in Eritrea formed their own OLF faction and allied themselves with Ginbot 7.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
On 20 November 2012, the main OLF faction and the faction that had broken away in the early 2000s announced reunification.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Alleged Terrorism==

Since the 1990s, the OLF has been accused of massacres and terrorist acts in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia which it has consistently denied. It had further claimed that the alleged massacres were committed by either the government or by disgruntled local Oromo farmers.
In 1998, at Bagalla on the border between Ethiopia and Kenya, 187 people were killed in a massacre believed to have been instigated by Borana Oromo tribesmen supported by the OLF .[tpl]Cite news|title = Africa  Massacre 'involved Oromos', says Kenya|date = 23 June 1999|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/376564.stm[/tpl]  It was estimated that several thousands of herds of livestock were stolen as well as 52 girls abducted. Most of this has led to tougher stance by the Kenyan government against the OLF.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.banadir.com/press.shtml|title = MOI DAY OR MASSACRE DAY?[/tpl] A quote from the BBC article states "the fighting was sparked when Degodia tribesmen allowed their cattle to graze on Borana land without asking permission.

In December 1991, it was reported that armed Oromos had attacked Amhara settlers in the Arsi Zone. According to a Human Rights Watch report, one hundred fifty-four Christians, mainly Amharas, were killed in Arba Guugu.  The report stated that the massacre was a result of exploitation of the animosity between Oromo and Amharas in that area by the previous government. The report went on to say that "OLF cadres instigated repeated attacks on Amhara settlers. Villages were burned and civilians were killed. "[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/WR93/Afw-01.htm|title = Ethiopia: Human Rights Developments[/tpl] According to University of Minnesota Human Right summary reports, the OLF admitted that its supporters might have carried out the massacre and "killed about 150 Amharas" in the area but it stated that the OLF had not planned or condoned the incidence.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/ins/ethiopia_amharas_93.html|title = Ethiopia: Status of Amharas[/tpl]
During the 1991-92 transition period, a massacre of 150 Amhara farmers which had been settled in Oromia was blamed on the Oromo Liberation Front. The killings are known as the Bodeno Massacre.

According to BBC reports dating as far back as 1999, OLF, along with other anti-Ethiopian elements operating in Ethiopia and Somalia, were receiving assistance from Eritrea as well as helping Eritrea during the Ethiopia-Eritrea 1998-2002 war.[tpl]Cite news|title = Africa  Ethiopia 'captures' Somali town|date = June 28, 1999|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/380472.stm[/tpl]  In April 1998, OLF held a congress in Mogadishu electing a more militant leadership.OLF in Mogadishu[tpl]Cite news|title = The Somali connection|date = 23 July 1999|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/07/99/battle_in_the_horn/399898.stm[/tpl] Eritrea also supported the Oromo fighters with a ship load of arms and additional 1,500 Oromo fighters being shipped from Eritrea to the south Somalia OLF training center of Qorioli.[tpl]Cite news|title = The Biggest War in the World|date = June 25, 1999|url = http://www.geocities.com/~dagmawi/NewsJuly99/June22_Gilkes.html[/tpl] In July 1999, OLF was stationed at the South Shabelle region and armed by Eritrea in order to fight Ethiopia during the border war.

However the Ethiopians, allied with the Somalia government temporarly stationed in Baidoa and the Puntland regional troops, attacked ICU and OLF bases in Southern Somalia.  OLF fighters who were arrested in Somalia admitted their involvement with the radical Islamists and admitted of being trained in Eritrea. They were noted being part of the 270 Oromo militants of OLF trained in Mogadishu with the Islamists before they were captured. Leaders of the Somali state, while talking about OLF's alliance with Al-Ithad and Al-Qaeda, stated that OLF's destabilizing influence in the horn of Africa should be addressed. Around seven OLF fighters surrendered to Kenyan authorities early in January 2007, in Garissa District. OLF captives also confirmed being deployed in Somalia from Eritrea. Some of the captured fighters stated that they lived in Yemen before joining the Front in Eritrea in order to fight for independence.

==Ideological base==

The fundamental objective of the Oromo liberation movement is to exercise the Oromo peoples' right to national self-determination and end centuries of oppression and exploitation. While self-determination for the Oromo people has been the main objective of OLF, the members and leaders of the party have not formed a consensus whether the exercising of self-determination by the Oromo people will be in the form of an independent Oromia, or as part of a democratic Ethiopia. But recently, it has taken a clear stance by stating that its goals is to form, if possible, a political union with other nations on the basis of equality, respect for mutual interests and the principle of voluntary associations. OLF had played a major role in the formation of the Transitional Government in 1991 following the fall of the Derg regime. However, OLF left the transitional government, alleging that its members were being intimidated, jailed, and killed in many part of Oromia. Since then OLF has been engaged in low-scale protracted armed struggle against the Ethiopian government.
The OLF believes the Oromo people still are being denied their fundamental rights,  still in centuries old of oppression by Ethiopian colonialism. According to OLF, Ethiopian colonialism has been led by Abyssinian Emperors which has been chiefly the Amhara ruling class until it was replaced by a Tigrayan-led government in early 1990s. OLF is one of the many Oromo political organizations in Ethiopia that are committed to the Oromo people who are endowed with the right to decide the type of sovereignty they want to live under and the type of political union they want to form with other peoples.Oromo liberation front briefs Oromo Liberation Front Beliefs
The OLF believes, that the change in government from the Derg regime in 1991, far from enables the Oromo people and others to realize their fundamental rights. The OLF reiterates the struggle of the Oromo people is not directed against any people but a system of oppression. In fact, the OLF implies that it is committed to the noble cause of laying a foundation for union of free peoples on the basis of their freely expressed will.Oromo Liberation Front mission
In January 2012, a press release announced that the OLF would no longer seek secession from Ethiopia.[tpl]Cite news | author=Argaw Ashine | title=Ethiopian rebels drop call for secession | newspaper=Daily Nation | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/Ethiopian+rebels+drop+call+for+secession+/-/1066/1299780/-/5mkrq3z/-/index.html | date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2012-01-03 [/tpl]  Instead, the group announced it would pursue unity and freedom, and work with other political groups.  However, a subsequent statement appearing on the OLF website claimed that an unauthorized splinter group, which did not represent the views of the OLF, had made the announcement.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.oromoliberationfront.org/News/2011/OLF_Statement_January_2012.pdf | title=OLF Statement on a Bogus Press Release in the Name of OLF | format=PDF | date=2012-02-02 | accessdate=2012-03-22 [/tpl]

==OLF policies==

On Peaceful Resolution of Conflicts in Ethiopia
OLF says that the root cause of political problems in Ethiopia is the policy of oppression by the former Imperial state of Ethiopia and refusal by the state to respect the rights of oppressed peoples to self-determination. The current Ethiopian government recognizes the right of self-determination of all states in its constitution, but it is accused of placing limitations imposed on the exercise of that right. OLF believes that there is an imperial domination that must be brought to an end in order to bring genuine peace and stability. Thus there is currently a policy of shelving political problems which must cease. The OLF says that it is ready to contribute towards any meaningful effort to reach at a comprehensive settlement to bring peace to all peoples. In the view of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) another issue with the OLF movement has been the movement's treatment of Oromos who don't support OLF's ideologies. This is part of the reason the EPRDF helped to form an organization called the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization. OLF has stated that they do not resent Oromos for being members of the OPDO.
