==Mission and Approach==

Founded in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, International Medical Corps is a private, voluntary, nonpolitical, nonsectarian organization that works to improve the quality of life through health interventions and related activities that build local capacity in under served communities worldwide.
International Medical Corps provides lifesaving relief while building self-reliance through programs that focus on education and training.  Approximately 96% of its field-based staff and health professionals are recruited from the local community, helping ensure that the skills stay within the area long after the program has ended.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org/Page.aspx?pid=393 |title=Our Approach |publisher=International Medical Corps |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl]
The emphasis on capacity building through education and training is central to all International Medical Corps programs.  Its central program priorities include: emergency response; health capacity building; women’s and children’s health and wellbeing; mental health; and clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.  In addition to these priorities, International Medical Corps also runs programs providing nutrition services, economic and agricultural livelihoods support, and prevention, testing, and care for communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
International Medical Corps is also a founding member of the ONE campaign[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.one.org/c/us/partner/ |title=Our Partners |publisher=ONE |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl] and part of the Clinton Global Initiative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/commitments/commitments_search.asp?Section=Commitments&PageTitle=Browse%20and%20Search%20Commitments&id=302467 |title=Commitments: Browse / Search Commitments |publisher=Clinton Global Initiative |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl]  Eighty-nine cents of every dollar goes directly to its field programs – one of the highest fundraising efficiencies in the industry – and International Medical Corps is an A+ rated charity by the American Institute of Philanthropy and a BBB accredited charity.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Borochoff |url=http://www.charitywatch.org/toprated.html#intrelief |title=Top-Rated Charities - American Institute of Philanthropy |publisher=Charitywatch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/international-medical-corps-in-santa-monica-ca-453 |title=Charity Review of International Medical Corps |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl]

==History==

International Medical Corps was founded by Dr. Robert Simon, a young emergency-room physician at UCLA Medical Center, who was moved to take action after learning about the plight of the Afghan people as a result of the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent occupation. All but 200 of the country’s 1,500 doctors had been executed, imprisoned, or exiled, and relief agencies had been ordered out of the country, worsening the shortage of doctors.
Simon began making trips to Afghanistan to provide medical assistance directly to civilians, eventually selling his Malibu home to finance a clinic in the battered Kunar River Valley. Eventually, understanding that a few new clinics would not meet the overwhelming health care needs of Afghans, Simon set up a full-time Afghan medical training center in the nearby – and relative security of - the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan.
At the end of one nine-month course, the Afghan medics trained by International Medical Corps were able to diagnose and treat 75-80 percent of the injuries and illnesses they encountered in the field. By 1990, International Medical Corps had graduated more than 200 medics who helped established 57 clinics and 10 hospitals in 18 provinces throughout rural Afghanistan.

==Current operations==

Today, International Medical works in some 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, providing relief to populations facing war, conflict, natural disaster, famine, and poverty while also laying the foundation for sustainable development.  Its programs are funded from both public and private sources, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), The United Nations, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and AmeriCares.http://internationalmedicalcorps.org/annualreport2011  
International Medical Corps is based in Los Angeles with other offices in Washington, DC, London, and Split, Croatia. They currently employ 4,500 employees and thousands of volunteers in some 30 countries.

==Responding to Emergencies==

Haiti Earthquake:  Just 22 hours after the earthquake hit, International Medical Corps was on the ground in Port-au-Prince providing emergency medical care.  They are still there offering medical care, training local health workers and building capacity to help the Haitian people return to self-reliance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org/Page.aspx?pid=801 |title=Where We Work: Haiti |publisher=International Medical Corps |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl]
Japan Earthquake and Tsunami: International Medical Corps was on the ground within 48 hours of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011, and has been supporting local partners to deliver critical humanitarian services ever since.  While Japan has significant capacity to manage emergencies, the magnitude of the disaster - coupled with the threat of radiation exposure - was large enough to warrant international assistance.  From building playgrounds to supporting day care workers and implementing disaster risk reduction programs, International Medical Corps has partenred with local and national organizations to ensure that relief and recovery needs of Japanese children, families and the elderly are being met.
