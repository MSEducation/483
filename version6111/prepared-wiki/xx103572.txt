==Career==

Tim Horner started wrestling in 1978 in the Alabama territory.
In 1984, while wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions, he formed The Lightning Express with Brad Armstrong. They won the Universal Wrestling Federation tag team title in 1987, defeating Sting and Rick Steiner. They also won the National Wrestling Alliance's National Tag Team title. In late 1988 and 1989 Horner wrestled for the WWF as a jobber in both singles and tag-team matches.
In the 1990s, Horner wrestled for World Championship Wrestling as the masked Star Blazer, and for Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). In SMW, he also played the original Kendo the Samurai (a masked samurai gimmick, also used by Scott Antol, Brian Logan, Dave Pillman and others) managed by Daryl Von Horn. Horner was co-owner of SMW, with Jim Cornette, until the two had a falling out. Thereafter, he competed in WCW as a jobber (sometimes teaming with Armstrong).
After WCW, he occasionally wrestled on independent shows in Georgia and Tennessee. He then worked in World Wrestling Entertainment as a producer for its SmackDown! brand, until October 26, 2006.
On June 16, 2013, he teamed with Tom Prichard to defeat Bob Orton, Jr. and George South at the Brad Armstrong Memorial Event.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=97046
