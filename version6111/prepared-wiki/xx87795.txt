==History==

The name of this town first appeared in documents in AD 998.
In the 15th century it grew into a fishing community and owed feudal allegiance to the Visconti family. It subsequently came under the control of the Borromeo family.
For centuries Stresa has been a popular retreat for Europe's aristocrats, who have endowed the town with a number of villas. Tourism increased substantially after tunneling of the Simplon Pass allowed train services from north of the Alps to pass through Stresa in 1906.
In 1948 American author and journalist, Ernest Hemingway visited the town. He had set part of his 1929 novel Farewell to Arms in the Grand Hotel des Iles Borromees.  In 2002 Stresa hosted the 10th International Hemingway Conference.
Stresa has played host to two notable political conferences in the 20th century:
Stresa is also the venue for the "Settimane Musicali"; one of Europe's important classical music international festivals which is held annually in the summer.

==Transport==

Regular boat services from the town's two docks provide access to the nearby Borromean Islands and a 20-minute cable car ride leads to the summit of Monte Mottarone, with the Giardino Botanico Alpinia en route.
