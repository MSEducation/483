In Haitian folklore, a zombie (Haitian Creole: zonbi) is an animated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | title = Zombie | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998[/tpl]
The concept has been popularly associated with the Vodou religion, but it plays no part in that faith's formal practices.

==Etymology==

The English word "zombie" was first used in the 1838 short story "The Unknown Painter", as zombi. The additional "e" was not added until the 1900s.[tpl]cite web|last=Gandhi|first=Lakshmi|title=Zoinks!

==Haitian tradition==

Zombies featured widely in Haitian rural folklore, as dead persons physically revived by the act of necromancy of a bokor sorcerer (the bokor is a witch-like figure to be distinguished from the houngan priests and mambo priestesses of the formal Vodou religion).  Zombies remain under the control of the bokor as their personal slaves, since they have no will of their own.
There also exists within the Haitian tradition, an incorporeal type of zombie, the "zombie astral", which is a part of the human soul that is captured by a bokor and used to enhance the bokor's spiritual power. Bokors produce and sell specially-decorated bottles to clients with an zombie astral inside, for the purposes of luck, healing or business success. It is believed that after a time God will take the soul back and so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity.*McAlister, Elizabeth. 1995.“A Sorcerer's Bottle:  The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti.” In Donald J. Cosentino, ed.,  Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou. UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 1995: 304–321.”
It has been suggested that the two types of zombie reflect soul dualism, a belief of Haitian Vodou.  Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit).Davis, Wade (1985), The Serpent and the Rainbow, New York: Simon & Schuster, pp 186
The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans, and their subsequent experiences in the New World.  It was thought that the Vodou deity Baron Samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa ("Guinea"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by feeding them salt.  A number of scholars have pointed out the significance of the zombie figure as a metaphor for the history of slavery in Haiti.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html |title=A Zombie Is a Slave Forever |location=Haiti |work=The New York Times |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=31 October 2012[/tpl]
While most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures, a connection has also been suggested to the island's indigenous Taíno people, partly based on an early account of native shamanist practices written by the Hieronymite monk Ramón Pané, a companion of Christopher Columbus.The relación of Fray Ramón Pane[tpl]cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Neal L.|title=Of Cannibals and Kings: Primal Anthropology in the Americas|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|pages=39 - 41[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Edmonds|first1=Ennis B.|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Michelle A.|title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction|date=2010|publisher=NYU Press|page=111[/tpl] 
The Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the United States occupation of Haiti (1915 - 1934), when a number of case histories of purported "zombies" began to emerge.  The first popular book covering the topics was William Seabrook's The Magic Island (1929).
Seabrooke cited the Haitian criminal code as what he considered official recognition of zombies - Article 246 (passed 1864), later to be used in promotional materials for the 1932 film White Zombie, reads in part:
In 1937, while researching folklore in Haiti, Zora Neale Hurston encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village, and a family claimed she was Felicia Felix-Mentor, a relative who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29. However, the woman had been examined by a doctor, who found on X-ray that she did not have the leg fracture that Felix-Mentor was known to have had.[tpl]cite jstor|2792947[/tpl] Hurston pursued rumors that the affected persons were given a powerful psychoactive drug, but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information. She wrote: "What is more, if science ever gets to the bottom of Vodou in Haiti and Africa, it will be found that some important medical secrets, still unknown to medical science, give it its power, rather than gestures of ceremony."[tpl]Cite book|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|title=Dust Tracks on a Road|publisher=2nd Ed. (1942: Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984, p. 205)[/tpl]

===Chemical hypothesis===

Several decades after Hurston's work,  Wade Davis, a Harvard ethnobotanist, presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a 1983 paper in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology,Davis, Wade (1983), The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 9: 85-104. and later in two popular books, The Serpent and the Rainbow (1985) and Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie (1988).
Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream (usually via a wound). The first, coup de poudre (French: "powder strike"), includes tetrodotoxin (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the pufferfish (order Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of dissociative drugs such as datura. Together, these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of Clairvius Narcisse, who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders, is part of a recently buried child's brain.Davis, Wade (1985), The Serpent and the Rainbow, New York: Simon & Schuster, pp 92-95Davis, Wade (1988), Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie, University of North Carolina Press, pp 115-116.http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin/[tpl]verify-inline|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike suspended animation, followed by re-awakening — typically after being buried — into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and psychological trauma was hypothesised by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they "knew" they were dead, and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect.
Davis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep "zombies" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.Booth, W. (1988), "Voodoo Science", Science, 240: 274–277. Symptoms of TTX poisoning range from numbness and nausea to paralysis — particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm — unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance. According to psychologist Terence Hines, the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state, and Davis' assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous.Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; Skeptical Inquirer; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; Pages 60–62.

===Social hypothesis===

Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion, in the context of schizophrenia and other mental illness, suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification.[tpl]Cite book|last=Oswald|first=Hans Peter|title=Vodoo|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|date=2009|page=39|isbn=3-8370-5904-9[/tpl]  Particularly, this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of catatonia.
Roland Littlewood, professor of anthropology and psychiatry, published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal The Lancet in 1997.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Littlewood |first1=Roland |author2=Chavannes Douyon|title=Clinical findings in three cases of zombification|journal=The Lancet|date=11 October 1997|volume=350|issue=9084|pages=1094 - 1096|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)04449-8/fulltext|accessdate=28 March 2014 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)04449-8[/tpl] 
The social explanation sees observed cases of people identified as zombies as a culture-bound syndrome, with a particular cultural form of adoption practiced in Haiti that unites the homeless and mentally ill with grieving families who see them as their "returned" lost loved ones, as Littlewood summarizes his findings in an article in Times Higher Education:

==African and related legends==

A Central or West African origin for the Haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the Kongo language, nzambi ("god") and zumbi ("fetish").  This root helps form the names of several deities, including the Kongo creator deity Nzambi a Mpungu and the Louisiana serpent deity Li Grand Zombi (a local version of the Haitian Damballa), but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit.[tpl]cite book|last1=Moreman|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Rushton||first2=Cory James|title=Race, Oppression and the Zombie: Essays on Cross-Cultural Appropriations of the Caribbean Tradi|date=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=3[/tpl]  The common African conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal "zombie astral", as in the the Kongo Nkisi spirits.
A related, but also often incorporeal, undead being is the jumbee of the English-speaking Caribbean, considered to be of the same etymology;[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=Brian L.|title=Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana, 1838-1900|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|pages=147 - 149[/tpl] in the French West Indies also, local "zombies" are recognized, but these are of a more general spirit nature.[tpl]cite book|last=Dayan|first=Joan|title=Haiti, History, and the Gods|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|page=37[/tpl] 
The idea of physical zombie-like creatures is present in some South African cultures, where they are called xidachane in Sotho/Tsonga and maduxwane in Venda.  In some communities it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=84[/tpl] It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough sangoma.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=98[/tpl] It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that witches can zombify a person into by killing and possessing the victim's body in order to force it into slave labor.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Niehaus |first= Isak |title=Witches and Zombies of the South African Lowveld: Discourse, Accusations and Subjective Reality |journal= The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2005|volume= 11| pages =197–198 |issue= 2 [/tpl] After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers, stories emerged about "witch trains". These trains appeared ordinary, but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch. The trains would abduct a person boarding at night, and the person would then either be turned into a zombified worker, or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location.

==In popular culture==

As fictional  undead creatures, zombies are  regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed works. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian folklore, their links to such folklore are unclear. Many consider George A. Romero's film Night of the Living Dead to be the progenitor of these creatures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|author=J.C. Maçek III|work=PopMatters|title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead|date=15 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title= Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human|editor= Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro|page=169|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&pg=PA57|isbn=978-0-8232-3447-9 |publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=2011[/tpl] Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, all drawing on European folklore of the undead. The popularity of zombies in movies has led to them sometimes having been taken out of their usual element of horror and thrown into other genres, for example the comedy film Shaun of the Dead. The "zombie apocalypse" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has become a staple of modern popular art. By 2011 the influence of zombies in popular consciousness had reached far enough that the United States government's Center for Disease Control used the idea as a theme to promote disaster preparedness.Boston Globe The CDC want you to prepare for the zombie apocalypse by Jesse Nunes 20 May 2011
