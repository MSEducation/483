[[Northeast Hoosier Conference]]

CATEGORIES: Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA), Indiana high school athletic conferences, High school sports conferences and leagues in the United States

An eight-member IHSAA-Sanctioned Athletic Conference within the Northeastern Indiana counties of Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Noble, Wells, and Whitley. The conference was started in 1989 when six schools from the Northeastern Indiana Athletic Conference (Bellmont, Columbia City, DeKalb, East Noble, Homestead, and New Haven) joined with two schools from the Allen County Athletic Conference (Fort Wayne Carroll and Norwell). There have been no membership changes since the conference began. On July 1, 2015, the conference will cease to exist, as all schools are pulling out of the conference. Six of the schools (Bellmont, Columbia City, DeKalb, East Noble, New Haven, and Norwell) will join with Huntington North of the North Central Conference and Leo of the Allen County Athletic Conference to join a new league (possibly retaining the NHC conference moniker), while Carroll and Homestead are joining the Summit Athletic Conference in football and basketball for 2015.
