[[Genital modification and mutilation]]

CATEGORIES: Genital modification

The terms genital modification and genital mutilation can refer to permanent or temporary changes to human sex organs. Some forms of genital alteration are performed at the behest of an adult, with their informed consent. Other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations by different groups of people.

==Body modification==

Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. Penile subincision, or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of Indigenous Australians.  This procedure has taken root in Western body modification culture. Meatotomy is a form that involves splitting of the glans penis alone, while genital bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.
Genital piercings and genital tattooing may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing sexual pleasure for the pierced individual or their sex partners.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html |title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] Similarly, Pearling involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina.
Clitoris enlargement may be achieved temporarily through the use of a clitoral pump, or it may be achieved permanently through application of testosterone cream to the clitoris, or through injectable testosterone.  Penis enlargement is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

==Voluntary sex reassignment==

People who are transgender may undergo sex reassignment surgery in order to modify their bodies to match their gender identity. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.Cuypere, G., T’Sjoen, G., Beerten, R., Selvaggi, G., Sutter, P., Hoebeke, P., Monstrey, S., Vansteenwegen, A., & Rubens, R. (2005). Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 34(6), 679-690. doi:10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5 Some of the surgical procedures are breast augmentation and vaginoplasty for transwomen and mastectomy, metoidioplasty, and phalloplasty for transmen. Transwomen may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery while some transmen may have liposuction to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

==Involuntary sex assignment==

Intersex children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to genital surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of the genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic benefits. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them infertile.ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery The Intersex Society of North America, Dated February 7, 1998 For example, in cases involving male children with micropenis, doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George. P Chrousos, MD, FAAP, MACP, MACE, FRCP, Merrily P M Poth, MD, Stephen Kemp, MD, PhD Microphallus: Epidemiology Medscape, Updated August 3, 2011 The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) objects to elective surgeries performed on people without their informed consent on grounds that such surgeries subject patients to unnecessary harm and risk.What's ISNA's position on surgery? - The Intersex Society of North America
In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to genital injury. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to circumcision damaging their penises beyond repair,Gearhart JP, Rock JA.

==In disease or medical necessity==

If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed.  Biological females may undergo vaginectomy, while males may undergo penectomy.  Reconstructive surgery may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in sex reassignment surgery.
Similarly, during childbirth, episiotomy is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.  Advocates of natural childbirth and unassisted birth state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.
Hymenotomy is the surgical perforation of an imperforate hymen.  It may be performed to allow menstruation to occur.  An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate sexual penetration of her vagina.

==Self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation==

A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as castration, penectomy, or clitoridectomy. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to skoptic syndrome, personal crisis related to gender identity, mental illness, self-mutilation, body dysmorphia, or social reasons.

==Female genitals==

Cosmetic surgery of female genitalia, known as elective genitoplasty, has become pejoratively known as designer vagina. In May 2007, an article published in the British Medical Journal strongly criticised the "designer vagina" craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.[tpl]cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei| coauthors = Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = British Medical Journal| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941[/tpl]  Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.

===Female genital mutilation===

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other surgery of the female genital organs whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."Definition of the World Health Organization  It is not the same as the procedures used in gender reassignment surgery or the genital modification of intersexuals. It is practiced throughout the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East. There is much controversy surrounding infibulation procedures, due to concerns regarding the safety and consequences of the procedure.  In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practiced in many societies.[tpl]cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine |url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc |publisher=Nthword.com |accessdate=2010-11-07[/tpl]

===Hymenorrhaphy===

Hymenorrhaphy refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue.  The newly created hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina.  This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female virginity at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of consummation of her marriage.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Individuals who are victims of rape, who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===

Labia stretching is the act of elongating the labia minora through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php, "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm, "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22 It is a familial cultural practice in Rwanda, common in Sub-Saharan Africa,http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf, "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19 and a body modification practice elsewhere. It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.

===Labiaplasty and Vaginoplasty===

Some women undergo vaginoplasty or labiaplasty procedures to alter the shape of their vulvas to meet personal aesthetic standards.The Perfect Vagina Documentary Retrieved [tpl]Nowrap|13 February 2011[/tpl]. The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".Green, Fiona: "From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting."

===Clitoral hood reduction===

Clitoral hood reduction, also termed clitoral hoodectomy,Gynecological cosmetic surgery: Expert Rev. Obstet. Gynecol. 4(2), 101-104 (2009): "The procedures described under female esthetic genital suergery are reduction labiaplasty, vaginaplasty, liposuction to mons pubis, fat injections to labia majora or mons, clitoral hoodectomy, hymenorrhaphy, 'G-spot amplication', and the use of a surgical laser in 'vaginal rejuvenation'." clitoral unhooding,Clitorolabial Reconstruction in Circumcised Females with Clitoral Inclusion Cyst: "It is very clear from the Prophet’s instruction to perform partial hoodectomy.

It is a form of hoodplasty. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a labiaplasty procedure for reducing the labia minora; and occasionally within a vaginoplasty procedure. These procedures are part, when done on individuals without their free personal consent as adults, and form of Female Genital Mutilation crimes.

==Male genitals==

===Castration===

Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context involves the amputation of the testicles. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common.

===Circumcision===

Male circumcision is the removal of part or all of the foreskin. It is a procedure usually performed for religious, cultural or medical reasons, and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. The age at which circumcision may be performed varies widely, with groups such as Americans and Jews typically circumcising in the neonatal period, and African tribes such as the Maasai and Xhosa circumcising in teenage years as an initiation into adulthood.
In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe phimosis or recurrent balanitis. Advocacy is often centered around preventive medicine while opposition is often centered around human rights (particularly those of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure. The World Health Organization estimates that roughly 30% of the world's men are circumcised, the majority being Muslims.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf| title = Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability| accessdate = 2009-03-04| year = 2007| publisher = World Health Organization|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Foreskin restoration===

Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the foreskin after its removal by circumcision. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the scrotum onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve tissue expansion by stretching the penile skin forward over the glans penis with the aid of tension. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===

Infibulation of males involves suturing the foreskin together over the head of the penis. In ancient Greece, public performers practiced a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a kynodesme. In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of BDSM.

===Pearling===

Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===

Penis removal involves the amputation of penis. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with castration, or alternatively referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on eunuchs and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a harem. The Hijra of India may remove their penis as a part of their gender identity. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of gangrene or cancer. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.
Penis removal for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in Thailand. Lorena Bobbit famously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In cases of accidental removal, the penis may be able to be reattached.

===Penile subincision===

Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a urethrotomy and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the meatus towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the Indigenous Australians, the Arrente, the Luritja, the Samburu, the Samoans, and the Native Hawaiians. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after ejaculation), and will require a man to sit down while urinating. As the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, exsanguination, or permanent damage are major concerns.

===Penile superincision===

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the glans penis without removing skin or tissue. It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to circumcision when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
