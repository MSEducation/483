The Holy Body Tattoo is a now defunct award-winning Canadian contemporary dance company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Formed in 1993 by co-artistic directors and choreographers Noam Gagnon and Dana Gingras, who had performed together since 1987, and also Jean-Yves Th√©riault composer-musician and co-founder of Voivod, initially as a multi-media dance company, they have performed throughout Canada, Europe, Asia, and the United States, and received international critical acclaim as well.
Their works often comment on modern life through repetitive and strenuous physical movement that pushes performers to the point of exhaustion. This technique is based on the idea that the secrets locked within the body will be revealed when pushed to its limit.
The company has been Artist in Residence at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre since 1998 and has captured a number of significant awards and honours for both its stage and film work. In 1997, our brief eternity won The Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Ensemble Performance.
Their performances have included collaborations with musical, visual, and literary artists including author William Gibson, UK bands Tindersticks and The Tiger Lillies, visual artist Jenny Holzer and Bill Pechet.
Their repertoire includes the works White Riot and Poetry & Apocalypse (1994); our brief eternity (1996); Circa (2000), a tango-influenced pas de deux; Running Wild (2004); and monumental (2005), which explored modern anxiety in urban corporate culture.
Poetry & Apocalypse was adapted into a film in 1997 by William Morrison (director).
