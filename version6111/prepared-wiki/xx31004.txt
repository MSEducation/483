Ice hockey began with the women's competition; Sweden defeated Russia 3–1 in the first match while Canada's team opened with the second most lopsided win in Olympic history by beating the host Italians 16–0.

===Day 3===

On February 12, Latvia won its first winter Olympic medal when Mārtiņš Rubenis took the bronze in the men's luge. Armin Zöggeler's win in that event gave Italy its first gold medal of the Games. Both the Canadian and American women's ice hockey teams posted their second straight shutout wins.

===Day 4===

Chinese figure skating pair Zhang Dan and Zhang Hao, trailing a dominant Russian pair, attempted a throw quadruple salchow jump—an element which had never been successfully completed in competition. Zhang Dan fell, injuring her knee, but the pair finished their program to a standing ovation and took the silver medal. Russia finished the third day of competition with two gold medals, as did the United States.

===Day 5===

The fourth day saw the two North American women's hockey teams finish out pool play with their third win each. Evgeni Plushenko of Russia set a world record score in the men's figure skating short program; his 90.66 points was more 10 points better than the nearest opponent's score. The men's combined alpine skiing was riddled with disqualifications, including front-runners Bode Miller and Benjamin Raich. American Ted Ligety won the event in what was considered an upset.

===Day 6===

Canada had another strong day on February 15, setting new Olympic records in both men's and women's pursuit team speed skating events as well as opening the men's ice hockey competition with a win against Italy. Italy finished the day with the men's pursuit team Olympic record, however, after the Netherlands bettered Canada's time only to have Italy improve upon theirs. China won its first gold of 2006 with Wang Meng's victory in the women's individual 500-metre short track speed skating. A pair of Austrian brothers Andreas Linger and Wolfgang Linger won the men's doubles luge while Michaela Dorfmeister gave the nation another championship in the women's downhill.

===Day 7===

LGBT figure skater Jeffrey Buttle from Canada won the bronze that year in fact, he is the only non-European man in the top 3 during the mens individual. It was the only medals for him and Stéphane Lambiel from Switzerland.

===Day 8===

On February 17, Tanja Frieden of Switzerland took the gold in women's snowboard cross after Lindsey Jacobellis of the United States fell on the second-to-last jump while performing an unnecessary method grab. Jacobellis settled for silver, while Canada's Dominique Maltais took bronze after recovering from a crash. Duff Gibson of Canada took gold in the skeleton just ahead of fellow Canadian Jeff Pain, becoming the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Olympics history. Rodney Hiner of the United States took home the Bronze. In the women's ice hockey semifinals, the United States lost a shootout to Sweden, marking the first time in international competition that the United States had lost to anyone other than Canada (Canada's win maintained its record of never having lost to anyone other than the United States).

===Day 9===

Kjetil André Aamodt won gold for Norway in the men's Super G on February 18, beating Hermann Maier of Austria. Germans Kati Wilhelm and Martina Glagow finished first and second in the 10 kilometre biathlon pursuit. The host Italians defeated Canada in men's curling, while Switzerland did the same in men's ice hockey to put the Canadians on the wrong end of two major upsets in the same day. The United States men's ice hockey team suffered its first loss of the tournament as Slovakia and Russia continue their dominance of the pool.

===Day 10===

Lascelles Brown became the first Jamaican-born competitor to win a medal at the Winter Olympics on February 19, competing on the Canadian 2-man bobsleigh team which finished second in an extremely tight competition. The German pair was only .21 seconds ahead of the Canadians, themselves only .14 ahead of the Swiss team. Finland continued to be unbeaten in men's ice hockey, handing Canada its second loss.
The day also saw the most hyped event of these games, at least in Europe, as the Men's 10 km Cross Country Relay was scheduled. The battle stemmed from the Lillehammer games 12 years ago in which Italy out-dueled Norway in that very same event. To that extent, many Norwegians wanted to win this event in order to embarrass the Italians on their home turf, but it was not to be as Italy crushed the field winning over Germany by over 15 seconds to take their 5th straight gold in this event. Norway failed to medal for the first time since 1988.

===Day 11===

The final day of curling pool play was February 20; Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada advanced to the women's semifinals while Finland, Canada, the United States, and Great Britain qualified in the men's competition. Austria took their first team gold medal in ski jumping, while Canada took their second in women's ice hockey to take a 2–1 lead over the United States in all-time Olympic championships.

===Day 12===

Slovakia and Finland both won their final men's ice hockey games on February 21 to win their respective pools with 5–0–0 records. Enrico Fabris gave the host nation another gold medal in speed skating by winning the men's 1500 metres.

===Day 13===

On February 22, the twelfth day of competition, Anja Pärson won her first gold medal in the women's slalom; it was her fifth overall Olympic medal and third of the 2006 Games. Chandra Crawford took a quicker route to the top of the podium, winning the 1.1 kilometre cross-country sprint gold in her Olympic debut. In the men's ice hockey quarterfinals, the previously undefeated Slovakians lost to the Czech Republic while Russia, Finland, and Sweden eliminated Canada, the United States, and Switzerland, respectively. Philipp Schoch successfully defended his snowboarding giant slalom gold against his brother Simon.

===Day 14===

Sweden took the women's championship in the curling finals held on February 23. Shizuka Arakawa gave Japan its first gold medal of the Games and first figure skating gold medal, winning the ladies' figure skating competition in part by being able to finish without falling, as Sasha Cohen and Irina Slutskaya both tumbled. Russia wrested the gold medal in women's team biathlon from two-time defending champions Germany.

===Day 15===

February 24 was the day of the men's curling finals, in which Canada won its first gold medal and the United States won its first medal in the sport as Canada defeated Finland and the United States beat Great Britain for the second time. The figure skating gala was also held, with top placers in all of the events performing exhibitions. Sweden and Finland won their men's ice hockey semifinal games, defeating the Czech Republic and Russia.

===Day 16===

The Austrians swept the men's alpine slalom medals on February 25, led by Benjamin Raich. Germany took gold medals in the men's 15 kilometer biathlon and the men's individual bobsleigh. Apolo Anton Ohno won his second short track speed skating gold medal, with only somewhat less controversy than his first 4 years earlier. South Korea's Jin Sun-Yu wins her third gold of the Games in the women's 1000 m. Compatriot Ahn Hyun-Soo wins his third gold medal of the Games, medaling in every men's short track event and bringing his total number of medals in Turin to four.

===Day 17 (Closing ceremony)===

The final day of competition and the closing ceremony, were held on February 26. The Swedish men's ice hockey team handed Finland their first loss in the final to take the gold medal. In the closing ceremony, Manuela Di Centa, a seven-time Olympic medalist from Italy and then-member of the International Olympic Committee, was scheduled to present the medals for the men's 50-kilometre cross-country skiing event. This resulted in her presenting the gold medal to her own brother when Giorgio Di Centa won the event to take his second gold medal.

==Venues==

===Olympic areas===

Olympic events were mainly held in Turin, but other events (namely skiing, snowboarding, and the track sports) were held in mountainous outlying villages for obvious reasons.

====Turin====

Many venues were located in the Olympic District in central Turin, including:

==Participating National Olympic Committees==

A record 80 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) entered athletes at the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. This was an increase of two from the 78 represented at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants that NOC contributed.  It was the first appearance for Albania, Ethiopia and Madagascar. It was the only appearance at the Winter Olympics for Serbia and Montenegro, coming between their change of name in 2003 and Montenegro's vote for independence in May.
 
 

==Organization==

Out of 40,000 applicants, 20,000 volunteers were selected to help the athletes, spectators, and journalists, and to prepare the competition sites. They were selected by the recruiting program Noi2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.torino2006.org/ENG/OlympicGames/spirito_olimpico/volontari.html |title=Noi2006 – The Volunteers Programme |accessdate=April 19, 2007[/tpl]

===Construction===

Sixty-five sporting facilities, various infrastructures, sport villages for athletes and media, and transportation infrastructures were constructed for a total of 1.7 billion euros.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thechronicle.us/news.php?id=975 |title=Winter Olympics Return to Italy Opening Ceremonies Begin February 10 in Turin |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060208163059/http://www.thechronicle.us/news.php?id=975 |archivedate=February 8, 2006 |author=Villani, Ron |accessdate=April 19, 2007[/tpl]
Among the most important sporting facilities that were used:
The most important transport infrastructure works were:
In the city, the main developments were the Palafuksas, a glass building designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the new Modern Art Gallery and the great project of the "Spina", that will provide urban regeneration over an area of 2 million square meters through the construction of an underground urban railway and the re-utilization of abandoned industrial areas.

==Broadcasting rights==

The 2006 Winter Olympic Games were broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters:

==Controversies==

The Games had issues with costs covering and international attendance. Due to a lack of funding by the Italian Government, Toroc risked dissolution. American skier Bode Miller was also a focus of controversy in his home country and Canada, where his actions were not considered in line with the Olympic spirit.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]

===Metro===

The metro was finally opened to the public on February 4, 2006, after a 45-day delay. It operated on a shorter stretch (XVIII Dicembre (Porta Susa) to Fermi – 11 stations) than originally forecast; it finally reached the main railway station (Porta Nuova) and the rest of the city centre more than one year after the Games, in October 2007. For the duration of the Games, a single ticket (5 euros) covered use of both the metro and other means of public transportation for a whole day. However, during the Games, metro service stopped at 6:00 pm, making it impractical for spectators of evening events. Furthermore, the metro did not reach any of the Olympic venues. On the other hand, the bus service was heavily improved for the Games, although still inadequate at night hours.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]

===Doping===

Italian police raided the Austrian athletes' quarter in search of evidence of doping. The raid was conducted due to suspicions over the presence of biathlon coach Walter Mayer, who had been banned from all Olympic events up to and including the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010 due to previous doping convictions. Around the time of the raid Mayer and two Austrian biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, tried to escape and fled back to Austria. Later, the Austrian ski federation president said that the two athletes told him they "may have used illegal methods".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.steroid.com/sitenews/?EC=ReadArticle&ArticleID=17 |title=Italians take hard line against steroids |author=Couch, Greg |date=February 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdU7iRH | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] After some days the results of the tests of all 10 tested Austrian athletes were presented and were all negative.

===Ratings and attendance===

A number of events reported low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales. Preliminary competition and locally less popular sports failed to attract capacity crowd as expected. Organizers explained this was because blocks of seats were reserved or purchased by sponsors and partners who later did not show up at the events.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
Several news organizations reported that many Americans were not as interested in the Olympics as in years past.[tpl]cite news |title=Ciao to the Winter Games |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/26/AR2006022600137_pf.html |date=February 26, 2006 |author=Shipley, Amy |work=Washington Post |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdUojem | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] It has been suggested that reasons for this lack of interest include the tape delayed coverage, which showed events in prime-time as much as 18 hours later in the Western United States, and also due to the lack of success achieved by big-name American athletes.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/winter06/columns/story?id=2345588 |title=The best, and real, drama is always at Olympics |date=February 26, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |author=Caple, Jim |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdVCBFE | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl]  Primetime viewing figures in Canada were also disappointing, especially after the early exit of the Canadian men's hockey team,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060223.wxolyblues0223_3/BNStory/Torino2006/home |title=Olympic hockey loss misses the net for CBC ratings |author=McArthur, Keith; Robertson, Grant |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdVq0zP | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail[/tpl] though overall viewing figures were up from 2002.[tpl]cite news |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2006/02/23/1457768.html |title=Olympics lose against fake games |author=Brioux, Bill |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Olympic Legacy==

The Olympics represented an opportunity to revamp the city's look and change its traditional image as an industrial city by showing the world its hidden side of vibrant cultural life and stunning architectures.
Thanks to the olympic exposure and state of the art venues, Turin has become one of Italy's primary tourist destinations and has been established as an important sport center in Europe.http://www.olympic.org/news/turin-enjoys-on-going-tourism-legacy-of-2006-winter-games/222028
Since 2006, TOP (Torino Olympic Park) had been the agency in charge of managing the Olympic facilities.

==Security measures==

As with every Olympics since the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics and increasingly since the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympics, there was heavy security due to fears of terrorism.
The organizers further increased security measureshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/06/AR2006020600655.html [tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl] in connection with the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and insisted that the Olympic Games were going to be safe, which they were; the Olympics concluded without a major breach of security occurring.
