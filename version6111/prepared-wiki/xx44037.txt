A black bloc is a tactic for protests and marches where individuals wear black clothing, scarves, sunglasses, ski masks, motorcycle helmets with padding, or other face-concealing and face-protecting items.Autonomia and the Origin of the Black Bloc. Retrieved 7 November 2008.[tpl]Cite news|last=Carlson|first=Kathryn Blaze|title=Black Bloc & Blue|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/Black+Bloc+Blue/3155069/story.html|accessdate=15 June 2010|newspaper=National Post|date=15 June 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qVr8Egub|archivedate=15 June 2010[/tpl] The clothing is used to conceal marchers' identities and hinder criminal prosecution, by making it difficult to distinguish between participants. It is also used to protect their faces and eyes from items such as pepper-spray which law enforcement often uses to stun. The tactic allows the group to appear as one large unified mass, and promotes solidarity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2008/10/11/fashion-tips-for-the-brave/|title=Fashion Tips for the Brave|publisher=CrimethInc.|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl] Black bloc participants are often associated with anarchism.
The tactic was developed in the 1980s in the European autonomist movement's protests against squatter evictions, nuclear power and restrictions on abortion among other things.  Black blocs gained broader media attention outside Europe during the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, when a black bloc damaged property of GAP, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other multinational retail locations in downtown Seattle.
Black blocs are an occasional tactic used by people who may also use other protest tactics at different times.

==History==

===German origins===

This tactic was developed following increased use of police force following the 1977 Brokdorf demonstration[tpl]cite web| publisher= TopFoto |url= http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/Germany1963_1988/ppages/ppage37.html | type = gallery | title = History of Germany 1963–1988 | first = Ullstein | last = Bild |date=19 February 1977 | place = UK | accessdate=13 August 2011 | page = 37[/tpl][tpl]cite web| publisher = TopFoto |url = http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/Germany1963_1988/ppages/ppage39.html | type = gallery | title = History of Germany 1963–1988 | first = Ullstein Bild | place = UK |date=19 February 1977 |language= German |accessdate= 13 August 2011 | page = 39[/tpl][tpl]cite web| page = 40 | publisher = TopFoto |url= http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/Germany1963_1988/ppages/ppage40.html | type = gallery | title = History of Germany 1963–1988 | first = Ullstein | last = Bild | place =UK |date=19 February 1977 |language=German |accessdate= 13 August 2011[/tpl] by the German police in 1980, particularly aimed at anti-nuclear activists and squatters.  Key areas for this development were Hafenstraße, Hamburg, and Kreuzberg, Berlin.  These were social spaces occupied by dissidents who preferred to create their own social institutions based on communal living and alternative community centres.  In June 1980, the German Police forcefully evicted the Free Republic of Wendland, an anti-nuclear protest camp in Gorleben, Wendland. This attack on 5,000 peaceful protesters led many former pacifists to become willing to use violent methods. By December 1980 the Berlin City Government organised an escalating cycle of mass arrests, followed by other local authorities across West Germany. The squatters resisted by opening new squats, as the old ones were evicted. Following the mass arrest of squatters in Freiburg, demonstrations were held in their support in many German cities. The day was dubbed Black Friday following a demonstration in Berlin at which between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets and destroyed an expensive shopping area. The tactic of wearing identical black clothes and masks meant that the autonomen were better able to resist the police and elude identification. The German media labeled them der schwarze Block ("the black block").
In 1986 Hamburg squatters mobilised following attacks on the Hafenstraße. A demonstration of 10,000 took to the streets surrounding at least 1,500 people in a black bloc. They carried a large banner saying "Build Revolutionary Dual Power!" At the end of the march, the black bloc then engaged in street fighting that forced the police to retreat.  The next day 13 department stores in Hamburg were set alight, causing nearly $10 million in damage. Later that year, following the Chernobyl disaster, militant anti-nuclear activists used the tactic.
On 1 May 1987, demonstrators in Berlin-Kreuzberg were confronted by West German police.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kreuzberger-chronik.de/chroniken/2004/mai/geschichte.html | work =Kreuzberger Chronik | title = Der Mythos von Bolle – Sie lesen das Original! aus Berlin-Kreuzberg | place = DE |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl] After this, thousands of people attacked the police with rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails. The riots became famous after the police had to completely pull out of the so-called "SO 36" Neighborhood in Kreuzberg for several hours, and rioters looted shops together with residents.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article198052/Die_Nacht_als_Bolle_in_Kreuzberg_abbrannte.html |title=Die Nacht, als Bolle in Kreuzberg abbrannte | place = Berlin | work = Berliner Morgenpost |date=30 April 2007 |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]
When Ronald Reagan came to Berlin in June 1987, he was met by around 50,000 demonstrators protesting against his Cold War policies. This included a black bloc of 3,000 people. In November 1987, the residents were joined by thousands of other protesters and fortified their squat, built barricades in the streets and defended themselves against the police for nearly 24 hours. After this the city authorities legalised the squatters residence.
On 1 May 1988, radical left groups organised a May Day demonstration through Berlin-Kreuzberg, ending in riots even heavier than the year before. The police were attacked with steel balls fired by slingshots, stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. On 2 May, headline of the Berlin newspaper B.Z. was "Beirut?? Nein, das ist Berlin!" (Beirut?? No, it’s Berlin!). The riots finally became a tradition in Berlin-Kreuzberg and have recurred every 1 May since, but never as fatally as in the first two years.[tpl]cite web| first1 =Peter | last1 = Neumann | first2 = Jan | last2 = Thomsen |url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/0216/berlin/0032/ |title= Kreuzberger übernehmen Vorbereitung für den 1.

Numbering around 80,000, the protesters greatly outnumbered the police. Officials tried to maintain control by banning all demonstrations and attacking public assemblies. Nevertheless, there were riots and upmarket shopping areas were destroyed.[tpl]Citation | first = AG | last = Grauwacke | contribution = We Will Disrupt this Conference: Resistance to the 1988 IMF and World Bank Conference in West Berlin| publisher = Dissent Network! | title = Days of Dissent: Reflections on Summit Mobilisations | url = http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm | place = UK[/tpl][tpl]Citation | language = German | first = AG | last = Grauwacke | title = Autonome in Bewegung: aus der ersten 23 Jahren | publisher = Association A | ISBN = 3-935936-13-3[/tpl]

===21st century===

In the period after the Berlin Wall, the German black bloc movement continued traditional riots such as May Day in Berlin-Kreuzberg, but with decreasing intensity. Their main focus became the struggle against the recurring popularity of Neo-Nazism in Germany. The "turn" came in June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit. A black bloc of 2,000 people built barricades, set cars alight and attacked the police during a mass demonstration in Rostock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,486280,00.html |title=G-8-Protest: Randale in Rostock - 430 verletzte Polizisten - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Politik |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl] 400 police officers were injured, and also about 500 demonstrators and activists. According to the German Verfassungsschutz, the weeks of organisation before the demonstration and the riots themselves were amounted to a revival for the militant left in Germany. Since the "Battle of Rostock", traditional "May Day Riots" after demonstrations every 1 May in Berlin, and since 2008 also in Hamburg, became more intense, and violence of the autonomen against police officers and political enemies at demonstrations of radical left groups have dramatically increased.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-78832416.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 23/2011 - Verfassungsschutz warnt vor linker Militanz |publisher=Spiegel.de |language=German |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]
In Egypt after the Egyptian revolution in year 2013 Egyptian Black Bloc Movement appeared to protest against President Mohamed Morsi polices and protect protesters from the police violence .

===International development===

====North America====

The first recorded use of the tactic in United States of America occurred at the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C. on 17 October 1988. Over one thousand demonstrators—a small number consisting of a black bloc—called for the end to U.S. support for the right wing death squads in El Salvador.See The Black Bloc Papers, page 35, Breaking Glass Press, Shawnee Mission, KS, 2010 Other early use in the US were the Earth Day Wall Street Action in 1990 and the February 1991 protests against the Gulf War.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] These were initiated by Love and Rage, a North American revolutionary anarchist organization active in New York. Black blocs gained significant media attention when a black bloc caused damage to property of GAP, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other retail locations in downtown Seattle during the 1999 anti-WTO demonstrations.[tpl]cite web|author=Rick Anderson |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/1999-12-22/news/delta-s-down-with-it.php |title=Delta's down with it - Page 1 - News - Seattle |publisher=Seattle Weekly |date=22 December 1999 |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]  They were a common feature of subsequent anti-globalization protests.

====Brazil====

During the June–July 2013 mass public demonstrations, a group of people who identified themselves as "Black Blocs" started attending demonstrations, especially those held across the street from governor of Rio de Janeiro State Sérgio Cabral's residence and the state government palace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/black-blocs-a-baderna-premeditada-na-zona-sul-9094666|title=Black Blocs e a baderna premeditada na Zona Sul|publisher=Globo.com|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/pm-culpa-black-blocs-por-confusao-em-laranjeiras-9135174|title=PM culpa Black Blocs por confusão em Laranjeiras|publisher=Globo.com|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl] Police face accusations of infiltrating the movement and, at times, acting as agents provocateurs by starting confrontations. Many people claim that video footage shows an infiltrated police officer throwing a molotov cocktail that wounded a riot policeman, although this has been denied by the police.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/video-of-clashes-in-brazil-appears-to-show-police-infiltrators-among-the-protesters/?_r=0|title=Video of Clashes in Brazil Appears to Show Police Infiltration of Protesters|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl]
Despite the denunciations by media, police, and even some activists, the black bloc tactic persisted in the movement.  By October 2013, "The mask-wearers were welcomed by the protesters...Indeed, this sense of solidarity amidst the demonstrations, this shared manning of barricades, inspires a common determination to fight against the fear of repression."  According to a report by two Brazilian activists published in Al Jazeera, this coincided with a revival in the breadth of the street protests that had not been seen since its early days in June.Bruno Cava and Marcelo Castaneda "Black Bloc and Teachers: Education crisis explodes on Rio's streets"  Al Jazeera English, Oct 23, 2013 On October 10, the Rio teacher's union (Sepe) officially declared support for the recent black bloc actions, stating that the bloc were "welcome" at their demonstrations.

====United Kingdom====

A group of about 400 black bloc demonstrators took part in the 2011 London anti-cuts protest where they attacked various high end retail outlets; according to journalist Paul Mason this may have been the largest ever black bloc assembly in the UK. Mason says some of the participants were anarchists from Europe, others were British students radicalised after participation in the 2010 UK student protests.[tpl]Cite book|last=Mason|first=Paul|chapter = Ch. 3|title=Why It's Kicking Off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions|location=London,Verso|year=2012|isbn=978-1-84467-851-8[/tpl]

===Police infiltration===

On occasion, police and security services have infiltrated black blocs, apparently for purposes of investigation.  Allegations first surfaced after several demonstrations. At the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa, amongst the many complaints about the police[tpl]cite web|title=Media Advisory: Media Missing New Evidence About Genoa Violence|url=http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120314122126/http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html|archivedate=Mar 14, 2012|publisher=FAIR|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl] there was mention of video footage which "suggests that men in black were seen getting out of police vans near protest marches."[tpl]Cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Men in black behind chaos: Hardliners plan 'actions' away from main protesters|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jul/23/globalisation.davidpallister|accessdate=28 June 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 July 2001|author2=John Vidal|author3=David Pallister|author4=Owen Bowcott[/tpl] In August 2007, Quebec police admitted that "their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators"in Montebello.  However, the officers did not engage in violence, and claimed that they were carrying rocks because other protesters were doing so.  They were identified by genuine protesters because of their police-issue footwear.[tpl]Cite news|title=Quebec police admit they went undercover at Montebello protest |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebec-police-admit-they-went-undercover-at-montebello-protest-1.656171|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=23 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Topping|first=David|title=Bon Cop, Bad Cop|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/08/bon_cop_bad_cop.php| work=Torontoist.com|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl]  According to veteran activist Harsha Walia, it was other participants in the black bloc who identified and exposed the undercover police.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/rabbletv/program-guide/2010/03/features/diversity-tactics-diversity-opinions |title=Rabble TV "A Diversity of Tactics - A Diversity of Opinions" Rabble.ca, March 5, 2010 |publisher=Rabble.ca |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl]
There is no evidence that the black bloc tactic is particularly vulnerable to infiltration, however, as investigatory - and even agent provocateur - activity has taken place regularly among completely nonviolent, non-black bloc campaigns.  In 2003, the Oakland, CA Police Dept infiltrated a group of demonstrators protesting police brutality and the war in Iraq at the port; subpoenaed private comments by Captain Howard Jordan indicate that his plan was to steer the march away from the police station in order to avoid confrontation.  In internal documents, Jordan mentioned this strategy was common in other police departments, including San Francisco and Seattle."“State of Surveillance: Government Monitoring of Political Activity in Northern & Central California A Report by the ACLU of Northern California”  Written by Mark Schlosberg, Police Practices Policy Director, July 2006; [tpl]cite news|last=Gonzalez |first=Richard| title=Oakland Police Spy on Anti-War Group|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5626076|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=8 August 2006[/tpl]

==Tactics==

Tactics of a black bloc can include offensive measures such as street fighting, vandalism of corporate property, rioting, and demonstrating without a permit, but mainly consists of defensive tactics like misleading the authorities, assisting in the escape of people arrested by the police ("un-arrests' or "de-arrests"), administering first aid to persons affected by tear gas, rubber bullets and other riot control measures in areas where protesters are barred from entering, building barricades, resisting the police, and practicing jail solidarity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02072012/|title=Hedging Our Bets on the Black Bloc: The Impotence of Mere Liberalism|publisher=Press Action|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/13/genoa.htm|title=Battle of Genoa|publisher=Southern Cross Review|accessdate=16 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Juris|first=Jeffrey S.|title=Violence Performed and Imagined: Militant Action, the Black Bloc and the Mass Media in Genoa|journal=Critique of Anthropology|year=2005|volume=25|issue=4|pages=413–432|doi=10.1177/0308275X05058657|url=http://coa.sagepub.com/content/25/4/413|accessdate=28 May 2012[/tpl] Property destruction carried out by black blocs tends to have symbolic significance: common targets include banks, institutional buildings, outlets for multinational corporations, gasoline stations, and video-surveillance cameras.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/zakkflash02152012/|title=A Principled Stand on Diversity of Tactic: Avoiding Uniformity of Failure|publisher=Press Action|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl]
There may be several blocs within a particular protest, with different aims and tactics.K, 2001, "being black block" in On Fire: the battle of Genoa and the anti-capitalist movement, p. 31, One Off Press. As an ad hoc group, blocs often share no universally common set of principles or beliefs apart from an adherence to—usually—radical left or autonomist values, although some anarchist groups have called for the Saint Paul Principles to be adapted as a framework in which diverse tactics can be deployed. A few radical right-wing groups, like some of the "autonomous nationalists" of Europe[tpl]Cite news|last=Nicola|first=Stefan|title=Germany's new neo-Nazis |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/05/20/Germanys-new-neo-Nazis/UPI-87471211285700/ |accessdate=28 June 2010|newspaper=UPI|date=20 May 2008[/tpl] or the Australian National-Anarchists[tpl]Cite journal|last=Sunshine|first=Spencer|title=Rebranding Fascism: Nationalists|journal=Public Eye Magazine|date=April 2008|volume=23 |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n4/rebranding_fascism.html |accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] have adopted "black bloc" tactics and dress.
In 2000, some months after the Battle of Seattle and the A16 protests against the IMF in Washington DC, the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective (based out of rural Vermont), called for Black Bloc activities to be coordinated on the tactical level, through the temporary election of street officers democratically empowered to make fast tactical decisions, especially concerning movement, while in confrontation with state police forces.  This collective also called for Black Bloc actions to entail reserve groups, who could be called into a clash by these elected officers.  These proposals were mapped out in the first edition of the pamphlet Communique on Tactics. The pamphlet was controversial  within the anarchist community.  Some anarchists attacked this approach be being too formal and bordering on Leninist in structure.  The Green Mountain Anarchist Collective countered that the direct election of tactical officers was historically in line with the CNT and FAI anarchist militias during the Spanish Civil War. Of those early segments of the anarchist scene that agreed, in principle, with these assertions were the Barricada Collective (Boston, MA) and Columbus Anti-Racist Action (Ohio). The Barricada Collective, in their publication of the same name, published the pamphlet, and also wrote their own essays calling for a more nuanced and more militant use of the Black Bloc in the North American anarchist movement.  In July 2001 the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective would go on to produce a second edition of the Communique On Tactics[tpl]cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anti-racist-action-the-green-mountain-anarchist-collective-black-bloc-tactics-communique|title=Communique On Tactics|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=Aug 26, 2013[/tpl] pamphlet in cooperation with Columbus ARA. This second edition further refined the proposal to suggest, among other things, that large Black Blocs, composed of numerous affinity groups, could reach a further level of tactical sophistication by each affinity group further specializing their capabilities (i.e. offense, defense, recon, etc.) and by investing coordinating ability to the elected officer core. This pamphlet, like the first, was debated among anarchists.  Aspects of these tactical reforms were field tested with some success at the Festival De La Pueblo May 5 march in Boston in 2002, and the siege of the Lewiston Armory (in opposition to a failed neo-Nazi organizing meeting), Maine, 2003. Both these actions were organized largely by the Northeast Federation of Anarcho-Communist (whom the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective and Barricada were then affiliated).

In comics, Valiant's "Archer & Armstrong" features a group called the Black Bloc, distinguished by cube-shaped helmets worn with various punctuation and emoticons on the face. The group is one of many factions of The Sect, an amalgam of secret societies formed with the intent of killing the titular immortal, Armstrong.
