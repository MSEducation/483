Smailes (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played in major cricket matches for Caterham Cricket Club and Surrey in the 1760s.

==Career==

Smailes played in two major 11-a-side matches, one in 1768 and one in 1769.  On 10 June 1768, he played against Kent and scored 25 and 11, Surrey winning by 14 runs.Buckley, p.48.  On 31 July and 1 August 1769, Smailes played for Caterham against Hambledon Cricket Club, the game being the equivalent of Surrey v Hampshire at Guildford Bason.  Hambledon won by 4 wickets before a crowd of "near 20,000 spectators".Waghorn, p.32.
Smailes is only recorded on those two occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Smailes.
