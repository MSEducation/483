CATEGORIES: Boroughs of Oslo

Grorud is a district of the city of Oslo, Norway.
The district contains the Ammerud, Grorud, Kalbakken, Rødtvet, Nordtvet and Romsås areas. Traditionally a borough inhabited by the working class, Grorud has in the last few decades had a great influx of immigrants. 40% of the population are first or second generation immigrants. Because of these statistics Grorud is a recurring theme in Norwegian immigration politics.
The first Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie came from Grorud.
Romsås lies within Grorud now, but previously was its own borough. 
Ammerud is another former borough that lies within Grorud.
