Crimewatch 2007 (Chinese: 绳之以法2007) is a Singaporean Current-Affairs Drama show produced by local TV station Mediacorp and airs on MediaCorp TV Channel 5 on the last Wednesday of every month at 8:00pm. It is hosted by Assistant Superintendent Gail Wong from the Singapore Police Force.
Different topics are covered every month, ranging from ATM skimming to motorbike thefts to drunk driving. Episodes usually end with either an appeal to the public to help apprehend suspects, or advice such as not to drink and drive.
The Chinese version is broadcast on the last Friday of each month, dealing with the same issues as the English version for the same month.
