Shawkat Ali completed his LL.B. from Comilla Law College under Dhaka University  in 1958 before he joined the Pakistan Army as a commissioned officer the following year.

===Agartala Conspiracy Case===

Shawkat Ali was a captain in 1968 when he was Accused No. 26 of the 35 implicated in the Agartala Conspiracy Case as a conspirator to secede East Pakistan from Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|title=Agartala Conspiracy Case|url=http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/A_0059.HTM|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=2 September 2011[/tpl] Initially he was supposed to be tried before a court martial, but the Government of Pakistan felt they would benefit more from a civil trial. The charges were dropped the next year amidst public protest; Shawkat still was forced to retire in 1969.
Although it was largely thought that the Case was only to frame Sheikh Mujib and others, in 2010, and on the anniversary of the withdrawal of the Case on 22 February 2011, Shawkat Ali confessed to the Parliament at a point of order that the charges read out to them were accurate, stating that they formed a Shangram Parishad under Sheikh Mujib for the sedition and secession of East Pakistan.[tpl]cite news|title='Agartala conspiracy case was not false'|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=188118&cid=2|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=BDNews24.com|date=23 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Textbook 'incorrectly' describes Agartala Case: Shawkat|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=142345|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=12 June 2010[/tpl]
