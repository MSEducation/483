Paroecopolis is presented by Sophrone Pétridès in a 1911 article in the Catholic Encyclopedia as a bishopric of uncertain name (Paroecopolis, Parthicopolis, Parthenopolis) and situated either in Macedonia, or in Thrace. 
Pétridès relates that the town is mentioned by PtolemyIII, 13, 30. as being in Sintice, a part of Macedonia, and by Phlegon."Fragm. histor. gr." ed. Didot, III, 609. HieroclesSynecdemus, 639, 8. and Constantine PorphyrogenitusDe thematibus'', 2. call it Parthicopolis, but the second locates it in Thrace. Stephanus Byzantius calls it Parthenopolis and relates according to Theagenes the legend of its foundation by Grastus, son of Mygdon, said to have named the city in honour of his two daughters. PlinyIV, xi. has the same name, but places it in Thrace.
Its bishop, Jonas or John, assisted at the Council of Sardica (342 or 343); at the Council of Chalcedon (451) there was present John "Parthicopolis primæ Macedoniae".Le Quien, Oriens christianus, II, 75.
This see is not mentioned in any of the Greek Notitiae episcopatuum, nor is there any mention of it, under any of the three names, in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), pp. 949-950
