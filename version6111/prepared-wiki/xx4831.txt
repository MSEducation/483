[[Geography of the Isle of Man]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Isle of Man

The Isle of Man is an island in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Ireland in Western Europe, with a population of over 75,000. It is a British Crown dependency. It has a small islet, the Calf of Man, to its south. It is located at [tpl]Coord|54|15|N|4|30|W|region:IM_type:country[/tpl].

==Coast==

The Isle of Man has a coastline of 160 km, and claims 12 nm of territorial waters, but only holds exclusive fishing rights in the first 3 miles.
Raad ny Foillan long distance footpath runs 95 miles around the Manx coast.

==Climate==

The Isle of Man enjoys a temperate climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Average rainfall is high compared to the majority of the British Isles, due to its location to the western side of Great Britain and sufficient distance from Ireland for moisture to be accumulated by the prevailing south-westerly winds. Average rainfall is highest at Snaefell, where it is around [tpl]convert|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] a year. At lower levels it can fall to around [tpl]convert|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] a year.
Temperatures remain fairly cool, with the recorded maximum being [tpl]convert|28.9|°C[/tpl] at Ronaldsway.

==Terrain==

The island's terrain is varied. There are two mountainous areas divided by a central valley which runs between Douglas and Peel. The highest point in the Isle of Man, Snaefell, is in the northern area and reaches [tpl]convert|620|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level. The northern end of the island is a flat plain, consisting of glacial tills and marine sediments. To the south the island is more hilly, with distinct valleys. There is no land below sea level.

==Natural hazards and environmental issues==

There are few severe natural hazards, the most common being high winds, rough seas and dense fog.  In recent years there has been a marked increase in the frequency of high winds, heavy rains, summer droughts and flooding both from heavy rain and from high seas.  Snow fall has decreased significantly over the past century while temperatures are increasing year round with rainfall decreasing.
Air pollution, marine pollution and waste disposal are issues in the Isle of Man.
Global warming and a sea level rise potentially pose a great threat to the Isle of Man.  All of the Island's towns are at threat from rising sea levels while the Northern Plain, a large, flat and low-lying plain composed of soft marine sediments and glacial material, which makes up about a quarter of the Island's landmass, is in danger of being lost to the sea over the next two centuries.  The same is true for the considerably smaller Southern Plain surrounding the settlements of Castletown and Ballasalla and including Ronaldsway Airporthttp://www.gov.im/dlge/enviro/climatechange.xml.

====Nature Reserves and Wildlife Sites====

The Isle of Man now has forty-five non-statutory Wildlife Sites as of 30 January 2009, covering approximately 195ha of land and an additional 10.5 km of inter-tidal coast.  The Manx Wildlife Trust also manage 20 nature reserves.

==Geology==

The larger part of the island is formed from highly faulted and folded sedimentary rocks of Ordovician age. There is a belt of younger Silurian rocks along the west coast between Niarbyl and St Patrick's Isle and a small area of Devonian sandstones around Peel. 
A band of Carboniferous age rocks underlies part of the northern plain but is nowhere seen at the surface however similar age rocks do outcrop in the south between Castletown, Silverdale and Port St Mary. Permo-Triassic age rocks are known to lie beneath Point of Ayre but, as with the rest of the northern plain, these rocks are concealed by substantial thicknesses of superficial deposits.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale Special map sheet Isle of Man BGS 2001
The island has significant deposits of copper, lead and silver, zinc, iron, and plumbago (a mix of graphite and clay).[tpl]Harvcolnb|Cumming|1861|pp=27–28[/tpl] Mines There are also quarries of black marble, limestone flags, clay schist, and granite.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Cumming|1861|p=28[/tpl] Quarries These are all modern, and there was no noticeable exploitation of metals or minerals prior to the modern era.

==Demographics==

The island has a preliminary census estimated population of 79 805, as of September 2006. This is up on the government's last census in 2001, which recorded 76 315 people, itself a rise of 9.1% on the previous 1991 census.
The island's largest town and administrative centre is Douglas, the population of which is 23 000, nearly a third of the entire population of the island. Neighbouring Onchan, Ramsey in the north, Peel in the west and the three southern ports of Castletown, Port Erin and Port St Mary are the island's other main settlements. Almost all its population lives on or very near to the coast.
