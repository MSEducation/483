==SNY Facility==

In 2005, MCSP became the only California state prison exclusively for Sensitive Needs Yards (SNY) inmates.  SNY inmates are segregated from mainline (a.k.a. general population) inmates for their own safety.  Many are gang dropouts, informants, sex offenders, former law enforcement officers, et al.  http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/16/local/me-prison16
