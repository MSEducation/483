[[Modal particle]]

CATEGORIES: Parts of speech

In linguistics, modal particles are always uninflected words, and are a type of grammatical particle. Their function is that of reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker or narrator, in that they are not reflexive but change the mood of the verb. They are often used to indicate how the speaker thinks that the content of the sentence relates to the participants' common knowledge.Fabian Bross (2012): German modal particles and the common ground.
