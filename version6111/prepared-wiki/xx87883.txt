===Éléments de géométrie algébrique===

Description: Written with the assistance of Jean Dieudonné, this is Grothendieck's exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry.  It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry.  The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.

===Séminaire de géométrie algébrique===

Description: These seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at IHÉS starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960–1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is Pierre Deligne's proof of the last of the open Weil conjectures in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include Michel Raynaud, Michael Artin, Jean-Pierre Serre, Jean-Louis Verdier, Pierre Deligne, and Nicholas Katz.

===Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta===

Description: Brahmagupta's Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers.

===Recherches d'Arithmétique===

===Disquisitiones Arithmeticae===

Description: The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a profound and masterful book on number theory written by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre and adds many important new results of his own.  Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the first two published proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, a deep investigation of binary quadratic forms going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithmétique, a first appearance of Gauss sums, cyclotomy, and the theory of constructible polygons with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular 17-gon.  Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of class numbers of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had conjectured.[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Ireland | first1 = K. |last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | title = A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1993  | location = New York, New York  | pages = 358–361  | isbn = 0-387-97329-X[/tpl]  In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the Hasse–Weil theorem).[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Silverman | first1 = J. |last2 = Tate | first2 = J. | title = Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1992 | location = New York, New York  | isbn = 0-387-97825-9  | page = 110[/tpl]

===Beweis des Satzes, daß jede unbegrenzte arithmetische Progression, deren erstes Glied und Differenz ganze Zahlen ohne gemeinschaftlichen Factor sind, unendlich viele Primzahlen enthält===

Description: Pioneering paper in analytic number theory, which introduced Dirichlet characters and their L-functions to establish Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Elstrodt | first = Jürgen | journal = Clay Mathematics Proceedings  | title = The Life and Work of Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805–1859) | publisher = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/tschinkel/gauss-dirichlet/elstrodt-new.pdf | format = PDF |pages = 21–22[/tpl]  In subsequent publications, Dirichlet used these tools to determine, among other things, the class number for quadratic forms.

===Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse===

Description: Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse (or On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude) is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern analytic number theory.  It also contains the famous Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in mathematics.H. M. Edwards, Riemann's Zeta Function, Academic Press, 1974

===Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie===

Description: Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory) is a textbook of number theory written by German mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863.
The Vorlesungen can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of Fermat, Jacobi and Gauss, and the modern number theory of Dedekind, Riemann and Hilbert. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the group that is central to modern algebra, but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory

===Zahlbericht===

Description: Unified and made accessible many of the developments in algebraic number theory made during the nineteenth century. Although criticized by André Weil (who stated "more than half of his famous Zahlbericht is little more than an account of Kummer's number-theoretical work, with inessential improvements")[ref]
