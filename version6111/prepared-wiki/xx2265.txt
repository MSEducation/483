Creation science or scientific creationism[tpl]Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=268–285[/tpl] is a branch of creationism that attempts to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reinterpret the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about the history of the Earth, cosmology and biological evolution.[tpl]cite book |last= Plavcan |first= J.

The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science is a religious, not a scientific view, and that creation science does not qualify as science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes.[tpl]cite book | title = Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, 2nd edition | author = National Academy of Science | publisher = National Academy Press | year = 1999 | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=6024 | page = 48 [/tpl][tpl]wayback|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html|title=Amicus Curiae Brief Of 72 Nobel Laureates, 17 State Academies Of Science, And 7 Other Scientific Organizations[/tpl], Edwards v.

It began in the 1960s as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution.[tpl]Cite book | last = Larson | first = Edward J. | author-link = Edward Larson | year = 2004 | title = Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory | publisher = Modern Library | isbn = 978-0-679-64288-6|ref=harv[/tpl] It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States, with creation science ministries branching worldwide.[tpl]harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=399–431[/tpl] The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in "creation ex nihilo" (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000 years; the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed "baraminological" kinds; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth.[tpl]cite court | litigants = Edwards v.

Creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as "Darwinism" or as "Darwinian evolution".
The creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature, most notably linking Noah's flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record in a system termed "flood geology". These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and evangelical Christians until the 1970s when its followers challenged the teaching of evolution in the public schools and other venues in the United States, bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the scientific community. Many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside Darwinian evolution in the science curriculum. Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and theological references, and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in Louisiana, Arkansas, and other regions in the United States.[tpl]cite journal | author = Numbers, R.L. | year = 2002 | title = 21 Creationism since 1859 | journal = Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction | url = http://books.google.com/?id=weOOCfiDhDcC&pg=PA277&dq=Creationism+since+1859| accessdate = 2008-01-19 | isbn = 9780801870385 | ref = harv[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Toumey | first = Christopher P. | title = God's Own Scientists: Creationists in a Secular World | publisher = Rutgers University Press | date = 1997-04-01 | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | page = 38 | isbn = 978-0-8135-2044-5 [/tpl]
The 1982 ruling in McLean v. Arkansas found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view.[tpl]Cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Trial and Error: The American Controversy over Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=288 |isbn=0-19-515471-1[/tpl] The teaching of creation science in public schools in the United States effectively ended in 1987 following the United States Supreme Court decision in Edwards v. Aguillard. The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief. In response to this ruling, the creation science school textbook Of Pandas and People changed references to creation to intelligent design. The intelligent design movement promoted this version, then teaching intelligent design in public school science classes was found to be unconstitutional in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District federal court case.

==Beliefs and activities==

===Religious basis===

Creation science is based largely upon chapters 1–11 of the book of Genesis. These describe how God (Hebrew Elohim) calls the world into existence through the power of speech ("God said, 'Let there be light'", etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a world-wide flood destroys all life except for Noah and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 "nations" of the world; the nations live together and speak one language until the incident of the Tower of Babel, when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science rarely goes beyond these stories, but claims that there is a biblical chronology which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago, and creation science therefore frequently attempts to explain history and science within this timeframe.

===Modern religious affiliations===

Most creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or evangelical Christian beliefs in biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the higher criticism supported by Liberal Christianity in the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. However, there are also examples of Islamic and Jewish scientific creationism that conform to the accounts of creation as recorded in their religious doctrines.[tpl]cite web |title=Islamic Scientific Creationism: A New Challenge in Turkey |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/6/islamic-scientific-creationism |authors=Ümit Sayin and Aykut Kence |year=1999 |publisher=National Center for Science Education [/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Eugenie C.|last=Scott|authorlink=Eugenie C.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a history of support for Creation Science. This dates back to George McCready Price, an active Seventh-day Adventist who developed views of flood geology,[tpl]Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=88–119[/tpl] which formed the basis of Creation Science.[tpl]Harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=268[/tpl] This work was continued by the Geoscience Research Institute, an official institute of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, located on its Loma Linda University campus in California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grisda.org/ |title=GRI 'About Us' page |publisher=Grisda.org |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=320–328[/tpl]
Creation science is generally rejected by the Church of England as well as the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifical Gregorian University has officially discussed intelligent Design as a "cultural phenomenon" without scientific elements. The Church of England's official website cites Charles Darwin's local work assisting people in his religious parish.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4588289/The-Vatican-claims-Darwins-theory-of-evolution-is-compatible-with-Christianity.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Chris | last=Irvine | title=The Vatican claims Darwin's theory of evolution is compatible with Christianity | date=2009-02-11[/tpl]

===Views on science===

Creation science rejects evolution's theory of the common descent of all living things on the Earth."creationism." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 20 Oct. 2007 Instead, it asserts that the field of evolutionary biology is itself pseudoscientificAntidote to superstition, Answers in Genesis or even a religion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wright-v-hisd1.html |title=Wright v. Houston I.S.D |publisher=Talkorigins.org |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] Creationists argue instead for a system called baraminology, which considers the living world to be descended from uniquely created kinds or "baramins".Get Answers: Created Kinds (Baraminology), Answers in Genesis
Creation science incorporates the concept of catastrophism to account for Earth's geological formations. Creationists employ the concept to attempt to reconcile current landforms and fossil distributions with Biblical interpretations, proposing the remains resulted from successive cataclysmic events, such as a world wide flood and subsequent ice age.[tpl]cite web|last=Oard |first=Michael |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/AnswersBook/iceage16.asp |title=What About The Ice Age? |publisher=Answersingenesis.org |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] It rejects one of the fundamental principles of modern geology (and of modern science generally): uniformitarianism, which means applying the same physical and geological laws observed on the Earth today to interpret the Earth's geological history."Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, 2nd edition", Steering Committee on Science and Creationism, National Academy of Sciences, 1999
Sometimes creationists attack other scientific concepts, like the Big Bang cosmological model or methods of scientific dating which measure radioactive decay. The Young Earth Creationist branch of the creationists also rejects current estimates of the age of the Universe and the age of the Earth, arguing for creationist cosmologies with timescales much shorter than those determined by modern physical cosmology and geological science, typically less than 10,000 years. (See The objection that evolution's evidence is unreliable or inconsistent and RATE for details of the rejection.)
The scientific community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside the boundaries of a legitimate science.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html |title=National Academy of Sciences |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2008-01-03 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][ref]

 (same quote, citing the June 29, 1987 issue of Newsweek magazine).[/ref] (See also: List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design.) The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible doctrine, and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not empirically testable in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. Those views of the scientific community were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.

==History==

The teaching of evolution was gradually introduced into more and more public high school textbooks in the United States after 1900,[tpl]cite journal |last=Skoog |first=Gerald |authorlink= |date=April 1979 |title= Topic of evolution in secondary school biology textbooks: 1900–1977 |journal= Science Education (1979 Wiley Periodicals) |volume= 63 |issue=5 |pages=621–640 |ref=harv[/tpl] but in the aftermath of the First World War the growth of fundamentalist Christianity gave rise to a creationist opposition to such teaching. Legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution was passed in certain regions, most notably Tennessee's Butler Act of 1925.[ref]
