[[Trans-splicing]]

CATEGORIES: RNA, Spliceosome, RNA splicing

''Trans''-splicing is a special form of RNA processing in eukaryotes where exons from two different primary RNA transcripts are joined end to end and ligated.
In contrast "normal" (cis-)splicing processes a single molecule. That is, trans-splicing results in an RNA transcript that came from multiple RNA polymerases on the genome. This phenomenon can be exploited for molecular therapy to address mutated gene products.[tpl]cite journal| pmid=19409879| year=2009| last1=Iwasaki| first1=R| last2=Kiuchi| first2=H| last3=Ihara| first3=M| last4=Mori| first4=T| last5=Kawakami| first5=M| last6=Ueda| first6=H| title=Trans-splicing as a novel method to rapidly produce antibody fusion proteins| volume=384| issue=3| pages=316–21| doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.04.122| journal=Biochemical and biophysical research communications[/tpl]
Trans-splicing can be the mechanism behind certain oncogenic fusion transcripts.[tpl]cite journal | year = 2008 | title = A neoplastic gene fusion mimics trans-splicing of RNAs in normal human cells | pmid = 18772439 | author = Li et al. | postscript =  | doi=10.1126/science.1156725 | volume=321 | issue=5894 | journal=Science | pages=1357–61 | last2 = Wang | first2 = J. | last3 = Mor | first3 = G. | last4 = Sklar | first4 = J.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | year = 2009 | title = SLC45A3-ELK4 is a novel and frequent erythroblast transformation-specific fusion transcript in prostate cancer | pmid = 19293179 | author = Rickman et al. | postscript =  | doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4926 | volume=69 | issue=7 | journal=Cancer Res. | pages=2734–8 | last2 = Pflueger | first2 = D. | last3 = Moss | first3 = B. | last4 = Vandoren | first4 = V.

Trans-splicing is used by certain microbial organisms, notably protozoa of the Kinetoplastae class to produce variable surface antigens and change from one life stage to another.
