The East Coast Greenway, or ECG, is a project to create a nearly [tpl]convert|3000|mi|adj=on[/tpl] urban path linking the major cities of the Atlantic coast of the United States, from Calais, Maine, to Key West, Florida, for non-motorized human transportation. It is similar in length and conception to the 12 routes of the EuroVelo project throughout Europe, and the Trans Canada Trail project in Canada.
Work on ECG began in 1991. As of 2013, 29% of the trail is complete (off-road).Trails website, main page.

==History==

In 1991, a group of cyclists and long-distance trail enthusiasts met in New York City and formed a national non-profit organization, the East Coast Greenway Alliance (ECGA), to plan and promote a greenway linking existing and planned trails into a contiguous "spine route" between Atlantic coast cities.
In summer 1992, the ECGA sent nine cyclists from Boston, New York , Vermont, and Washington, D.C. on a 30-day "exploratory" cycle tour. In June 1999, the ECG was selected by the White House for designation as a National Millennium Trail.[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2009[/tpl]
Between February and June 2000, the ECG Wave non-motorized relay transported a bottle of sea water from Key West, Florida, up the eastern seaboard to Canada along the route of the ECG.

==Route==

Major cities connected by the spine route are:
A planned alternative to the Richmond-Wilmington leg of the journey hews closer to the coast, passing through Virginia Beach in the Tidewater region and continuing on through the Elizabeth City, Greenville, New Bern and Jacksonville in North Carolina before rejoining the main line near the mouth of the Cape Fear River at Wilmington. Other alternate routes are planned for Maine, Massachusetts, and Florida.

==Active segments==

As of 2014, a sampling of segments of the East Coast Greenway that are accessible include:

New Jersey's spine route is [tpl]convert|93|mi[/tpl] long, running between the Hudson River and the Delaware River.[tpl]cite web | title = New Jersey East Coast Greenway | work = Map | publisher = East Coast Greenway | year = 2008 | url = http://www.greenway.org/pdf/NJ.pdf | accessdate = 2011-07-05 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = East Coast Greenway Trail Guide | work = | publisher = New Jersey Department of Transportation | date = | url = http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/commuter/bike/pdf/ecgtrailguide6.pdf | accessdate = 2011-07-05 [/tpl] It passes through bustling urban areas — Jersey City, Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton, and Trenton — as well as quiet suburban settings and more rural landscapes. As of 2011, it had the second highest percentage of completed trail of any East Coast state. 48 percent of the greenway in the state was along traffic-free paths, including the longest completed trail in the system – the D&R Canal Towpath, which is [tpl]convert|34.3|mi[/tpl] long. North of the Raritan River, travelers alternate between park paths and interim on-road sections to Newark.[ref]
