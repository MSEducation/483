==Beta distribution==

==Gnedenko-Kolmogorov central limit theorem revisited==

Suppose that all variables are independent. 
Central Limit Theorem for distributions of compact support (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov) 2. 

==Beta wavelets==

has only one-cycle (a negative half-cycle and a positive half-cycle).
The (unimodal) scale function associated with the wavelets is given by
A closed-form expression for first-order beta wavelets can easily be derived. Within their support, 

==Beta wavelet spectrum==

The beta wavelet spectrum can be derived in terms of the Kummer hypergeometric function 5. 
Higher derivatives may also generate further beta wavelets.  Higher order beta wavelets are defined by

==Application==

Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filter banks. Similarly, Beta wavelet 16 and its derivative are utilized in several real-time engineering applications such as image compression6,bio-medical signal compression78, image recognition 9 etc.
