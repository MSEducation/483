==Career==

===Rolling Stone magazine===

When Leibovitz returned to the United States in 1970, she started her career as staff photographer, working for the just launched Rolling Stone magazine.
In 1973, publisher Jann Wenner named Leibovitz chief photographer of Rolling Stone, a job she would hold for 10 years.
Leibovitz worked for the magazine until 1983, and her intimate photographs of celebrities helped define the Rolling Stone look. While working for Rolling Stone, Leibovitz became more aware of the other magazines.
Richard Avedon's portraits were an important and powerful example in her life.
She learned that she could work for magazines and still create personal work, which for her was the most important.
She sought intimate moments with her subjects, who "open their hearts and souls and lives to you".
name= "Annie Liebovitz: Always in Style " She was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2009.http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Centenary-Medal
Photographers such as Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson influenced her during her time at the San Francisco Art Institute. "Their style of personal reportage—taken in a graphic way—was what we were taught to emulate."

===The Rolling Stones===

Leibovitz photographed The Rolling Stones in San Francisco in 1971 and 1972, and served as the concert-tour photographer for Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75. Her favorite photo from the tour was a photo of Mick Jagger in an elevator.Leibovitz, A. (2008).At Work. New York City, NY: Random House. ISBN 978-0-375-50510-2

===Joan Armatrading===

In 1978 Leibovitz became the first woman to photograph Joan Armatrading for an album. She did the photography for Armatrading's fifth studio album To the Limit, spending four days at her house capturing the images.Mayes, Sean (1990). Joan Armatrading – A Biography (unauthorised). Weidenfeld and Nicolson. ISBN 0-297-81058-8 page 86 She also did the photography for Armatrading's 1979 live album, Steppin' Out.

===John Lennon===

On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a photo shoot with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, promising him that he would make the cover.[tpl]cite web |date=December 8, 2005| url = http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-8-2005-83469.asp| title = Hours After This Picture Was Taken John Lennon Was Dead| publisher = Guardian Unlimited| accessdate = July 26, 2007 | last= [/tpl] She had initially tried to get a picture with just Lennon alone, which is what Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the Double Fantasy album cover, a picture that she loved. She had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on' — not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and he looked like he was clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I looked him in the eye and we shook on it."[tpl]cite web |year=2007 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/1000thphotographers/11/john_lennon_and_yoko_ono| title = Issue #335 (Jan. 22, 1981) | format = Audio | publisher = Rolling Stone | accessdate = July 26, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070704202814/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/1000thphotographers/11/john_lennon_and_yoko_ono| archivedate= 4 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennon—he was shot and killed five hours later.[tpl]cite video |people=Yoko Ono |date=August 9, 2008 |title=Annie Leibovitz - Life Through a Lens |url= |medium= DVD |publisher=ICA |location= |accessdate= |time= |quote=a heavy weight fate was waiting for us only...four or five hours later [/tpl]

In 2011, Leibovitz was nominated alongside Singaporean photographer Dominic Khoo and Wing Shya for Asia Pacific Photographer of the Year.

===Other projects===

In 2007, The BBC misrepresented a portrait shooting by Leibovitz of Queen Elizabeth II to take the Queen's official picture for her state visit to Virginia. This was filmed for the BBC documentary A Year with the Queen. A promotional trailer for the film showed the Queen reacting angrily to Leibovitz's suggestion ("less dressy") that she remove her tiara, then a scene of the Queen walking down a corridor, telling an aide "I'm not changing anything. I've had enough dressing like this, thank you very much."[tpl]cite news | author=Reuters | title=BBC sorry for misrepresenting Queen | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/12/1977378.htm | work=ABC News | date=July 12, 2007 | accessdate=July 19, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070718104148/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/12/1977378.htm?| archivedate= 18 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The BBC later apologized and admitted that the sequence of events had been misrepresented, as the Queen was in fact walking to the sitting in the second scene.[tpl]cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Broadcaster sorry for queen claim | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/07/12/britain.queen/index.html | work=CNN | date=July 12, 2007 | accessdate=July 19, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713043414/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/07/12/britain.queen/index.html  |archivedate = July 13, 2007[/tpl] This led to a BBC scandal and a shake-up of ethics training. See The Tiaragate Affair.
Leibovitz claims she never liked the word "celebrity". "I've always been more interested in what they do than who they are, I hope that my photographs reflect that." She tries to receive a little piece of each subjects personality in the photos.

On April 25, 2008, the televised entertainment program Entertainment Tonight reported that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair.Miley Knows Best, Vanity Fair, June 2008[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23608789-5001026,00.html|title=Miley Cyrus topless controversy|date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2008|publisher=news.com.au/dailytelegraph/| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501145339/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23608789-5001026,00.html| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The photograph, and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photographs, show Cyrus without a top, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet.

On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/business/media/28hannah.html |title=A Topless Photo Threatens a Major Disney Franchise |author=Brook Barnes |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 29, 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080428203021/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/business/media/28hannah.html | archivedate= 28 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Some parents expressed outrage at the nature of the photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as "a situation that was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines".
In response to the Internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27:
 "I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about."
 
Leibovitz also released a statement saying:
 "I'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted," Leibovitz said. "The photograph is a simple, classic portrait, shot with very little makeup, and I think it is very beautiful."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Annie_Leibovitz_Miley_Cyrus_Photos_Were_Misinterpreted/5226536 |title=Annie Leibovitz: 'Miley Cyrus Photos Were Misinterpreted' |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/lXQP|archivedate=May 26, 2012[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Leibovitz had a close romantic relationship with noted writer and essayist Susan Sontag. They met in 1989, when both had already established notability in their careers. Leibovitz has suggested that Sontag mentored her and constructively criticized her work.
After Sontag's death in 2004, Newsweek published an article about Leibovitz that made reference to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating that "The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket. They never lived together, though they each had an apartment within view of the other's."[tpl]cite news | author=Cathleen McGuigan | title=Through Her Lens | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14964292/site/newsweek | work=Newsweek | date=October 2, 2006 | accessdate=July 19, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025011853/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14964292/site/newsweek  |archivedate = October 25, 2007[/tpl]
Neither Leibovitz nor Sontag had ever previously publicly disclosed whether the relationship was familial, a friendship, or sexual in nature. However, when Leibovitz was interviewed for her 2006 book A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005, she said the book told a number of stories, and that "with Susan, it was a love story."[tpl]cite news | author=Janny Scott | title=From Annie Leibovitz: Life, and Death, Examined | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/arts/design/06leib.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1 | work=The New York Times | date=October 6, 2006 | accessdate=July 19, 2007[/tpl]
Even though Annie Leibovitz and Susan Sontag never formally stated their relationship Annie has said in her book A Photographers life "Words like 'companion' and 'partner' were not in our vocabulary," Leibovitz says. "We were two people who helped each other through our lives. The closest word is still 'friend'."

In the preface to the book, she speaks in greater detail about her romantic/intellectual relationship with Sontag, briefly discussing a book they were working on together and describes how assembling A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 was part of the grieving process after Sontag's death. The book and accompanying show include many photographs of Sontag throughout their life together, including several on her deathbed.
Leibovitz acknowledged that she and Sontag were romantically involved. When asked why she used terms like "companion" to describe Sontag, instead of more specific ones like "partner" or "lover", Leibovitz finally said that "lover" was fine with her.[tpl]cite interview | last=Leibovitz | first=Annie | interviewer=Tom Ashbrook | url=http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2006/10/20061017_b_main.asp | type=Audio | program=On Point | callsign=WBUR, NPR | city=Boston | date=October 17, 2006 | accessdate=July 19, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070710211653/http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2006/10/20061017_b_main.asp| archivedate= 10 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] She later repeated the assertion in stating to the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Call us 'lovers'. I like 'lovers.' You know, 'lovers' sounds romantic. I mean, I want to be perfectly clear. I love Susan."[tpl]cite news | author=Edward Guthmann | title=Love, family, celebrity, grief -- Leibovitz puts her life on display in photo memoir | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/01/DDGCKM2T9J1.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=November 1, 2006 | accessdate=July 19, 2007[/tpl]
Leibovitz is Jewish and nonobservant. Asked if being Jewish is important to her, Leibovitz replied, "I'm not a practicing Jew, but I feel very Jewish."

===Children===

Leibovitz has three children. Her daughter Sarah Cameron Leibovitz was born in October 2001 when Leibovitz was 52 years old."Annie Leibovitz" Her twins (two girls) Susan and Samuelle were born to a surrogate mother in May 2005.

===Financial troubles===

In February 2009, Leibovitz borrowed $15.5 million, having experienced financial challenges in recent years.[tpl]cite news | author = Allen Salkin | title=That Old Master?

In July 2009, a breach of contract lawsuit against Leibovitz was filed by Art Capital Group in the amount of $24 million regarding the repayment of these loans.Allen Salkin, "Lender Sues Annie Leibovitz", The New York Times, July 30, 2009 http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/lender-sues-annie-leibovitz/?scp=1&sq=leibovitz&st=cse In a follow-up article,Allen Salkin, "For Annie Leibovitz, a Fuzzy Financial Picture", The New York Times, July 31, 2009 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/fashion/02annie.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&sq=leibovitz&st=cse&scp=1 the Times explores why an artist of her standing could be in such financial straits, despite a $50 million archive. They cite a "long history of less than careful financial dealings", and "a recent series of personal issues". The latter include the recent loss of her father, her mother, her companion (Susan Sontag), the addition of two children to her family, and the controversial renovation of three properties in Greenwich Village. In early September 2009, an Associated Press story quoted legal experts as saying that filing for bankruptcy reorganization might offer Leibovitz her best chance to control and direct the disposition of her assets to satisfy debts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?pnum=1&bfromind=7404&eeid=6797319&_sitecat=1479&dcatid=0&eetype=article&render=y&ac=2&ck=&ch=en&rg=blsadstrgt&_lid=332&_lnm=tg+en+topnews&ck=&l=hm |title=Debts closing in on photographer Annie Leibovitz, Associated Press, September 5, 2009, published in AT&T on-line news, retrieved September 5, 2009 |publisher=My.att.net |date=January 1, 1985 |accessdate=January 26, 2011[/tpl] On September 11, Art Capital Group withdrew its lawsuit against Leibovitz, and extended the due date for repayment of the $24 million loan.
