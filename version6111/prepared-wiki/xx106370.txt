The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Stanier 2-6-0 or Stanier Mogul is a class of 2-6-0 mixed traffic steam locomotive. Forty were built between October 1933 and March 1934.

==Overview==

Although all built at Crewe Works, they were designed at Horwich Works and were developed from the Horwich Mogul, the LMS Hughes Crab 2-6-0. They had the addition of several features brought over from the Great Western Railway by newly arrived Chief Mechanical Engineer William Stanier, most notably the taper boiler. (Stanier would have been familiar with the GWR 4300 Class). In an effort to please Stanier, Horwich had designed in 
a GWR style top-feed cover and locomotive 13245 appeared with the feature fitted. Stanier was not at all pleased, ordering it promptly removed and replaced with the normal LMS cover.
Due to a higher boiler pressure than the Crabs the cylinders were 3" smaller in diameter and so the cylinders were able to be mounted horizontally: the only Stanier design to do so. Like the Crabs they were connected to a Fowler tender that was narrower than the locomotive. When built the first ten locomotives had no water pick-up gear fitted to their tenders.
They were initially numbered 13245–84 (following on from the Crabs), but as standard locomotives, in the LMS 1933 renumbering scheme they were renumbered 2945–84 in 1934 (the Crabs becoming 2700–2944). BR added 40000 to their numbers so they became 42945–84. They were always painted black, and this was lined out except during the austere periods of the 1940s and towards the end of steam.
From the end of 1934 Stanier turned to a larger 4-6-0 for his mixed traffic class, this being the LMS Black Five Class.

==Withdrawals==

Withdrawals commenced in November 1963 with the last one being withdrawn in February 1967.

==Preservation==

One, 13268/(4)2968, the penultimate member of the class to be withdrawn, has been preserved. This locomotive was restored on the Severn Valley Railway and is currently undergoing overhaul after withdrawal from service in January 2013; for a time it ran with the tender from LMS Black 5 no. 45110, but now has its own Fowler-pattern one.
