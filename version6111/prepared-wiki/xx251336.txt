==Early life==

==Activism==

Desgagnés was co-orindator of the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec (Common Front of Quebec Social Assistance Recipients) in the early 1990s and again from 1996 to 2004. In this capacity, he was a vocal critic of the social assistance policies pursued by several Quebec governments. 
In 1991, he accused Robert Bourassa's government of creating hunger among low-income children through program cuts that amounted to one hundred million dollars per year. While acknowledging that a school meals program introduced at the same time was better than nothing, he also described it as an act of gross hypocrisy under the circumstances.Andre Picard, "Breakfast program gives food for thought," Globe and Mail, 31 May 1991, A5. In 1996, he argued that welfare recipients would require an income of fifteen thousand dollars per year to be in a position to find viable employment. See Rheal Seguin, "Quebec to cut back benefits if youths refuse job training," Globe and Mail, 11 December 1996, A10.
In the late 1990s, Desgagnés criticized the government of Lucien Bouchard for cutting social programs in order to balance the provincial deficit.Rheal Seguin, "Quebec welfare bill gives and takes," Globe and Mail, 19 December 1997, A9. He was particularly critical of a provincial work-for-welfare scheme, arguing that it was ineffective as a job creation program."Quebec welfare bill enforces workfare," Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 19 December 1997, B10. In the buildup to a 1998 provincial election, he organized protests against government cuts in several Quebec cities."Welfare group turning on PQ," Globe and Mail, 7 April 1998, A9. 
Desgagnés also criticized the government of Bernard Landry at times,"Social activists say instead of tax cuts, Quebec should boost help for poor," Canadian Press, 22 October 2001, 08:52 pm; "Des pauvres désavouent les consultations menées par le ministre Rochon," La Presse Canadienne, 23 November 2001, 02:14 pm. though he supported its 2002 budgetary announcements for low-income Quebecers."L'énoncé budgétaire est accueilli favorablement par plusieurs groupes," La Presse Canadienne, 19 March 2002, 06:51 pm; Norman Delisle, "Les réactions au projet de loi sur la pauvreté sont modérées," La Presse Canadienne, 12 June 2002, 02:21 pm. He was strongly critical of the Jean Charest government's first budget in 2003, arguing that it required welfare recipients to apply for training programs that were themselves being cut.Les Perreaux, "Quebec government will force welfare recipients to work or train," Canadian Press, 3 July 2003, 3:58 pm. He did, however, welcome the Charest government's decision to remove financial penalties for recipients the following year.Martin Ouellet, "Le gouvernement du Québec élimine toutes les pénalités aux assistés sociaux," La Presse Canadienne, 2 April 2004, 04:39 pm.
Although Desgagnés is a Quebec sovereigntist, he has sometimes downplayed nationalism when conflicts with social justice concerns. He criticized the Quebec government's 1991 decision to impose user fees on some medical services and supported the Canadian government in its efforts to overturn the policy. "It's unacceptable to have user fees, because it implies health services won't be accessible to poor people," he said. "As long as we're in Canada . . . we still need national standards."Martin Cohn, "Bourassa'a 'no-lose' situation," Toronto Star, 14 April 1991, A1.
Desgagnés condemned a 2003 Supreme Court of Canada decision that allowed the Quebec government to pay less than minimum wage to people on social assistance programs."Quebec can pay lower wages for welfare recipients, Supreme Court rules," Canadian Press, 17 April 2003, 10:50 pm.
In 2008, Desgagnés was described as a researcher for the Centre de recherche de Montréal sur les inégalités, les discriminations et les pratiques alternatives de citoyenneté (CREMIS) and Masculinités et société, and also as a lecturer and doctoral student at Université Laval.Jean-Lesage : Jean-Yves Desgagnés, Québec solidaire, 13 November 2008, accessed 9 January 2010.

==Politics==

Desgagnés was the political attaché for Parti Québécois legislator Louise Harel in 1988-89.Jean-Lesage : Jean-Yves Desgagnés, Québec solidaire, 13 November 2008, accessed 9 January 2010.

In the 2003 election, he ran as an independent candidate supported by the Union des forces progressistes."L'Union des forces progressistes se prépare au combat électoral," Canada Newswire, 2 February 2003; "Union des forces progressistes - Campagne électorale dans Jean-Lesage et Taschereau," Canada Newswire, 19 March 2003. He supported a ten-dollar minimum wage and free medication for people on social assistance, and indicated that he was strongly opposed to the social policies of the Action démocratique du Québec."L'activiste Jean-Yves Desgagnés se lance en politique pour contrer l'ADQ," Nouvelles Tele-Radio, 10 February 2003, 11:58 am.
A longtime ally of Françoise David, Desgagnés was a founding member of her Option citoyenne party in 2004."Françoise David lancera un nouveau parti politique à l'automne," La Presse Canadienne, 16 March 2004, 12:30 pm. See also, "Un deuxième rassemblement national pour Option citoyenne," Canada Newswire, 22 April 2005, 09:30 am.

He was fifty years old in 2007.Présentation de Jean-Yves Desgagnés, Québec solidaire, 22 February 2007, accessed 9 January 2010.
