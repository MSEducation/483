[[Party bike]]

CATEGORIES: Cycle types, Transport in Amsterdam

A party bike, pedal crawler, pedibus, cycle pub, beer bike, or bierbike is a multi-passenger human powered vehicle. A party bike is sometimes mistaken for a larger scale version of a pedicab, but it is not since the party bike is powered by the passengers while the steering and braking is controlled by the driver who does not provide pedaling power. Some also double as rolling refreshment stands. Human-powered party bikes have been in use for decades and have grown into several families of vehicles for a variety of purposes, including tourist rentals and private touring. They are not used as pedal taxis or pedicabs since the driver provides no power to the party bike and cannot pick up “fares” in the customary sense. They are often available at tourist attractions where they are rented by the hour or day and often serve as a rolling refreshment stand. When used in conjunction with alcohol, the driver is usually hired with the party bike.

A modern tourist party bike usually features open seating for eight or more riders in a sociable configuration. These vehicles are often designed to look like early 20th century trolley cars and have side seating for the pedalers, a bench seat in the rear, rack-and-pinion steering, and a canopy top. Only a few manufacturers offer an electric assist motor to aid the riders on hilly terrain. Modern party bikes are typically fifteen to twenty feet long, seven feet wide and eight feet tall. Because they are driven on municipal streets, some manufacturers include headlights, tail lights and turn signals, as well as lighting for use at night.

These pubs-on-wheels have become popular in the United States, as well as Germany and other European countries. Some party bikes can have up to 12 cycling passengers, three non-cycling passengers, bar tenders and a driver. In many European municipalities, it is legal to consume alcohol while pedaling or riding on the party bike, provided the driver is not imbibing. However, strict state-based open container laws in the United States prevent most party bike passengers from consuming alcohol while on board except in certain municipalities.United States open container laws Retrieved 13 December 2012 In some locations, the driver is required to have a chauffeur's driver's license to operate on public streets. Generally, a company or individual will own the party bike and rent it out to the public for tours. The party bike is often associated with the micro beer tourism industry.The Cycle Pub is Alive!
