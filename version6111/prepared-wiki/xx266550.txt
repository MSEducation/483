[[List of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates]]

CATEGORIES: Planetary systems, Lists of superlatives in astronomy, Lists of exoplanets

This list of nearest terrestrial exoplanets candidates contains possible terrestrial ("rocky") exoplanets at a distance of up to 50 light-years from the Solar System, ordered by increasing distance.[tpl]citation | display-authors=1 | last1=Pepe | first1=F. | last2=Lovis | first2=C. | last3=Ségransan | first3=D. | last4=Benz | first4=W. |last5=Bouchy | first5=F. | last6=Dumusque | first6=X. | last7=Mayor | first8=M. | last9=Queloz | first9=D. |title=The HARPS search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone: I – Very low-mass planets around HD20794, HD85512 and HD192310 | year=2011 | arxiv=1108.3447 | bibcode=2011yCat..35349058P | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201117055 [/tpl][tpl]citation | first1=Jean | last1=Schneider | publisher=Paris Observatory | title=Star: HD 20794 | work=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=HD+20794 | accessdate=2011-12-05 [/tpl][tpl]cite arXiv |last= Tuomi, Anglada-Escude, Gerlach, Jones, Reiners, Rivera, Vogt, Butler|first= Mikko, Guillem, Enrico, Hugh R.

They may be composed primarily of silicate rocks and/or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun.
There is no scientific consensus about terrestrial composition of most of the planets in the list. Sources in the "Main source" column confirm the possibility of terrestrial composition.

==Incompleteness of the list==

This list is incomplete, currently containing 23 exoplanets, 8 of which probably lie inside their star's habitable zone.
There are roughly 2000 stars at a distance of up to 50 light-years from the Solar Systemhttp://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/50lys.html (64 of them are yellow-orange "G" stars like our Sunhttp://www.solstation.com/stars3/100-gs.htm). As many as 15% of them can have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones.http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0430
On November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy.[tpl]cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis|title=Far-Off Planets Like the Earth Dot the Galaxy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html |date=November 4, 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Petigura |first1=Eric A.|last2=Howard |first2=Andrew W. |last3=Marcy |first3=Geoffrey W. |title=Prevalence of Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/10/31/1319909110 |date=October 31, 2013 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319909110 |accessdate=November 5, 2013 [/tpl] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars.[tpl]cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |title=Milky Way may host billions of Earth-size planets |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-earth-like-planets-20131105,0,2673237.story |date=November 4, 2013 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 [/tpl] The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists.

In September 2012, the discovery of two planets orbiting Gliese 163[tpl]cite web|author=Staff |title=LHS 188 -- High proper-motion Star |url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HIP+19394 |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg(Strasbourg astronomical Data Center) |accessdate=September 20, 2012 [/tpl] was announced.[tpl]cite web |last=Méndez |first=Abel |title=A Hot Potential Habitable Exoplanet around Gliese 163|url=http://phl.upr.edu/press-releases/ahotpotentialhabitableexoplanetaroundgliese163 |date=August 29, 2012|publisher=University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo (Planetary Habitability Laboratory)|accessdate=September 20, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Redd |first = Nola Taylor|title=Newfound Alien Planet a Top Contender to Host Life|url=http://www.space.com/17684-alien-planet-gliese-163c-extraterrestrial-life.html|date=September 20, 2012|publisher=Space.com |accessdate=September 20, 2012 [/tpl]  One of the planets, Gliese 163 c, about 6.9 times the mass of Earth and somewhat hotter, was considered to be within the habitable zone, but is probably not terrestrial.
