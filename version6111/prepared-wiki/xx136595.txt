Dr. Harold Olmo (b. July 31, 1909  – June 30, 2006) was a pioneering viticulturalist and professor at the University of California, Davis where he created many new grape varieties known today as Olmo grapes. In the 1950s, he helped to establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. This led to an expansion of California's wine industry as more vitis vinifera was introduced to the area.
