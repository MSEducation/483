"Engine One-Forty-Three" is a ballad in the tradition of early American train wreck songs, based on the true story of the wreck of the FFV near Hinton, West Virginia on 23 October 1890.  The train was on its way to Clifton Forge, Virginia, when it hit a rock slide.  Early accounts record that the engineer, George Alley, remained on the train to try to slow it and save the lives of its passengers.  Alley died at the scene, but the fireman is said to have jumped to safety.  The ballad elaborates the story, including a mother (not alive at the time of the wreck), excessive speed (a popular theme in train wreck songs), and a motive (a prior delay, and the engineer's wish to make up time on a train with a reputation for swiftness).[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AY7St4-8x10C&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=george+allen+engine+143#PPA189,M1 | title = Long steel rail: The railroad in American folksong | isbn = 978-0-252-06881-2 | author1 = Cohen | first1 = Norm | last2 = Cohen | first2 = David | date = 2000-04-17[/tpl]
The author of the song is unknown, but is attributed amongst others to a worker at the Hinton rail yard and to a C&O engineer.  The best-known version of the song was written down by A. P. Carter and recorded by the Carter Family  either (or both) in 1927 (released on Victor 40089B (Smithsonian Collection of American Folk Music - Folkways) and/or February 15, 1929, released in 2009 on JSP Records 2001, JSPCD7701B. However, these may be the same recording. It is also available on the 1993 Rounder compilation My Clinch Mountain Home: Their Complete Victor Recordings (1928â€“1929). It is also the last song recorded by country music singer Johnny Cash in its entirety, according to his son John Carter Cash. 
 Cash performed the song for the tribute album The Unbroken Circle - The Musical Heritage of the Carter Family in 2004.
