The Hohe Salve is a well-known mountain located between Kufstein, Wörgl and Kitzbühel in the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is part of the Kitzbühel Alps and is also nicknamed the Rigi of the Tyrol.

The mountain has a very striking conical appearance. On the summit is an old pilgrimage chapel, a restaurant and a transmission mast. In addition the peak is served by two gondola lifts from Söll and Hopfgarten.
The summit restaurant and church belong to the parish of Westendorf; the transmission mast to Hopfgarten.
In winter the Hohe Salve is part of the Skiwelt Wilder Kaiser/Brixental ski region and there are several runs from the top into the surrounding villages of Söll, Itter, Hopfgarten and Brixen im Thale.
Because of its shape and location the Hohe Salve is also a popular start point for paragliders.
The name is probably a Rhaeto-Romance term.
