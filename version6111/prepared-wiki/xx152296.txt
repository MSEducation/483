==Railways==

It is the location of a railway junction connecting the Cootamundra to Lake Cargelligo railway line (completed to Stockinbingal in 1893) to Parkes, which provides an alternative route from Sydney to Parkes to the route over the Blue Mountains, avoiding that route's steep grades and is now as a result the major route for freight between Sydney and Perth.  The route from Cootamundra to Stockinbingal and Parkes is also part of a rail bypass of Sydney for traffic between Melbourne and Brisbane via Dubbo, Werris Creek and Maitland.NSWRail.Net
