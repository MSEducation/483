Colm Begley (born 31 August 1986) is an Irish Gaelic football player.  He has also played Australian rules football for the St Kilda Football Club and the Brisbane Lions of the Australian Football League (AFL).

==Recruitment==

Begley was scouted by the Lions football manager Graeme Allan, along with several other potential recruits during a training camp in Ireland, having previously witnessed a near best on ground performance from the young Irishman in the Under 19s International Rules series playing for Ireland against Australia. Begley was later persuaded to move to Australia as a rookie listed professional Australian rules footballer in 2005.

==AFL career==

===Brisbane Lions===

Begley played his very first game of Australian rules immediately after moving from Ireland to Australia in 2006. In just his third game weeks later, he lined up in a  NAB Cup quarter final. In that game he picked up a total of six possessions and one mark whilst playing on Melbourne speedster Aaron Davey.
He was later elevated to the senior list during the regular season when the Lions suffered a string of injuries. In his senior debut against the West Coast Eagles he gathered seven possessions, seven marks and two hitouts, lining up on Brownlow Medallist Chris Judd. At the end of the season he was retained by the club as a rookie listed player.
Following his good form through the 2007 NAB Cup, Begley was once again elevated onto the Brisbane Lions' senior playing list and was soon after named on the interchange bench in the Lions' first game for the season.
