==Early life and education==

Clary was born in Surbiton, Surrey, to Brenda (née McDonald), a probation officer, and Peter J. Clary, a policeman. He was brought up in Teddington with two older sisters. By his own words, he was conceived "in broad daylight" in Clacton-on-Sea in 1958. Two of his great-grandparents were Germans who immigrated to Britain at the end of the 19th century.[tpl]Citation|title=WDYTYA?

==Stand-up comedy==

Clary began his career under the name Leo Hurll, a fake keyboardist for pop band Thinkman (a recording project conceived by Rupert Hine).visible in the video for the song "Formula"Julian Clary confirms this in his autobiography, A young man's passage. He entered the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s, first under the alias "Gillian Pieface", and later as "The Joan Collins Fanclub". He wore heavy glam make-up and dressed in outrageous clothes, often involving leather/PVC and hinting at bondage. His pet dog "Fanny the Wonder Dog", a whippet, also featured in performances.
Since then, Clary has undertaken several successful tours of his stage act, three of which have been released on home video, including The Mincing Machine Tour (1989), My Glittering Passage (1993) and Lord of the Mince (2011). Clary's latest UK tour, Position Vacant: Apply Within, ran through the autumn of 2012Julian Clary's Official Website and was extended to run from April until June 2013.

==Television, film and theatre==

After a number of appearances on Friday Night Live in the mid-late 1980s, Clary co-hosted the short-lived ITV game show Trick or Treat in 1989 with Mike Smith, before achieving greater success later that year with his own high-camp Channel 4 gameshow, Sticky Moments with Julian Clary. More a vehicle for his brand of humour than a genuine gameshow, Sticky Moments was a light-hearted "non-quiz" satire, with him often awarding points because he liked the contestants, rather than because they possessed a particular skill or aptitude. He later starred in the 1992 audience participation sitcom Terry and Julian with Lee Simpson, again for Channel 4. His next series was the BBC's studio-based All Rise for Julian Clary in 1996, in which he played a judge in a mock courtroom setting. 
In 1992, he played a cameo guest star part in the BBC drama, Virtual Murder. In his episode, "A Dream of Dracula", he played an undertaker, alongside other guest stars including Alfred Marks, Jill Gascoine, Ronald Fraser and Peggy Mount. He also appeared in an episode of the improvisational comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway?
In 1993, he made an infamous appearance at the British Comedy Awards where he made a joke comparing the set to Hampstead Heath (a famed London cruising area for gay men) and stating that he had just been fisting the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont. Although the joke was met with uproarious laughter from the audience, he was criticised in some newspapers, including the Daily Mail and The Sun, who launched an unsuccessful campaign to have him banned from television.

In May 2006, and again in April 2008, he hosted an episode of the topical quiz show Have I Got News for You.
In September 2006, he returned to primetime TV as presenter and judged on Channel 5's brand new celebrity performance programme The All Star Talent Show.

In 2007, he made a cameo appearance in the Australian soap opera, Neighbours, in scenes filmed in London with Natalie Bassingthwaighte.
From 20 March 2007, Clary presented a brand-new show for the BBC called The Underdog Show. Celebrities and children were paired up with rescue dogs. They then commenced training and competed against each other in obedience and agility trials in a live arena. The show ran until 26 April 2007.
In Spring 2007, Clary did a theatre tour of the UK with his show An Evening with... Julian Clary. From 2 October 2007, he played the much coveted role of 'Emcee', in Rufus Norris's Olivier Award winning production of Cabaret, which was in its second year in the West End of London.

In 2012, Clary was one of the contestants in Celebrity Big Brother 10 and went on to win the series. In 2013, he was a judge on the ITV entertainment series Your Face Sounds Familiar, alongside Emma Bunton.

==Film==

Clary appeared in the film Carry On Columbus (1992), an unsuccessful attempt to revive the "Carry On" series of films. It was widely panned by critics, but was more financially profitable than the two other 'Columbus' films released the same year: 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Christopher Columbus: The Discovery
Clary returned to film in 2001 in the film The Baby Juice Express which starred Lisa Faulkner, Samantha Womack, Ruth Jones and David Seaman, about a prisoner who is desperate to find some way of conceiving with his wife whilst he is prison, but the sperm ends up getting hijacked. It was released on DVD in 2004.

==Radio==

In 1992 Clary hosted a radio show for the BBC called Intimate Contact, the premise of which was for him to act as a genial 'Mr Fix-it' for a wide range of 'punter' problems. Clary attempted to solve these issues over the telephone, with the assistance of roving reporter "Hugh Jelly" (actor Philip Herbert). It originally aired on BBC Radio 1 for two series; the pilot and 6-part first series have since been repeated on BBC Radio 7 a number of times.
Clary had also appeared regularly in The Big Fun Show in 1988. He has also often been a guest on Just a Minute, the BBC Radio 4 comedy show.

==Writing==

Clary has released two large format comedy books: My Life With Fanny The Wonder Dog (1989) and How To Be A Man (1992).
Between 2005 and 2008, Clary wrote a fortnightly column for New Statesman magazine. He has also published an autobiography, A Young Man's Passage, which covers his life and career up to the 1993 "Norman Lamont incident" at the British Comedy Awards (see above). In 2007, Clary released his first novel, Murder Most Fab, published by Ebury Press. His second novel, Devil in Disguise, was published in 2009.
