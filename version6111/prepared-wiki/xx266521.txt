"It Will Rain" is featured in the end credits of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1. Mars said the tune was halfway done before he viewed an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. Alexandra Patsavas, music supervisor for the "Twilight" films, said she picked Mars because the latest film centered on a wedding and, "Who more appropriate than Bruno Mars to write a timeless, classic wedding song?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/08/bruno-mars-grammy-the-smeezingtons_n_1262313.html|title=Bruno Mars Heads Back To Grammys With Production Team, Smeezingtons|author=Ryan Pearson|publisher=Huffington Post|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2013[/tpl]
The singer recalls having to literally turn off the radio when hearing his song "It Will Rain" (written for 2011's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1) because of his displeasure with the track's final mix. "I felt like I was a mosquito singing," Mars says with noticeable agitation. "I don't want that to happen again."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474881/bruno-mars-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0%2C0|title=Bruno Mars: The Billboard Cover Story|author=Mitchell Peters|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2013[/tpl]

==Composition and lyrical interpretation==

The agony and torment of heartbreak in the lyrics describe the universal emotional pain of relationship bonds like oxytocin relationships, sexual arousal, bonding and romantic attachment and behavioral addiction, being ripped apart that results in depression.  Although some reviews were mixed, for example Rolling Stone, which gave the song three stars out of five, saying it "sounds a little bit like "Wild Horses," and "a lot like Mars' next radio juggernaut".
