==Biography==

Milton Gendel has lived in Rome since 1949. As a correspondent for ARTnews, he wrote prescient articles about several of Italy's most important artists, including Alberto Burri and Toti Scialoja. Gendel's photographs, too, capture artists and intellectuals against the background of the transformation of Italy during the postwar economic boom. In 1945-46, while stationed in China with the United States Army, he captured the tumultuous period between the Japanese surrender and the advent of civil war that brought the Communists to power. During the 1950s, Gendel portrayed Rome, along with other sites in Italy. His photographs of Sicily recall both Neorealist cinema and the atmosphere of paintings by Giorgio de Chirico. Images from the 1960s are suffused with Dolce Vita glamour, psychological insight and mordant wit.
Gendel's work was the subject of dual retrospective exhibitions at the Museo Carlo Bilotti and the American Academy in Rome in 2011."Life and work of American photographer Milton Gendel celebrated in two exhibitions", ArtDaily, October 26, 2011."
