Chris Nero (born 14 February 1981) is an Australian/Italian professional rugby league player. He plays in the Super League for Salford City Reds. His usual position is [tpl]rlp|SR[/tpl], although he can also play in the [tpl]rlp|CE[/tpl]s. Nero leaves the Bulls at the end of the 2010 season to play for Salford City Reds.
Since joining the Giants in 2004, he has been a consistent try scorer for the club.
Nero played for Huddersfield in the 2006 Challenge Cup final at centre but the Giants lost 12-42 against St Helens RFC.
It was announced in August 2007 that he will leave the Giants.
Chris joined the Bulls in September 2007 after spending three years at the Giants. Last season he was voted 'Player's' Player of the Year and will be a great addition to the Bulls side. His direct running and combination of speed and power means he is equally effective in the second row or in the centres, and he has been a consistent try scorer in both positions. He is also a tremendous tackler and will quickly become a favourite with the Bulls fans.
After recent sparkling form, Centre Nero (28) has been linked with a move to fellow Super League club Wigan Warriors as a replacement for George Carmont.
