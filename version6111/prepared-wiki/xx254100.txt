The Authority is governed by a five-member board of directors, including three appointed by the Governor, one (attorney Luis Berríos-Amadeo) selected by President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, Thomas Rivera Schatz, and another, former San Juan mayor Dr. Hernán Padilla, selected by Speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives Jennifer González. The Board is headed by Puerto Rico Government Development Bank president Carlos M. García and day-to-day operations are headed by executive director David Alvarez.
Although final decisions are made and PPP contracts signed by the Governor, the current chief executive has signed an Executive Order delegating that role to Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock, who has assumed the role of advocate of Puerto Rico's P3 process.http://app.gobierno.pr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/KDM-P3-Forum-Pres-Jun-23-2010-KDM-Revised-FINAL.pdf
