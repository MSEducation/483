==History==

Kansas State University, originally named Kansas State Agricultural College, was founded in Manhattan on February 16, 1863, during the American Civil War, as a land-grant institution under the Morrill Act.[tpl]cite book | last = Willard | first = Julius | title = History of Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science | publisher = Kansas State College Press | year = 1940 | url = http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=hearth;cc=hearth;rgn=full%20text;idno=5725255;didno=5725255;view=image;seq=0003;node=5725255%3A3 [/tpl] The school was the first land-grant college created under the Morrill Act.[tpl]Cite journal | title = The National Schools of Science | journal = The Nation | page = 409 | date = November 21, 1867 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&f=false | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] K-State is the third-oldest school in the Big 12 Conference and the oldest public university in the state of Kansas.
The effort to establish the school began in 1861, the year that Kansas was admitted to the United States.  One of the new state legislature's top priorities involved establishing a state university. That year, the delegation from Manhattan introduced a bill to convert Blue Mont Central College (a private college incorporated in Manhattan in 1858) into the state university.[tpl]cite journal | last = Willard | first = Julius | title = Bluemont Central College, the Forerunner of Kansas State College | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | date = May 1945 | url = http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1945/45_6_willard.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-29[/tpl]  But the bill establishing the university in Manhattan was controversially vetoed by Governor Charles L. Robinson of Lawrence, and an attempt to override the veto in the Legislature failed by two votes.[tpl]cite web| last =Griffin | first =C.S. | title =The University of Kansas and the Years of Frustration, 1854–64 | url =http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1966/66_1_griffin.htm | accessdate =2006-10-06[/tpl]  In 1862, another bill to make Manhattan the site of the state university failed by one vote.  Finally, upon the third attempt on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds and established the state's land-grant college at the site – the institution that would become Kansas State University.
When the college opened for its first session on September 2, 1863, it became only the second public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally in the United States.[tpl]cite book | last = Olson | first = Kevin | title = Frontier Manhattan | publisher = University Press of Kansas | year = 2012 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-7006-1832-3[/tpl]  Enrollment for the first session totaled 52 students: 26 men and 26 women.
The early years of the institution witnessed debate over whether the college should provide a focused agricultural education or a full liberal arts education. During this era, the tenor of the school shifted with the tenure of university presidents.  For example, President John A. Anderson (1873–1879) favored a limited education and President George T. Fairchild (1879–1897) favored a classic liberal education.[tpl]cite book | title = Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History | publisher = Standard Publishing Co. | year = 1912 | url = http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/a/agricultural_college.html | accessdate = 2009-01-13[/tpl]  Fairchild was credited with saying, "Our college exists not so much to make men farmers as to make farmers men."
During this era, in 1873, Kansas State helped pioneer the academic teaching of home economics for women, becoming one of the first two colleges to offer the program of study.[tpl]cite book | last = Craig | first = Hazel | last2 = Stover | first2 = Blanche | title = The History of Home Economics | year = 1946 | url = http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=hearth;cc=hearth;rgn=full%20text;idno=5725268;didno=5725268;view=image;seq=7;node=5725268%3A5;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; | page = 5 | accessdate = 2009-09-01 | isbn = 0-585-06199-8[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = History of the K-State College of Human Ecology | url = http://www.humec.k-state.edu/about/history-college.php | accessdate = 2009-09-01[/tpl]  In 1874, the college also became the first in the United States to offer printing courses, which led to journalism courses being launched in 1910; thus, today's A.Q. Miller School of Journalism & Mass Communications, though no longer teaching printing, has the nation's longest continuously offered curriculum in mass communication.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In November 1928, the school was accredited by the Association of American Universities (AAU) as a school whose graduates were deemed capable of advanced graduate work. The name of the school was changed in 1931 to Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science.  In 1959, the Kansas legislature changed the name again to Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Science to reflect a growing number of graduate programs, although as a practical and legal matter it has since been referred to as Kansas State University.[tpl]cite web | title = University Archives Facts and Flyers  | url = http://www.lib.k-state.edu/depts/spec/flyers/ | accessdate = 2008-03-05[/tpl]KS Statutes: Ch 76 Article 4: Kansas State University. Kansasstatutes.lesterama.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. Milton S. Eisenhower served as president of the university from 1943 to 1950, and Dr. James McCain succeeded him, serving from 1950 to 1975. Several buildings, including residence halls and a student union, were added to the campus in the 1950s. The 1960s witnessed demonstrations against the Vietnam War, though fewer than at other college campuses. Enrollment was relatively high through most of the 1970s, but the university endured a downward spiral from approximately 1976 to 1986, when enrollment decreased to 17,570 and a number of faculty resigned. In 1986, Jon Wefald assumed the presidency of Kansas State University. During his tenure, enrollment and donations increased.
On June 15, 2009, Kirk Schulz became the 13th president of Kansas State University.Kansas State Collegian Schulz begins new term In March 2010 he announced his K-State 2025 plan.K-State News Services "K-State beginning ambitious plan for next 15 years to be a top 50 public university" The initiative is designed to elevate K-State to a top 50 nationally recognized research university by 2025.

==Campus==

The university moved its main campus from the location of Blue Mont Central College to its present site in 1875. The original site is now occupied by Central National Bank of Manhattan and Founders Hill Apartments.
The main campus of Kansas State University in Manhattan now covers [tpl]convert|668|acre|km2[/tpl].  The campus is very historic, featuring more buildings built before 1910 than any other campus in Kansas.  Holtz Hall, built in 1876, is the oldest free-standing building on campus. However, the oldest building on campus is the original section of Seaton Hall, which now forms Seaton Court, facing the courtyard of Hale Library and Eisenhower Hall. Originally named the Industrial Workshop, this section of Seaton Hall is the oldest remaining education building on the Manhattan campus.
The predominant architectural feature of the Manhattan campus is its use of native limestone.  This includes the signature building at Kansas State University, Anderson Hall, developed in three stages between 1877 and 1885.  Anderson Hall, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has housed the university's administrative offices for more than a century.  Although there are many historic building on the campus, since 1986 Kansas State has also added over two million square feet (186,000 m²) of new buildings to the campus, including an expanded library, new art museum, and plant sciences building.
Several of the buildings on campus were heavily damaged by an EF4 tornado on June 11, 2008. Damage estimates totaled more than $20 million.Wichita Eagle-Beacon Tornadoes rip Manhattan, KSU damage more than $20 million K-State paid a deductible of $5 million for their insurance to repair all damages.

==Academic profile==

The graduate school offers 65 master's degree programs and nearly 50 doctoral programs.
In 1991, the former Kansas Technical Institute in Salina, Kansas was merged with Kansas State University by an act of the Kansas legislature.  The College of Technology and Aviation is located at the Salina campus, and is commonly referred to as K-State Salina.
K-State implemented an academic honor code in 1999.[tpl]cite web | title=  KSU Honor Code| url=http://www.k-state.edu/honor| accessdate =2007-03-02[/tpl]  When students are admitted, it is implied that they will adhere to the Honor Pledge: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."

==Research==

The university has had a long-standing interest in agriculture, particularly native Great Plains plant and animal life. The Kansas State University Gardens is an on-campus horticulture display garden that serves as an educational resource and learning laboratory for K-State students and the public. The Konza Prairie is a native tallgrass prairie preserve located south of Manhattan, which is co-owned by The Nature Conservancy and Kansas State University and operated as a field research station by the department of biology.  The university also owns an additional [tpl]convert|18000|acre|km2[/tpl] in cities across the state that it operates as Agricultural Experiment Stations in research centers in Hays, Garden City, Colby, and Parsons.
In 2006, K-State dedicated the Biosecurity Research Institute.K-State News Services "K-State's Biosecurity Research Institute to provide research, training space for food safety and security efforts" The BRI, in Pat Roberts Hall, is a safe and secure location in which scientists and their collaborators can study high-consequence pathogens.

===Television and radio===

Kansas State was involved in early experimentation with television and radio broadcasts.  The first radio station licensed in Manhattan was Kansas State's experimental station 9YV.[tpl]cite web | title = U.S. Special Land Stations: 1913–1921 Recap | publisher = earlyradiohistory.us | url = http://earlyradiohistory.us/speclnd2.htm | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl] In 1912 the station began a daily broadcast (in morse code) of the weather forecast, becoming the first radio station in the U.S. to air a regularly-scheduled forecast.[tpl]cite web | title = A Chronology of AM Radio Broadcasting 1900–1960 | url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/chrono1.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = KKSU History | url = http://www.route56.com/radio/mid/kksu.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl]  After a series of efforts to secure a more high-powered signal for the university – including a brief cooperation with John R. Brinkley's notorious KFKB – Kansas State was granted a license for KSAC, which began broadcasting with 500 watts of power on December 1, 1924. The station was reassigned to the frequency of AM 580 in 1928, and continued broadcasting on that frequency until November 27, 2002, when it made its last broadcast after the frequency was bought out by WIBW in Topeka, Kansas.
On March 9, 1932, the Federal Radio Commission granted Kansas State a license to operate the television station W9XAK.[tpl]cite web | title = Early Television Stations: W9XAK - Manhattan, Kansas | publisher = Early Television Museum | url = http://www.earlytelevision.org/w9xak.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl]  It was the first television station in Kansas.[tpl]cite web | title = A U.S. Television Chronology: 1875–1970| url = http://claytwhitehead.com/ctwlibrary/Box%20070/003_Timelines%20%5B2%20of%202%5D.pdf | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl] Activity on the station peaked in 1933 and 1934, with original programs being produced three nights a week.

Student media includes KSDB-FM The Wildcat 91.9 Student Radio, the Kansas State Collegian, the Royal Purple Yearbook, and the "Purple Power Hour," "Manhattan Matters," & "Wildcat Watch".
Alma Mater is the name of the official school song of Kansas State University. In 1888, when the University was still Kansas State Agricultural College, H.W. Jones submitted the song as part of a school-wide contest. It was originally a four-stanza song and, over the years, some lyrics have changed.Kansas State Traditions - Kansas State University Wildcats Official Athletics Site The song is sung at most K-State sporting events by fans, students and alumni. Wildcat Victory and Wabash Cannonball are both commonly used as fight songs. Wildcat Victory is used by many high schools as their fight song.

====Fraternities and sororities====

For nearly 100 years, K-State has been home to several national and international social-leadership and service fraternities and sororities.  An important and historic aspect of what they refer to as "the Wildcat family", fraternal organizations have had a tremendous influence on the campus.  Several buildings were named after fraternal members, and after the multitude of contributions given in the forms of what they refer to as time, talent and treasure.

==Athletics==

Intercollegiate sports began at Kansas State in the 1890s.  The school's sports teams are called the Wildcats, and they participate in the NCAA's Division I and the Big 12 Conference.  The official school color is Royal Purple, making Kansas State one of very few schools (alongside Syracuse[tpl]cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://studentactivities.syr.edu/traditions/index.html|publisher=Syracuse University[/tpl]  and Harvard[tpl]cite web|title=History of Harvard University|url=http://www.harvard.edu/history|work=Harvard at a Glance|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=28 January 2014[/tpl]) that have only one official color.[tpl]cite web | title = Kansas State Traditions | url = http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&KEY=&ATCLID=37671 | format = English | accessdate = 2008-11-30[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  White and silver are commonly used as complementary colors, with white mentioned with purple in the university's fight song "Wildcat Victory." The athletics logo is a stylized Wildcat head in profile usually featured in the school color, called the "Powercat."
Sports sponsored by the school include football, basketball, cross country and track, baseball, golf, tennis, rowing, equestrian and volleyball.  The head football coach is Bill Snyder, the head men's basketball coach is Bruce Weber, the head women's basketball coach is Jeff Mittie, and the head baseball coach is Brad Hill.  In 2012−2013, Kansas State became only the second Big 12 school to win conference titles in football, men's basketball, and baseball in the same school year.[tpl]cite news| title = Is K-State nation's hottest school? | agency = Associated Press | date = March 12, 2013 | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/collegebasketball/story/kansas-state-big-12-football-basketball-champions-nations-hottest-program-looking-to-cap-magical-season-031213 | accessdate = 2013-03-13[/tpl]
Historically, African-American athletes at Kansas State were responsible for breaking the modern "color barrier" in Big Seven Conference athletics.  Harold Robinson became the first African-American athlete in the conference in more than two decades and the first ever to receive a scholarship, playing football for Kansas State in 1949.  In the spring of 1951 the conference's baseball color barrier was broken by Kansas State's Earl Woods, and in the winter of 1951–1952 Kansas State's Gene Wilson broke the conference color barrier in basketball (together with LaVannes C. Squires at the University of Kansas).

===Alumni===

Beginning with the first graduating class in 1867,[tpl]cite book | title = Record of the Alumni of the Kansas State Agricultural College | year = 1914 | url =http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/education/ksu/ksugrads1.html[/tpl] a number of Kansas State alums have gone on to distinguished careers.  The current Governor of Kansas and one U.S. Senator from Kansas are graduates of Kansas State University.  Other graduates currently serve as the vice-president of Liberia, the president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the chief White House photographer.  Kansas State alums have been enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame, served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and have earned Emmy Awards and Olympic gold medals.

===Faculty===

In line with its roots as a land grant college, a number of Kansas State's most eminent faculty in its earliest years were in the areas of agriculture, science and military.  For example, famed geologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge was chair of the geology department, while famed Army officer Andrew Summers Rowan, the subject of the essay A Message to Garcia, served as professor of military tactics.
Kansas State faculty have received a number of awards.  Prof. Fred Albert Shannon was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1929, while teaching history at Kansas State. In 2008, CASE and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching honored Michael Wesch as national Professor of the Year.  At least three Kansas State faculty members have gone on to serve as university presidents elsewhere, including Naomi B. Lynn, the first Hispanic female president of an American public university.
