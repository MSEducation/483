==History==

The village was called Safsofa in Roman times.Khalidi, 1992, p 490
In the early sixteenth century CE, Safsaf was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and by 1596, it was a village in the nahiyah ("subdistrict") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad. It had a population of 138, and it paid taxes on several agricultural items including wheat, barley, olives and fruits, as well as other types of produce, such as beehives and goats.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah p.177, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 490.
In the late nineteenth century, travellers reported that Safsaf was a small village situated on a plain, with a population of about 100. They also noted that "ornamented stones of a preexisting public building" had been built into the doorway of the village mosque.SWP (Survey of Western Palestine), (1881) I 257. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 491 The villagers cultivated olive and fig trees and vineyards.SWP,  I 200. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 491
Safsaf became a part of the British Mandate in 1922. During this time, the village lay on the eastern side of the Safad-Tarshiha highway and extended in a northeast-southwest direction. All the residents of Safsaf were Muslims. A mosque and several shops were located in the village center, and an elementary school was established during this period. Agriculture was the main economic activity, and it was both irrigated from springs and rainfed. Fruits and olives were cultivated on the land north of the village. In 1944/45 a total of 2,586 dunums were allotted to cereals; 769 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.Hadawi, 1970, p.121
On October 29, 1948, Israeli forces assaulted the village as part of Operation Hiram.[tpl]Citation|title=Welcome to Safsaf|publisher=Palestine Remembered|accessdate=2007-12-12|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Safad/Safsaf/index.html[/tpl] After the villagers surrendered, some 50-70 men were massacred while bound and three women were allegedly raped.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 153Nazzal, 1978, p. 93-96Morris, 2004, p. 481
