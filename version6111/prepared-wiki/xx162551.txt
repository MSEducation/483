 Mormons identify him as the Biblical god [[Elohim]]. Latter-day Saint leaders have also taught that God the Father was once a mortal man who has completed the process of becoming an exalted being.

===Origin of Jehovah (Jesus)===

According to Mormon belief, Jesus is identified as the god Jehovah (Yahweh).  The pre-mortal Jehovah was born to the Virgin Mary and was named Jesus. Jesus was the Son of God—the literal father of his physical body was God the Father.Ezra Taft Benson, “Five Marks of the Divinity of Jesus Christ,” New Era, December 1980, p. 44; reprinted in Ensign, December 2001, p. 8. Because Jesus was the Son of God, he had power to overcome physical death.John 10:17–18. Because he lived a perfect and sinless life, Jesus could offer himself as an "infinite and eternal" sacrifice that would be required to pay for the sins of all of the other children of God.Alma 34:10–12.

===Adam/Michael, under the Adam–God doctrine===

According to Brigham Young, Adam was a god identified as the Biblical archangel Michael prior to his placement in the Garden of Eden. The pre-existent godhood of Adam/Michael is now repudiated by the LDS Church, but it is accepted by some adherents of Mormon fundamentalism.  According to this interpretation of Young's teachings, Michael was a god who had received his exaltation.  He took Eve, one of his wives, to the Garden,[tpl]harvtxt|Young|1852|p=50[/tpl]. where they became mortal by eating the fruit in the garden.[tpl]harvtxt|Young|1852b|p=13[/tpl].
Although the LDS Church has repudiated the Adam–God doctrine,"Encyclopedia of Mormonism: Adam" the denomination's Endowment ceremony portrays this Adam/Michael as a participant with Jesus in the creation of the earth, under the direction of Elohim.Keith Meservy, “Four Accounts of the Creation,” Ensign, January 1986, p. 50.

===Heavenly mother, the Holy Ghost, and other gods and goddesses===

The official doctrine of the LDS Church includes the existence of "heavenly parents" (plural), which is generally understood to refer to the goddess Heavenly Mother, who exists alongside God the Father.Wilcox, Linda P., "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven", Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective, edited by Maureen Ursenbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Anderson (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987), pp. 64–77.
The Holy Ghost has a spirit body, in contrast with the Heavenly Father, the Heavenly Mother, and Jesus Christ, who have celestial bodies.

==Other worlds and extraterrestrial life==

Mormon cosmology teaches that the Earth is not unique, but just one of many inhabited planets,[tpl]citation|author=Johnson|year=1992|page=1595[/tpl] each planet created for the purpose of bringing about the immortality and "eternal life" (i.e., the highest degree of salvation) of humanity.[tpl]citation|author=Johnson|year=1992|page=1595[/tpl] (citing [tpl]Sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Moses|chapter=1|verse=39[/tpl]). These worlds were, according to doctrine, created by Jesus. Because Mormonism holds that Jesus created the universe, yet his father, God the Father, once dwelt upon an earth as a mortal, it may be interpreted that Mormonism teaches the existence of a multiverse, and it is not clear if the other inhabited worlds mentioned in LDS scripture and teachings refers to planets within this universe or not.Kirk D. Hagen, "Eternal Progression in a Multiverse: An Explorative Mormon Cosmology", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 39, no. 2 (Summer 2006) pp. 1–45. Mormon leaders and theologians have taught that these inhabitants are similar or identical to humans, and that they are subject to the Atonement of Jesus.
The doctrine of other worlds is found in LDS scripture, in the Endowment ceremony, and in the teachings of Joseph Smith, Jr. In addition, many LDS leaders and theologians have elaborated on these principles through exegesis or speculation, and many of these ideas are widely accepted among Mormons.

===Official sources===

According to a revelation dictated by Joseph Smith, Jr., Jesus is the creator of many worlds, so "that by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God."
D&C 76:24 (emphasis added).
