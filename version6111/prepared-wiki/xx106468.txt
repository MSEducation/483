Elmer's Candid Camera is a 1940 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones, and first released on March 2, 1940, by Warner Bros. It marks the first appearance of a redesigned Elmer Fudd (voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan),  and the fourth starring appearance of Happy Rabbit (excluding Elmer's Pet Rabbit, where he was billed as Bugs Bunny, the first instance of that name being used on-screen, and a cameo in a later cartoon Patient Porky) until Looney Tunes: Back in Action (first re-seen in the final minutes of a deleted scenes montage featured on that film's DVD release).

==Plot==

Elmer has come to the country to photograph wildlife. As he tries to photograph Happy Rabbit, Happy finds himself a convenient victim to harass. This tormenting eventually drives Elmer insane, causing him to jump into a lake and nearly drown. Happy saves him, ensures that Elmer is all right now - and then kicks him straight back into the lake. Then, Happy throws Elmer's "How To Photograph Wildlife" book on his head thus ending the cartoon as the screen.
