Lindores Loch is a freshwater loch situated in North Fife in the Parish of Abdie. The Loch has for many years been used as a fishery and is well known for its abundant fish life. A curling pond is situated on the Northern shoreline and is nominally used by the Abdie Curling Club and Abdie ladies Curling Club. A speculative study suggests that the loch was created by glacial deposits from the surrounding Ochil Hills at the end of the last ice-age. The water level and shoreline have changed over time due to roads, railway, sluice gate and farmland.

==Geography==

The loch is nestled in the Ochil Hills between Woodmill Hill to the west and Dunboghill to the East and Kinnaird Hill to the North. The water stretches from the village of Lindores southwards for a distance of 1.3Â km. It is a shallow loch with a maximum depth of 3m.

==History==

The old Abdie Parish Church ruins are close to the north shoreline. The ruins of Inchrye House, a grand Victorian Gothic house to which estate the loch once belonged, lay to the East. The rail line between Perth and Ladybank is located on the west shoreline. The loch was an important source of water for powering mills in the Lindores valley, where up to 13 mills of various types operated from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century.
