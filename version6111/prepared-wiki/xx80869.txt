[[Doppler cooling limit]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics, Threshold temperatures

Doppler temperature is the minimum temperature achievable with Doppler cooling, one of the methods of laser cooling.
The term Doppler arises from the fact that the Doppler effect, which provides a velocity dependence of the absorption rate and thus the light force, is an essential ingredient of the Doppler cooling mechanism.
Temperatures well below the Doppler limit have been achieved with various laser cooling methods, including Sisyphus cooling, which allows to approach the lower so-called recoil limit.
