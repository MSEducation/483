The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams is a 1972 novel by Charles E. Sellier Jr.. There is a 1974 film based on the novel, a two-season NBC television series, and a 1982 TV movie. The title character, played by Dan Haggerty, is loosely based on the actual trapper James "Grizzly" Adams.
Grizzly Adams (Haggerty) is a woodsman during the frontier era who flees into the mountains after he is wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams discovers an orphaned grizzly bear cub whom he takes in and calls Ben. The bear, despite his huge adult size, becomes Adams's closest companion. Adams proves to have an uncanny link to most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, who have no fear of him. In return, he resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible. In the television series, Adams had two human companions, an old trader named Mad Jack the Mountain Man (Denver Pyle, commonly featured with a mule named "Number Seven") and a native American named Nakoma (Don Shanks). Together, they helped various visitors while protecting the wildlife.
The series was concluded with a 1982 TV movie called The Capture of Grizzly Adams where a bounty hunter used Adams's daughter—not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film—to draw him back to civilization. In the end, Adams proved his innocence. NBC aired this 2 hour finale on February 21, 1982.

==Cast==

In addition to Ben, there were many other named animals in the series, the most prominent being Number 7, Mad Jack's ornery mule.
Gene Edwards—a stunt double for Dan Haggerty—later played Grizzly Adams in the otherwise unrelated 1990 film The Legend of Grizzly Adams.

==Production==

Grizzly Adams was the creation of Sunn Classic Pictures, a company based in Park City, Utah, operated by founder Charles E. Sellier Jr., who had written the book on which first the 1974 movie, and then the series, was based. The studio successfully made up for its lack of experience with lavish marketing and promotional budgets. The 1974 movie was a runaway success, produced on a $140,000 budget but which went on to earn $65 million at theaters. The 43% market share captured by a 1976 airing of this film on NBC caused network executives to greenlight a television series. This series drew a 32% market share, a figure which still remains very significant to this day. The enterprise also came at a time when the environmental movement flourished.
In a 1978 interview with TV Guide, Sellier said that the company used extensive market testing to produce the series, which was based on tests showing that audiences liked stories about men and animals in the wilderness; that bears were favorite wilderness animals; and that grizzlies were the favorite type of bear.[tpl]cite news |title=Studio Cleans Up By Marketing Films Like Selling Soap. |first=Janice C. |last=Chimpson |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 6, 1978[/tpl] The actual filming locations for the television series took place in the mountains near Ruidoso, New Mexico.
The show's theme song, “Maybe,” was written and sung by Thom Pace. The song was released as a single in Europe, where it reached number one, and in 1980 won Germany's Goldene Europa award for best song.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
