==Career==

===Early career===

Cox appeared in the 1984 music video for Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" as a young woman pulled onstage at the St. Paul Civic Center to dance with Springsteen. Her early television work includes a starring role in the short-lived television series Misfits of Science (1985), and later a recurring role (1987–89) on the TV series Family Ties as Lauren Miller, the girlfriend of Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox). Her early film roles include Masters of the Universe (1987) and Cocoon: The Return (1988) and I'll Be Home for Christmas (1988).  She had a supporting role as Jewel, the hard-as-nails assistant to James Belushi's character, in the 1990 fantasy film Mr. Destiny. In 1994, shortly before the debut of the sitcom, Friends, Cox appeared with Jim Carrey in the film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and on Seinfeld in "The Wife" episode as Jerry's girlfriend named Meryl. In 1995, she was cast in Toad the Wet Sprocket's music video "Good Intentions". The song is also on the Friends Soundtrack.

===Friends===

Later in 1994 Cox was asked to audition for the part of Rachel Green on a new sitcom, Friends; she was cast as Monica Geller instead.[tpl]cite web|last=Fair |first=Vanity |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |title=The Oral History of Friends: Jennifer Aniston Almost Didn’t Play Rachel Green |publisher=Vanity Fair |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07[/tpl] At first the most famous cast member of the new show, Cox joined fellow castmates Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) and David Schwimmer (Ross Geller) for what would become her most famous role, lasting for 10 seasons until 2004. According to the Guinness Book of World Records (2005), Cox (along with her female costars) became the highest paid TV actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final two seasons of Friends.
Between seasons five and six, Cox married David Arquette, and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. An in-joke reference to this is made in the beginning credits of the episode "The One After Vegas", where the rest of the cast and executive producers have "Arquette" added to their names. The dedication "For Courteney and David, who did get married" – a reference to Monica and Chandler's decision not to marry in the episode – appears during the fade out to the tag scene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/product-description/B00004I9PR |title=Friends – Series 6 – Episodes 1–4: Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Courteney Cox, Gary Halvorson: Video |publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=November 24, 2010[/tpl]
