[[Lists of tropical cyclone names]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of tropical cyclones, Lists of names

Due to their long-term persistence, and the need for a unique identifier in issuing forecasts and warnings, tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are given names according to policy (see Tropical cyclone naming). The following are lists from which these tropical and subtropical cyclone names are derived.

==North Atlantic==

Within the North Atlantic ocean, tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC/RSMC Miami) when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 km/h, (40 mph). The World Meteorological Organisation maintains six alphabetical lists of names which alternate between masculine and feminine and are used on a six-year cycle. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.). Greek-letter names, unlike the names in the regular lists, cannot be retired. If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement, the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating that the Greek letter would still be available for future storms.[tpl]Cite web|date=2010-07-30|title=RA IV Hurricane Operational Plan for North America, Central America and the Caribbean Hurricane Operational Plan|work=Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee|format=PDF|author=Unattributed|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|date=2010-06-01|accessdate=2010-09-25|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP30_2010_OpsPlan_En.pdf[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|author=Unattributed|title=Frequently asked questions: B: Tropical Cyclone Names|work=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B2.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|work=Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf|author=Unattributed|date=2006-04-04|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5szgi2O7l|archivedate=2010-09-24|title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Twenty-eighth Session report|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2010-09-24[/tpl] The next name to be used within the basin is Arthur.

==Eastern Pacific Ocean==

Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean there are two Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) who assign names to tropical cyclones when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 km/h, (40 mph). Tropical cyclones that intensify into tropical storms between the coast of Americas and 140°W are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC/RSMC Miami), whilst tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140°W and 180° are named by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC/RSMC Honolulu). Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. Should a tropical cyclone pass from the NHC's area of responsibility in to the CPHC's or vice versa it will retain its original name.

===North Pacific east of 140°W===

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W then it will be named by the NHC. Six lists of names, alternating between masculine and feminine, are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization with them rotating on a yearly basis. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are then named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.). Greek names, unlike the names in the regular lists, cannot be retired. If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement, the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms. The next name to be used within the basin is Amanda.

===Central North Pacific (140°W to 180°)===

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between 140°W and 180° it is named by the CPHC. Four lists of Hawaiian names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, rotating without regard to year, with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. The last name to be used from this list was Unala, while the next one will be Wali.

==Western Pacific Ocean (180° to 100°E)==

Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which often results in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h, (40 mph), to the north of the equator between the 180° and 100°E. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===International names===

Tropical Cyclones are named from the following lists by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo, Japan, once they reach tropical storm strength. Names are contributed by members of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. Each of the 14 states or territories submitted 10 names, which are used in alphabetical order, by the English name of the country.[tpl]Cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone names|date=2009-01-21|accessdate=2010-09-24|author=Unattributed|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|year=2010|title=FAQ: B) Tropical cyclones names|accessdate=2010-06-06|author=Unattributed|publisher=Meteo France|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/faq/FAQ_Ang_B.html[/tpl]
Note: Names listed under United States are from Chamorro (language of the Mariana Islands), Palauan, and Marshallese. Names listed under Micronesia are from the four main languages of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The U.S. National Weather Service funds and administers weather offices in the FSM, Palau and the Marshall Islands. The next name to be used within the basin is Mitag.

===Philippines===

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, regardless of whether it forms within or enters from beyond. These unique identifiers are usually local nicknames for people; should the list of names for a given year be exhausted, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first ten of which (i.e. those beginning in letter A-J) are published every year.[tpl]Cite web|title=Philippine Tropical cyclone names|publisher=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|accessdate=February 18, 2014|date=June 1, 2013|url=http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/learning-tools/philippine-tropical-cylcone-names[/tpl] There are no names that begin with the Filipino letters Ñ, NG and X. The next name to be used within the area is Ester.

==North Indian Ocean (45°E – 100°E)==

Within this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached Cyclonic Storm intensity with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The names were selected by members of the ESCAP/WMO panel on Tropical Cyclones between 2000 and May 2004, before the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in New Delhi started to assign names in September 2004. There is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up. Should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin, from the Western Pacific then it will retain its original name.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] The next name to be used within the basin is Nanauk.

==South-West Indian Ocean (90°E – 30°E)==

Within the South-west Indian Ocean, tropical and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h, (40 mph) or more for at least 6 hours by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Réunion Island, France are named. However it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names the storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E; if the storm should intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. New name lists are used every year, whilst a name is normally only used once so thus no names are retired.[tpl]Cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-West Indian Ocean (2012)|author=RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2012-11-12|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|year=2010|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP-12-WMO-TD-577-rev-2012_121495_en.pdf|format=PDF|type=[/tpl] The next name to be used within the basin is Jirani.

==Australian Region (90°E – 160°E)==

Within the Australian Region there are five different official Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers who assign names to tropical cyclones. However as three of the warning centers are run by the Bureau of Meteorology of Australia, only 3 lists of names exist. A tropical low or a tropical depression will be judged to have intensified into a tropical cyclone if winds reach 65 km/h, (40 mph) and it is evident that gales are occurring more than halfway around the center. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next WMO Regional Association V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.[tpl]cite report|author=RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP24_RAVOpPlan_2012.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-East Indian Ocean and the Southern Pacific Ocean 2012|date=December 12, 2012|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl]
When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10°S and between 90°E and 141°E then it will be named by TCWC Jakarta. Should a tropical low intensify into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10°S and between 141°E and 160°E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Tropical lows intensifying into tropical cyclones in all other areas between 90°E and 160°E as well as the Equator and 40°S are named by the Bureau of Meteorology of Australia.

===Indonesia===

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10°S and between 90°E and 141°E it will be named by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Jakarta, Indonesia. Names are currently assigned in sequence from list A, whilst list B details names that will replace names on list A that are retired.[tpl]Cite web|accessdate=December 14, 2008|title=Cyclone Names|author=Unattributed|publisher=Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Agency|url=http://meteo.bmkg.go.id/siklon/name[/tpl] The next name to be used is Bakung.

===Australia===

When a tropical low intensifies into a tropical cyclone between 10°S and 40°S and between 90°E and 160°E, then it will be named by one of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres in Perth, Darwin, or Brisbane. Starting with Anika, the names are assigned in alphabetical order, alternating between masculine and feminine names, with the lists used in rotating order without regard to year.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/about/names.shtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AeJXfi2D|title=Australian Tropical Cyclone Names|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=September 13, 2012|archivedate=September 13, 2012[/tpl] The next name that will be used within this basin is Kate.

===Papua New Guinea===

When a tropical low intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the equator and 10°S and between 141°E and 160°E then it will be named by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in Port Moresby, New Guinea. Names are assigned randomly by TCWC Port Moresby whilst list B details replacement names for list A which will be added in the bottom of list A to maintain the alphabetical order. As tropical cyclones rarely form in TCWC Port Moresby's area of responsibility when one does form the name is retired regardless of any impact reported.

==Southern Pacific Ocean (160°E – 120°W)==

Within the Southern Pacific a tropical depression is judged to have reached tropical cyclone intensity should it reach winds of 65 km/h (40 mph), and it is evident that gales are occurring at least halfway around the center. Tropical depressions that should intensify into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 25°S and between 160°E and 120°W are named by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi). Should a Tropical Depression intensify to the south of 25°S between 160°E and 120°W, it will be named in conjunction with RSMC Nadi by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand (TCWC Wellington). Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting, while tropical cyclones that move into the Australian region will retain its original name. The next name that will be used within this basin is Nute.

==Other areas==

Tropical cyclone formation is rare within the Mediterranean Sea, South Atlantic and to the east of 120W in the Southern Pacific, as a result there are no official naming lists for these areas although in 2004, 2010 & 2011 when tropical cyclones formed within the South Atlantic they were named as Catarina, Anita and Arani.
