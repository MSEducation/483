where Fk represents the force on the kth particle, which is located at position rk.  The word "virial" derives from vis, the Latin word for "force" or "energy", and was given its technical definition by Rudolf Clausius in 1870.[tpl]cite journal | last = Clausius | first = RJE | year = 1870 | title = On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat | journal = Philosophical Magazine, Ser. 4 | volume = 40 | pages = 122–127[/tpl]
The significance of the virial theorem is that it allows the average total kinetic energy to be calculated even for very complicated systems that defy an exact solution, such as those considered in statistical mechanics; this average total kinetic energy is related to the temperature of the system by the equipartition theorem.  However, the virial theorem does not depend on the notion of temperature and holds even for systems that are not in thermal equilibrium.  The virial theorem has been generalized in various ways, most notably to a tensor form.
If the force between any two particles of the system results from a potential energy V(r) = αr n that is proportional to some power n of the inter-particle distance r, the virial theorem takes the simple form
Although the virial theorem depends on averaging the total kinetic and potential energies, the presentation here postpones the averaging to the last step.

==History==

In  1870, Rudolf Clausius delivered the lecture "On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat" to the Association for Natural and Medical Sciences of the Lower Rhine, following a 20 year study of thermodynamics. The lecture stated that the mean vis viva of the system is equal to its virial, or that the average kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 the average potential energy. The virial theorem can be obtained directly from Lagrange's Identity as applied in classical gravitational dynamics, the original form of which was included in Lagrange's "Essay on the Problem of Three Bodies" published in 1772. Karl Jacobi's generalization of the identity to n bodies and to the present form of Laplace's identity closely resembles the classical virial theorem. However, the interpretations leading to the development of the equations were very different, since at the time of development, statistical dynamics had not yet unified the separate studies of thermodynamics and classical dynamics.Collins, G. W. (1978). The Virial Theorem in Stellar Astrophysics. Pachart Press. Introduction  The theorem was later utilized, popularized, generalized and further developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh, Henri Poincaré, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Enrico Fermi, Paul Ledoux and Eugene Parker.   Fritz Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to deduce the existence of unseen matter, which is now called dark matter. As another example of its many applications, the virial theorem has been used to derive the Chandrasekhar limit for the stability of white dwarf stars.

==Statement and derivation==

===Definitions of the virial and its time derivative===

For a collection of N point particles, the scalar moment of inertia I about the origin is defined by the equation
where mk and rk represent the mass and position of the kth particle.  rk=|rk| is the position vector magnitude.  The scalar virial G  is defined by the equation
where pk is the momentum vector of the kth particle.  Assuming that the masses are constant, the virial G  is one-half the time derivative of this moment of inertia
In turn, the time derivative of the virial G can be written

===Connection with the potential energy between particles===

It often happens that the forces can be derived from a potential energy V that is a function only of the distance rjk between the point particles j and k.  Since the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, we have in this case
Thus, we have

===Special case of power-law forces===

In a common special case, the potential energy V between two particles is proportional to a power n of their distance r
where the coefficient α and the exponent n are constants.  In such cases, the force term of the virial time derivative is given by the equation
where VTOT is the total potential energy of the system
Thus, we have
For gravitating systems and also for electrostatic systems, the exponent n equals −1, giving Lagrange's identity
which was derived by Lagrange and extended by Jacobi.

===Time averaging===

The average of this derivative over a time, τ, is defined as
from which we obtain the exact equation
Even if the average of the time derivative of G is only approximately zero, the virial theorem holds to the same degree of approximation.
For power-law forces with an exponent n, the general equation holds
For gravitational attraction, n equals −1 and the average kinetic energy equals half of the average negative potential energy
This general result is useful for complex gravitating systems such as solar systems or galaxies.
A simple application of the virial theorem concerns galaxy clusters. If a region of space is unusually full of galaxies, it is safe to assume that they have been together for a long time, and the virial theorem can be applied. Doppler measurements give lower bounds for their relative velocities, and the virial theorem gives a lower bound for the total mass of the cluster, including any dark matter.
The averaging need not be taken over time; an ensemble average can also be taken, with equivalent results.

==In special relativity==

In particular, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is no longer fixed, but necessarily falls into an interval: 
where the more relativistic systems exhibit the larger ratios.

==Generalizations==

Lord Rayleigh published a generalization of the virial theorem in 1903.[tpl]cite journal | last = Lord Rayleigh | year = 1903 | title = Unknown[/tpl]  Henri Poincaré applied a form of the virial theorem in 1911 to the problem of determining cosmological stability.[tpl]cite book | last = Poincaré | first = H | authorlink = Henri Poincaré | title = Lectures on Cosmological Theories | publisher = Hermann | location = Paris[/tpl]  A variational form of the virial theorem was developed in 1945 by Ledoux.  A tensor form of the virial theorem was developed by Parker, Chandrasekhar and Fermi. The following generalization of the virial theorem has been established by Pollard in 1964 for the case of the inverse square law:

==Inclusion of electromagnetic fields==

The virial theorem can be extended to include electric and magnetic fields. The result is[tpl]cite book |first=George |last=Schmidt |title=Physics of High Temperature Plasmas |edition=Second |publisher=Academic Press |year=1979 |pages=72[/tpl]
where I is the moment of inertia, G is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field, T is the kinetic energy of the "fluid", U is the random "thermal" energy of the particles, WE and WM are the electric and magnetic energy content of the volume considered. Finally, pik is the fluid-pressure tensor expressed in the local moving coordinate system
and Tik is the electromagnetic stress tensor,
A plasmoid is a finite configuration of magnetic fields and plasma. With the virial theorem it is easy to see that any such configuration will expand if not contained by external forces. In a finite configuration without pressure-bearing walls or magnetic coils, the surface integral will vanish. Since all the other terms on the right hand side are positive, the acceleration of the moment of inertia will also be positive. It is also easy to estimate the expansion time τ. If a total mass M is confined within a radius R, then the moment of inertia is roughly MR2, and the left hand side of the virial theorem is MR2/τ2. The terms on the right hand side add up to about pR3, where p is the larger of the plasma pressure or the magnetic pressure. Equating these two terms and solving for τ, we find
where cs is the speed of the ion acoustic wave (or the Alfvén wave, if the magnetic pressure is higher than the plasma pressure). Thus the lifetime of a plasmoid is expected to be on the order of the acoustic (or Alfvén) transit time.

==In astrophysics==

The virial theorem is frequently applied in astrophysics, especially relating the gravitational potential energy of a system to its kinetic or thermal energy.  Some common virial relations are,

===Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and radius)===

In astronomy, the mass and size of a galaxy (or general overdensity) is often defined in terms of the "virial radius" and "virial mass" respectively.  Because galaxies and overdensities in continuous fluids can be highly extended (even to infinity in some models—e.g. an isothermal sphere), it can be hard to define specific, finite measures of their mass and size.  The virial theorem, and related concepts, provide an often convenient means by which to quantify these properties.
As numerous approximations have been made, in addition to the approximate nature of these definitions, order-unity proportionality constants are often omitted (as in the above equations).  These relations are thus only accurate in an order of magnitude sense, or when used self-consistently.
