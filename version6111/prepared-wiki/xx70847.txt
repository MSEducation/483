==History==

===Founding===

The Aberdare Report of 1881 recommended the foundation of university colleges in North Wales and South Wales to complement the already established University College, Wales (now Aberystwyth University), in Aberystwyth. There was considerable debate about whether the southern college should be located in Cardiff or Swansea. The case for Cardiff was strengthened by stressing the need to take account of the interests of Monmouthshire, at that time not legally considered part of Wales. This influenced the name of the new body. Following a public appeal that raised £37,000, the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire opened on 24 October 1883, offering studies in Biology, Chemistry, English, French, German, Greek, History, Latin, Mathematics & Astronomy, Music, Welsh, Logic & Philosophy and Physics. The University College was incorporated by Royal Charter the following year. John Viriamu Jones was appointed as the University’s first Principal, at age 27. The only college in Wales with its own degree awarding powers at this time was St David's University College. As such, Cardiff entered students for the examinations of the University of London[tpl]cite web |title=Student Lists |url=http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/our-collections/historic-collections/archives-manuscripts/university-of-london-student-records-1836-1931/ |publisher=Senate House Library |accessdate=27 March 2013 [/tpl] until, in 1893, it became one of the founding institutions of the University of Wales and began awarding their degrees.
In 1885, Aberdare Hall opened as the first hall of residence, allowing women access to the university. This moved to its current site in 1895, but remains a single-sex hall. 1904 saw the appointment of the first female professor in the UK, Millicent McKenzie.
Architect W.D. Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former college (Trinity College, Cambridge) with the picturesque balance of many of the University of Oxford colleges. Building work on the Main Building commenced in 1905 and was completed in many stages, the first in 1909. Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built. Prior to then, from its founding in 1883, the university was based in the Old Infirmary on Newport Road, Cardiff which is now part of the university’s Queen’s Buildings.

===Expansion===

In 1931, the School of Medicine, which had been founded as part of the college in 1893 when the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Pharmacology were founded, was split off to form the University of Wales College of Medicine. In 1972, the college lost the name it had retained for ninety years and was renamed University College, Cardiff."Cardiff University", Higher Education Funding Council for Wales
In 1988, financial considerations led to the merger of University College, Cardiff with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, UWIST, forming the University of Wales College, Cardiff. The Principal of the new institution was Sir Aubrey Trotman-Dickenson, who had been principal of UWIST. Following changes to the constitution of the University of Wales in 1996, this became the University of Wales, Cardiff.
In the early 1990s, the university's computer systems served as the home for The Internet Movie Database.[tpl]cite web|url=http://imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history|title=IMDb History[/tpl] In 1997, the college was granted full independent degree awarding-powers by the Privy Council (though, as a member of the University of Wales it could not begin using them) and in 1999 the public name of the university was changed to Cardiff University.

===2000 to present===

In 2002, ideas were floated to re-merge Cardiff with the University of Wales College of Medicine following the publication of the Welsh Assembly Government's review of higher education in Wales. This merger became effective on 1 August 2004, on which date Cardiff University ceased to be a constituent institution of the University of Wales and became an independent "link institution" affiliated to the federal University. The process of the merger was completed on 1 December 2004 when the Act of Parliament transferring UWCM's assets to Cardiff University received Royal Assent. On 17 December it was announced that the Privy Council had given approval to the new Supplemental Charter and had granted university status to Cardiff, legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but these have been replaced by Cardiff degrees.
In 2005, The Wales College of Medicine, which is part of the University, launched the North Wales Clinical School in Wrexham in collaboration with the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in Wrexham and the University of Wales, Bangor and with the National Health Service in Wales. This has been funded with £12.5 million from the Welsh Assembly[tpl]cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/healthpress/healthpress2005/708646/?lang=en |accessdate=4 July 2008|title=Health Minister opens North Wales Clinical School |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government [/tpl] and will lead to the trebling of the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four-year period.
The university also has a popular Centre for Lifelong Learning which has been teaching a wide range of courses to the public for over 125 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/mediacentre/mediareleases/Dec08/new-book-celebrates-125-years-of-lifelong-learning-at-cardiff-university.html|accessdate=16 May 2009 |title=New book celebrates 125 years of Lifelong Learning at Cardiff University=Cardiff University[/tpl] In July 2009, the University announced it was ending the teaching of over 250 humanities courses at the centre making over 100 staff redundant. The University has since reintroduced a number of humanities courses for a trial period beginning in 2010.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/learn/humanities/ |title=Humanities Courses[/tpl]
In June 2010, the University launched three new Research Institutes,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2010/06/14/cardiff-creating-three-research-institutes-91466-26644003/|title=Cardiff creating three research institutes|accessdate=21 June 2010|publisher=WalesOnline[/tpl] each of which offers a new approach to a major modern research issue. They are the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, the Sustainable Places Research Institute, and the Neurosciences & Mental Health Research Institute.

==Insignia and other representations==

===Motto===

Cardiff University's motto is Gwirionedd, Undod a Chytgord. The Welsh motto is translated as Truth, Unity and Concord or Truth, Unity and Harmony and is taken from the prayer for the Church militant as it appears in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.[tpl]cite web|title=Cardiff Motto|last=Cardiff Motto|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/index.html|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]

===Coat of arms===

Cardiff University's current coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms in 1988 following the merger of University College Cardiff and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Cardiff University|url=http://cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/|accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl] The coat of arms incorporates features from the heralds of both of the former institutions. The three chevrons of the arms are derived from the arms of the de Clare Lords of Glamorgan (Glamorgan being the county in which Cardiff is located). The open book signifies learning; on it are the crescent and annulet, marks of cadence that indicate that University College Cardiff is the second of the University of Wales' institutions, and that the Wales Institute of Science and Technology is the fifth.[tpl]cite web|title=Cardiff University coat of arms|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/identity/coatofarms.html|accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl]
A notable feature of the arms are the supporters, which in heraldry are rarely granted to universities. The supporters are an angel and dragon, and are derived from the crests of the merged universities. The crest is a Welsh dragon in the stance of a lion; it stands on the helmet. Both the dragon and the helmet are distinguished by being front-facing rather than in profile as is more usually found in Welsh heraldry.
