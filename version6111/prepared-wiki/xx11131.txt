Sapindales [tpl]IPAc-en|s|æ|p|ɨ|n|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|iː|z[/tpl] is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. Well-known members of Sapindales include citrus; maples, horse-chestnuts, lychees and rambutans; mangos and cashews; frankincense and myrrh; mahogany and neem.
The APG II system of 2003 includes it in the clade eurosids II (in rosids, in eudicots) including the following 9 families:[tpl]cite journal | title = Placing Biebersteiniaceae, a herbaceous clade of Sapindales, in a temporal and geographic context | journal = Plant Systematics and Evolution | year = 2007 | first = A.

The Cronquist system of 1981 used a somewhat different circumscription, including the following families:
The difference from the APG II system is not as large as may appear, as the plants in the families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae stay in this order at APG II (both included in family Sapindaceae). The species now composing the family Nitrariaceae in APG II also belonged to this order in the Cronquist system as part of the family Zygophyllaceae, while those now in the family Kirkiaceae were present as part of the family Simaroubaceae.
