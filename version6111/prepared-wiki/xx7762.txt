 Schumacher finished the [tpl]F1|1991[/tpl] season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the [tpl]F1 GP|1991|Italian[/tpl], in which he finished ahead of his team-mate and three-time World Champion [[Nelson Piquet]].
At the start of the [tpl]F1|1992[/tpl] season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton, Peter Sauber said that "Schumacher didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?".
