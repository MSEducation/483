[[Kilo-]]

CATEGORIES: Metric prefixes

kilo is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by one thousand. It has been used in the International System of Units where it has the unit symbol k, in lower case.
The prefix kilo is derived from the Greek word χίλιοι (chilioi), meaning "thousand". It was originally adopted by Antoine Lavoisier's research group in 1795, and introduced into the metric system in France with its establishment in 1799.
Examples:
A second definition has been used incoherently in some contexts of computer science and information technology, which is, however, inconsistent with the SI. It uses kilo as meaning 210 = 1024, because of the mathematical coincidence that 210 is approximately 103. The incoherence of that definition is that it suggests that kilobyte can sometimes mean 1024 bytes, whereas "kilo" in kilobit always implies a decimal multiple, exactly as in every other unit using the kilo prefix. The NIST comments on this confusion: "Faced with this reality, the IEEE Standards Board decided that IEEE standards will use the conventional, internationally adopted, definitions of the SI prefixes", instead of kilo for 1024.Definition of binary prefixes at NIST

==Exponentiation==

When units occur in exponentiation, such as in square and cubic forms, any multiplier prefix is considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.
