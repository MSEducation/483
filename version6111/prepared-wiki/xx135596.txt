Wincing the Night Away is an album by indie rock group The Shins. It was released by Sub Pop Records on January 23, 2007. It is the band's third album, and the final under their contract with Sub Pop. The album was recorded in James Mercer's basement studio, Phil Ekâ€™s home in Seattle, and in Oregon City with veteran producer Joe Chiccarelli (Frank Zappa, Oingo Boingo).

==Writing and recording==

Producer Chiccareli had become acquainted with Mercer while in Portland, Oregon, working with Pink Martini.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Joe_Chiccarelli_Interview.html |title=Interview with Joe Chiccarelli |publisher=HitQuarters|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=Aug 17, 2010[/tpl] At the time Mercer was recording the new Shins album on his own and finding that it wasn't going the way he wanted and at the speed he wanted. Frustrated and in need of fresh objective feedback he sought Chiccarelli's advice and suggestions, before the producer eventually became involved in a professional capacity.
The duo didn't start the record from scratch; while they started some songs completely anew, they also retained some of the material that Mercer had been recording on his own. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters, the duo spent around two months working together on the album.

==Title==

The title is a play on the name of a Sam Cooke song "Twistin' the Night Away". As reported in Rolling Stone magazine, it is a reference to band member James Mercer's "crippling insomnia". "Sleeping Lessons", the title of the first track, also references insomnia and was considered as a possible album title.
Prior to the album's release, Mercer confirmed Wincing the Night Away as the album title in an August 2006 interview with Billboard.[tpl]cite web | title=The Shins Stretching Out On Third Album | work=Billboard | url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052641 | accessdate=August 24, 2006 [/tpl]

The full track listing was announced by Pitchfork Media on October 16, 2006. The first single, "Phantom Limb", was released on iTunes on November 14, 2006 and reached physical retailers on November 21. The new album was previewed in its entirety on the band's MySpace.
