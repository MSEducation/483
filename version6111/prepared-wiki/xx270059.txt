==Critical response==

Upon its release, Master of Ceremonies was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, saying "Master of Ceremonies is Styles P’s first album since landing a feature on one of the biggest rap hits of 2010, Rick Ross’ “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast).” None of this newfound fame is squandered as big money names like Pharrell, Busta Rhymes, and Rick Ross himself fill the guest list, but Styles is as uncompromising and hard as always, filling the middle of this effort with dark, stark, and dirty reminders of life in the ghetto and/or life as a gangster." Alex Thornton of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying "While there’s no telling how much closer this brings us to a new L.O.X. album, Styles is doing his best to represent the collective properly with his latest solo. While it feels like Master of Ceremonies could have been more, it’s a solid effort worth checking out both for fans of Styles specifically and New York rap in general. Admittedly, Styles still hasn’t quite hit the height of his potential, but he’s far from falling off while he continues the pursuit." Ralph Bristout of XXL gave the album an XL rating, saying "There are a few surprises on the 12-track album, including appearances from Pharrell on “Don’t Turn Away” and Pharoahe Monch on the introspective “Children.” Despite a loaded list of features and the underwhelming Avery Storm-assisted “How I Fly,” Master of Ceremonies exhibits more wins than duds. Holiday certainly lives up to the album’s title."
