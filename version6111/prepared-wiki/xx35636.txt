A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no arbitrarily fixed duration, is "pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing".''

==Classification==

Chronic pain may be divided into "nociceptive" (caused by activation of nociceptors), and "neuropathic" (caused by damage to or malfunction of the nervous system).[tpl]cite book |last1= Keay|first1= KA|last2= Clement|first2= CI|last3= Bandler|first3= R|editor1-first= GJT|editor1-last= Horst|title= The nervous system and the heart|year= 2000|publisher= Humana Press|location= Totowa, New Jersey|isbn= 978-0-89603-693-2|page= 304|chapter= The neuroanatomy of cardiac nociceptive pathways|chapterurl= http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IeElgT1clUcC&pg=PA303&lpg=PA303&dq=%22definitions+of+pain+and+its+central+representation%22#v=onepage&q=%22definitions%20of%20pain%20and%20its%20central%20representation%22&f=true[/tpl]
Nociceptive pain may be divided into "superficial" and "deep", and deep pain into "deep somatic" and "visceral". Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or superficial tissues. Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fasciae and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. Visceral pain originates in the viscera (organs). Visceral pain may be well-localized, but often it is extremely difficult to locate, and several visceral regions produce "referred" pain when damaged or inflamed, where the sensation is located in an area distant from the site of pathology or injury.[tpl]cite book |last1= Coda|first1= BA|last2= Bonica|first2= JJ|editor1-first= D|editor1-last= Loeser|editor2-first= JJ|editor2-last= Bonica|title= Bonica's management of pain|edition= 3|year= 2001|publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn= 0-443-05683-8|location= Philadelphia|chapter= General considerations of acute pain[/tpl]
Neuropathic pain is divided into "peripheral" (originating in the peripheral nervous system) and "central" (originating in the brain or spinal cord).[tpl]cite book |last1= Bogduk|first1= N|last2= Merskey|first2= H|title= Classification of chronic pain: descriptions of chronic pain syndromes and definitions of pain terms|edition= second |publisher= IASP Press|location= Seattle |year= 1994|page= 212|isbn= 0-931092-05-1[/tpl] Peripheral neuropathic pain is often described as "burning", "tingling", "electrical", "stabbing", or "pins and needles".[tpl]cite journal |last1= Paice |first1= JA|title= Mechanisms and management of neuropathic pain in cancer|journal= Journal of supportive oncology|date=Jul–Aug 2003|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 107–20|pmid= 15352654|doi= |url= http://www.supportiveoncology.net/journal/articles/0102107.pdf[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Under persistent activation nociceptive transmission to the dorsal horn may induce a wind up phenomenon. This induces pathological changes that lower the threshold for pain signals to be transmitted. In addition it may generate nonnociceptive nerve fibers to respond to pain signals. Nonnociceptive nerve fibers may also be able to generate and transmit pain signals. The type of nerve fibers that are believed to propagate the pain signals are the C-fibers, since they have a slow conductivity and give rise to a painful sensation that persists over a long time.[tpl]cite book |author=Hansson P |title=Nociceptive and neurogenic pain |publisher=Pharmacia & Upjon AB |pages=52–63 |year=1998[/tpl] In chronic pain this process is difficult to reverse or eradicate once established.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vadivelu N, Sinatra R |title=Recent advances in elucidating pain mechanisms |journal=Current Opinion in Anesthesiology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=540–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16534290 |doi=10.1097/01.aco.0000183109.27297.75[/tpl]

These structural changes can be explained by the phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. In the case of chronic pain, the somatototic representation of the body is inappropriately reorganized following peripheral and central sensitization. This maladaptative change results in the experience of allodynia and/or hyperalgesia. Brain activity in individuals suffering from chronic pain, measured via electroencephalogram (EEG), has been demonstrated to be altered, suggesting pain-induced neuroplastic changes. More specifically, the relative beta activity (compared to the rest of the brain) is increased, the relative alpha activity is decreased, and the theta activity both absolutely and relatively is diminished.Jensen, M.P., Sherlin, L.H., Hakiman, S., Fregni, F.

==Management==

Complete and sustained remission of many neuropathies and most idiopathic chronic pain (pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing, or chronic pain that has no known underlying pathology) is rarely achieved, but much can be done to reduce suffering and improve quality of life.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chou|first=Roger|coauthors=Huffman, LH; American Pain, Society; American College of, Physicians|title=Medications for Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: A Review of the Evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=2 October 2007|volume=147|issue=7|pages=505|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-7-200710020-00008|pmid=17909211[/tpl]

The emergence of studies relating chronic pain to neuroplasticity also suggest the utilization of neurofeedback rehabilitation techniques to resolve maladaptive cortical changes and patterns. The proposed goal of neurofeedback intervention is to abolish maladaptive neuroplastic changes made as a result of chronic nociception, as measured by abnormal EEG, and thereby relieve the individual's pain. However, this field of research lacks randomized control trials, and therefore requires further investigation.

==Epidemiology==

In a recent large-scale telephone survey of 15 European countries and Israel, 19% of respondents over 18 years of age had suffered pain for more than 6 months, including the last month, and more than twice in the last week, with pain intensity of 5 or more for the last episode, on a scale of 1(no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable). 4839 of these respondents with chronic pain were interviewed in depth. Sixty six percent scored their pain intensity at moderate (5–7), and 34% at severe (8–10); 46% had constant pain, 56% intermittent; 49% had suffered pain for 2–15 years; and 21% had been diagnosed with depression due to the pain. Sixty one percent were unable or less able to work outside the home, 19% had lost a job, and 13% had changed jobs due to their pain. Forty percent had inadequate pain management and less than 2% were seeing a pain management specialist.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 16095934 | doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.06.009 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Survey of chronic pain in Europe: prevalence, impact on daily life, and treatment |date=May 2006 | author=Breivik H, Collett B, Ventafridda V, Cohen R, Gallacher D | journal=Eur J Pain | pages=287–333[/tpl]
In a systematic literature review published by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), 13 chronic pain studies from various countries around the world were analyzed.  (Of the 13 studies, there were three in the United Kingdom, two in Australia, one each in France, the Netherlands, Israel, Canada, Scotland, Spain, and Sweden, and a multinational.) The authors found that the prevalence of chronic pain was very high and that chronic pain consumes a large amount of healthcare resources around the globe. Chronic pain afflicted women at a higher rate than men.  They determined that the prevalence of chronic pain varied from 10.1% to 55.2% of the population.[tpl]cite journal | volume=XI | issue=2 | title=How Prevalent Is Chronic Pain? |date=June 2003 | author=Harstall C and Ospina M | journal=Pain Clinical Updates, International Association for the Study of Pain | pages=1–4 | url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=7594&SECTION=Home[/tpl]
In the United States, the prevalence of chronic pain has been estimated to be approximately 30%.  According to the Institute of Medicine, there are about 116 million Americans living with chronic pain.[tpl]cite book | title=Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research | publisher=The National Academies Press | location=Washington DC | year=2011 | last=Institute of Medicine of the National Academies Report[/tpl]  The Mayday Fund estimate of 70 million Americans with chronic pain is slightly more conservative.[tpl]cite book | title=A Call to Revolutionize Chronic Pain Care in America: An Opportunity in Health Care Reform | publisher=The Mayday Fund | year=2009 [/tpl]  In an internet study, the prevalence of chronic pain in the United States was calculated to be 30.7% of the population: 34.3% for women and 26.7% for men.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2010.07.002 | pmid=20797916 | volume=11 | issue=11 | title=The Prevalence of Chronic Pain in United States Adults: Results of an Internet-Based Study |date=Nov 2010 | author=Johannes C, Le T, Zhou X, Johnston J, Dworkin R | journal=J Pain | pages=1230–1239[/tpl]  These estimates are in reasonable agreement and indicate a prevalence of chronic pain in the US that is relatively comparable to that of other countries.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

==Comorbidities and sequelae==

Chronic pain is associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pruimboom L, van Dam AC |title=Chronic pain: a non-use disease |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=506–11 |year=2007 |pmid=17071012 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.08.036[/tpl] Sleep disturbance, and insomnia due to medication and illness symptoms are often experienced by those with chronic pain.[tpl]cite journal | author=Ferini-Strambi L | title=Sleep disorders in multiple sclerosis |journal=Handb Clin Neurol. |volume=99 |pages=1139–46 |year=2011 |pmid=21056246 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52007-4.00025-4 | series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology | isbn=978-0-444-52007-4[/tpl] Chronic pain may contribute to decreased physical activity due to fear of exacerbating pain, often resulting in weight gain. Such comorbid disorders can be very difficult to treat due to the high potential of medication interactions, especially when the conditions are treated by different doctors.

==Psychology==

===Psychosocial factors===

Those who have a tendency to "catastrophise" in response to pain report greater pain levels induced by an ice bath (Sullivan et al., 1995).[tpl]cite journal|last=SULLIVAN|first=M|coauthors=BISHOP, S. R. & PIVIK, J.|title=The Pain Catastrophizing Scale: Development and validation.|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=1995|volume=7|pages=524–532|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.7.4.524[/tpl] A study by Crombez et al. (1998) showed that those with unhealthy catastrophising pain beliefs experienced greater impairment in performance in an auditory discrimination task when a painful stimulus was applied then those with more healthy pain beliefs.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crombez|first=G|coauthors=Eccleston, C; Baeyens, F; Eelen, P|title=When somatic information threatens, catastrophic thinking enhances attentional interference.|journal=Pain|date=April 1998|volume=75|issue=2-3|pages=187–98|pmid=9583754|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(97)00219-4[/tpl]  In addition there was a perception of pain at greater intensity during the experiment. This indicates that there is an increase in attention to pain at the expense of other somatosensation. Indeed Crombez et al. (2005) postulated that in chronic pain patients are thought to display a “hyper-vigilance” to pain.  In addition, pain inhibited visual attention disengagement in those with a tendency to catastrophise though not in non-catastrophisers (Van Damme et al., 2004).[tpl]cite journal|last=Van Damme|first=S|coauthors=Crombez, G; Eccleston, C|title=The anticipation of pain modulates spatial attention: evidence for pain-specificity in high-pain catastrophizers.|journal=Pain|date=October 2004|volume=111|issue=3|pages=392–9|pmid=15363884|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2004.07.022[/tpl]

===Personality===

Two of the most frequent personality profiles found in chronic pain patients by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) are the conversion V and the neurotic triad. The conversion V personality, so called because the higher scores on MMPI scales 1 and 3, relative to scale 2, form a "V" shape on the graph, expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings, develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, and often fails to recognize their own emotional state, including depression. The neurotic triad personality, scoring high on scales 1, 2 and 3, also expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings and develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, but is demanding and complaining.[tpl]cite book |title=Clinical manual of pain management in psychiatry |last=Leo|first=Raphael |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-58562-275-7  |page=58[/tpl]
Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing neuroticism. When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and anxiety fall, often to normal levels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fishbain|first=David A.|coauthors=Cole, Brandly; Cutler, R.

Self-esteem, often low in chronic pain patients, also shows striking improvement once pain has resolved.

===Effect on cognition===

Chronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published. Most chronic pain patients complain of cognitive impairment, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention, and difficulty completing tasks. Objective testing has found that people in chronic pain tend to experience impairment in attention, memory, mental flexibility, verbal ability, speed of response in a cognitive task, and speed in executing structured tasks. In 2007, Shulamith Kreitler and David Niv advised clinicians to assess cognitive function in chronic pain patients in order to more precisely monitor therapeutic outcomes, and tailor treatment to address this aspect of the pain experience.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kreitler S | coauthor = Niv D | year = 2007 | title = Cognitive impairment in chronic pain | journal = Pain: Clinical Updates | publisher = International Association for the Study of Pain | volume = XV | issue = 4 | pages = 1–4 | url = http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/TemplateRedirect.cfm?template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=4132 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-15 [/tpl]
