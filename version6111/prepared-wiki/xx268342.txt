[[Hundred of Carhampton]]

CATEGORIES: Hundreds of Somerset

The Hundred of Carhampton is one of the 40 historical Hundreds in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England, dating from before the Norman conquest during the Anglo-Saxon era although exact dates are unknown. Each hundred had a 'fyrd', which acted as the local defence force and a court which was responsible for the maintenance of the frankpledge system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/status_page.jsp?unit_status=Hundred |title=Administrative Units Typology | Status definition: Hundred |publisher=Vision of Britain |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl] They also formed a unit for the collection of taxes.[tpl]cite web|title=The Shire and the Hundred|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Shirehundred.htm|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=13 October 2011[/tpl] The role of the hundred court was described in the Dooms (laws) of King Edgar.

The importance of the hundred courts declined from the seventeenth century. By the 19th century several different single-purpose subdivisions of counties, such as poor law unions, sanitary districts, and highway districts sprang up, filling the administrative role previously played by parishes and hundreds. Although the Hundreds have never been formally abolished, their functions ended with the establishment of county courts in 1867County Courts Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 142) s.28 and the introduction of districts by the Local Government Act 1894.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/occupations/hundredmapping/ |title=Mapping the Hundreds of England and Wales in GIS | publisher=University of Cambridge Department of Geography|date=6 June 2008| accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl]
