===Bishopston===

Bishopston - or Llandeilo Ferwallt - is an inland village, 6 miles (9.5 km) west-southwest of Swansea and near the beaches of Caswell Bay, Brandy Cove and Pwll Du. One of the larger villages in Gower, it has its own rugby club, South Gower Rugby Football Club, and its own primary and comprehensive schools.  (Bishopston is part of Swansea's Bishopston ward.)
Bishopston church, at the head of Bishopston Valley, is dedicated to Saint Teilo, who gives the village its Welsh name. The church contains a plain, massive font of Romanesque type, and its tower holds two 18th-century bells. In the churchyard are the remains of an old stone cross.

===Cheriton===

===Ilston===

Ilston is an inland village. It has its own community council. The population of the community in the United Kingdom Census 2001 was 538.  The name of the village (Welsh, Llan Illtyd) is thought to have originated from Saint Illtud. The village is home to a brook, a 13th-century parish church (which has a 15th-century bell inscribed with a prayer to St Thomas) and a National Trust limestone quarry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/gower/english/Gower_072.htm |title=CADW: Historic Landscape Characterisation: Ilston |publisher=Ggat.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] The community is surrounded by common land used as grazing land, woodlands and fields.

===Llangennith===

Llangennith, in north-west Gower, has a scattering of houses and one pub - the King's Head. It sits at a crossroads: Moor Lane leads west to a caravan park near Rhossili Bay; and Burrows Lane leads north to a caravan park overlooking Broughton Bay.
The 12th-century village church, St. Cenydd's Church, is the largest in Gower, and was founded by St. Cenydd, who in the 6th century made a hermitage here, which was destroyed by Vikings in 986.  The folk singer, Phil Tanner, is buried in its churchyard.
A painting of Worm's Head from Llangennydd was made by Cedric Morris. A painting of Llangennith Burrows by John Nash is held in the Government Art Collection.

===Llanmadoc===

Llanmadoc is in the north west of Gower. The village is named after the churchyard of St Madoc, who founded his hermitage or monastery here in the 6th century. The 13th-century building was restored in 1865, but retains a Romanesque font and a Romano-British tombstone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-gower.com/placesofworship/Church/llanmadoc/llanmadoc.htm |title=St. Madoc's Church Llanmadoc |publisher=The-gower.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] Llanmadoc Hill, formed of Old Red Sandstone, is a landmark of west Gower and affords wide views from the top. An evocative painting of the Hill, by Cedric Morris, may be seen at the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea. A painting of Llanmadoc was also made by John Nash.  An alternative origin, more likely, comes from Médoc, in France, along the Gironde estuary of the Garonne river, in the Bordeaux region of France.  Quite interestingly, there is a region called "Landes du Médoc",[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GirondePays.png |title=File:GirondePays.png - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-06-19[/tpl] compare with "Llanmadoc". The Medulli were the likely Celtic tribal ancestors of Madoc. Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA):File:Distribution Haplogroup R1b Y-DNA version 2.gif [tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] is consistent with the regions of Llanmadoc, Wales and Médoc, Bordeaux, France and the Celtic migrations from the South East to the North West, and likely predates St. Madoc.
Close-by communities include Cheriton and Landimore.  Nearby beaches include Broughton Bay and Whiteford Sands.

===Llanmorlais===

Llanmorlais, on the north coast, was a cockling village. The name Llanmorlais is not a true Llan place name, but a corruption of the village's old name, Glan Morlais, which refers to the banks of Morlais Stream.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.someplacenamesinsouthwales.4t.com/rich_text.html |title=GOWER/GWYR |publisher=www.someplacenamesinsouthwales.4t.com |accessdate=2010-01-10 [/tpl] (The village is in Penclawdd electoral ward of Swansea.)

The village gets its name from Saint Rhidian. Its church is dedicated to St Illtyd and St Rhidian. The present building was constructed in the 13th century, with a chancel and tower added in the 14th century. In the porch may be seen a 9th-century stone, bearing simple carvings of human figures and animals. A standing stone on the village green may be the remains of a village cross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-gower.com/placesofworship/Church/llanrhidian/llanrhidian.htm |title=St. Rhidian & St. Illtyd Church, Llanrhidian |publisher=The-gower.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl]

===Penmaen===

Penmaen is an inland village - a scatter of houses around the A4118 road at the foot of the slopes of Cefn Bryn. There are a number of archaeological sites in the area. It contains Parc-Le-Breos, a 19th-century hunting lodge, that was once the deer park of William de Breos, Lord of Gower, but today serves as a hotel and pony-trekking centre.
Penmaen Castle began as a small timber castle. Later it was replaced by a stone structure. The dates of the structures are not known but the ringwork and timber gateway is accepted as being Norman. The timber gateway was destroyed by fire and later replaced by a drystone walled gate tower. It is believed that the replacement could either have been built by a Norman or the Welsh lord Rhys Gryg ap Rhys, who had destroyed all the castles in Gower in 1217.
A painting of Penmaen Burrows was made by John Nash.
