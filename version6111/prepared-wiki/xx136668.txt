West Union High School is a public high school located just outside West Union, Ohio.  It is one of three high schools in the Adams County/Ohio Valley School District, the other two being North Adams High School and Peebles High School.  All 3 schools are nearly identical in design. The district also has a vocational school (Ohio Valley Career and Technical Center).

==Background==

The current West Union High School building was completed in August 1997, along with three other public high schools in Adams County, North Adams, Peebles, and Manchester High School.  All four schools used the same layout and appear almost identical from the air.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3O0CAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=Manchester,+North+Adams,+Peebles,+West+Union+identical+buildings&source=bl&ots=1TiHMd20Dr&sig=E6g0E2tcxHjfu5gxLaetlCEVn2o&hl=en&ei=PxMpS-zMNsv_nAfPtdmcDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=In God's Country|accessdate=2009-12-16|publisher=Cincinnati Magazine|author=Linda Vaccariello[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The four regular public high schools in Adams County were built at the same time and all four featured a large granite tablet outside the school carved with the Ten Commandments.  They were removed after a lengthy four-year legal battle over the placement of the tablets on public property.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/10/loc_commandments10.html|title=Commandments removed amid protests |accessdate=2009-12-16|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|author=Marie McCain and Dan Horn[/tpl]
