[[Lake Lyndon]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of the Canterbury Region

Lake Lyndon is a small lake in the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island.  It is located near Porters Pass on State Highway 73 after Springfield heading into the Southern Alps. The lake regularly freezes in winter due to its elevation and location on the outer border of the Southern Alps. Native plants present in the lake include, Isoetes, native Pondweeds, native Milfoils, Charophyte species, and Charophyte meadow. Invasive plants present in the lake are currently on the Elodea species. The current lake submerged plant indicator (SPI) condition is rated as high, as of April 2010, and measured by NIWA.Lake Lyndon NIWA LakeSPI Report Card - April 2010. http://lakespi.niwa.co.nz/lake/48597
It is roughly an hour from Christchurch and is a popular site for rainbow trout fishing as the trout population in the lake is thriving due to the dense oxygen weed beds that provide a plentiful food source.  The lake is largely surrounded by Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park,Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park, Department of Conservation. http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/canterbury/north-canterbury-and-arthurs-pass/korowai-torlesse-tussocklands-park/ and the Acheron River flows from the lake to the Rakaia River.  Mount Lyndon is to the west of the lake and Castle Hill Peak is to the North of the lake.
One of the proposed routes for the Midland Line railway to Westland would have left the now-closed Whitecliffs Branch in Homebush and followed the eastern shore of Lake Lyndon on its route to Cass.  The route that was built takes a more direct route to Cass and bypasses the lake.

==Fishing==

Lake Lyndon is one of the closest vehicle access High Country lakes to Christchurch and is normally well stocked with rainbow trout averaging 1.5 to 2 pounds.Lake Lyndon. http://www.adventureguide.co.nz/articles/12/216/lake-lyndon.php The best fishing for rainbow trout is usually late in the winter season as this lake tends to heat up quite a bit during summer. During the winter season lake conditions are also more likely to be calm and free of the strong wind associated with the summer months.Lake Lyndon Fishing. http://www.fishingmag.co.nz/Winter-coleridge-lyndon.htm
