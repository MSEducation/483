When he is not acting, Rady Panov is a self-taught magician and film editor. His interest for magic arose when he first saw Chris Angel on television; the thing that drew him in was the fact that he was able to figure out the magic tricks.

Rady is looking forward to working on local TV series and is fond of the idea of working with director Guy Normal Bee (Supernatural), and executive producer Julie Plec (The Tomorrow People).http://radypanov.com/
