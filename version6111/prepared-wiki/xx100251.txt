The World Championship commenced on 7 February 1960 and ended on 20 November after ten races.

==Season summary==

The last year of the 2.5 litre formula produced repeat victories for Jack Brabham and Cooper, and saw Lotus, Porsche, and BRM campaigning rear-engined cars. Lance Reventlow's Scarabs, like the Aston Martins, were front-engined and outclassed. Stirling Moss' Rob Walker Lotus gave Colin Chapman his first Grand Prix win at Monaco and followed it with victory in the USA. All other Grands Prix went to Cooper, except for the Italian which was boycotted by the British constructors since the Italians were using Monza's banked circuit.
The points-scoring system was changed with the point for fastest lap being dropped and a point given for sixth place. The best six scores counted towards the championship, increased from five from the previous season.
It was the last World Drivers' Championship to include the Indianapolis 500, and the last season which saw a victory for a front-engined car in a World Drivers' Championship race.
Three drivers died in this season of Grand Prix racing. American Harry Schell in a non-championship race at Silverstone, and Britons Chris Bristow & Alan Stacey, both killed at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. Stirling Moss was severely injured in a practice accident at this event and did not compete for most of the season.
