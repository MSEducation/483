==Plot overview==

The play shows Bobby Gould, introduced in Mamet's 1988 play Speed-the-Plow and his time in Hell after he dies. Gould is subjected to questions from a devilish personage referred to simply as "The Interrogator." The Interrogator has had to interrupt a fishing trip in order to question Gould and he is consequently displeased. Through the course of the play, Gould confronts whether or not he is a "bad man."
