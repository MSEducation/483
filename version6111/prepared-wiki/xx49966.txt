===Origin of term in California municipalities===

In August 1979, gay rights activist Tom Brougham proposed a new category of relationship called "domestic partnership".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equalitywithoutmarriage.org/G&LR%20July-Aug%202008.pdf |title=A Brief History of Domestic Partnerships |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl]  Initially, the requirements were that only two people who resided together and were qualified to marry except that they were the same gender.  Additional requirements were later added for the partners to maintain mutual financial responsibility and for both to be at least eighteen years old and able to enter into a legal contract.[tpl]cite web|author=By admin, on May 26th, 2010% |url=http://divorcelawca.com/category/domestic-partners/ |title=Domestic-Partners |publisher=Divorce Law CA |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-06-11[/tpl]

====San Francisco====

In 1982, Brougham's definition was modified by Supervisor Harry Britt, a gay man appointed to replace Harvey Milk.  Britt's version was adopted and passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, but Dianne Feinstein, mayor of San Francisco at the time, came under intense pressure from the Catholic Church and vetoed the bill.  In 1989, a domestic partnership law was adopted in San Francisco. However, voters repealed the domestic partnership law by initiative; a modified version was reinstated by another voter initiative, 1990's Proposition K, also written by Britt.
Currently, the city still offers a domestic partnership status separate and differing in benefits from that offered by the state; city residents can apply for both.[ref]

In 1982, the term "domestic partner" was first used in a lawsuit filed by San Francisco Human Rights Commission employee Larry Brinkin. Brinkin, then an employee of Southern Pacific Railway, had recently suffered the loss of his partner of eleven years. When he was denied the three days of paid bereavement leave given to married employees, he filed suit with the assistance of the ACLU. Mr. Brinkin lost his case. Despite a great deal of evidence to the contrary, the judge agreed with his employer’s claim that there was no way to know if his relationship was legitimate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/sfhumanrights/docs/eb_2yr.pdf |title=Two Year Report on the San Francisco Equal Rights Ordinance |publisher=Sfgov.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl]

====Berkeley====

In 1983, the City Council of Berkeley, California, under the leadership of Mayor Gus Newport, ordered their Human Relations and Welfare Commission to develop a domestic partnership proposal.  The Commission appointed its Vice-Chair, Leland Traiman, a gay activist, to head the Domestic Partner Task Force and draft a policy.  Working with Tom Brougham, members of the East Bay Lesbian/Gay Democratic Club, and attorney Matt Coles, the Domestic Partner Task Force drafted what has become the template for domestic partner/civil union policies around the world.  The City of Berkeley's Human Relations and Welfare Commission held a public hearing early in 1984 on "Examining the Use of Marriage to Determine Benefits and Liabilities in Berkeley and the Alternatives." A policy was adopted by the Commission and presented to the City Council. A copy was sent to the Berkeley School Board.  In July 1984 the City Council voted down the proposal citing financial concerns.  On August 1, 1984, the Berkeley School Board enacted the policy by a 4 to 1 vote.  The school board motion was made by board member and community activist Ethel Manheimer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ethel-Manheimer-Berkeley-activist-dies-4110179.php|title=Ethel Manheimer, Berkeley activist, dies|publisher=SFGate|date=December 12, 2012|first=Joe|last=Garofoli|accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl]
In November 1984, all the city council members up for election who had voted against the policy lost reelection.  Progressives from the Berkeley Citizens' Action (BCA) slate who replaced them had voiced strong support for a domestic partner policy. The East Bay Lesbian/Gay Democratic Club had worked hard to elect the BCA Slate.  This was the first time domestic partners was a campaign issue.  At the first meeting of the new City Council in December 1984, the Berkeley City Council enacted a policy extending employee benefits to unmarried couples of any gender.  The first couple to file for benefits under Berkeley's sex-neutral policy were Brougham and his partner Barry Warren.
However, the City Council did not create a registry for domestic partners until 1991.  On October 11 of that year, 28 lesbian and gay male couples and one heterosexual couple registered their partnerships. The registry and benefits were also extended to non-resident couples that same year.

====West Hollywood====

In 1985, West Hollywood city council member John Heilman successfully introduced domestic partner legislation for city residents and employees that was passed by the city council and created the first domestic partnership registry.

===Statewide===

====California====

In 1999 California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, signed a domestic partner bill, making California the first state to legally recognize same-sex couples.
On September 4, 2003 the California legislature passed an expanded domestic partnership bill, extending nearly all the legal rights of married couples to people in same-sex partnerships.  This erased all difference between California's domestic partnerships and civil unions passed in other states. California's comprehensive domestic partner policy was the first same-sex couples policy in the United States created by a legislature without court intervention. The policy became effective January 1, 2005.
The State of California has developed an Online Self-Help Center that provides resources and information to assist domestic partners in many areas, including filing domestic partnerships, dissolving domestic partnerships,parenting issues, tax issues, and more.

====Colorado====

Since July 1, 2009 unmarried couples have been legally able to enter a designated beneficiary agreement which will grant them limited rights.[tpl]cite news|title=Ritter signs bill that will help gay couples|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Denver Post|date=2009-04-09|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_12109357|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] A law on civil unions went into effect on May 1, 2013.

====District of Columbia====

Washington, D.C., has recognized domestic partnerships since 1992. However, Congress prohibited the District from spending any local funds to implement the law. The prohibition was lifted in the federal appropriations act for the District for the 2002 fiscal year. Domestic partnership in the District is open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner’s remains after the partner’s death. The measure also grants District of Columbia government employees rights to a number of benefits. Domestic partners are eligible for health care insurance coverage, can use annual leave or unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a dependent child or to care for a domestic partner or a partner's dependents, and can make funeral arrangements for a deceased partner. The Domestic Partnership Equality Amendment Act of 2006, D.C. Law 16-79, came into effect on April 4, 2006. This act provides that in almost all cases a domestic partner will have the same rights as a spouse regarding inheritance, probate, guardianship, and other rights traditionally accorded to spouses.[tpl]cite web|author=Enter your Company or Top-Level Office |url=http://dchealth.dc.gov/doh/cwp/view,a,3,q,573324,dohNav_GID,1787,dohNav,%7C33110%7C33120%7C33139%7C.asp#6 |title=DOH: Vital Records – Domestic Partnership FAQ |publisher=Dchealth.dc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] D.C.

====Hawaii====

Reciprocal beneficiary registration was enacted in 1997. The law took effect on 1 June 1997.

====Maine====

In April 2004 the legislature passed a domestic partnership bill. The law, which provides same-sex individuals with inheritance rights over their partners' property and guardianship over their deceased partner, went into effect on July 30, 2004. On May 6, 2009, Maine's legislature and governor enacted a law to legalize same-sex marriage, but on November 3, 2009, that law was repealed by voters.[tpl]cite news |title=Mainers vote down gay marriage law |author=Susan M.

====Maryland====

Since July 1, 2008, unmarried couples have been able to enter a designated unregistered beneficiary agreement which will grant them limited rights such as the right to visit one another in the hospital, the right to share a room in a nursing home, and the right to make funeral decisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/your_community/904.htm |title=Maryland Marriage/Relationship Recognition Law |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl] A law on same-sex marriage went into effect on January 1, 2013.

====Nevada====

In Nevada domestic partnerships are granted all the benefits, rights, obligations and/or responsibilities of marriage (for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples over 18) and these have become legally available since 1 October 2009. The act specifically excludes requiring any entity to provide health benefits to domestic partners. In addition, due to vagueness in the verbiage of the act, most companies and entities within Nevada refuse to acknowledge or afford any major benefits or rights to registered domestic partners, leaving legal action as the only avenue to garner individual rights.

====New Jersey====

Domestic partnerships in New Jersey have been available since July 30, 2004 for same-sex couples, and for opposite-sex couples in which one person is above the age of 62.  However, on October 25, 2006, the Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled that under the New Jersey state constitution, the state could not deny the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples, although the court left it up to the legislature whether to call such relationships marriage or to use a different term.  Complying with the court's ruling, on December 14, 2006, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill establishing civil unions for same-sex couples, which was signed into law by the governor on December 21 and came into effect on February 19, 2007.

====Oregon====

The governor of Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, signed a domestic partnership bill into law on May 9, 2007. Called the Oregon Family Fairness Act, the law would provide several major rights to same-sex couples that were previously only given to married couples, including the ability to file jointly on insurance forms, hospital visitation rights, and rights relating to the deceased partner. The law's initial implementation was delayed by a federal Court, but the injunction was lifted on February 1, 2008 and the law went into effect on February 4.[tpl]cite journal |date=2007-05-09 |title=Oregon Gov.

====Washington====

In the state of Washington, Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law legislation allowing limited domestic partnership on April 21, 2007. The law, which took effect July 22, 2007 and expanded to all areas except for marriage in 2008 and 2009, permits same-sex couples (as well as heterosexual couples when one individual is at least age 62) to register in a domestic partnership registry that allows couples hospital visitation rights, the ability to authorize autopsies and organ donations, and inheritance rights when there is no will.[tpl]cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2003675942_webdomestic21.html|title=Gregoire signs domestic partnership measure into law|accessdate=May 25, 2007 | work=The Seattle Times | date=April 21, 2007 | first=Rachel | last=La Corte[/tpl] This follows the 1998 passage of a bill by the Washington State legislature that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman; this legislation was upheld by the Washington State Supreme Court in 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/278896_samesex26ww.html|title=State's high court upholds ban on gay marriage|accessdate=April 23, 2007 | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|first1=Tracy|last1=Johnson|date=July 25, 2006[/tpl] Washington State Senate Report

====Wisconsin====

Wisconsin was the first state in the Midwest to legislatively enact same-sex unions. Out of about thirty states that have bans on same-sex marriage and civil unions, Wisconsin was the first (and only) to enact domestic partnerships.Journal Sentinel: http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/49651627.html Accessed June 9, 2012

==In Europe==

Portugal, Hungary and Croatia have domestic partnerships, whereas most other nations in Europe recognize some form of civil unions, also called a registered partnership, or civil partnership for same-sex partners, which afford rights similar to marriage to LGBT couples.
In Hungary, since 1995[tpl]cite web|url=http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc2.cgi?dbnum=1&docid=995H0014.AB |title=14/1995. (III. 13.) AB hatαrozat |publisher=Net.jogtar.hu |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl] domestic partnership in the form of unregistered cohabitation offers a limited set of rights compared to marriage in a Civil Code (more in the field of health and pension; but no inheritance), although a growing number of Hungarian couples, both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples choose this kind of partnership instead of marriage. In April 2009, the Hungarian Parliament passed a Registration Partnership Act 2009 with a vote of 199–159, which provides a registered partnership for same-sex couples with all the benefits and entitlements of marriage (except for marriage itself, adoption, IVF access, taking a partner's surname, parentage and surrogacy). The law was passed in December 2007 by a vote of 110–78, but the Constitutional Court of Hungary was "deeply concerned" that the law was a duplication of opposite-sex marriage benefits and entitlements, so same-sex couples only registration was chosen. Some politicians of the Alliance of Free Democrats and Hungarian Socialist Party parties have argued for the introduction of marriage for same-sex couples. The Registration Partnership Act 2009 came into effect from July 1, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |title=Gay and Lesbian Marriage, Partnership or Unions Worldwide |publisher=UK Gay News |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl]

==In Oceania==

===Australia===

In Australia, all levels of Governments, plus even some Councils, such as Yarra, Melbourne and Sydney, now offer "de facto/domestic status" or a "registered or civil partnership" to both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. Nevertheless, since 2009, the Australian Government amended 100 statutes to recognise both opposite and same gender couples, but still bans same-sex marriages under the Marriage Act 1961.

===New Zealand===

In 2001, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 was extended to offer partners in unregistered "de facto" relationships similar rights to those of married couples. A de facto relationship is defined as a relationship between two persons living as a couple, who are not married or in a civil union. This applies to both heterosexual and same sex couples.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1976/0166/latest/DLM440945.html |title=Property (Relationships) Act 1976 |publisher=New Zealand Legislation, Parliamentary Counsel Office |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl]
