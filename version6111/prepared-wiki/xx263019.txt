The X79 chipset is made to work with the Intel LGA 2011 (Socket R) which features 2011 copper pins. The added pins allow for more PCI Express lanes and interconnects for server class processors.
Newer Core and Xeon processors address 40 PCI Express 3.0 lanes directly through Sandy Bridge-E architecture (Xeon) and Ivy Bridge architecture (Core processors).[tpl]Cite web |title= Products (Formerly Sandy Bridge-EP)|work= official product information |publisher= Intel |accessdate= January 2, 2014|url= http://ark.intel.com/products/codename/33170/Sandy-Bridge-EP [/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title= Products (Formerly Sandy Bridge-EN)|work= official product information |publisher= Intel |accessdate= January 2, 2014|url= http://ark.intel.com/products/codename/33169/Sandy-Bridge-EN [/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title= Products (Formerly Ivy Bridge)|work= official product information |publisher= Intel |accessdate= January 2, 2014|url= http://ark.intel.com/products/codename/29902/Ivy-Bridge [/tpl]

==Partial support for Windows XP==

The X79 chipset does not support installing Windows XP in AHCI mode for Intel's Serial ATA controllers as Intel won't release AHCI drivers for 32-bit Windows XP.Intel X79 SATA AHCI RAID Mode Notice Windows XP can be installed in IDE mode but without SATA features enabled. For users that dual boot Windows XP with another operating system installed in AHCI mode, this means changing to IDE mode every time to boot into Windows XP and changing back to SATA to boot the other OS, or installing the other OS which supports AHCI also in IDE mode to prevent switching the setting in the BIOS each time. This restriction applies only to 32-bit Windows XP, 64-bit Windows XP is supported by Intel drivers.
For motherboards with X79 chipset but with third party SATA disk controllers, 32-bit Windows XP AHCI drivers may still be supported by the disk controller vendor (non-Intel).
