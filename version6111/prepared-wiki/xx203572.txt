==History==

On March 25, 1963, the Padre Noguera Municipality was founded within the Liberty District, and after December 3, 1964 changed its name to Liberty District Archbishop Chacon, now Arzobispo Chacón Municipality. In 1975, studies began to build a dam, and in 1980 the construction work flooded the area, forcing the evacuation of 20 of the 23 villages that existed in the town, leaving only the villages Florida, Vegón and the larger Tucupido Santa Maria of Caparo. The impact of hydroelectric development Camburito-Caparo was such that the extension of the county shrank from 319 km² to 206 km² due to flooding to keep the waters of the reservoir. On March 19, 1986, the municipality changed its name to Autonomous Municipality Padre Noguera.

==Geography==

The territory is divided into three areas due to water of the Caparo Dam. Part of the town is protected by the Tapo-Caparo National Park
