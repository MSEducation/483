[[Semantic feature]]

CATEGORIES: Semantics

A semantic feature is a notational method which can be used to express the existence or non-existence of pre-established semantic properties by using plus and minus signs.
Man is +HUMAN, +MALE, +ADULT 
Woman is +HUMAN, -MALE, +ADULT 
Boy is +HUMAN, +MALE, -ADULT 
Girl is +HUMAN, -MALE, -ADULT
Intersecting semantic classes share the same features. Some features need not be specifically mentioned as their presence or absence is obvious from another feature. This is a redundancy rule.
