</ref>  There are an additional 40 [[trans-Neptunian object]]s with a semi-major axis further than Neptune (a&nbsp;>&nbsp;30.1&nbsp;AU) and perihelion closer than the orbit of [[Uranus]] (q&nbsp;<&nbsp;19&nbsp;AU).<ref name="sbdb"/>  The [[Committee on Small Body Nomenclature]] of the [[International Astronomical Union]] has not formally weighed in on either side of the debate. Instead, it has adopted the following naming convention for such objects: befitting their centaur-like transitional orbits between TNOs and comets, "objects on unstable, non-resonant, giant-planet-crossing orbits with semimajor axes greater than Neptune's" are to be named for other hybrid and shape-shifting mythical creatures.  Thus far, only the binary objects [[65489 Ceto|Ceto and Phorcys]] and [[42355 Typhon|Typhon and Echidna]] have been named according to the new policy.<ref name=Grundy2007>

Other objects caught between these differences in classification methods include [tpl]mpl|(44594) 1999 OX|3[/tpl], which has a semi-major axis of 32Â AU but crosses the orbits of both Uranus and Neptune.  Among the inner centaurs, 2005 VD, with a perihelion distance very near Jupiter, is listed as a centaur by both JPL and DES.
Centaurs with measured diameters listed as possible dwarf planets according to Mike Brown's website include 10199 Chariklo, 2060 Chiron, and 54598 Bienor.[ref]

===Distribution===

The diagram at right illustrates the orbits of all known centaurs in relation to the orbits of the planets. For selected objects, the eccentricity of the orbits is represented by red segments (extending from perihelion to aphelion).
Centaurs' orbits are characterised by a wide range of eccentricity, from highly eccentric (Pholus, Asbolus, Amicus, Nessus) to more circular (Chariklo and the Saturn-crossers: Thereus, Okyrhoe).
To illustrate the range of the orbits' parameters, a few objects with very unusual orbits are plotted in yellow on the diagram:
A dozen known centaurs, including Dioretsa ("asteroid" spelled backwards), follow retrograde orbits.
