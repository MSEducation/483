It is an airport of entry[tpl]cite web | title = Customs at ALB | publisher = Albany International Airport | url = http://www.albanyairport.com/customs.php | accessdate = 2008-08-12 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080831034045/http://www.albanyairport.com/customs.php| archivedate= 31 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  in the town of Colonie. It was built on the site of the Shaker settlement about 6 miles (10 km) north of Albany and stretching north to the hamlet of Verdoy. The airport is below class C airspace.[tpl]cite web |url=http://skyvector.com/#46-15-3-2706-1338 |title=Albany Airspace |publisher=SkyVector.com |accessdate=2009-04-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090404132639/http://skyvector.com/#46-39-2-1700-3584| archivedate= 4 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In the past, most airlines operated mainline aircraft to ALB. The biggest aircraft that flew into ALB was Air Force One (Boeing 747), which has made four appearances: in 1994, 2009, 2011, and again in 2012. The C-5 Galaxy has landed for training, for cargo during Hurricane Katrina, and for the transportation of President Obama's motorcade on September 20 and 21, 2009. An Air Canada Airbus A340-300 (which has seating for 286 passengers) made an unscheduled arrival on December 21, 2007. Also, on August 10, 2012, a United Airlines Boeing 767-400 flight from Munich, Germany was diverted to Albany due to bad weather conditions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey where the flight was expected to land.
Many times a week, UPS runs a 757-200 for cargo.  FedEx Airlines brings the Boeing 757-200 to the airport about 5 times a week for cargo. Today, about half of the planes that depart and land in ALB are regional aircraft. Airlines that operate mainline aircraft are Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and US Airways. The largest passenger aircraft to fly into ALB daily is the Boeing 737-800 operated by Southwest Airlines with seating for 175 passengers.
The airport previously had pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi access throughout the airport provided by WiFiFee, but recently introduced free WiFi service.

==History==

Albany International was the first, and remains the oldest, municipal airport in the United States.  In 1908 the airstrip was on a former polo field on Loudonville Road, three miles (5 km) north of the city in the town of Colonie. In 1909 the airport moved to Westerlo Island, in the city of Albany, but at that time was in the town of Bethlehem; the airport was named at this time. The airport was named after Teddy Roosevelt's son, Quentin, a fighter pilot during World War I. A $10,000 prize was established for sustained flight between Albany and New York City; Glenn Curtiss achieved this on May 29, 1910. Other early pioneers of aviation that stopped at this early field were Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, and James Doolittle.
Mayor John Boyd Thacher II once said "a city without the foresight to build an airport for the new traffic may soon be left behind in the race for competition". He therefore decided to build in 1928 a new modern airport on the Shaker site near Albany-Shaker Road in Colonie, not far from the original polo fields used as the first site of the municipal airport. The Shakers not only sold the land used but also loaned the use of tractors and tools.
The early Albany Airport was often closed and threatened with closure which prompted repeated improvements in the late 1930s and 1940s. The airport was closed from January 1939 until December 1940, when it reopened to traffic during daylight hours only, and then with no restrictions since January 1942. The airport has not been closed (other than for weather and emergency landings) since.
The February 1947 C&GS chart shows three 3500-ft runways aimed 12, 98 and 133 degrees magnetic.
ALB was jointly owned and managed by the city and county of Albany until 1960 when Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd ended the city's stake.
In 1962 a new terminal building opened. A landside building had ticket counters, a coffee shop, and baggage claim on the first floor and a restaurant, offices and viewing area on the second floor. A single-story boarding concourse extended outwards from this building. In 1968 this concourse was widened to allow more concessions and boarding space. The terminal was expanded again in 1979, with the addition of a new two-story building attached diagonally to the northwest. It had boarding gates for Allegheny Airlines on the second floor, and baggage carousels on the first floor.
The Albany County Airport Authority was created by the county in 1993 with a 40 year lease to operate the airport in 1996. A new terminal was begun on May 16, 1996, opening June 1998. It was designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills and Stracher-Roth-Gilmore,SRG Architects - Albany International Airport and it was built around the existing terminal, most of which was demolished upon its completion. Only the 1979 extension remains from the old terminal building.[tpl]cite web |title=Albany Airport History|publisher=Albany County Airport Authority|accessdate=December 20, 2008|url=http://www.albanyairport.com/alb_history.php| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081222081857/http://www.albanyairport.com/alb_history.php| archivedate= 22 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Service history==

At the time of US Airline Deregulation in 1978, most of Albany's service was provided by two "trunk carriers" (American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines) and one "local service carrier" (Allegheny Airlines, which renamed itself USAir in 1979). After Deregulation, many new airlines expanded to Albany. Most did not survive the tumultuous 1980's.
Airlines that served Albany after Deregulation include:
During 1986-1987, the airline industry consolidated through a series of mergers, so that after 1989 the US airline industry was dominated by a group of six "legacy carriers:" American, United, Delta, Northwest, USAir, and Continental. All of them served Albany themselves or by their regional affiliates. During the 1990s, Albany and other Upstate markets enjoyed little low-fare service, and the legacy carriers mostly kept fares high. Southwest Airlines' entry into Albany in 2000 ushered in a new era of low fare service at the airport.

==CommutAir hub==

In early 2001, CommutAir started to invest in an Albany hub. The hub was to connect smaller cities with bigger cities with Continental Express and mainline. At its peak CommutAir served Allentown, Bangor, Binghamton, Boston, Buffalo, Burlington, Elmira, Portland, Harrisburg, Nantucket, Scranton, La Guardia, Islip, Hartford, White Plains, Manchester, Providence, Syracuse, Rochester, Lake Placid, Montreal, Ottawa, and Plattsburgh. The hub was closed down in late 2005 to shift operations to Cleveland. A few of the markets did do well.
The hub was served by Beechcraft 1900s operated by CommutAir for Continental Connection. Currently, CommutAir operates 2 flights from Albany to its hub at Newark Liberty International Airport for United Express.

==Concourses==

===Concourse A===

Concourse A was opened in 1968.  Prior to the opening of a much more modern Concourse B in June 1998, all gates in Concourse A were occupied by US Airways. Pre-merger United Airlines flights and Cape Air are the only two airlines in Concourse A.  Other previous airlines at Concourse A include American Airlines, American Eagle, Northwest Airlines (before their merger with Delta Air Lines) and Continental Airlines (before their move to Concourse C). United, following its merger with Continental added gate A4, and following the transfer of flights to/from Newark and Cleveland to Concourse A, United also added gate A3, giving United control of gates A3-A6.

===Concourse B===

===Concourse C===

Concourse C was opened in June 1998 as part of the airport's $184 million renovation project. Concourse C has three gates, all being used by Southwest Airlines. Gate C1 was formerly used by Continental Airlines. Concourse C has two Paradies Shops, a business center, an interfaith prayer room and a Brioche Dorée.

===Concourse D===

There have been discussions between the Town of Colonie and The Albany Airport Board regarding the construction of a new concourse. The concourse will be built to satisfy the needs of a growing US Airways and Southwest, and will also become an international concourse with immigration and customs facilities.[tpl]cite news | first = | last = | title = Architecture+, Petersen Group picked for $1.8M airport terminal project | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2004/10/18/daily14.html | work = The Business Review | publisher = American City Business Journals, Inc. | location = Albany, New York | date = 2006-01-13 | accessdate = 2004-10-19 [/tpl] Southwest only has two gates for their operations which some have said is not enough, considering that Southwest has over a 40% market share with only 10% of the gates. At times, aircraft have to wait until one of the two gates open up or passengers have to deplane on the tarmac via airstairs.
Proponents of the new concourse contend that it would also be useful to attract new airlines to ALB. The proposed concourse would have approximately 10 gates. However, there is insufficient space for the new facility on airport property at this time.
