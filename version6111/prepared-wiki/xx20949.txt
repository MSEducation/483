The city of Panama has an average GDP per capita of $15,300.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/panama/gdp_per_capita_(ppp).html |title=Panama GDP - per capita (PPP) - Economy |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] It has a dense skyline of mostly high-rise buildings, and it is surrounded by a large belt of tropical rainforest. Panama's Tocumen International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in Central America, offers daily flights to major international destinations. Panama was chosen as the 2003 American Capital of Culture jointly with Curitiba, Brazil. It is among the top five places for retirement in the world, according to International Living magazine.
The city of Panama was founded on August 15, 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias Dávila. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo City, through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas.
On January 28, 1671, the city was destroyed by a fire when pirate Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21, 1673, in a peninsula located [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins and is now a popular tourist attraction known as Panama Viejo.

==History==

The city was founded on August 15, 1519, by Pedro Arias de Ávila, also known as Pedrarias Dávila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. In 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panamá la Vieja (Old Panama). It was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately [tpl]convert|5|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city.
One year before the start of the California Gold Rush, the Panama Railroad Company was formed, but the railroad did not begin operation until 1855. Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. That traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period.
The construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone. These include the eradication of yellow fever and malaria and the introduction of a first-rate water supply system. However, most of the laborers for the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.
During World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama city metropolitan area. Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Some tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the January 9, 1964 events, known as Martyrs' Day.
In the late 1970s through the 1980s the city of Panama became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering center. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President George H. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to depose the leader of Panama, General Manuel Noriega. As a result of the action a portion of the El Chorrillo neighborhood, which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s (though still a large slum area), was destroyed by fire. Eventually, the U.S. helped finance the construction of large cinderblock apartment buildings to replace the destroyed structures. The city of Panama remains a banking center, although with very visible controls in the flow of cash. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and in fact the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there.

==Geography==

Panama is located between the Pacific Ocean and tropical rain forest in the northern part of Panama. The Parque Natural Metropolitano (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama City along the Panama Canal, has unique bird species and other animals, such as tapir, puma, and caimans. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology, managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
Tropical forests around Panama are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal, providing it with the water required for its operation; the canal is thus a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of a forest that helped to preserve that forest. Due to the canal's importance to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state. Along the western side of the canal is the Parque Nacional Soberania (Sovereignty National Park), which includes the Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. The best known trail in this national park is Pipeline Road, popular among birdwatchers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canopytower.com/ |title=Canopy Tower, a famous birdwatchers hotel |publisher=Canopytower.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]
Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Most are unnavigable; many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chepo and the Río Chagres, both within the boundaries of the city, work as sources of hydroelectric power.
The Río Chagres is one of the longest and most vital of the approximately 150 rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Part of this river was dammed to create Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the transit route between the locks near each end of the canal. Both Gatun Lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity to the former Canal Zone area. The Río Chepo, another major source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Panama has a tropical wet and dry climate. It sees [tpl]convert|1900|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation annually. The wet season spans from May through December, and the dry season spans from January through April. Temperatures remain constant throughout the year, averaging around [tpl]convert|27|C|F[/tpl].

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

Panama's old quarter (or Casco Viejo, Panama) features many architectural styles, from Spanish colonial buildings to French and Antillean townhouses built during the construction of the Panama Canal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usa-lawfirm.com/news-BostonGlobe-012207.asp?id=2924322 |title=In Panama City's Old Quarter, a Rebirth Takes Place |work=Boston Globe |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2011-02-11[/tpl] The more modern areas of the city have many high-rise buildings, which together form a very dense skyline. There are more than 110 high-rise projects under construction, with 127 already built.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=864 |title=Skyscraper page Panama City |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] The city holds the 45th place in the world by high-rise buildings count.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?s=1&c=4&p=1&r=50&10=0 |title=Skyscraper page Cities List |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]
The Centennial Bridge that crosses the Panama Canal earned the American Segmental Bridge Institute prize of excellence, along with seven other bridges in the Americas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2005/10/23/hoy/panorama/379361.html |title=La Prensa Newspaper |publisher=Mensual.prensa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

===Neighborhoods===

The city is located in Panama District, although its metropolitan area also includes some populated areas on the opposite side of the Panama Canal. As in the rest of the country, the city is divided into corregimientos, in which there are many smaller boroughs. The old quarter, known as the Casco Viejo, is located in the corregimiento of San Felipe. San Felipe and twelve other corregimientos form the urban centre of the city, including Santa Ana, El Chorrillo, Calidonia, Curundú, Ancón, Bella Vista, Bethania, San Francisco, Juan Diaz, Pueblo Nuevo, Parque Lefevre, and Río Abajo.

==Economy==

As the economic and financial center of the country, Panama City's economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panamatours.com/Facts/Useful%20Facts.htm |title=Panama Useful Facts |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] The economy depends significantly on trade and shipping activities associated with the Panama Canal and port facilities located in Balboa. The city has benefited from significant economic growth in recent years, mainly due to the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal, an increase in real estate investment, and a relatively stable banking sector.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/02/panama-economy-idUSN0214618620100302 |title=Panama economy grew 2.4 percent in 2009 |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] There are around eighty banks in the city, at least fifteen of which are national.
Panama City is responsible for the production of approximately 55% of the country's GDP. This is because most Panamanian businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://municipio.gob.pa/ |title=Municipio de Panamá |publisher=Municipio.gob.pa |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] It is a stopover for other destinations in the country, as well as a transit point and tourist destination in itself.
Tourism is one of the most important economic activities in terms of revenue generation. The city's hotel occupancy rate has always been relatively high, reaching the second highest for any city outside the United States in 2008, after Perth, Australia, and followed by Dubai.[tpl]cite web|url=http://panamarealestateinvestment.org/2008/05/06/panama-city-has-the-second-highest-hotel-occupancy-outside-of-the-united-states/ |title=Panama City Has The Second Highest Hotel Occupancy Outside Of The United States |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] However, hotel occupancy rates have dropped since 2009, probably due to the opening of many new luxury hotels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globaledge.co.uk/news/hotel-occupancy-rates-see-sharp-drop-36008 |title=Hotel occupancy rates see sharp drop. |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] Several international hotel chains, such as Le Méridien, Radisson, and RIU, have opened or plan to open new hotels in the city,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elpanama-hotel.com/twenty-two-hotels-are-under-construction-in-panama/ |title=Twenty-two Hotels are Under Construction in Panama. |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] along with those previously operating under Marriott, Sheraton, InterContinental, and other foreign and local brands.

==Demographics==

The city proper has around 880,691 inhabitants in 23 boroughs."Panama City Hall (Spanish"[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] The inhabitants of Panama City are commonly referred to as capitalinos and include large numbers of Afro-Panamanians, mestizos, and mulattos, with notable white and Asian minorities.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Panama.htm

===World Heritage Sites===

====Panamá La Vieja====

Panamá Viejo ("Old Panama") is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de Avila on August 98, 1519. This city was the starting point for the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru in 1532. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, where most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through.
The committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of cultural criteria (ii), (iv), and (vi), considering that Panama was the first European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas, in 1519, and that the Historic District preserves intact a street pattern along with a substantial number of early domestic buildings, which are testimony to the nature of this early settlement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/790 |title=UNESCO Official Site |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=1997-12-07 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

====Casco Viejo or Casco Antiguo====

Built and settled in 1671 after the destruction of Panama Viejo by the privateer Henry Morgan, the historic district of Panama City (known as Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, or San Felipe) was conceived as a walled city to protect its settlers against future pirate attacks. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/790/
Casco Antiguo displays a mix of architectural styles that reflect the country's cultural diversity: Caribbean, Republican, art deco, French, and colonial architecture mix in a site comprising around 800 buildings. Most of Panama City's main monuments are located in Casco Antiguo, including the Salón Bolivar, the National Theater (founded in 1908), Las Bóvedas, and Plaza de Francia. There are also many Catholic buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the La Merced Church, and the St. Philip Neri Church. The distinctive golden altar at St. Joseph Church was one of the few items saved from Panama Viejo during the 1671 pirate siege. It was buried in mud during the siege and then secretly transported to its present location.
Undergoing redevelopment, the old quarter has become one of the city's main tourist attractions, second only to the Panama Canal. Both government and private sectors are working on its restoration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,fdc48ceb-4b4e-427c-af4c-e3131de40e66.aspx |title=Panama Casco Viejo Blog – Panama News: World Bank invests in Cultural Industries for Casco Antiguo |publisher=Arcoproperties.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] However, a construction project proposed by President Ricardo Martinelli has recently proven controversial. Named "Cinta Costera 3", this project includes the construction of a maritime highway viaduct around the Casco Antiguo.[tpl]cite web|title=Darién mira la discusión en San Petersburgo so you don’t have to|url=http://arquitectopana.com/tag/cinta-costera/|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl] Proponents claim the road will ease traffic congestion in the city while "causing a positive dialog between the highly contrasting areas of the city."

On June 28, 2012, UNESCO decided that Casco Viejo will not be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, while affirming the importance that further studies be conducted to demonstrate the project will not be culturally detrimental to Casco Viejo and that the viaduct is the "most viable option".[tpl]cite web|title=Gobierno debe presentar estudios de opción más viable para cinta costera 3|url=http://www.prensa.com/uhora/locales/gobierno-debe-presentar-estudios-de-opcion-mas-viable-para-cinta-costera-3/103865|publisher=Prensa.com|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl]

==Transportation==

Panama's international airport, Tocumen International Airport, has two runways and is located on the eastern outskirts of the city's metropolitan area. There are direct flights between Tocumen and the United States, some European cities, and all major cities in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago de Chile, Bogotá, Buenos Aires, and Lima. Panama City has a regional airport, Marcos A. Gelabert, located in an area once occupied by Albrook Air Force Base. Marcos A. Gelabert Airport is the main hub for regional flights within Panama and the Pearl Islands in the Pacific and Bocas del Toro islands in the Caribbean.
There are frequent traffic jams in Panama City due to the high levels of private transport ownership per mile of traffic lane. In an attempt to curb traffic jams, President Ricardo Martinelli has brought forward a citywide metro system, initially [tpl]convert|14|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, stretching across the city. This new metro system, along with the Metrobus, will replace the current public transportation system.
The bus terminal located in Ancon offers buses in and out of the city. Bus service is one of the most widely used forms of transportation in Panama. The terminal receives thousands of passengers daily from locations like David, Chiriqui, and the central provinces of Herrera and Los Santos. The terminal also receives international passengers from Central America via the Pan-American Highway.
Panama City offers transportation services through yellow taxis. Taxis do not use a meter to measure fares, instead using a zone system for fares that is published by the Autoridad de Transito y Transporte Terrestre, Panama's transit authority. Major vehicle rental companies are located at the airports.
Although Panama City is modernizing its public transportation system, it is still possible to see a form of public transportation consisting of colorfully painted buses, colloquially known as [tpl]lang|es|diablos rojos[/tpl]. A [tpl]lang|es|diablo rojo[/tpl] is usually painted with bright colors, usually depicting famous actors, politicians, or singers. It is popular for bus drivers to customize the interior and exterior of their [tpl]lang|es|diablo rojo[/tpl].
