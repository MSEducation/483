John Wills Martin (ca. 1790[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]after 1843) was an English-born merchant and political figure in Newfoundland. He represented Placentia and St. Mary's in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1832 to 1836.
He came to St. John's from Poole, Dorset in 1816, later working as a clerk at Trinity for George Garland and Sons. In 1827, he was sent to Twillingate. Martin later was employed by another firm in St. Mary's. In 1830, he was named justice of the peace for the southern district, and, in 1834, a commissioner of roads. He was married twice: to Phoebe Cooper in 1827 and to Martha Taylor in 1839. In 1834, Martin was named a governor for the Savings Bank in St. John's. In 1836, he became head of a branch in Carbonear of the mercantile firm which employed him and also became justice of the peace for the northern district. In 1843, he was named a justice of the peace for Fogo. Martin may have returned to England some time after that.
