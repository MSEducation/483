The Renfrewshire Derby is a Scottish football derby, contested between two senior clubs Greenock Morton and St. Mirren.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.stmirren.info/id68.html |title= Greenock Morton |accessdate=2010-01-11 |publisher= www.stmirren.info [/tpl] The fixture, since the sides first met in 1885, has grown in significance over the years, due in part to the demise of other Renfrewshire football clubs, and is one of the most hotly contested derbies in Scotland today. Although both sides have regularly competed at the same level of Scottish football, recent years have seen St. Mirren competing in the Scottish Premier League, with Morton competing in the lower leagues. However, the annual Renfrewshire Cup, a regional cup competition turned pre-season friendly, generally ensures that there is at least one Renfrewshire Derby a year.
