CATEGORIES: School districts in Manitoba

The Pelly Trail School Division was a school division in Manitoba, Canada that operated in rural and small-town communities near the Saskatchewan border.  In 2002, it was merged with the Birdtail River School Division to create the new Park West School Division.Nick Martin, "School division mergers move through hearings", Winnipeg Free Press, A13; Nick Martin, "Ban expires, schools to close", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 August 2005, A6.
In 1985, the division made a controversial decision not to allow Manitoba Premier Howard Pawley to address a group of high-school students.  Trustee Len Derkach argued that the school board "wanted to keep politics out of the school system", although a spokesperson for the premier indicated that the talk would not have been partisan in nature.  The spokesperson added that Pawley had never been refused permission to speak to students before."School turns down premier's proposal to address students", Globe and Mail, 2 November 1985, A4.
