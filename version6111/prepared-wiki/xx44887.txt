==Biography==

===Early years===

Baltimore was born to Gertrude (Lipschitz) and Richard Baltimore in New York City. Raised in the Queens neighborhoods of Forest Hills and Rego Park, Queens, he moved with his family to suburban Great Neck, New York while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate. His father had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and his mother was an atheist, and Baltimore observed Jewish holidays and would attend synagogue with his father through his Bar Mitzvah.David Baltimore - Interviewed by Sara Lippincott; October - November 2009, California Institute of Technology. Accessed February 21, 2013. "But she was also committed to her family and to my father's right to have his religion, and we celebrated the major holidays, we fasted on Yom Kippur, and I walked with my father to the shul, which was a long walk from where we lived." He graduated from Great Neck High School in 1956, and credits his interest in biology to a high-school summer spent at the Jackson Laboratory's Summer Student Program in Bar Harbor, Maine.Nobel Prize autobiography.

"David Baltimore, 1975 Nobel laureate and one of the nation's best-known scientists, is a good case in point. The 60-year-old Baltimore, who graduated from Great Neck High School in 1956..." He earned a BA at Swarthmore College in 1960, and received his Ph.D. at Rockefeller University in 1964. After postdoctoral fellowships at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a non-faculty research position at the Salk Institute, he joined the MIT faculty in 1968. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]

===Career===

In 1975, at the age of 37, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The citation reads, "for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell." At the time, Baltimore's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase (RTase or RT). Reverse transcriptase is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV and was also discovered independently, and at about the same time, by Mizutani and Temin.[tpl]cite news | title = No Nobel Prize for Whining | author = Judson, Horace F| date = 2003-10-20 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C02E4DE123EF933A15753C1A9659C8B63 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2007-08-03[/tpl]
Also in 1975, Baltimore was an organizer of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA. In 1982, Baltimore was appointed the founding director of MIT's Whitehead Institute, where he remained through June 1990.
In 1981, Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello, a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory, used recombinant DNA technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus, an animal RNA virus. The plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced.[tpl]cite journal |author=Racaniello V, Baltimore D |title=Cloned poliovirus complemenatry DNA is infectious in mammalian cells |journal=Science |volume=214 |issue=453 |pages=916–919 |year=1981 |pmid=6272391 |doi=10.1126/science.6272391|bibcode = 1981Sci...214..916R [/tpl] The infectious clone, DNA encoding the genome of a virus, is a standard tool used today in virology. Other important breakthroughs from Baltimore's lab include the discovery of the transcription factor NF-κB and the recombination activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2.
Baltimore became president of Rockefeller University in New York City on July 1, 1990. After resigning on December 3, 1991, Baltimore remained on the Rockefeller University faculty and continued research until spring of 1994. He then rejoined the MIT faculty.
Baltimore has influenced national policy concerning recombinant DNA research and the AIDS epidemic. He has trained many doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, several of whom have gone on to notable and distinguished research careers. Baltimore is a member of The Jackson Laboratory's Board of Trustees, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Board of Sponsors, the National Academy of Sciences USA (NAS), the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM), Amgen, Inc. Board of Directors, the BB Biotech AG Board of Directors, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Vaccine Research Committee (AVRC), and numerous other organizations and their boards.

====Imanishi-Kari case====

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a scientist in Baltimore's laboratory was implicated in a case of scientific fraud.  The case received extensive news coverage and a Congressional investigation. The case was linked to Baltimore's name because of his scientific collaboration with and later his strong defense of Imanishi-Kari against accusations of fraud.
In 1986, while a Professor of Biology at MIT and Director at Whitehead, Baltimore co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with Thereza Imanishi-Kari (an Assistant Professor of Biology who had her own laboratory at MIT) as well as four others.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90389-2 |author=Weaver D, Reis MH, Albanese C, Costantini F, Baltimore D, Imanishi-Kari T |title=Altered repertoire of endogenous immunoglobulin gene expression in transgenic mice containing a rearranged mu heavy chain gene |journal=Cell |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=247–59 |date=April 1986 |pmid=3084104 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0092-8674(86)90389-2[/tpl][tpl]Retracted paper|PMID 2032282|intentional=yes[/tpl] A postdoctoral fellow in Imanishi-Kari's laboratory, Margot O'Toole, who was not an author, reported concerns about the paper, ultimately accusing Imanishi-Kari of fabricating data in a cover-up. Baltimore, however, refused to retract the paper.
O'Toole soon dropped her challenge, but the NIH, which had funded the contested paper's research, began investigating, thanks to the insistence of Walter W. Stewart, a self-appointed fraud buster, and Ned Feder, his lab head at the NIH. Representative John Dingell (D-MI) also aggressively pursued it, eventually calling in U.S. Secret Service (USSS; U.S. Treasury) document examiners."Fraud in NIH Grant Programs," 12 April 1988; "Scientific Fraud," 4 & 9 May 1989; and "Scientific Fraud (Part 2)," 14 May 1990 (transcript includes 30 April 1990 hearing on R. Gallo's NIH lab)
Around October 1989, when Baltimore was appointed president of Rockefeller University, around a third of the faculty opposed his appointment because of concerns about his behaviour in the Imanishi-Kari case. He had to visit every laboratory, one by one, to hear those concerns directly from each group of researchers.[tpl]citation |title= Conduct Unbecoming? |author= Philip Weiss |date= 29 October 1989 |work= New York Times |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/29/magazine/conduct-unbecoming.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm [/tpl]
In a draft report dated March 14, 1991 and based mainly on USSS forensics findings, NIH's fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity (OSI), accused Imanishi-Kari of falsifying and fabricating data. It also criticized Baltimore for failing to embrace O'Toole's challenge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] Less than a week later, the report was leaked to the press.Philip J. Hilts, "Crucial Data Were Fabricated In Report Signed by Top Biologist" (New York Times, 21 March 1991, pp. A1, B10) Baltimore and three co-authors then retracted the paper; Imanishi-Kari and Moema H. Reis did not sign the retraction.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90085-D |author=Weaver D, Albanese C, Costantini F, Baltimore D |title=Retraction: altered repertoire of endogenous immunoglobulin gene expression in transgenic mice containing a rearranged mu heavy chain gene |journal=Cell |volume=65 |issue=4 |page=536 |date=May 1991 |pmid=2032282 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0092-8674(91)90085-D[/tpl]
Amid concerns raised by negative publicity in connection with the scandal, Baltimore resigned as president of Rockefeller University[tpl]cite journal |author=Hall SS |title=David Baltimore's final days |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5038 |pages=1576–9 |date=December 1991 |pmid=1749930 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1749930 |doi=10.1126/science.1749930 |bibcode=1991Sci...254.1576H[/tpl] or here http://www.gatewaycoalition.org/files/Gateway_Project_Moshe_Kam/Resource/DBCre/Science13dec91.html and rejoined the MIT Biology faculty.Natalie Angier, "Embattled Biologist Will Return to M.I.T." (New York Times, 19 May 1992, P. C5)
In July 1992, the US Attorney for the District of MD, who had been investigating the case, announced he would bring neither criminal nor civil charges against Imanishi-Kari.Malcolm Gladwell, "Prosecutors Halt Scientific Fraud Probe; Researcher Baltimore Claims Vindication, Plans to 'Unretract' Paper" (Washington Post, 14 July 1992, P. A3); [tpl]cite journal |author=Hamilton DP |title=U.S. attorney decides not to prosecute Imanishi-Kari |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5068 |page=318 |date=July 1992 |pmid=1321499 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1321499 |doi=10.1126/science.1321499 |bibcode=1992Sci...257..318H[/tpl] In October 1994, however, OSI's successor, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI; HHS) found Imanishi-Kari guilty on 19 counts of research misconduct, basing its conclusions largely on Secret Service analysis of laboratory notebooks.
An HHS appeals panel began meeting in June 1995 to review all charges in detail. In June 1996, the panel ruled that the ORI had failed to prove even one of its 19 charges. Citing repeated instances where Dr. O'Toole's allegations were "not credible", the panel dismissed all charges against Imanishi-Kari. Furthermore, as their final report stated, the HHS panel "found that much of what ORI presented was irrelevant, had limited probative value, was internally inconsistent, lacked reliability or foundation, was not credible or not corroborated, or was based on unwarranted assumptions." Neither OSI nor ORI ever accused Baltimore of research misconduct.1996 HHS report exonerating Imanishi-Kari. Hhs.gov.

During Baltimore's tenure at Caltech, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Baltimore the National Medal of Science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world. In 2004, Rockefeller University gave Baltimore its highest honor, Doctor of Science (honoris causa).[tpl]cite journal |author=Bhattacharjee, Y. |title=The Balance of Justice |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5679 |page=1901 |date=25 June 2004 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/304/5679/1901a |doi=10.1126/science.304.5679.1901a[/tpl]
In October 2005, Baltimore resigned the office of the president,LATimes.com, "Caltech President Baltimore Announces Retirement," 3 October 2005; R.L. Hotz, "Caltech President Who Raised School's Profile to Step Down". LA Times, 4 October 2005, p.
