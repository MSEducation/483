Sacramento International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|SMF|KSMF|SMF[/tpl] is a public airport 10 miles (16 km) northwest of downtown Sacramento, in Sacramento County, California. It is run by Sacramento County. Southwest Airlines currently accounts for half the airline passengers. In 2012 the airport handled 8,910,570 passengers, a decrease from 8,929,289 passengers in 2011.

==History==

Due to housing growth around Sacramento Executive Airport, the City of Sacramento Planning Department and the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors commissioned a study in the 1950s to move airline flights to a less populated area. In 1957 the proposed construction of Sacramento Metropolitan Airport and purchase of nearly 6,000 acres north of downtown Sacramento was considered extravagant, risky, poorly located, and based on unrealistic passenger expectations.
Sacramento International Airport (SMF) opened October 21, 1967 as Sacramento Metropolitan Airport with one 8600-foot runway. Until then the airlines used Sacramento Municipal Airport (SAC), now called Sacramento Executive Airport. The estimate of 750,000 annual passengers soon proved to be conservative as the airport surpassed one million passengers during its first year. Sacramento Metropolitan Airport was the first airport west of the Mississippi built from the ground up for public use.
The airport initially had five airlines: Pacific Air Lines, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), United Airlines, Western Airlines, and West Coast Airlines. For a short time around 1975 PSA tried Lockheed L-1011 TriStars at Sacramento, nonstop to San Francisco and direct to Los Angeles.  L-1011 flights were uneconomical and PSA soon replaced the L-1011 with smaller jets such as the Boeing 727-200.
During the 1980s development included: the in-flight catering facility (1980), an FAA Flight Inspection Field Office (1985), a second air cargo facility (1985), and the east runway (1987). The east runway’s opening was celebrated by the landing of a Concorde SST[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Please reference this|date=February 2014[/tpl]. America West Airlines, Continental Airlines, Morris Air and American Eagle Airlines joined the original carriers at Sacramento Metropolitan Airport during this time.
In the 1990s the consolidated rental car facility and Terminal A opened (1998), which was designed by Dreyfuss & Blackford Architects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreyfussblackford.com/projectsDetail.jsp?id=38&category=3&title=Aviation&level=1 |title=Sacramento International Airport Terminal A - Dreyfuss & Blackford Architects |publisher=Dreyfussblackford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl] Meanwhile traffic continued to grow. With the opening of a new terminal building it was renamed Sacramento International Airport, though it did not receive international flights until 2002 when Mexicana started nonstops to Guadalajara. The airport was designated a port of entry on October 5, 2006.[tpl]cite news |title=Sacramento International Named Official Port of Entry|first=Melanie|last=Turner|url=http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2006/10/09/story8.html|newspaper=Sacramento Business Journal|date=October 6, 2006[/tpl]
The consolidated rental car terminal, the first of its kind in the nation, gave all rental car customers a single point of access that could be reached on a single shuttle. This innovation streamlined bus operations to reduce congestion at the terminal and improve air quality while enhancing customer service.
The Sacramento County Airport System launched its Web site in April 1997.
Southwest Airlines (1991), Alaska Airlines (1993), Horizon Air (1993), and Trans World Airlines (TWA) (1994) were added to the list of carriers at Sacramento. Southwest and Alaska Airlines grew quickly, offsetting the departure of airlines such as American Eagle, Continental and USAir which had acquired PSA.
Airport security procedures were dramatically changed after September 11, 2001. The newly formed Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration were created and sweeping changes were implemented to improve aviation security.
September 11 did not deter growth at Sacramento International Airport. Four airlines were soon added to Sacramento International: Continental returned (2000) and Frontier (2002), Mexicana (2002), Hawaiian (2002), and Aloha Airlines (2003) initiated service. Mexicana’s arrival initiated international nonstop flights and necessitated completion of the International Arrivals Building for federal inspection services.
The Terminal A Parking Garage opened September 23, 2004. The six-story structure had covered parking, a short walk to the terminal and public art (“Flying Gardens” by Dennis Oppenheim and “Flying Carpet” by Seyed Alavi).
In 2006 Sacramento International Airport was one of the first airports in the nation to offer free wireless Internet service (WiFi).
As the nation’s economy was taking a hit in 2008, commercial aviation was challenged by reduced passenger numbers and increasing fuel and other costs. ExpressJet ceased independent operations in 2008, Aloha Airlines ceased operations in 2008 and Mexicana discontinued operations as well.  However, prior to the economic downturn, new services began and airliners merged. America West  and US Airways merged, Northwest and Delta Merged and United and Continental initiated their merger by the end of 2011. Despite these challenges, Alaska added nonstop flights to Guadalajara(now discontinued), Mexico and Hawaii (Maui) while Aeromexico’s (2011) debut reestablished foreign-flag service with daily nonstops to Guadalajara, Mexico. On April 2011 American Eagle started flights to Los Angeles. On June 5, 2008 US Airways began  seasonal flights to Charlotte and Philadelphia. In the summer of 2010 Delta Air Lines began seasonal flights to Detroit.
Long dominated by Southwest and United (United Express), the intra-California market was joined in 2011 by American (American Eagle) and Delta (Delta Connection) which fly from Los Angeles International Airport.
Air Canada flew to this airport in 2007-2008 to Vancouver, but ended the route in 2008.
The airport was a focus city for ExpressJet Airlines which independently operated Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets on point-to-point, "hub bypass" routes.  ExpressJet then ended all independent flying and refocused its business on code shares for major airlines.
California Pacific Airlines hopes to fly between Sacramento and Carlsbad in southern California in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flycpair.com/about/aboutDestinations.htm |title=California Pacific Airlines Destinations |publisher=Flycpair.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl]
Sacramento County has tried (and so far failed) to entice Virgin America into adding a Los Angeles route by giving them 400,000 dollars to operate out of terminal A or 150,000 dollars to operate in terminal B; other airports are trying to entice the airline.[tpl]cite news |title=Sacramento County Approves Incentives to Land Virgin America at Airport|first=Melanie|last=Turner|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2012/04/10/sac-county-incentives-virgin-airlines.html?page=all|newspaper=Sacramento Business Journal|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] American Eagle operated by Skywest Airlines will begin service to Los Angeles on November 14, 2012. On the same day, the regular American Eagle discontinued service to Los Angeles. On January 6, 2013, Frontier Airlines ended service to Denver.
In 2011 the airport carried  an estimated 9 million passengers; it averaged 323 flights a day. Continental Airlines, which later merged with United Airlines, previously had seasonal flights to Newark. Sacramento's seasonal route are operated during the summer and fall.
Between 1990 and 2007 Sacramento International Airport had a high incidence of bird strikes due to its location in an avian migratory route.
Sacramento hosted one of Alaska Airlines' last MD-80 flights, Sacramento to Seattle.
US Airways previously flew to Las Vegas, but ended service after closing its Las Vegas hub.
On July 6, 2013 the airport was one of ten airports that hosted flights diverted from San Francisco International Airport after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed short of the runway.
On December 17, 2013, Aeromexico began seasonal service to Del Bajio International Airport.

On June 7, 2006, plans were announced to replace the aging Terminal B with a brand new terminal by the year 2012. In 2008, the Sacramento County Airport System broke ground on the largest capital improvement project in the history of the County of Sacramento: “The Big Build”. Designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. in association with Fentress Architects and built by Turner Construction, the $1.03 billion terminal modernization project replaces the airport’s original, aging Terminal B to meet the rising demand for passenger services and improve the airport’s ability to attract new carriers and routes. Aeromexico, Alaska/Horizon, American Airlines, Hawaiian, Volaris, and Southwest are located in the new terminal while Delta, United/Continental, JetBlue,http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2013/10/11/jetblue-changing-airport-terminals.html and US Airways operate out of Terminal A.
The Central Terminal B complex is three times the size of the original Terminal B with the two parts of the complex – airside and landside – connected by an automated people mover.
Airport officials held a press conference on July 15, 2011 at the California State Fair, announcing the terminal will open on October 6, 2011. This is many months ahead of schedule from the original projected opening in 2012.[tpl]cite news |title=New Sacramento Airport Terminal to Open in Fall|first=Melanie|last=Turner|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2011/07/15/new-sacramento-airport-terminal-to.html|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2011[/tpl]
