Ralph MacDonald (March 15, 1944 – December 18, 2011) was a Trinbagonian-American percussionist, song-writer, musical arranger, record producer, steelpan virtuoso and philanthropist.
His compositions include "Where Is the Love", a Grammy Award winner for the duet Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, "Just the Two of Us", recorded by Bill Withers and Grover Washington, Jr., and "Mr. Magic" recorded by Grover Washington, Jr.

==Career==

Growing up in Harlem, U.S.A. under the close mentorship of his Trinbagonian father, Patrick MacDonald (a calypsonian and bandleader originally from Trinidad and Tobago who went by the stage name "Macbeth the Great"), MacDonald began showing his musical talent, particularly with the steelpan, and when he was 17 years old started playing pan for the Harry Belafonte show.
He remained with the Belafonte band for a decade before deciding to strike out on his own. In 1967, together with Bill Eaton and William Salter, he formed the Anisitia Music Incorporated. Anisitia is based in Stamford, Connecticut.
In 1971, Roberta Flack recorded "Where Is the Love", which MacDonald and Salter had written. The duet with Donny Hathaway won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The single was awarded gold status and sold more than one million copies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Ralph%20MacDonald.html|title=Ralph MacDonald|publisher=soulwalking.co.uk[/tpl]  MacDonald played on the session for the song.http://www.allmusic.com/song/where-is-the-love-t809536
One of MacDonald's best-known compositions is "Just the Two of Us", a single sung by Bill Withers, with saxophone performance by Grover Washington, Jr. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and has since been covered and sampled by many artists, including Will Smith.

==Later life==

MacDonald regularly travelled back to Trinidad and Tobago, where he renewed his work in the steelpan, particularly on the hills of Laventille, Trinidad with the multiple Steelband Panorama champions Deperadoes Steel Band, whose shows he attended and with whom he played whenever he got the opportunity, "beating iron" in "The Engine Room" (as a steelband's rhythm section is often called).  Calypso and the steelpan were Ralph MacDonald's roots. He composed a song called "You Need More Calypso", musically to articulate how he felt the music world could more benefit by the genre his homeland had given to the world.
At 12:50 AM on Sunday, December 18, 2011, MacDonald died of lung cancer.
