==History==

Founded in 1989, the school started its operations by temporarily accommodating boys from the primary levels of Don Bosco Technical College (DBTC) in Mandaluyong City which belongs to the Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB). DBTC gradually phased out their pre-school and primary levels. DBTC also temporarily transferred some of their primary level faculty to Don Bosco School Manila. The administration and policies applied to this agreement followed the DBTC Manual for students, faculty and staff. The Salesian Sisters Administration of DBS Manila and the Salesian Fathers Administration of DBTC Mandaluyong worked in close supervision and collaboration until April 1993 when the last group of transferees had finished their Grade 4 and enrolled back at DBTC to finish their Intermediate and High school. Faculty members who were temporarily transferred from DBTC were offered a choice as to their preferred employer.
However, this agreement did not hinder the administration of DBS to start its own co-educational pre-school and grade school levels and to employ directly its new faculty and staff in 1989. In April 1993, DBS Manila and DBTC Mandaluyong finally ended its temporary phase in and phase out agreement.
In 1994, the first class of Grade 5 students (all girls) started the intermediate level. In 1996, the school held its first Commencement Exercises of its 59 graduates in the Elementary Course. In 2000, the program for the Secondary Education was completed.
The school started to accept boys in the Grade 5 level during the school year 2004-2005. These boys were accepted into the secondary level (SY 2006-2007) after a consultation made by the Educating Community Core Group. The results of the consultation showed that majority of parents prefer to send their boys in DBS until they finish their secondary school.
In 2004 construction finished for the St. Mary Mazzarello Building (multi-purpose building). There is a canteen on the 1st floor. On the 2nd floor it has a Cooking Lab, P.E. Hall, and Speech Lab. On the 3rd floor it has an Auditorium (Audio Visual Room) and Admin Offices. On the 4th floor it has a Dance Hall and Music Room. On the other floors, access to students is prohibited.
In 2011 construction finished for the Don Bosco School Skyroof. This massive roof covers 80% of the Don Bosco School Quadrangle. A budget estimate of Php 7,000,000. This was the latest construction feat of Don Bosco School Manila.
