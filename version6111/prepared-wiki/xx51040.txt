The Complete Studio Recordings is a ten compact disc box set by the English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on 24 September 1993. It contains all nine of the original Led Zeppelin studio albums digitally remastered, and an expanded version of Coda. The albums are placed in chronological order with the exception of Presence which appears between Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. The intention was to have the latter in one two-disc-sleeve.[tpl]cite book | author= Lewis, Dave| title=Led Zeppelin: The Complete Guide to Their Music| edition=1st | location=London| publisher= Omnibus Press | year=2004| page=74| chapter=The Complete Studio Recordings| isbn=1-84449-141-2[/tpl]
The set's version of Coda included some of the previously unreleased tracks that had surfaced on the box set series: "Baby Come On Home", "Travelling Riverside Blues", "White Summer"/"Black Mountain Side", and "Hey Hey What Can I Do". In 2007, when the Led Zeppelin catalog was released to digital stores, the expanded tracklist for Coda was used, but omitted "Travelling Riverside Blues" because of its inclusion with BBC Sessions.
The set also includes a booklet featuring an extended essay by rock journalist Cameron Crowe and photos of the band.
The album cover depicts the inside structure of a zeppelin.
This title has been discontinued just prior to the launch of Mothership, and is now superseded by the Definitive Collection Mini LP Replica CD Boxset, which was released in September 2008.
