[[My Huckleberry Friend]]

CATEGORIES: 1974 albums, Johnny Mercer albums

"...My Huckleberry Friend": Johnny Mercer Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer is an album by singer/composer Johnny Mercer, released in 1974. 
Recorded just two years before his death, ...My Huckleberry Friend features, by and large, updated, funky arrangements of most of Mercer's most popular tunes as interpreted by the author himself. The instrumentation relies heavily (but not exclusively) on a flute-lead horn section, electric piano and funk/R&B-tinged percussion. Some of the songs, however, such as "One For My Baby", "Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home" and "Midnight Sun" feature more classic arrangements in the ballad style.
The album's title comes from the song responsible for relaunching Mercer's career, "Moon River".
