The new owners will rent out the whole house rather than individual rooms. Those renting such units are not required to pay the 7-percent room tax levied on inn and hotel clients, which Jay Schatz believes to be a factor in the declining bed and breakfast business.[tpl]Cite news |last=Fichter |first=Jack |date=March 17, 2012 |title=Schatz Leaves the Abbey, Military Gear for Sale |url=http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/people/cape+may/81306-schatz+leaves+abbey+military+gear+sale/ |newspaper=Cape May County Herald[/tpl]
