Isoëtes (sometimes spelled Isoetes), commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of plants in the class Isoëtopsida and order Isoëtales. They are lycopods. There are about 140–150 species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus Stylites, although molecular data place these species among other species of Isoëtes, so the genus does not warrant taxonomic recognition.

==Description==

Quillworts are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic in clear ponds and slow-moving streams, though several (e.g. I. butleri, I. histrix and I. nuttallii) grow on wet ground that dries out in the summer. Quillwort leaves are hollow and quill-like, arising from a central corm. Each leaf is narrow, [tpl]convert|2|-|20|cm|1[/tpl] long (exceptionally up to [tpl]convert|100|cm|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) and [tpl]convert|0.5|-|3.0|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl] wide; they can be either evergreen, winter deciduous, or dry-season deciduous. They broaden to a swollen base up to [tpl]convert|5|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] wide where they attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground rhizome characteristic of most quillwort species, though a few (e.g. I. tegetiformans) form spreading mats. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. They are heterosporous. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope.

==Classification==

The genus Isoëtes is placed in its own family Isoëtaceae. The genus includes about 150 species worldwide.[tpl]cite book | last=Taylor | first=W. Carl | coauthors=Neil T. Luebke; Donald M. Britton; R.

Many species, such as the Louisiana quillwort and the mat-forming quillwort, are endangered species. Several species of Isoetes are commonly called Merlin's grass, especially I. lacustris, but also the endagered species I. tegetiformans and I. virginica.

==Evolution==

Fossilised specimens of I. beestonii have been found in rocks dating to the early Triassic. Quillworts are considered by some to be the last remnant of the fossil tree Lepidodendron with which they share some unusual features including the development of both wood and bark, a modified shoot system acting as roots, bipolar growth, and an upright stance.
