Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, released October 1966, is the third album by Simon & Garfunkel. It was produced by Bob Johnston, and Rolling Stone magazine co-founder Ralph J. Gleason provided the liner notes. The name comes from the second line of the album's first track, "Scarborough Fair/Canticle". The album peaked on the U.S. charts at #4.
The closing track, "7 O'Clock News/Silent Night," includes a news bulletin mixed in with the music. The bulletin reports the death of Lenny Bruce, the indictment of mass-murderer Richard Speck, and the calling out of the National Guard in response to civil protests.Billig, Michael.
