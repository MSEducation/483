Richard Joseph "Dick" Durbin (born November 21, 1944) is the senior United States Senator from Illinois, in office since 1997. He has been the Senate Majority Whip, the second highest position in the Democratic Party leadership in the Senate, since 2007.
He was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, he graduated from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and Georgetown University Law Center. Working in state legal counsel throughout the 1970s, he made an unsuccessful run for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1978. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, representing the Springfield-based 20th congressional district. In 1996 he won election to the U.S. Senate by an unexpected 15-point margin. He has served as Senate Democratic Whip since 2005, and assumed his current title when the Democratic Party obtained a majority in 2007.

==Early life, education and career==

Durbin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois to an Irish-American father, William Durbin, and a Lithuanian-born mother, Anna (née Kutkin; Lithuanian: Ona Kutkaitė).durbin He graduated from Assumption High School in East St. Louis in 1962. During his high school years he worked at a meatpacking plant. He earned a B.S. from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1966. He was an intern in the office of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois during his senior year in college. Durbin earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1969 and was admitted to the Illinois bar later that year.
After graduating from law school, Durbin started a law practice in Springfield. He was legal counsel to Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon from 1969 to 1972, and then legal counsel to the Illinois State Senate Judiciary Committee from 1972 to 1982. Durbin was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for a seat in the Illinois State Senate in 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=26847 |title=Senator Dick Durbin - Biography - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=1944-11-21 |accessdate=2012-09-15[/tpl] He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1978 as the running mate of State Superintendent of Schools Michael Bakalis. They were defeated by Republican incumbents Jim Thompson and Dave O'Neal. Durbin then worked as an adjunct professor at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine for five years while maintaining his law practice.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1982, Durbin won the Democratic nomination for the now-eliminated 20th congressional district, which included most of Springfield. He scored a huge upset, defeating 22-year incumbent Paul Findley. As part of the decennial redistricting process, Findley's district had been redrawn to include more Democrats. Durbin's campaign emphasized unemployment and financial difficulties facing farmers, and told voters that electing him would send "a message to Washington and to President Reagan that our economic policies are not working." Durbin benefited from donations by pro-Israel groups from around the United States, in particular, concentrated support from AIPAC supporters,The Israel Lobby, pg 157, by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt that had been angered by Findley's support for an American policy of a more equal treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis.[tpl]cite news|last=Findley|first=Paul|title=Liberating America From Israel|url=http://www.mediamonitors.net/findley2.html|accessdate=11 September 2002|newspaper=Media Monitors Network|date=11 September 2002[/tpl] Ultimately, Findley raised more money than Durbin, $582,793 to $417,635 in the year prior to the election. Durbin was reelected six times, rarely facing serious opposition, and winning more than 55% of the vote in each election except 1994.[tpl]cite news|last=Malcolm|first=Andrew|title=The Midwest|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/us/the-midwest.html|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 September 1982[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Clymer|first=Adam|title=Democrats Shaping Election as Referendum on Economy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/us/democrats-shaping-election-as-referendum-on-economy.html?scp=4&sq=Paul%20Findley%20Durbin&st=nyt&pagewanted=1|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 October 1982[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Clymer|first=Adam|title=GOP House Candidates Leading in Fundraising|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/us/gop-house-candidates-leading-in-fund-raising.html?scp=3&sq=Paul+Findley+Durbin&st=nyt|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 October 1982[/tpl]

==U.S. Senate==

In 1996, Durbin defeated Pat Quinn to become the Democratic Party's nominee to replace the retiring Democratic incumbent, Senator Paul Simon, a long-time friend. He faced Republican State Representative Al Salvi in the November general election. Although the election was initially expected to be competitive, Durbin won by a surprising 15-point margin, undoubtedly helped by Bill Clinton's 18-point win in Illinois that year.

Mother Jones has called him a "top Senate liberal."Khimm, Suzy (2010-12-08) Top Senate Liberal Defends Obama on Tax Cuts, Mother Jones His voting record is very similar to the Democratic caucus position, consistent with his leadership position as Whip, which has the duty of persuading senators to follow the party line in their votes.

As a congressman, Durbin voted consistently to uphold pre-existing restrictions on abortion or impose new limitations[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] including supporting a Constitutional amendment that would have nullifed Roe v. Wade.The Durbin Abortion Papers He reversed his position in 1989 and has since voted to maintain access to abortion, including support for Medicaid funding of it, and opposition to any limitation that he considers a practical or potential encroachment upon Roe.Richard Durbin on Abortion Durbin has maintained that this reversal came about as a result of personal reflection and his growing awareness of potentially harmful implications of his previous policy with respect to women facing dangerous pregnancies.Excerpt from NBC News' Meet the Press While visiting a home for abused children in Quincy, Illinois, the director, a friend, asked him to speak with two girls who were about to turn 18 and be turned out of state care. Talking with the girls, victims of gang rape and incest, made him reconsider his position on the subject. He says, "I still oppose abortion and would try my best to convince any woman in my family to carry the baby to term. But I believe that ultimately the decision must be made by the woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience."[tpl]Cite news|last=Parsons|first=Christi|author-link=Christi Parsons|title=Dick Durbin's Challenge|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|pages=15–19, 26–27|date=2007-12-02|postscript=[/tpl]

In 1987, Durbin introduced major tobacco regulation legislation in the House to ban cigarette smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. He was joined by Rep. C. W. Bill Young, a Republican from Florida, in saying that the rights of smokers to smoke end where their smoking affects the health and safety of others, such as on airplanes. The bill went on to pass as part of the 1988 transportation spending bill. In 1989, Congress banned cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights.[tpl]cite news|agency=Associated Press |date=July 15, 1987|title=House Passes Ban on Smoking on Flights of 2 Hours or Less|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED6123DF936A25754C0A961948260&scp=5&sq=durbin+tobacco+airplanes&st=nyt | work=The New York Times[/tpl]
In March 1994, Durbin proposed an amendment to the Improving America's Schools Act that required schools that receive Federal drug prevention money to teach elementary and secondary students about the dangers of tobacco in addition to those of drugs and alcohol.

In February 2008, Durbin called on Congress to support a measure that would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to oversee the tobacco industry. This measure would require companies to disclose the contents of tobacco products, restrict advertising and promotions, and mandate the removal of harmful ingredients in tobacco products. The measure would also prohibit tobacco companies from using terms such as "low risk," "light," and "mild" on packaging.

After several years of voting to keep sugar quotas and price supports, Durbin now favors abolishing the program. "The sugar program depended on congressmen like me from states that grew corn," Durbin said, referring to the fact that, though they were formerly a single entity, the sugar market and the corn syrup market are now largely separate.Congressman Mark Steven Kirk - 10th District of Illinois
In May 2006, Durbin campaigned to maintain a $0.54 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol. Durbin justified the tariff by joining Barack Obama in stating that "ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices," arguing instead that domestic ethanol production is sufficient and expanding.http://harkin.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=255348[tpl]Dead link|url=http://harkin.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=255348|date=July 2009[/tpl] American Coalition for Ethanol gives him a rating of 100%.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Guantanamo interrogation criticism===

Durbin received a lot of media attention on June 14, 2005, when in the U.S. Senate chambers he compared interrogation techniques used at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to those utilized by such regimes as Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Khmer Rouge:
Durbin's comments drew widespread criticism that comparing U.S. actions to such regimes insulted the United States and victims of genocide. Radio host Rush Limbaugh and White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove accused Durbin of treason,Harper's Magazine, Stabbed in the Back!: The past and future of a right-wing myth while former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called on the Senate to censure Durbin.http://www.newt.org/backpage.asp?art=1843[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2009[/tpl] Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, whose son Patrick was serving in U.S. Army, also called on Durbin to apologize for his remarks, saying that he thought it was a "disgrace to say that any man or woman in the military would act like that."Durbin Apologizes for Remarks on Abuse John Wertheim, Democratic state party chairman of New Mexico, and Jim Pederson, Arizona Democratic party chairman, also criticized Durbin's remarks.Durbin's Gitmo remarks draw fire back in Illinois The leader of the Veterans of Foreign Wars also demanded an apology,Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) :: News as did the Anti-Defamation League

Andrew Sullivan, former editor of The New Republic, praised Durbin for raising serious moral issues about U.S. policy.The Daily Dish Other commentators, including liberal commentator Markos Moulitsas Zúniga of Daily Kos, condemned Durbin for apologizing to his critics, arguing Durbin made a mistake in making himself, rather than detention and torture concerns at Guantanamo Bay, the focus of media coverage.CT article ]Daily Kos: Durbin fucked up

===Allegations against Pete Sessions===

In October 2013, Durbin posted a comment on his Facebook page describing an incident in which a Republican congressman told President Barack Obama, "I can't even stand to look at your face." The insult allegedly occurred at the White House during budget negotiations over the government shutdown. The story/rumor spread when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told a Democratic caucus that the remark was made by Texas Congressman Pete Sessions[tpl]cite news|title=Harry Reid Told Caucus That Pete Sessions Was Behind Obama Insult, Senators Say|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/24/harry-reid-pete-sessions_n_4156453.html?ref=topbar|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 24, 2013[/tpl] Both Sessions and the White House denied the exchange took place. Durbin eventually removed the Facebook post. He said he felt the American people understood the controversy arose as the result of a White House miscommunication and was not the fault of his office.
