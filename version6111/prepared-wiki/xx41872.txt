Destiny's Child was an American R&B girl group whose final, and perhaps most recognizable, line-up comprised Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical endeavors as Girl's Tyme comprising, among others,Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) – Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV.com Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. After years of limited success, they were signed in 1996 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the 1999 release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall, which contained the number-one singles "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Say My Name". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.
Both Roberson and Luckett were soon replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, in 2000, Franklin was dismissed, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, Survivor, which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits "Independent Women", "Survivor" and "Bootylicious". In 2002, they announced a hiatus and re-united two years later for the release of their fourth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004). Destiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records worldwide to date.[tpl]cite news|last=Waxman|first=Olivia|title=Beyoncé and Destiny's Child to Release Original Track for First Time in Eight Years|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/11/beyonce-and-destinys-child-to-release-original-track-for-first-time-in-eight-years/|publisher=time.com|accessdate=June 11, 2013|date=2013-01-11[/tpl] Billboard magazine ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time,[tpl]cite web |title=Billboard Greatest Trios of All Time |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/destinys_child.jsp |work=Billboard |accessdate=2008-05-13|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430084937/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/destinys_child.jsp |archivedate = April 30, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/artists-of-the-decade?year=2009&begin=1&order=position|title=Best of the 2000s.

==Recording history==

===1990–97: Early beginnings and Girl's Tyme===

In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while auditioning for a girl group.[tpl]Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl] Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles's house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor.[tpl]Cite video |title=Beyonce: All New |work=E!

He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles's vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong;[tpl]cite news |last=Farley |first=Christopher John |title=Call Of The Child |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998976,00.html |work=Time |date=2001-01-15 |accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] they were actually rapping instead of singing.
Because of the group's defeat, Knowles's father, Mathew, voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them.[tpl]cite web |title=Driven: Beyonce Knowles |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/65240/episode_about.jhtml |work=VH1 |publisher=MTV Networks |accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] Mathew Knowles cut down the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl's Tyme practiced in their backyards and at Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles's mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a "boot camp" to train them in dance and vocal lessons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/jun/10/life1.lifemagazine5|title=Date with destiny|last=Dunn|first=Jancee|date=2001-06-10|work=The Observer|accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London[/tpl] After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R&B groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances.
Over the course of the early years in their career, Girl's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh, Cliché, the Dolls, and to Destiny.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.essence.com/news_entertainment/entertainment/articles/destinyschildsoulsurvivors|title=Destiny's Child: Soul-Survivors|last=Gillings|first=Andrew|date=2001-04-22|work=Essence|accessdate=2009-02-25 | archivedate= October 15, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081015053632/http://www.essence.com/news_entertainment/entertainment/articles/destinyschildsoulsurvivors[/tpl] The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny, but were dropped several months later before they could release an album. The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family: in 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical-equipment salesman, a move that reduced Knowles's family's income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure. In 1996, they finally changed their name to Destiny's Child, which was taken from a passage in the Book of Isaiah. Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records, which signed the group that same year. Prior to signing with Columbia, the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland, California produced by D'wayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni! Toné!, including "Killing Time", which upon the label's recognition that Destiny's Child had a "unique quality", was included in the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[tpl]Cite book |last=Stacy-Deanne |coauthors=Kenyatta, Kelly; Lowery, Natasha |title=Alicia Keys, Ashanti, Beyoncé, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez & Mya: Divas of the New Millennium |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1ZGMcUEvkyEC&pg=PA60 |publisher=Amber Books Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-9749779-6-9 |accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl]

===1998–2000: Breakthrough and lineup changes===

Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album in the United States on February 17, 1998, featuring productions by Tim & Bob, Rob Fusari, Jermaine Dupri, Wyclef Jean, Dwayne Wiggins and Corey Rooney. Destiny's Child peaked at number sixty-seven on the Billboard 200 and number fourteen on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=destiny's child|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Artist Chart History – Destiny's Child|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl] It managed to sell over one million copies in the United States, earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[tpl]cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Destiny%20Child&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold and Platinum|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl] The remix version to the album's lead single, "No, No, No", reached number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Its follow-up single, "With Me Part 1" failed to reproduce the success of "No, No, No". Meanwhile, the group featured on a song from the soundtrack album of the romantic drama Why Do Fools Fall in Love and "Get on the Bus" had a limited release in Europe and other markets. In 1998, Destiny's Child garnered three Soul Train Lady of Soul awards including Best New Artist for "No, No, No". Knowles considered their debut successful but not huge, claiming as a neo soul record it was too mature for the group at the time.[tpl]cite news |last=Anthony |first=James |title='Of course you can lose yourself' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1852025,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2008-05-13 | location=London[/tpl]
After the success of their debut album, Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in a new lineup of producers, including Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs and Rodney Jerkins. Coming up with The Writing's on the Wall, they released it on July 27, 1999 and it eventually became their breakthrough album. The Writing's on the Wall peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and number two on R&B chart in early 2000. "Bills, Bills, Bills" was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single. The Writing's on the Wall has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/aug/18/urban.popandrock|title='Of course you can lose yourself'|last=Flynn|first=Paul|date=2006-08-18|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-02-26 | location=London[/tpl] The main key to the group's breakthrough was the album's third single, "Say My Name", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. The successful release of the singles bolstered the album's sales,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/arts/music-in-tune-with-the-new-feminism.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Destiny's Child: In Tune With the New Feminism|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=2001-04-29|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-01-07[/tpl] eventually selling over eight million copies in the United States, gaining eight-time platinum certification by the RIAA. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and was one of the top-selling albums of 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=About Destiny's Child – MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/destinys-child/biography/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 22, 2014[/tpl]
In December 1999, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland. While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for "Say My Name" surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that two new members were joining Knowles and Rowland. Prior to the video premiere, Knowles announced on TRL that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group. They were replaced by Michelle Williams, a former backup singer to Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress. Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny's Child by choreographer Braden Larson aka "Peanut Orlando", and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family.
In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media. Five months after joining, Franklin left the group. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress. Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision making. Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, shared that her inclusion into the group resulted in "battling insecurity": "I was comparing myself to the other members, and the pressure was on me."
Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they retained one against their manager. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly. Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to record company issues. Although affected by the turmoil, Destiny's Child's success continued. The following years of their career were seen as the group's most successful stretch, becoming a pop culture phenomenon. "Say My Name" became their second number-one and biggest single to date. The fourth single from The Writing's on the Wall, "Jumpin', Jumpin'", also became a top-ten hit. During this time, Destiny's Child began performing as an opening act at the concerts of pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
With Williams in the new lineup, Destiny's Child recorded a theme song for the soundtrack to the film version of Charlie's Angels. Released as a single in October 2000, "Independent Women Part 1" spent eleven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 from November 2000 to January 2001, the longest-running number-one single of Destiny's Child's career and of that year in the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64057/chart-beat-bonus|title=Chart Beat Bonus: Endless Love|date=2005-02-18|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl] [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl] The successful release of the single boosted the sales of the soundtrack album to Charlie's Angels to 1.5 million by 2001. In 2000, Destiny's Child won Soul Train's Sammy Davis Jr. Entertainer of the Year award.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Destiny's Child canceled a European tour and performed in a concert benefit for the survivors.

Also in 2001, Destiny's Child sang backup vocals for Solange Knowles, who was the lead, on the theme song to the animated Disney Channel series The Proud Family. In March 2002, a remix compilation titled This Is the Remix was released to win fans over before a new studio album would be released.[tpl]Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |title=Destiny's Child Groove On 'Remix' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76898/destinys-child-groove-on-remix |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=2002-02-05 |accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] The remix album reached number 29 in the United States. The lead single and Grammy-winning song "Survivor" was by some interpreted as a response to the strife between the band members, although Knowles claimed it was not directed at anybody. Seeing it as a breach of the agreement that barred each party from public disparagement, Roberson and Luckett once again filed a lawsuit against Destiny's Child and Sony Music, shortly following the release of This Is the Remix. In June 2002, remaining cases were settled in court.

Knowles stated that their destinies were already fulfilled. The group exclusively sent a letter to MTV about the decision:
 
 We have been working together as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussion and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies.

In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, "is the way its melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses."[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E6DE1E3FF932A3575BC0A9639C8B63&fta=y&scp=36&sq=Destiny%27s%20child&st=cse|title=Pop Review; Empowerment, Allure And a Runway's Flair |last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2005-08-01|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-27[/tpl] The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In Survivor, each members sings lead in the majority of the album: "... everybody is a part of the music ... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443010/20010420/destinys_child.jhtml|title='Bootylicious' Destiny's Child Sample Stevie Nicks, More On Survivor|last=Basham|first=David|date=2001-04-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-26[/tpl] Knowles, however, completely led songs like "Brown Eyes" and "Dangerously in Love". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, and sisterhood and female empowerment anthems.
Survivor contains themes interpreted by the public as a reference to the group's internal conflict. The title track, "Survivor", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio ... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family ... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine" caused LaTavia and LeToya Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot, ... We went through our drama with the members ... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better." In another song called "Fancy", which contains the lyrics "You always tried to compete with me, girl ... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, as a response to the lawsuit.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,108583,00.html|title=Survivor (2008): Destiny's Child|last=Browne|first=David|date=2001-05-07|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2009-02-26[/tpl] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic summarized Survivor as "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife. ...

Destiny's Child were compared to The Supremes, a 1960's American female singing group, with Knowles being compared to Supremes frontwoman Diana Ross; Knowles, however, has dismissed the notion. Coincidentally, Knowles starred in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls as Deena Jones, the front woman of the Dreams, a female singing group based on the Supremes. With Knowles' wide role assumed in the production of Survivor, Gil Kaufman of MTV noted that "it became clear that Beyoncé was emerging as DC's unequivocal musical leader and public face". Her dominance to the creative input in the album made the album "very much her work". For Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times, "It's been a long-held belief in the music industry that Destiny's Child was little more than a launching pad for Beyoncé Knowles's inevitable solo career."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/14ogun.html|title=Beyoncé's Second Date With Destiny's Child|last=Ogunnaike|first=Lola|date=2004-11-14|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-27[/tpl]
