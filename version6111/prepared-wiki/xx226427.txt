Aall is a prominent Norwegian family, originally from Aal in Jutland (Denmark). The family's oldest known ancestor is SÃ¸ren Nielsen, who was a peasant in Aal until 1534, when he lost his farm. The family immigrated to Norway in 1714 with Niels Aall the older, who became a merchant and ship-owner in Porsgrunn. The family was part of the Patriciate of Norway from the 18th century.
