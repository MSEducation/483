[[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]

CATEGORIES: Hormonal contraception, Sexual revolution, Counterculture of the 1960s

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth-control pill or colloquially as  "the pill", is a birth control method that includes a combination of an estrogen (estradiol) and a progestogen (progestin). When taken by mouth every day, these pills inhibit female fertility. They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Mosher WD, Martinez GM, Chandra A, Abma JC, Willson SJ |year=2004 |title=Use of contraception and use of family planning services in the United States: 1982–2002 |journal=Adv Data |issue=350 |pages=1–36 |pmid=15633582 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad350.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] all US women aged 15–44 Use varies widely by country,

==Medical use==

Combined oral contraceptive pills should be taken at the same time each day. If one or more tablets are forgotten for more than 12 hours, contraceptive protection will be reduced.
[tpl]cite web|author=Organon |date=November 2001 |title=Mercilon SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics |url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=5384 |accessdate=2007-04-07[/tpl] Most brands of combined pills are packaged in one of two different packet sizes, with days marked off for a 28 day cycle. For the 21-pill packet, a pill is consumed daily for three weeks, followed by a week of no pills. For the 28-pill packet, 21 pills are taken, followed by week of placebo or sugar pills. A woman on the pill will have a withdrawal bleed sometime during the placebo week, and is still protected from pregnancy during this week. There are also two newer combination birth control pills (Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) that have 24 days of active hormone pills, followed by 4 days of placebo.Stacey, Dawn. Birth Control Pills. Retrieved July 20, 2009.

===Placebo pills===

The placebo pills allow the user to take a pill every day; remaining in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Placebo pills may contain an iron supplement,[tpl]cite web |title = US Patent:Oral contraceptive:Patent 6451778 Issued on September 17, 2002 Estimated Expiration Date: July 2, 2017. |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6451778/description.html |publisher= PatentStorm LLC |accessdate=2010-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Iron deficiency in Europe |author=Serge Herceberg | author2=Paul Preziosi |author3=Pilar Galan |url=http://www.idpas.org/pdf/1174IronDeficiencyinEurope.pdf |journal=Public Health Nutrition: 4(2B) |pages=537–545 |accessdate=2010-11-19[/tpl] as iron requirements increase during menstruation.
Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.
The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills was thought to be comforting, as a physical confirmation of not being pregnant.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Gladwell | first = Malcolm | title = John Rock's Error | journal = The New Yorker | date = 2000-03-10 | url= http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm | accessdate=2009-02-04[/tpl] The 28-day pill package also simulates the average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. The pill suppresses the normal cycle, and the withdrawal bleeding occurs while the placebo pills are taken. The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.[tpl]cite web|last=Mayo Clinic staff|title=Birth control pill FAQ: Benefits, risks and choices|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-control-pill/WO00098|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]

===Less frequent placebos===

If the pill formulation is monophasic, it is possible to skip withdrawal bleeding and still remain protected against conception by skipping the placebo pills and starting directly with the next packet. Attempting this with bi- or tri-phasic pill formulations carries an increased risk of breakthrough bleeding and may be undesirable. It will not, however, increase the risk of getting pregnant.
Starting in 2003, women have also been able to use a three-month version of the Pill.
[tpl]cite web| author = FDA |title=FDA Approves Seasonal Oral Contraceptive |work=|publisher=|date=2003-09-25 |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html |accessdate=2006-11-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061007101134/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html  |archivedate = 2006-10-07[/tpl] Similar to the effect of using a constant-dosage formulation and skipping the placebo weeks for three months, Seasonale gives the benefit of less frequent periods, at the potential drawback of breakthrough bleeding. Seasonique is another version in which the placebo week every three months is replaced with a week of low-dose estrogen.
A version of the combined pill has also been packaged to completely eliminate placebo pills and withdrawal bleeds. Marketed as Anya or Lybrel, studies have shown that after seven months, 71% of users no longer had any breakthrough bleeding, the most common side effect of going longer periods of time without breaks from active pills.

===Effectiveness===

According to James Trussell's Contraceptive Efficacy chapter in the current (2011) edition of Contraceptive Technology, the estimated probability of pregnancy during the first year of perfect use of pill is 0.3%, and the estimated probability of pregnancy during the first year of typical use of the pill is 9%. The perfect use failure rate is based on a review of pregnancy rates in clinical trials of the pill, the typical use failure rate is based on a weighted average of estimates from the 1995 and 2002 U.S. National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), corrected for underreporting of abortions.
Several factors account for typical use effectiveness being lower than perfect use effectiveness:
For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, or by mistake not take the pill one day, or simply not go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription.
COCPs provide effective contraception from the very first pill if started within five days of the beginning of the menstrual cycle (within five days of the first day of menstruation). If started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs provide effective contraception only after 7 consecutive days use of active pills, so a backup method of contraception must be used until active pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days. COCPs should be taken at approximately the same time every day.

Contraceptive efficacy may be impaired by: 1) missing more than one active pill in a packet, 2) delay in starting the next packet of active pills (i.e., extending the pill-free, inactive or placebo pill period beyond 7 days), 3) intestinal malabsorption of active pills due to vomiting or diarrhea, 4) drug interactions with active pills that decrease contraceptive estrogen or progestogen levels.

===Non-contraceptive use===

The hormones in "the Pill" have also been used to treat other medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, amenorrhea, menstrual cramps, adenomyosis, menorrhagia (excessive menstral bleeding), menstruation-related anemia and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).[tpl]cite web|last=CYWH Staff|title=Medical Uses of the Birth Control Pill|url=http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/med-uses-ocp.html|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]  Though extensively used for these conditions, no oral contraceptives have been approved by the U.S. FDA for those uses because of lack of convincing scientific evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] In addition, oral contraceptives are sometimes prescribed as medication for mild or moderate acne, although none are approved by the U.S. FDA for that sole purpose.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2005.07.010 |title=Treating acne with oral contraceptives: Use of lower doses |year=2006 |last1=Huber |first1=Johannes |last2=Walch |first2=Katharina |journal=Contraception |volume=73|pages=23–9 |pmid=16371290 |issue=1[/tpl] Three different oral contraceptives have been FDA approved to treat moderate acne if the person is at least 14 or 15 years old, have already begun menstruating, and need contraception.  They include Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Estrostep, and YAZ.[tpl]cite web|last=Chang, MD|first=Louise|title=Birth Control of Acne|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/birth-control-for-acne-treatment|publisher=WebMD, LLC|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]   Although the pill is sometimes prescribed to induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles, it actually suppresses the normal menstrual cycle and then mimics a regular 28-day monthly cycle, as noted earlier in this article.

==Drug interactions==

Some drugs reduce the effect of the Pill and can cause breakthrough bleeding, or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin and carbamazepine. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin and doxycycline, which may cause problems "by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel" (BNF 2003).
The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on Combined contraceptive pills is not found on systematic interaction metanalysis (Archer, 2002), although "individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol when they take certain other antibiotics" (Dickinson, 2001). "...experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction" (DeRossi, 2002) and this remains current (2006) UK Family Planning Association advice.

The traditional medicinal herb St John's Wort has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the P450 system in the liver.

==Common side effects==

Different sources note different incidences of side effects. The most common side effect is breakthrough bleeding. A 1992 French review article said that as many as 50% of new first-time users discontinue the birth control pill before the end of the first year because of the annoyance of side effects such as breakthrough bleeding and amenorrhea.[ref][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01849448 |title=Medical aspects of oral contraceptive discontinuation |year=1992 |last1=Serfaty |first1=D. |journal=Advances in Contraception |volume=8 |pages=21[/tpl]

==Major side effects==

It is generally accepted by medical authorities that the health risks of oral contraceptives are lower than those from pregnancy and birth,[tpl]Cite book| author=Crooks, Robert L. and Karla Baur | title=Our Sexuality | year=2005 | publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA | isbn=0-534-65176-3[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] and "the health benefits of any method of contraception are far greater than any risks from the method".WHO (2005). Decision-Making Tool for Family Planning Clients and Providers Appendix 10: Myths about contraception Some organizations have argued that comparing a contraceptive method to no method (pregnancy) is not relevant—instead, the comparison of safety should be among available methods of contraception.[tpl]cite web|last=Holck |first=Susan |title=Contraceptive Safety |work=Special Challenges in Third World Women's Health |publisher=1989 Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association |url=http://www.users.interport.net/i/w/iwhc/sc_cs.html |accessdate=2006-10-07 [/tpl]

===Venous thromboembolism===

Combined oral contraceptives increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (including deep vein thrombosis DVT and pulmonary embolism PE).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1586/erc.09.175 |title=Venous thromboembolism in women taking hormonal contraceptives |year=2010 |last1=Blanco-Molina |first1=Ángeles |last2=Monreal |first2=Manuel |journal=Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=211–5 |pmid=20136607[/tpl] These blood clots can cause permanent disability or death.

The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100.000 woman years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared to 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone 1.88. In comparison, venous thromboembolism occurs in 100–200 per 100.000 pregnant women every year.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmt028[/tpl]
One study showed more than a 600% increased risk of blood clots for women taking COCPs with drospirenone compared to non-users, compared to 360% higher for women taking birth control pills containing  levonorgestrel.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lidegaard|first=O.|coauthors=Milsom, Geirsson, Skjeldestad|title=Hormonal Contraception and venous thromboembolism|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|year=2012|volume=91|pages=796-788|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01444.x|accessdate=22 October 2012[/tpl]  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated studies evaluating the health of more than 800,000 women taking COCPs and found that the risk of VTE was 93% higher for women who had been taking drospirenone COCPs for 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking drospirenone COCPs for 7–12 months, compared to women taking other types of oral contraceptives.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dunn|first=N|title=The risk of deep venous thrombosis with oral contraceptives containing drospirenone.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Apr 21, 2011|volume=342|pages=d2519|pmid=21511807|doi=10.1136/bmj.d2519[/tpl]

===Cancer===

A systematic review in 2010 did not support an increased overall cancer risk in users of combined oral contraceptive pills, but did find a slight increase in breast cancer risk among current users, which disappears 5–10 years after use has stopped.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq022[/tpl]

====Protective effects====

COC decrease the risk of ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer,
 and colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite journal| last1 = Senn| first1 = Hansjörg| last2 = Kapp| first2 = Ursula| last4 = Hernandez| first4 = Mary A.| last5 = Daley| first5 = Mary| last6 = Ozols| first6 = Robert| last7 = Lu| first7 = Karen| last8 = Lu| first8 = Zhen| last9 = Badgwell| first9 = Donna| title = Prevention and early detection of ovarian cancer: mission impossible?| series = Recent Results in Cancer Research| volume = 174| year = 2007| isbn = 978-3-540-37695-8| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-37696-5_9| pages = 91–100| journal = Recent Results Cancer Res.| pmid = 17302189 [/tpl] Two large cohort studies published in 2010 both found a significant reduction in adjusted relative risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer mortality in ever-users of OCs compared to never-users.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Hannaford|first1=Philip C.|last2=Iversen|first2=Lisa|last3=Macfarlane|first3=Tatiana V.|last4=Elliot|first4=Alison|last5=Angus|first5=Valerie|last6=Lee|first6=Amanda J.|date=March 11, 2010|title=Mortality among contraceptive pill users: cohort evidence from Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study|journal=BMJ|volume=340|page=c927|doi=10.1136/bmj.c927|pmc=2837145|pmid=20223876[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Vessey|first1=Martin|last2=Yeates|first2=David|last3=Flynn|first3=Susan|date=September 2010|title=Factors affecting mortality in a large cohort study with special reference to oral contraceptive use|journal=Contraception|volume=82|issue=3|pages=221–229|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2010.04.006|pmid=20705149[/tpl]
The use of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) for five years or more decreases the risk of ovarian cancer in later life by 50%.  Combined oral contraceptive use reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 40% and the risk of endometrial cancer by 50% compared to never users. The risk reduction increases with duration of use, with an 80% reduction in risk for both ovarian and endometrial cancer with use for more than 10 years. The risk reduction for both ovarian and endometrial cancer persists for at least 20 years.

====Increased risks====

A report by a 2005 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) working group said COCs increase the risk of cancers of the breast (among current and recent users), cervix and liver (among populations at low risk of hepatitis B virus infection). Two large cohort studies published in 2010 both found no significant increase in adjusted relative risk of breast cancer mortality in ever-users of OCs compared to never-users.
Research into the relationship between breast cancer risk and hormonal contraception is complex and seemingly contradictory.

A large 1996 collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found that: "The results provide strong evidence for two main conclusions. First, while women are taking combined oral contraceptives and in the 10 years after stopping there is a small increase in the relative risk of having breast cancer diagnosed. Second, there is no significant excess risk of having breast cancer diagnosed 10 or more years after stopping use. The cancers diagnosed in women who had used combined oral contraceptives were less advanced clinically than those diagnosed in women who had never used these contraceptives."

A 2011 Cochrane systematic review found that studies of combination hormonal contraceptives showed no large difference in weight when compared with placebo or no intervention groups.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gallo|first=MF|coauthors=Lopez LM, Grimes DA, Schulz KF, Helmerhorst FM.|title=Combination contraceptives: effects on weight|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|date=7 Sep 2011|issue=9|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003987.pub4|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012456/|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] The evidence was not strong enough to be certain that contraceptive methods do not cause some weight change, but no major effect was found.

COCPs may increase natural vaginal lubrication.

===Depression===

Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, have been linked to depression. High levels of estrogen, as in first-generation COCPs, and progestin, as in some progestin-only contraceptives, have been shown to promote the lowering of brain serotonin levels by increasing the concentration of a brain enzyme that reduces serotonin. This observation, along with some small research studies

===Hypertension===

Bradykinin lowers blood pressure by causing blood vessel dilation.  Certain enzymes are capable of breaking down bradykinin (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Aminopeptidase P).  Progesterone can increase the levels of Aminopeptidase P (AP-P), thereby increasing the breakdown of bradykinin, which increases the risk of developing hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1177/1470320308096405 |title=The bradykinin-degrading aminopeptidase P is increased in women taking the oral contraceptive pill |year=2008 |last1=La Corte |first1=A.

===Mortality===

Two large cohort studies published in 2010 both found a significant reduction in adjusted relative risk of all-cause mortality in ever-users of OCs compared to never-users.

===Other effects===

Other side effects associated with low-dose COCPs are leukorrhea (increased vaginal secretions), reductions in menstrual flow, mastalgia (breast tenderness), and decrease in acne. Side effects associated with older high-dose COCPs include nausea, vomiting, increases in blood pressure, and melasma (facial skin discoloration); these effects are not strongly associated with low-dose formulations.

Combined oral contraception decreases total testosterone levels by approximately 0.5 nmol/l, free testosterone by approximately 60%, and increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by approximately 100 nmol/l. Contraceptives containing second generation progestins and/or estrogen doses of around 20 –25 mg EE were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmt038[/tpl]

==Contraindications==

Combined oral contraceptives are generally accepted to be contraindicated in women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, in women who have a familial tendency to form blood clots (such as familial factor V Leiden), women with severe obesity and/or hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol level), and in smokers over age 40.
COC are also contraindicated for women with liver tumors, hepatic adenoma or severe cirrhosis of the liver, those who have migraine with aura and for those with known or suspected breast cancer.   (WHO category 4).

==Mechanism of action==

Combined oral contraceptive pills were developed to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. Combined hormonal contraceptives, including COCPs, inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.[tpl]cite book| last1 = Nelson| first1 = Anita L.| last2 = Cwiak| first2 = Carrie| editor1-last = Hatcher| editor1-first = Robert A.| editor2-last = Trussell| editor2-first = James| editor3-last = Nelson| editor3-first = Anita L.| editor4-last = Cates| editor4-first = Willard Jr.| editor5-last = Kowal| editor5-first = Deborah| editor6-last = Policar| editor6-first = Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen. Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.

Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and greatly decreases the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH secretion prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.
Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the secretion of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.
Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration through the cervix into the upper genital tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) by decreasing the water content and increasing the viscosity of the cervical mucus.
The estrogen and progestogen in COCPs have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:
Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during COCP use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of COCPs.

==Formulations==

Oral contraceptives come in a variety of formulations. The main division is between combined oral contraceptive pills, containing both estrogen and progestins and progestin only pills. Combined oral contraceptive pills also come in varying types, including varying doses of estrogen, and whether the dose of estrogen or progestin changes from one week to the next.

==History==

By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the steroid hormones and found that high doses of androgens, estrogens or progesterone inhibited ovulation,

In 1939, Russell Marker, a professor of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and the period of the heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.

Midway through 20th century, the stage was set for the development of a hormonal contraceptive, but pharmaceutical companies, universities and governments showed no interest in pursuing research.

===Studies of progesterone to prevent ovulation===

In early 1951, reproductive physiologist Gregory Pincus, a leader in hormone research and co-founder of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, first met American birth control movement founder Margaret Sanger at a Manhattan dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, medical director and vice president of Planned Parenthood (PPFA), who helped Pincus obtain a small grant from PPFA to begin hormonal contraceptive research. Research started on April 25, 1951 with reproductive physiologist Min Chueh Chang repeating and extending the 1937 experiments of Makepeace et al. that showed injections of progesterone suppressed ovulation in rabbits. In October 1951, G. D. Searle & Company refused Pincus' request to fund his hormonal contraceptive research, but retained him as a consultant and continued to provide chemical compounds to evaluate.

In March 1952, Sanger wrote a brief note mentioning Pincus' research to her longtime friend and supporter, suffragist and philanthropist Katharine Dexter McCormick, who visited the WFEB and its co-founder and old friend Hudson Hoagland in June 1952 to learn about contraceptive research there. Frustrated when research stalled from PPFA's lack of interest and meager funding, McCormick arranged a meeting at the WFEB on June 6, 1953 with Sanger and Hoagland, where she first met Pincus who committed to dramatically expand and accelerate research with McCormick providing fifty times PPFA's previous funding.

Pincus and McCormick enlisted Harvard clinical professor of gynecology John Rock, chief of gynecology at the Free Hospital for Women and an expert in the treatment of infertility, to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory "pseudo-pregnancy" state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of estrogen (diethylstilbestrol 5–30 mg/day) and progesterone (50–300 mg/day) and within the following four months an encouraging 15% became pregnant.

In 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory "pseudo-pregnancy" state in twenty-seven of his infertility patients with an oral 300 mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from cycle days 5–24 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding. This produced the same encouraging 15% pregnancy rate during the following four months without the troubling amenorrhea of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced breakthrough bleeding and in the first cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation.

===Studies of progestins to prevent ovulation===

Pincus asked his contacts at pharmaceutical companies to send him chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's norethindrone and Searle's norethynodrel and norethandrolone.
[tpl]Cite journal|author=Chang MC |year=1978 |title=Development of the oral contraceptives |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=217–9 |pmid=356615[/tpl]
Chemists Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City had synthesized the first orally highly active progestin norethindrone in 1951. Chemist Frank B. Colton at Searle in Skokie, Illinois had synthesized the orally highly active progestins norethynodrel (an isomer of norethindrone) in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.

In December 1954, Rock began the first studies of the ovulation-suppressing potential of 5–50 mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethindrone or norethynodrel 5 mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10 mg and higher doses of norethindrone or norethynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding and led to a 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's norethynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethindrone's very slight androgenicity in animal tests.

===Development of an effective combined oral contraceptive===

Norethynodrel (and norethindrone) were subsequently discovered to be contaminated with a small percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the norethynodrel in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying norethynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956. The norethynodrel and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name Enovid.

====United States====

On June 10, 1957, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Enovid 10 mg (9.85 mg norethynodrel and 150 µg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, based on data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5 mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, Searle filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5 mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10 mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10 mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.

Although FDA-approved for contraceptive use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10 mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, on February 15, 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5 mg for contraceptive use. In July 1961, Searle finally began marketing Enovid 5 mg (5 mg norethynodrel and 75 µg mestranol) to physicians as a contraceptive.

Although the FDA approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960, contraceptives were not available to married women in all states until Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 and were not available to unmarried women in all states until Eisenstadt v. Baird in 1972.

The first published case report of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10 mg in the U.S.) at a dose of 20 mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women.

 These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson.

 Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent.

====Australia====

The first oral contraceptive introduced outside the United States was Schering's Anovlar (norethindrone acetate 4 mg + ethinyl estradiol 50 µg) on January 1, 1961 in Australia.

====Britain====

Before the mid-1960s, the United Kingdom did not require pre-marketing approval of drugs. The British Family Planning Association (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider of family planning services in Britain and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934). In 1957, Searle began marketing Enavid (Enovid 10 mg in the U.S.) for menstrual disorders. Also in 1957, the FPA established a Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control (CIFC) to test and monitor oral contraceptives which began animal testing of oral contraceptives and in 1960 and 1961 began three large clinical trials in Birmingham, Slough, and London.

====France====

On December 28, 1967, the Neuwirth Law legalized contraception in France, including the pill.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Dourlen Rollier, AV|title=Contraception: yes, but|journal=Fertilite, orthogenie|year=1972|volume=4|issue=4|pmid=12306278|pages=185–8[/tpl] The pill is the most popular form of contraception in France, especially among young women. It accounts for 60% of the birth control used in France. The abortion rate has remained stable since the introduction of the pill.[tpl]cite web|title=The Aids Generation: the pill takes priority?|publisher=Science Actualities|year=2000|accessdate=2006-09-07|url=http://www.cite-sciences.fr/francais/ala_cite/science_actualites/sitesactu/question_actu.php?langue=an&id_article=263[/tpl]

====Japan====

In Japan, lobbying from the Japan Medical Association prevented the Pill from being approved for nearly 40 years. Two main objections raised by the association were safety concerns over long-term use of the Pill, and concerns that the Pill use would lead to diminished use of condoms and thereby potentially increase sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates.
[tpl]cite press release |title=Djerassi on birth control in Japan - abortion 'yes,' pill 'no'|publisher=Stanford University News Service |date=96-14-02|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/96/960214japanabort.html|accessdate=2006-08-23 [/tpl] As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparatively low rates of AIDS.
The Pill was approved for use in June 1999. According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28 million Japanese females use the Pill, compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. The Pill prescription guidelines the government endorsed require Pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for Pill users. However, as far back as 2007, many Japanese OBGYNs now only require a yearly visit for pill users, with the tri-annual visits only recommended to those who are older or at increased risk of side effects.

==Society and culture==

The Pill was approved by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. Time magazine placed the pill on its cover in April, 1967.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101670407,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Pill |publisher=Time.com |date=April 7, 1967 |accessdate=2010-03-20[/tpl] In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take the Pill was a private one. This combination of factors served to make the Pill immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.
Claudia Goldin, among others, argue that this new contraceptive technology was a key player in forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence Katz |year=2002 |title=The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women's Career and Marriage Decisions |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=730–770 |doi=10.1086/340778[/tpl] From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.
Because the Pill was so effective, and soon so widespread, it also heightened the debate about the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae Vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex.[tpl]Cite book| author=George Weigel | title=The Courage to Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Renewal of the Church | year=2002 | publisher=Basic Books[/tpl]
The United States Senate began hearings on the Pill in 1970 and there were different viewpoints heard from medical professionals. Dr. Michael Newton, President of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:
 
 "The evidence is not yet clear that these still do in fact cause cancer or related to it. The FDA Advisory Committee made comments about this, that if there wasn't enough evidence to indicate whether or not these pills were related to the development of cancer, and I think that's still thin; you have to be cautious about them, but I don't think there is clear evidence, either one way or the other, that they do or don't cause cancer."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title |title=1970 Year in Review |work=UPI[/tpl]

Another physician, Dr. Roy Hertz of the Population Council, said that anyone who takes this should know of "our knowledge and ignorance in these matters" and that all women should be made aware of this so she can decide to take the Pill or not.
The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare at the time, Robert Finch announced the federal government had accepted a compromise warning statement which would accompany all sales of birth control pills.
At the same time, society was beginning to take note of the impact of the Pill on traditional gender roles. Women now did not have to choose between a relationship and a career; singer Loretta Lynn commented on this in her 1974 album with a song entitled "The Pill", which told the story of a married woman's use of the drug to liberate herself from her traditional role as wife and mother.
According to writer Margaret Wente, "The pill decoupled sex and marriage, and it also decoupled marriage and procreation. The purpose of marriage was mutual satisfaction, not children, and once that happened, gay marriage probably became inevitable."Margaret Wente (2004) An Accidental Canadian, p 38, HarperCollins ISBN 0-00-200798-3
