[[Assassination market]]

CATEGORIES: Crypto-anarchism, Prediction markets

An assassination market or market for assassinations is a prediction market where any party can place a bet (using anonymous electronic money, and pseudonymous remailers) on the date of death of a given individual, and collect a payoff if they "guess" the date accurately. This would incentivise assassination of individuals because the assassin, knowing when the action would take place, could profit by making an accurate bet on the time of the subject's death. Because the payoff is for knowing the date rather than performing the action of the assassin, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination.[tpl]Cite book |title=Lost in Cyburbia |first=James |last=Harkin |year=2009 |page=239 |publisher= |isbn= [/tpl]
Early uses of the terms "assassination market" and "market for assassinations" can be found (in both positive and negative lights) in 1994's "The Cyphernomicon"[tpl]cite web |title=The Cyphernomicon: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666|last=May |first=Timothy C. |date=September 10, 1994 |url= http://www.cypherpunks.to/faq/cyphernomicron/cyphernomicon.html |pages=Sections 4 & 16 |work=Cypherpunks.to |accessdate=February 28, 2011[/tpl] by Timothy C. May, a cypherpunk. The concept and its potential effects are also referred to as assassination politics, a term popularized by Jim Bell in his 1995-96 essay of the same name.[tpl]cite web |last=Bell |first=Jim |title=Assassination Politics |url= http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/AP.pdf |date=April 3, 1997 |work=Infowar |accessdate=February 28, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110127224301/http://jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/AP.pdf| archivedate= 27 January 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=Crypto-Convict Won't Recant |url= http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35620 |work=Wired News |date=April 14, 2000 |accessdate=January 14, 2008 [/tpl]
In Part 10 of his essay Bell posits a market that is largely not-anonymous. He contrasts this version with the one previously described. Carl Johnson's attempt to popularise the concept of assassination politics appeared to rely on the earlier version. ( CJ files http://parrhesia.com/cj/ )
There followed an attempt to popularise the second in 2001 that is ongoing today ( http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/05/43771 and http://www.lair.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2003-July/023219.html )The feasibility of assassination markets as a tactic of radical civil-disobedience has been established.
Technologies like Tor and Bitcoin have enabled online assassination markets as described in parts one to nine of " Assassination Politics". One was created by a self-described "crypto-anarchist".[tpl]cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|title=Meet the 'Assassination Market' creator who's crowdfunding murder with Bitcoins|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/18/meet-the-assassination-market-creator-whos-crowdfunding-murder-with-bitcoins/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=18 November 2013[/tpl] The first assassination market that adopted a Jim Bell protocol became available in autumn 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] It remains a continuous project called ' APster' which is a name that was used quite often by various cypherpunks ( archives http://cypherpunks.venona.com/ )
