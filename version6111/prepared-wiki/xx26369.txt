==History==

The Aviators franchise was relocated from Chillicothe, Ohio, where they were known as the Chillicothe Paints, to Rockford in time for the 2011 season after the former Rockford RiverHawks franchise moved to the Northern League in 2010 and folded following that season. The club operated as the RiverHawks for 2011 and 2012 before changing the name to Aviators.
The Rockford Aviators (including years as the Chillicothe Paints) have been to six league championship series, but have yet to win a Frontier League Championship.
