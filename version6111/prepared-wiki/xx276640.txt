==Plot==

The second season, while still comedic, has a much darker tone, as Nancy becomes increasingly involved in the more dangerous aspects of the drug world. In season 2, Silas is 16 years old and Shane is 11. Ignoring Heylia's advice, Nancy and Conrad start their own small-scale growing operation and eventually rent a suburban "grow-house" â€” a place where they can grow marijuana indoors using artificial light and hydroponics. She welcomes other people into her business, including her brother-in-law Andy and accountant (and customer) Doug. During this season, Peter Scottson tells Nancy he knows she is a drug dealer, but considers her too small time to be worth busting, and the two are married as part of a deal to legally protect Nancy from Peter testifying in a court of law. While Nancy's drug activities increase, Celia runs for, and wins, Doug's spot on the town council. Her victory is due to the incompetence of her husband Dean (a lawyer), who forgot to file Doug's paperwork, leaving him off the ballot. She immediately launches a drug-free campaign across Agrestic complete with drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras. Doug and Celia share a strong desire for revenge on Dean, which inspires a brief sexual liaison.
Silas and Megan's relationship threatens to split apart once she leaves for college (she, a very serious student, has gotten into Princeton, while mediocre student Silas is going to a local school). Silas attempts to get her pregnant to prevent this, but instead his success leads to her parents forcing her to have an abortion and a violent confrontation with Megan's father, ending the relationship. Andy tries to develop a relationship with an attractive, sexually formidable administrator, Yael Hoffman, at his rabbinical school, but the relationship falls apart once he tells her he is planning to drop out, due to an incident at the grow house where a dog bites off two of his toes, which he thinks will invalidate him from his military obligation.
As the season progresses, Nancy's children become more aware of her illegal activities, though the two sons deal with the issue in quite different ways. Shane continues to have problems fitting in at school and his friends begin to ridicule him for his sexual inexperience, though being hypocritical. To resolve the problem, his uncle Andy takes him to a massage parlor to get a "happy ending" hand job. Gaining confidence, Shane joins the debate team to get closer to Gretchen (a girl Shane kicked in the hallway), who later becomes his girlfriend. However, he later breaks up with her because of an infatuation with Andy's estranged ex-girlfriend, Kat. Silas, on the other hand, takes out his frustrations by committing acts of vandalism, most notably stealing Celia's drug-free zone signs and cameras, which he sees as helping his mother. Meanwhile, Nancy has received threats from an Armenian group of dealers who have grow houses all around hers and see her as encroaching on their territory. Nancy tells Peter, and he has them all arrested.
Nancy and Conrad's drug business becomes a hit as Conrad's strain of plant (which Snoop Dogg dubs "MILFweed" during a chance meeting at a recording studio) pleases their customers; but their high profile causes trouble. With their "drug" doing so well, Nancy and Conrad get intimate. Initially, Nancy's marriage to a DEA agent keeps her on top while her Armenian rivals were busted, but her marriage to Peter deteriorates after she tips off Heylia when the DEA plans to raid her house and Peter pressures her to quit dealing. For Nancy, the final straw is when Peter comes over for dinner and manhandles Silas. Nancy calls Conrad and tells him that she doesn't love Peter but will string him along until the current harvest is done; Peter hears the conversation with wireless surveillance. Meanwhile, Doug and Celia plan to leave their spouses. Celia tells Dean, but Doug refuses to leave his wife, Dana, stating that "she's a sweetheart" and their affair ends. Dean kicks Celia out of the house and demands a divorce.
The season concludes with a complex series of betrayals, as Peter demands of Nancy and Conrad all of the cash from a quick sale of their crop. Heylia hires Armenian mobsters to kill Peter, as she believes Peter is planning to kill Conrad after the deal. Nancy's buyer, U-Turn (Page Kennedy), demands the entire crop of weed at gunpoint. The Armenian mobsters arrive at the same time, kill Peter, and expect the proceeds from the big sale to pay for their hit. When they realize that U-Turn plans on stealing the weed and therefore there is no money, they decide to take the weed instead. Only then does Nancy discover that Silas has stolen the entire batch of weed, in order to hold it hostage until his mother cedes to his demands to be part of the business. Minutes after hiding the batch in his car trunk, he is approached by Celia and a police officer for the theft of the drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras, because Celia has footage of Silas stealing the last camera. This leaves Nancy at the grow house, in a Mexican standoff with both the gangsters and the mobsters pointing guns at her in a season-ending cliffhanger.
