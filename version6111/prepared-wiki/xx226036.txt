Initially, Oscar joined Internacional after a contractual dispute with his former club São Paulo, with Oscar's agent claiming that the club had not paid salaries as promised. Oscar's representatives argued that his contract with São Paulo was null and void whereupon Oscar joined Internacional as a free agent. São Paulo continued to claim that Oscar belonged to them and lodged legal appeals which prevented Oscar from playing for Inter in vital [[CoMdldd
Ds nlpa Libertadores]] fixtures. Eventually, a settlement was agreed upon between São Paulo and Internacional on 30 May 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jul/19/london-2012-chelsea-oscar-brazil|title=London 2012: Chelsea-bound Oscar the brains of Brazil's Olympic team|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012|first=David|last=Hytner|date=19 July 2012[/tpl] Oscar's first season at Internacional was blighted by injury.

As a playmaker, Oscar has great vision and is able to deliver the precise pass to his teammates. Oscar is extremely effective in building up play in areas higher up the pitch and his cunning runs as well as skillful short range passing make him a threat in and near the opponent's box. Although he typically played in central attacking midfield for Internacional, since his transfer to Chelsea, Oscar has been deployed as the main creator behind the striker. Known for his vision for picking out teammates in tight positions and carving out chances in difficult situations, Oscar acts as the catalyst in Chelsea's attack, and was widely praised for his role in the team's Europa League success in 2013. Under José Mourinho, Oscar has been used as Chelsea's primary playmaker.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/20/chelsea-jose-mourinho-juan-mata|title=José Mourinho tells Juan Mata to adapt after blasting Chelsea's style|date=21 September 2013|accessdate=12 December 2013|work=The Guardian[/tpl] His flexibility of being able to play in wider positions is also admired.
