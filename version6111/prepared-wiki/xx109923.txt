[[Einstein coefficients]]

CATEGORIES: Emission spectroscopy

In physics, one thinks of atomic spectral lines from two viewpoints.
The two states must be bound states in which the electron is bound to the atom, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a "bound–bound" transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely ("bound–free" transition) into a continuum state, leaving an ionized atom, and generating continuum radiation.

==Emission and absorption coefficients==

The above equations have ignored the influence of the spectroscopic line shape. To be accurate, the above equations need to be multiplied by the (normalized) spectral line shape, in which case the units will change to include a 1/Hz term.

===Equilibrium conditions===

In the cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, but for other cases, (e.g. lasers) the calculation is more complicated.

==Einstein coefficients==

In 1916, Albert Einstein proposed that there are three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line. The three processes are referred to as spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption. With each is associated an Einstein coefficient which is  a measure of the probability of that particular process occurring. Einstein considered the case of isotropic radiation of frequency [tpl]math|ν[/tpl], and spectral energy density [tpl]math|ρ (ν)[/tpl].Loudon, R. (2000), Section 1.5, pp. 16–19.

===Various formulations===

Hilborn has compared various formulations for derivations for the Einstein coefficients, by various authors.Hilborn, R.C. (2002). Einstein coefficients, cross sections, f values, dipole moments, and all that.  For example, Hertzberg works with irradiance and wavenumber.Herzberg, G. (1950). Yariv works with energy per unit volume per unit frequency interval;Yariv, A. (1967/1989), pp. 171–173. also;Garrison, J.C., Chiao, R.Y. (2008), pp. 15–19. this is how the present account is formulated. Mihalas & Weibel-Mihalas work with radiance and frequency; also Chandrasekhar;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950), p. 354 also Goody & Yung;Goody, R.M., Yung, Y.L. (1989), pp. 33–35. Loudon uses angular frequency and radiance.Loudon,R. (1973/2000), pp. 16–19.

===Spontaneous emission===

The same process results in increasing of the population of the state 1:

===Stimulated emission===

Stimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the development of the laser. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the present case of isotropic radiation.

===Photo absorption===

==Detailed balancing==

The Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities associated with each atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part. Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermodynamic equilibrium will be valid universally. 
At thermodynamic equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have detailed balancing as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:
Along with detailed balancing, at temperature [tpl]math|T[/tpl] we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in Planck's law of black body radiation to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.
From the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution we have for the number of excited atomic species i:
where:
Substituting these expressions into the equation of detailed balancing and remembering that [tpl]math|E2 − E1 [tpl]=[/tpl] hν[/tpl] yields:
separating to:
The above equation must hold at any temperature, so 
and
Therefore the three Einstein coefficients are interrelated by:
