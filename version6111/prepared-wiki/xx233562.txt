[tpl]DISPLAYTITLE:FPSO Noble Seillean[/tpl]The FPSO ''Noble Seillean'' is a dynamically positioned floating oil production, storage and offloading vessel. 

==Etymology==

The name Seillean means "honeybee" in Gaelic.

==History==

The vessel was designated as a single well oil production ship (SWOPS) when constructed for BP by Harland and Wolff in 1990.  The vessel was designed for the Cyrus oilfield on Block 16/28 in the UK sector of the North Sea. Later she served on the Donan field. Seillean was sold by BP in 1993 to Reading & Bates.   As Brazilian oil company Petrobras took the decision to develop the Roncador field, a four-year charter for Seillean was signed. In 1997-1998, Seillean was upgraded and arrived in Brazil in December 1998.[tpl]cite web | title= Roncador, Campos Basin, Brazil | url= http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/roncador/ | work=Offshore-Technology | publisher = Net Resources International | accessdate= 2010-06-17[/tpl]
After acquisition of Reading & Bates by Transocean, the vessel was acquired by Frontier Drilling in 2002.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article218091.ece |title= Hayward says spill 'never should have happened' |last1=Brenner |first1=Noah | newspaper = Upstream Online | publisher = NHST Media Group |date=2010-06-17|accessdate=2010-06-17[/tpl]  She was moved to Jubarte field.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rigzone.com/training/heavyoil/insight.asp?i_id=192 |title= Heavy Oil Contributes to Brazil's Energy Self-Sufficiency | newspaper = Rigzone | publisher = Bishop Interactive |first= Veronica | last = Murillo|accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl]  In February 2006, the vessel started to operate in the Petrobras-operated Golfinho Field in the Espirito Santo Basin off Brazil.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=29540&rss=true |title= Petrobras Begins Testing Operations of FPSO Seillean at Golfinho Field | work = Petrobras; Rigzone | publisher = Bishop Interactive |date=2006-02-17|accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl]  In 2007, Seillean was moved to Pipa 2 oil field.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=44593 |title= Petrobras Highlights FPSO Usage at OTC | work = Petrobras; Rigzone | publisher = Bishop Interactive |date=2007-05-01|accessdate=2010-07-16[/tpl]
In June 2010, FPSO Seillean was contracted for the oil collection and processing at the Macondo Prospect to deal with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
With the purchase of Frontier Drilling in 2010, FPSO Seillean was acquired  by Noble Corporation.  She was renamed Noble Seillean and her flag was changed from Panama to Liberia.

==Description==

FPSO Seallean is a dynamically positioned monohull floating production, storage and offloading vessel. She is classed by Lloyd's Register of Shipping as a 100A1 Oil Processing Tanker.  Seallean is equipped with a flare, two cargo-handling cranes, a process plant inside the hull, a completion tower, and crew accommodation.  The vessel has a displacement of 79,600 tonnes, the capacity to process up to [tpl]convert|20000|oilbbl/d[/tpl], and to store up to [tpl]convert|306000|oilbbl[/tpl] of oil.  Ship's length is [tpl]convert|249.7|m[/tpl], breadth is [tpl]convert|37|m[/tpl], and depth is [tpl]convert|20.5|m[/tpl]. She could operate at the water depth of [tpl]convert|2000|m[/tpl].  The vessel is equipped with a helideck of [tpl]convert|29|by|27.5|m|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title= Seallean, dynamically positioned FPSO. 10 years of deepwater test production in Brazil | url= http://www.frontier-drill.com/Portals/0/Brochure%20Seillean%20nov09.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Frontier Drilling | accessdate= 2010-07-16[/tpl]
Seillean is powered by a hybrid system of three Ruston gas turbine of 3.3 MW each, and three MAN diesel driven generators 4.2 MW each.  These are operated such that when fuel gas is available from production operations, the gas turbine generators generate electrical power. When fuel gas is unavailable, the diesel driven generators provide the power, supplemented by the gas turbine driven generators operating on diesel oil.
Seillean has the following production facilities:
The crude oil is pumped from the process plant to six cargo oil tanks. During the 1998 upgrade, an offtake reel system was installed which allows to ship discharge of cargo to a dynamically positioned shuttle tanker.
