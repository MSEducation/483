Although typically drawn with vertices in rows and edges proceeding from top to bottom, layered graph drawing algorithms may instead be drawn with vertices in columns and edges proceeding from left to right.[tpl]citation|contribution=Some modifications of Sugiyama approach|first=Danil E.|last=Baburin|title=Graph Drawing, 10th International Symposium, GD 2002, Irvine, CA, USA, August 26–28, 2002, Revised Papers|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2002|volume=2528|pages=366–367|doi=10.1007/3-540-36151-0_36[/tpl]. The same algorithmic framework has also been applied to radial layouts in which the graphs are arranged in concentric circles around some starting node[tpl]citation|title=A radial adaptation of the Sugiyama framework for visualizing hierarchical information|first=Christian|last=Bachmaier|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=13|issue=3|year=2007|pages=583–594|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2007.1000[/tpl]. and to three-dimensional layered drawings of graphs.[tpl]citation|contribution=Layered drawings of directed graphs in three dimensions|first1=	Seok-Hee|last1= Hong|first2=	Nikola S. |last2=Nikolov|title=Proceedings of the 2005 Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information Visualisation (APVis '05)|series=Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology|volume=45|year=2005|pages=69–74|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1082326[/tpl].
In layered graph drawings with many long edges, edge clutter may be reduced by grouping sets of edges into bundles and routing them together through the same set of dummy vertices.[tpl]citation|contribution=Improving layered graph layouts with edge bundling|first1=Sergey |last1=Pupyrev|first2= Lev|last2= Nachmanson |first3= Michael |last3=Kaufmann|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|title=Graph Drawing, 18th International Symposium, GD 2010, Konstanz, Germany, September 21-24, 2010, Revised Selected Papers|volume=6502|year=2011|pages=329–340|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-18469-7_30[/tpl]. Similarly, for drawings with many edges crossing between pairs of consecutive layers, the edges in maximal bipartite subgraphs may be grouped into confluent bundles.[tpl]citation|title=Confluent layered drawings|first1=David|last1=Eppstein|author1-link=David Eppstein|first2=Michael T.|last2=Goodrich|author2-link=Michael T. Goodrich|first3=Jeremy Yu|last3=Meng|journal=Algorithmica|volume=47|issue=4|year=2007|pages=439–452|doi=10.1007/s00453-006-0159-8[/tpl].
Drawings in which the vertices are arranged in layers may be constructed by algorithms that do not follow Sugiyama's framework. For instance, it is possible to tell whether an undirected graph has a drawing with at most k crossings, using h layers, in an amount of time that is polynomial for any fixed choice of k and h, using the fact that the graphs that have drawings of this type have bounded pathwidth.[ref]

For layered drawings of concept lattices, a hybrid approach combining Sugiyama's framework with additive methods (in which each vertex represents a set and the position of the vertex is a sum of vectors representing elements in the set) may be used. In this hybrid approach, the vertex permutation and coordinate assignment phases of the algorithm are replaced by a single phase in which the horizontal position of each vertex is chosen as a sum of scalars representing the elements for that vertex.[tpl]citation|contribution=Automated layout of concept lattices using layered diagrams and additive diagrams|first=Richard|last=Cole|title=Proceedings of the 24th Australasian Conference on Computer Science (ACSC '01)|year=2001|pages=47–53|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=545570[/tpl].
Layered graph drawing methods have also been used to provide an initial placement for force-directed graph drawing algorithms.[tpl]cite journal|  url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v18/n12/full/nbt1200_1257.html | volume=18|author=Benno Schwikowski1, Peter Uetz, and Stanley Fields|journal=Nature Biotechnology| title=A network of protein−protein interactions in yeast|year=2000|pmid=11101803| pages=1257–1261| doi=10.1038/82360| issue=12[/tpl]
