He has stated that he prefers acting on the stage, "because it’s a lot more fun to do. There is instant communication with the audience. An actor can tell whether or not he or she is connecting with an audience or whether they understand what’s going on."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2011articles/July2011/0726Gilliam_Gardiner.php |title=Houston Shakespeare Festival Welcomes Seth Gilliam, Leah C.
