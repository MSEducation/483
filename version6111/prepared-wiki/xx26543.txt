[[Cisgender]]

CATEGORIES: Gender, Gender identity, Transgender, Words coined in the 1990s

Cisgender and cissexual (often abbreviated to simply cis) describe related types of gender identity where an individual's experience of their own gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.Crethar, H. C. & Vargas, L. A. (2007). Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling. In J. Gregoire & C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p. 61. Sociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define cisgender as a label for "individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity" as a complement to transgender.[tpl]Cite journal| last1 = Schilt | last2 = Westbrook| first1 = Kristen| first2 = Laurel| title = Doing Gender, Doing Heteronormativity: 'Gender Normals,' Transgender People, and the Social Maintenance of Heterosexuality| journal = Gender & Society| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages = 440–464 461| doi =10.1177/0891243209340034|date = August 2009[/tpl] Prominent gay activist John Aravosis considers the term "a slur against non-trans people."[tpl]cite web|last=Aravosis|first=John|title=Dan Savage glitter-bombed again|url=http://americablog.com/2011/11/dan-savage-glitter-bombed-again.html|accessdate=7 April 2014[/tpl]
There are a number of derivatives of the terms in use, including cis male for "male assigned male at birth", cis female for "female assigned female at birth", analogically cis man and cis woman, as well as cissexism and cissexual assumption. In addition, certain scholars have begun to use the term cisnormativity, akin to the queer studies' heteronormativity.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Logie|first1= Carmen|last2= James|first2= Lana|last3= Tharao|first3= Wangari|last4= Loutfy|first4= Mona|year= 2012|title= ‘‘We don’t exist’’: a qualitative study of marginalization experienced by HIV-positive lesbian, bisexual, queer and transgender women in Toronto, Canada|journal= Journal of the International AIDS Society|volume= 15|issue= 2|url= http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/17392|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1= Ou Jin Lee|first1= Edward|last2= Brotman|first2= Shari|year= 2011|title= Identity, Refugeeness, Belonging: Experiences of Sexual Minority Refugees in Canada|journal= Canadian Review of Sociology|volume= 48|issue= 3|pages= 241–274|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01265.x/abstract;jsessionid=3683049B898CB3729C2991069982412B.d03t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false|doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01265.x[/tpl] A related adjective is gender-normative; Eli R.

==Cisgender vs. cissexual==

Julia Serano has defined cissexual as "people who are not transsexual and who have only ever experienced their mental and physical sexes as being aligned", while cisgender is a slightly narrower term for those who do not identify as transgender (a larger cultural category than the more clinical transsexual).[tpl]cite book |title= Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last= Serano|first= Julia|year= 2007|publisher= Seal Press|isbn= 978-1-58005-154-5|page= 12[/tpl] For Jessica Cadwallader, cissexual is "a way of drawing attention to the unmarked norm, against which trans* is identified, in which a person feels that their gender identity matches their body/sex".[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Sullivan | last2 = Murray| first1 = Nikki | first2 = Samantha| title = Somatechnics: queering the technologisation of bodies| publisher = Ashgate Publishing| location = Surrey, England| year = 2009| page = 17| isbn = 0-7546-7530-0 [/tpl]

==Origins==

Cisgender has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix cis-, meaning "on this side of," which is an antonym for the Latin-derived prefix trans-, meaning "across from" or "on the other side of". This usage can be seen in the cis-trans distinction in chemistry, the cis-trans or complementation test in genetics, in Ciscaucasia (from the Russian perspective) and in the ancient Roman term Cisalpine Gaul (i.e., "Gaul on this side of the Alps"). In the case of gender, cis- is used to refer to the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.

===Internet use===

The word cisgender has been used on the Internet since at least 1994, when it appeared in the alt.transgendered Usenet newsgroup in a post by Dana Leland Defosse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.transgendered/browse_thread/thread/69c04e35666a9a1b/69ebde0bf2af8dc6?lnk=st&q=cisgendered+dana+defosse&rnum=1&hl=en#69ebde0bf2af8dc6 |title=Transgender Research |accessdate=2007-12-22 |author=Dana Leland Defosse |date=1994-05-26 |publisher=Posted on alt.transgendered newsgroup[/tpl] Defosse does not define the term and seems to assume that readers are already familiar with it. It may also have been independently coined a year later: Donna Lynn Matthews, the charter maintainer of the alt.support.crossdressing usenet group, attributed the word to Carl Buijs, a transsexual man from the Netherlands, claiming that Buijs coined the word in 1995.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cydathria.com/ms_donna/tg_def.html |title=Definitions |accessdate=2007-12-22 |author=Donna Lynn Matthews |date=May 1999 |work=Donna's Hideout[/tpl] In April 1996, Buijs said in a Usenet posting, "As for the origin, I just made it up. I just kept running into the problem of what to call non-trans people in various discussions, and one day it just hit me: non-trans equals cis. Therefore, cisgendered."[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/soc.support.transgendered/msg/184850df15e48963?hl=en |title=A new perspective on an old topic |accessdate=2007-12-22 |author=Carl Buijs |date=1996-04-16 |publisher=Posted on soc.support.transgendered newsgroup[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/soc.support.transgendered/msg/a9d7afcea3d23cde?hl=en%F0%AD%88%92df15e48963?hl=en |title=A new perspective on an old topic |accessdate=2012-01-08 |author=Joan Tine |date=1996-04-12 |publisher=Posted on soc.support.transgendered newsgroup[/tpl]
In February 2014, Facebook began offering "custom" gender options, allowing users to identify with one or more gender-related terms from a curated list, including cis, cisgender, and others.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/13/tech/social-media/facebook-gender-custom/index.html |title=Facebook goes beyond 'male' and 'female' with new gender options |accessdate=2014-02-13 |author=Brandon Griggs | date=February 13, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/facebooks-new-gender-identity-options |title=Facebook's New Gender Identity Options|author=The Associated Press[/tpl]

===Academic and literary use===

German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch may have been the first to use the term cissexual (zissexuell in German) in a peer-reviewed publication: in his 1998 essay "The Neosexual Revolution", he cites his two-part 1991 article "Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick" ("Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view") as the origin of the term.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Sigusch| first = Volkmar| authorlink = Volkmar Sigusch| title = The Neosexual Revolution| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 27| pages = 331–359| date = February 1998| issue = 4| doi = 10.1023/A:1018715525493| pmid = 9681118[/tpl] He also used the term in the title of a 1995 article, "Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr" (or: "Transsexual desire and cissexual defense").[tpl]Cite journal| last = Sigusch| first = Volkmar| authorlink = Volkmar Sigusch| title = Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr| journal = Psyche| volume = 49| pages = 811–837| year = 1995| pmid = 7480808| issue = 9–10[/tpl]
The terms cisgender and cissexual have more recently been used in publications, such as a 2006 article in the Journal of Lesbian StudiesGreen, Eli R. (2006). "Debating Trans Inclusion in the Feminist Movement: A Trans-Positive Analysis," Journal of Lesbian Studies. Volume: 10 Issue: 1/2. pp. 231−248. ISSN 1089-4160 and Julia Serano's 2007 book Whipping Girl, after which the term gained some popularity among English-speaking activists and scholars.[tpl]Cite journal| authorlink = Carla A.

Williams| last = Williams| first = Rhaisa| title = Contradictory Realities, Infinite Possibilities: Language Mobilization and Self-Articulation Amongst Black Trans Women | journal = Penn McNair Research Journal | volume = 2| issue = 1| date = November 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| last = Drescher| first = Jack| authorlink = Jack Drescher| title = Queer Diagnoses: Parallels and Contrasts in the History of Homosexuality, Gender Variance, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9531-5 | date = September 2009| volume = 39| issue = 2| pages = 427–460| pmid = 19838785[/tpl] Proponents of using the terms rather than terms like "non-transsexual" or "non-trans" have argued that it calls attention to and unsettles the assumption that people, by default, have an internal sense of being male or female that matches the sex they were assigned at birth: for example, Jillana Enteen wrote that "cissexual" is "meant to show that there are embedded assumptions encoded in expecting this seamless conformity".[tpl]Cite book| last = Enteen | first = Jillana | authorlink = Jillana B.

Serano also uses the related term cissexism, "which is the belief that transsexuals' identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than, those of cissexuals".Serano (2007) also defines cisgender as synonymous with "non-transgender" and cissexual with "non-transsexual" (p. 33). While having been used by trans activists for some time,Koyama, E. (2002). Cisexual! cisgender: Decentralizing the dominant group.

Retrieved June 5, 2009 from http://www.t-vox.org/index.php?title=Cisgender_privilege the term "cisgender privilege" has recently appeared in academic literature and is defined there as the "set of unearned advantages that individuals who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth accrue solely due to having a cisgender identity".Walls, N. E., & Costello, K. (2010). "Head ladies center for teacup chain": Exploring cisgender privilege in a (predominantly) gay male context. In S. Anderson and V.
