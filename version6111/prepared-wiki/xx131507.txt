David Andrew Quayle (19 August 1936 â€“ 6 April 2010)Obituary in The Times was probably best known for his part in starting the UK chain B&Q.  He worked in the Marley Tile company in the 1960s and together with his brother-in-law Richard Block started the B&Q retail chain in 1969.  Their idea of large warehouse-style DIY stores copied the style already successfully operating in other European countries, but was unknown in the UK and B&Q soon became the largest retail suppliers of DIY products in the UK.http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_154.shtml
David left B&Q in 1982 and moved on to other companies, working in Television South, City Vision and The Beatrice Royal Contemporary Art and Craft Gallery.
