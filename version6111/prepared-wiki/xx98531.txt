[[Springgun]]

CATEGORIES: American punk rock groups, Musical groups from Arkansas

Springgun was an old school punk rock band from central Arkansas. Through the band's five year run, they went through many line up changes until nearly everyone in the central Arkansas scene had played with them including Skeeter Thompson, former bassist for the DC band Scream. They managed to record one album, "Springgun, The Band That Wouldn't Die" before calling it quits in 2003.
