[[Battle of Bani Walid]]

CATEGORIES: Bani Walid, Battles of the Libyan Civil War

The Battle of Bani Walid was a military operation in the Libyan civil war conducted by anti-Gaddafi forces in September and October 2011, in an effort to take control of the desert city of Bani Walid from pro-Gaddafi forces. It began following days of force buildup on the part of the attackers, as well as skirmishes around the city.

==Background==

Following the collapse of loyalist forces in Zawiya, Zliten and finally Tripoli in mid to late August, NLA forces advanced southwards from Misrata and Tarhuna towards the apparent pro-Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid.

===Advance===

3 September
Negotiations between representatives of the National Transitional Council, and tribal leaders from Bani Walid broke down. NLA fighters armed with heavy machine guns and anti aircraft guns advanced from Tarhuna towards Bani Walid after negotiations appeared to have failed.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-fighters-prepare-for-assault-on-gaddafi-desert-bastion/2011/09/04/gIQA4awT2J_story.html | title=Libyan fighters prepare for assault on Gaddafi desert bastion | work=The Washington Post | date=4 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Denyer | first=Simon[/tpl]

5 September 
The NTC announced that "the door is still open for negotiations", referring to attempts to get Bani Walid to surrender to NLA forces peacefully. It was reported that NLA units were only 40 km from the city.
6 September 
The NTC claimed that there had been resumed negotiations over Bani Walid, although there was some confusion in NTC/NLA ranks over the actual outcome, as loyalist elements in the city tried to block negotiations, fearing reprisals.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8743642/Libya-September-5-as-it-happened.html | title=Libya: 5 September as it happened | work=Telegraph | date=5 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Hough | first=Andrew |author2=John-Paul Ford Rojas | location=London[/tpl]
7 September 
Tribal representatives from Bani Walid, who had been negotiating with the NTC, were shot at by diehard loyalists in the city as they returned, prompting NLA forces to prepare for an attack on the town itself. It was also reported that Col. Gaddafi and his sons, Saif al-Islam, Hannibal, and Mutassim, had passed through Bani Walid on their way south.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8745657/Libya-fears-of-bloodshed-grow-as-Bani-Walid-talks-break-down.html | title=Libya: fears of bloodshed grow as Bani Walid talks break down | work=Telegraph | date=6 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last1=Sherlock | first1=Ruth |first2=Andrew|last2=Gilligan|first3=Rob|last3=Crilly | location=London[/tpl]

===Loyalists fire the first shots===

8 September
Gaddafi claimed that Bani Walid would never surrender, in an audio message aired on Syrian TV, and urged his people to continue the fight.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/muammar-gaddafi-loyalists-on-the-road-to-dusty-death/story-e6frg6so-1226128426097 | title=Muammar Gaddafi loyalists on the road to dusty death | work=The Australian | date=3 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] Loyalist troops fired missiles, which landed in Wadi Dinar, about 20 km from Bani Walid.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14841901 | title=Libya conflict: Rockets fired from Bani Walid |work=BBC News | date=8 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Galpin | first=Richard[/tpl]

===NTC offensive repelled===

9 September
The National Liberation Army said its fighters had entered Bani Walid from the north and east, penetrating to within two kilometres of the city centre,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16066371 | title=Anti-Gaddafi Fighters Say They Have Entered Town Of Bani Walid After Week Of Talks | work=Sky News | date=10 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] and heavy street fighting was underway. The offensive apparently began in response to a Grad rocket barrage against besieging anti-Gaddafi forces originating from within the city.
Anti-Gaddafi troops said they had lost at least one fighter in a skirmish on the outskirts of the city, also claiming they had killed two pro-Gaddafi soldiers and captured ten.[tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-9-2011-1511 | title=Friday, 9 September 2011 – 15:11 GMT+3 – Libya | work=Al Jazeera Live Blog | date=9 September 2011 | agency=Al Jazeera | accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl]
Al Jazeera reported unconfirmed allegations that anti-Gaddafi dissidents within the city were rising up in an effort to expel pro-Gaddafi elements, but stressed it could not corroborate the claims.[tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-9-2011-2027 | title=Friday, 9 September 2011 – 20:27 GMT+3 – Libya | work=Al Jazeera Live Blog | date=9 September 2011 | agency=Al Jazeera | accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl]
10 September
Opposition forces withdrew from the city, after encountering much more fierce resistance than they expected and suffering heavy casualties,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14864397 | title=Libya conflict: Gaddafi forces resist Bani Walid attack |work=BBC News | date=10 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Harding | first=Andrew[/tpl] in anticipation of NATO air-strikes on loyalist positions.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/world/africa/11libya.html | title=Facing Resistance, Rebel Assault on Key Qaddafi Loyalists’ Stronghold Slows | work=The New York Times | date=10 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Nordland | first=Rod[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/10/us-libya-nato-strikes-idUSTRE7891AR20110910 | title=NATO strikes pro-Gaddafi town: Reuters witness | work=Reuters | date=10 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Golovnina | first=Maria[/tpl] The rebels had fallen back a full 40 kilometres from the city.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/initial-assault-on-gaddafi-stronghold-falters-2352871.html | title=Initial assault on Gaddafi stronghold falters |work=The Independent  | date=11 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Sengupta | first=Kim | location=London[/tpl] However, NTC negotiators and field commanders said that they did not intend to enter the city the previous day, and that the incursion into the town was a result of anti-Gaddafi forces engaging in skirmishes with loyalist snipers placed in the city. The NTC ceasefire had not yet expired when the fighting occurred, and opposition fighters outside the city wanted to give anti-Gaddafi residents a chance to stage an uprising. The main attack, they said, was yet to come.[tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-10-2011-1405 | title=Saturday, 10 September 2011 – 11:05 GMT+3 – Libya | publisher=Al Jazeera | work=Al Jazeera Live Blog | date=10 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | last=Turton | first=Sue[/tpl]
Later during the day, a renewed assault was launched after anti-Gaddafi forces received reinforcements, with rebels saying that they had taken the northern gate to the city and met up with local resistance fighters. Unconfirmed reports of loyalist reinforcements prompted opposition forces to increase their numbers to put increased pressure on the loyalist-held city.
The pro-Gaddafi forces in Bani Walid were reported to include members of the Legion Thoria, a part of Gaddafi's secret police, as well as members of the elite Khamis Brigade[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/10/gaddafi-beni-walid-rebels-nato|title=Gaddafi's diehard secret police dig in as Nato jets blast desert stronghold|date=10 September 2011|author=Chris Stephen, Abdul Raufund and David Smith|work=The Guardian  |accessdate=16 September 2011|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-08/new-libyan-leaders-face-difficult-fight-for-unity-after-qaddafi-ouster.html|title=Libyan Fighters Suspend Qaddafi Attacks|first1=Christopher|last1=Stephen|first2=Massoud A.|last2=Derhally|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011|work=Bloomberg[/tpl] and mercenaries from Darfur, according to opponents of the old regime.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-11/libyan-opposition-advances-on-sirte-during-bani-walid-impasse.html | title=Libyan Opposition Advances on Sirte During Bani Walid Impasse |work=Business Week|agency=Bloomberg|first1=Christopher|last1=Stephen|first2=Mariam|last2=Fam | date=11 September 2011 | accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl]

12 September
Residents, who were evacuating from the city, stated that rebel forces had only managed to reach the northern outskirts of the town and were still a full 10 kilometers from the city center, contradicting earlier opposition claims of major advances. It also surfaced that, the day before, some rebels had in fact needed to pull back from Bani Walid due to inter-factional tensions among various opposition groups.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/12/libya.war/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 | title=Libya's interim leader promises to build 'a state of law' | work=CNN | date=13 September 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]
