[[Zaanaim]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

Zaanaim or Bezaanaim is a place in northwest of Lake Merom, near Kedesh, in Naphtali; currently sited in Hulah Valley, Israel. Here Sisera was slain by Jael, "the wife of Heber the Kenite," who had pitched his tent in the "plain 'as far as the oak' of Zaanaim" (or terebinth) ([tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:11|KJV[/tpl]).
Zaanaim means "wanderings", "the unloading of tents", the location was probably so called from the fact of nomads in tents encamping amid the cities and villages of that region.[ref][tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Ellicott |editor-first=Charles John |editor-link=Charles John Ellicott |title=An Old Testament Commentary for English Readers: Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel |publisher=Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co |year=1883 |location= |page=192 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1tsVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]

It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the LXX. and the Talmud, the letter "b", which in Hebrew means "in," should be taken as a part of the word following, and the phrase would then be "unto the oak of Bitzanaim," a place which has
been identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.
