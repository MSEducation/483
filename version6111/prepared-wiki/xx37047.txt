Drum memory was a magnetic data storage device invented by Gustav Tauschek in 1932 in Austria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=222|title=Magnetic drum|work=Virtual Exhibitions in Informatics|editor=Universität Klagenfurt|accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]  It was widely used in the 1950s and into the 1960s as computer memory. Some drum memories were also used as secondary storage.e.g., IBM 2301 Drum Storage
For many early computers, drum memory formed the main working memory of the computer. It was so common that these computers were often referred to as drum machines. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Drums were displaced as primary computer memory by magnetic core memory which was faster (no moving parts), less expensive and more dense. For the same reasons, drums were replaced by hard disk drives for secondary storage. The manufacture of drums ceased in the 1970s.

==Design==

A drum was a large metal cylinder, coated on the outside surface with a ferromagnetic recording material. It could be considered the precursor to the hard disk platter, but in the form of a drum rather than a flat disk. In many designs, a row of fixed read-write heads ran along the long axis of the drum, one for each track so, unlike modern hard disks, which have only one head per platter that must be positioned over a particular track before it can be accessed, the unit's controller simply selected the proper head and waited for the data to appear under it as the drum turned. (Not all drum units were designed with each track having its own head. Some, such as the English Electric DEUCE drum and the Univac FASTRAND had one or more moving heads.)
In a modern hard disk drive, delay in reading and writing data includes the time to position the head over the desired track (seek time), plus the time until the desired data rotates into position under the head (rotational latency), whereas the performance of a drum with one head per track is determined almost entirely by the rotational latency. In the era when drums were used as main working memory, programmers often positioned code on the drum in such a way as to reduce the amount of time needed for the next instruction to rotate into place under the head. They did this by timing how long it would take after loading an instruction for the computer to be ready to read the next one, then placing that instruction on the drum so that it would arrive under a head just in time. This method of timing-compensation, called the "skip factor" or "interleaving" (interleave in disk storage), was used for many years in storage memory controllers.

==Use and legacy==

Tauschek's original drum memory had a capacity of about 500,000 bits (62.5 kilobytes).
One of the earliest functioning computers to employ drum memory was the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, however, it employed regenerative capacitor memory rather than magnetism to store information.  The outer surface of the drum was lined with electrical contacts leading to circuitry contained within.
The first mass-produced computer, the IBM 650, had about 8.5 kilobytes of drum memory (later doubled to about 17 kilobytes in the Model 4).
As late as 1980, PDP-11/45 machines using magnetic core main memory and drums for swapping were still in use at many of the original UNIX sites.
In modern-day BSD Unix and its descendants, /dev/drum is the name of the default virtual memory (swap) device, deriving from the use of drum secondary-storage devices as backup storage for pages in virtual memory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=drum&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+3.5.1-RELEASE&format=html|title=FreeBSD drum(4) manpage|accessdate=2013-01-27[/tpl]
