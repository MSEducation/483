Saint Adalard (or Adalard of Corbie) (c. 751 â€“ 2 January 827) was son of Bernard the son of Charles Martel and half-brother of Pepin; Charlemagne was his cousin.

==Biography==

Adalard received a good education in the Palatine School at the Court of Charlemagne, and while still very young was made Count of the Palace. At the age of twenty he entered the monastery at Corbie in Picardy. In order to be more secluded, he went to Monte Cassino, but was ordered by Charlemagne to return to Corbie, where he was elected abbot. At the same time Charlemagne made him prime minister to his son Pepin, King of Italy, in the Carolingian Empire.Ott, Michael. "St. Adalard." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

When, in 817, Bernard, son of Pepin, aspired to the imperial crown, Louis le Debonnaire suspected Adalard of being in sympathy with Bernard and banished him to Hermoutier, the modern Noirmoutier, on the island of the same name. After seven years Louis saw his mistake and made Adalard one of his chief advisers.
In 822 Adalard and his brother Wala founded Corvey Abbey ("New Corbie") in Westphalia. Adalard is honoured as patron saint of many churches and towns in France and along the lower Rhine.
