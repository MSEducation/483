===Clare===

====2008: Munster final appearance====

McNamara's first season in charge was a reasonably successful one.  After a relatively lacklustre National Hurling League campaign, Clare were drawn to meet Waterford in the quarter-final of the Munster Championship and were installed as underdogs.  An intriguing game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Clare had won by 2-26 to 0-23.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2008/0601/clare_waterford.html |title=Clare 2-26, Waterford 0-23|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=2008-06-01|accessdate=2008-11-21[/tpl]  The provincial semi-final pitted Clare against Limerick.  While more was expected of the Shannonsiders McNamara's side had another relatively comfortable 4-12 to 1-16 victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2008/0622/clare_limerick.html |title=Clare 4-12, Limerick 1-16|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=2008-06-23|accessdate=2008-11-22[/tpl]  This win allowed Clare to advance to a first Munster final since 1999.  Tipperary provided the opposition on this occasion, with Clare being regarded as underdogs once again.  A close game developed in the second-half as Clare ate into Tipp's lead, however, in the end victory went to Tipperary by 2-21 to 0-19.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2008/0713/tipperary_clare.html |title=Tipperary 2-21 Clare 0-19|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=2008-07-13|accessdate=2008-11-22[/tpl]   In spite of this defeat McNamara's side were allowed to advance to the All-Ireland quarter-final.  Cork provided the opposition on this occasion, however, Clare went seven points ahead at one stage.  Cork slowly fought back to eventually clinch a 2-19 to 2-17 victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2008/0727/clare_cork.html|title=Cork 2-19 Clare 2-19|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=2008-07-27|accessdate=2008-11-22[/tpl]   Thus ended Clare's involvement in the championship.

====Gerry Quinn Saga====

Gerry Quinn had been left out of the Clare Hurling Panel. On 20 March 2009 Gerry Quinn went to visit the Clare Team Doctor Dr Paraic Quinn in Gurteen because he had been laid low with a virus. According to Quinn he rang Mike Mc on the way and informed him about the situation regarding his illness and his desire to meet Paraic Quinn. Quinn then claimed that Mike Mc cut loose at him on the phone. Nevertheless Quinn was hopeful that things could be worked out when he arrived at the session and after asking McNamara whether the doctor was around, Quinn was informed that he was off the panel. On TG4 the day of the match Mike Mc was asked was Gerry Quinn still on the panel, McNamara gave no comment and when he was asked was there a drinking ban he gave no comment.

===2009 Player Opposition Crisis===

In October 2009, McNamara's tenure as Clare hurling manager looked to be under threat after it emerged the players had sent a letter to the County Board seeking his removal from the post. It appears that the players were disappointed with the county's lack of progress in 2009. The panel requested that the unsigned letter be read out at a County Board meeting on 27 October 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/1027/clare.html|title=Clare face player revolt over manager|date=2009-10-27|work=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl] At the meeting on the 27 October 2009, the Clare county board gave McNamara their full backing despite the growing opposition from some players.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/1028/clare.html|title=Clare board behind McNamara |date=2009-10-28|work=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl]
On 1 November 2009, the hurling panel produced a vote of no confidence in McNamara to continue as manager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/1103/clare.html|title=Clare hurlers remain opposed to McNamara|date=2009-11-03|work=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl]  After a Clare County Board meeting in Ennis on 10 November 2009, McNamama made a stirring address, confirming his desire to stay in place as manager of the Banner hurlers, reflecting on the progress made in 2009 and outling his plans for next season. He spoke to delegates present for close to 30 minutes after members of the media had been asked to leave the room. A letter from the 27 player panel was read out at the meeting explaining that only one squad member had sided with McNamara in the vote of confidence on November 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/sport/mcnamara-to-continue-as-clare-manager-433832.html|title=McNamara to continue as Clare manager|date=2009-11-11|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl]  In spite of the opposition, the Clare County Board stood standing behind McNamara with County Board officials pledging to work with him to iron out any problems they could.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/1111/1224258554058.html|title=Clare saga rolls on as McNamara digs in|date=2009-11-11|work=Irish Times|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/clare-facing-meltdown-1940205.html|title=Clare facing meltdown|date=2009-11-11|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl]
