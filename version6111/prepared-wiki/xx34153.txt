==History==

CBS had previously attempted late-night talk shows with The Merv Griffin Show (1969-1972) and The Pat Sajak Show (1989-1990) but were unable to compete with NBC's Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and were cancelled due to poor ratings. For most of the 20 years preceding Late Show, CBS's late night fare consisted of movies, reruns and specialty programming packaged under the title CBS Late Night and broadcast to middling ratings. When David Letterman became available following a conflict with NBC, CBS was eager to lure him and offered him a three-year, $14 million per year contract,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305416,00.html|title=Is Dave Worth It?|publisher=Entertainment Weekly |first=Mark |last=Harris|date=January 29, 1993|accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl] doubling his Late Night salary. According to their agreement, the show would spend a month in Hollywood at least once a year.
CBS purchased the Ed Sullivan Theater for $4 million, spending "several million more" for renovation.[tpl]cite web| last=Carter | first= Bill | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/theater/cbs-buys-a-theater-to-keep-letterman-on-new-york-s-stage.html |title= CBS Buys a Theater To Keep Letterman On New York's Stage | work= The New York Times | date= February 22, 1993| accessdate=2014-02-22[/tpl] The renovation was supervised by architect James Polshek. CBS' total cost for acquiring the show including renovations, negotiation rights paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer Bill Wendell, Shaffer, the writers and the band was over $140 million.http://mancave.cbslocal.com/2011/04/11/david-letterman-keeping-us-up-late/
When Letterman moved to CBS and began Late Show, several of Late Night's long-running comedy bits made the move with him. Letterman renamed a few of his regular bits to avoid legal problems over trademark infringement (NBC cited that what he did on Late Night was "intellectual property" of the network). "Viewer Mail" on NBC became the "CBS Mailbag", and Larry "Bud" Melman began to use his real name, Calvert DeForest. Paul Shaffer's "World's Most Dangerous Band" became "The CBS Orchestra", a jab at NBC regarding the show's new home, and a play on the NBC Orchestra of the long running The Tonight Show. Letterman's signature bit, the Top Ten List, was perfunctorily renamed the "Late Show Top Ten List" (over time it was simply referred to again by its original name).
After Letterman was introduced on Late Show's very first episode, NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw accompanied him on stage and wished him "reasonably well". As part of a pre-arranged act, Brokaw then proceeded to retrieve a pair of cue cards while stating that "These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!" After he carried them off stage, Letterman responded, "Who would have thought you would ever hear the words 'intellectual property' and 'NBC' in the same sentence?" In his opening monologue, Letterman said "Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave"[tpl]cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D9173FF932A0575BC0A965958260 |title= Review/Television; New Time, New Place, Same Humor at nytimes.com, originally published Aug. 31, 1993 |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-08-31 |accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl] but joked that he woke up that morning and next to him in bed was the head of a peacock (while the orchestra played the theme from The Godfather).[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DF113CF936A3575AC0A965958260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FL%2FLeno%2C%20Jay |title=AUG. 29-Sept. 4; Mega-Mouths: Jay and Dave Head-to-Head, originally published Sept. 5, 1993 |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-09-05 |accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl]
In ratings, Letterman's Late Show dominated Leno's Tonight Show for its first two years.  Leno pulled ahead on July 10, 1995, starting with a Hugh Grant interview, after Grant's much-publicized arrest for picking up an LA prostitute.[tpl]cite news |first=Natalie |last= Finn|title=Tonight Show Turns 15|publisher=E!

Likewise the CBS network was hurt by affiliation switches in late 1994 relating to Fox's acquirement of CBS's National Football League rights, stunting the Late Show just as it was beginning to gain traction.
Announcer Bill Wendell left in 1995,http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-18/entertainment/ca-36624_1_david-letterman-show with Alan Kalter taking his place.
At times Late Show even came in third in its time slot (behind Nightline, most recently in November 2008), once prompting Letterman to arrange for a Manhattan Billboard proudly declaring himself and his show to be No. 3 in Late Night, aping an older, nearby billboard which promoted Leno and The Tonight Show as No. 1.
On June 1, 2009, Conan O'Brien (who had succeeded Letterman as host of Late Night in 1993) took over as host of The Tonight Show — an event Letterman referenced in his own show's Top Ten List on that night — and Letterman's "feud" with Leno temporarily ceased. In 2008 Letterman told Rolling Stone that he would welcome Leno on his show once Leno's tenure ended.[tpl]cite news | title=Letterman baffled by NBC's replacing of Leno | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/television/03lett.html | last=Stelter | first=Brian | publisher=New York Times | date=2008-09-02 | accessdate=2009-06-10[/tpl] Letterman said on competing with O'Brien, "I still find it hard to believe that Jay won’t be there." The interview was held prior to Leno announcing his return to NBC for The Jay Leno Show. In the second week after Letterman and O'Brien began their opposing broadcasts, viewer ratings for Tonight began to slip and Late Show was poised to beat Tonight for the first time in over ten years,[tpl]cite web | title=Who's loyal to Leno, O'Brien, and Letterman? | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=7797222&page=1 | last=Fisher | first=Luchina | publisher=ABC News | date=2009-06-10 | accessdate=2009-06-10[/tpl] a fact pointed out by Letterman's guests on air (Howard Stern and Julia Roberts).[tpl]cite web | title=Roberts sides with Letterman | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31210920/ | author=Access Hollywood | publisher=MSNBC.com | date=2009-06-10 | accessdate=2009-06-10[/tpl] Letterman quickly tried to change subject in the interviews and tried to avert a new rivalry.

The feud between the hosts ended for good on February 6, 2014 with Leno's second and final retirement and Late Night host Jimmy Fallon, who succeeded Conan O'Brien in 2009, becoming the current host of the Tonight Show on February 17, with its subsequent return to New York for the first time since 1972.
On April 3, 2012, CBS reached an agreement with Worldwide Pants and CBS Television Studios to continue the show through 2014. The parties reached another agreement in October 2013 to extend the show an additional year, continuing the series into 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=871 |title= CBS announces new contract extensions with late night stars David Letterman and Craig Ferguson through 2015 |publisher=CBS Corporation |work= Press release| date= April 3, 2012 |accessdate= 2012-10-19[/tpl] Letterman is the longest tenured late-night talk show host, having surpassed Johnny Carson.[tpl]cite web | title=David Letterman Extends Agreement to Host 'Late Show With David Letterman' Through 2015 | url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/10/04/david-letterman-extends-agreement-to-host-late-show-with-david-letterman-through-2015/206991/ | last=Bibel | first=Sara | publisher=TVbythenumbers | date=2013-10-04 | accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]
On April 10, 2014, one week after Letterman announced that he would retire as host of the Late Show in 2015, CBS announced that Stephen Colbert (host of competing late night series The Colbert Report on Comedy Central) would succeed Letterman as the host of the program after Letterman retires.[tpl]cite web|title=Stephen Colbert Next Host of "The Late Show"|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/news/1002302/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=10 April 2014[/tpl]

==Production==

===Studio and set design===

The show has taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater at the corner of Broadway and 53rd Street in midtown Manhattan since its inception. Formerly called CBS Studio 50, it had been home to several TV programs over the years, most notably The Ed Sullivan Show. Letterman has made use of the immediate neighborhood surrounding the theater for his show, closing off the portion of 53rd Street that goes past his studio for various stunts on occasion. Nearby merchants gained fame after making frequent appearances on the program, including Rupert Jee, owner of the Hello Deli at 213 W. 53rd St., and Mujibur and Sirajul, Bengali immigrants who worked at a souvenir shop close to the studio.
The stage layout has followed the same basic structure Letterman employed at 30 Rock: the house band appears on the far left, followed by the performance area and then the interview set.

===Same-day tapings===

When Letterman is not on vacation (which he takes roughly ten weeks per year[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,251464_2,00.html |title=A Dave New World |publisher=Ew.com |date=2002-03-15 |accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl]), he and his crew work four days per week, taping Friday's show earlier in the week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/03/when-the-hell-does-letterman-tape-his-shows |title=When the hell does Letterman tape his shows? |publisher= TV Squad |date= April 3, 2006 |accessdate= 2011-05-15[/tpl] From October 2001 until May 2004, Friday's show was taped on Thursdays. From 2004 to 2010, Friday's show was taped on Mondays. During this time, the Friday's show's monologue topics, sketches, and other segments were chosen for their lack of topicality, with few if any references to current events or any subject which would run the risk of seeming dated. However, in late 2011 the Late Show reverted to the practice of taping the Friday show on Thursdays, helping the Friday shows become more topical and relevant.

===Episode structure===

On rare episodes, the show begins with a cold open with Letterman in a baseball cap interacting with a celebrity. The show's opening credits feature a series of shots of New York City as the CBS Orchestra performs the Late Show theme (a livelier variation of the more jazzy Late Night theme). The announcer presents the names of that night's guests, as well as Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra, then introduces Letterman.
Letterman then walks out on the show stage to perform his stand-up monologue, which may begin with a reference to something an audience member said to him during the pre-show question-and-answer session. The jokes are based on pop culture, current events, and politics. He then introduces one or two video jokes such as a running gag or fake commercial/public service announcement. The monologue is followed by Letterman's introduction of Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra. Beginning in 2009, a commercial break replaces Letterman's trademark 'crossing to the desk' which he had done since the early years. Letterman then chats with the audience and Shaffer, sometimes relating an anecdote from his personal life, sometimes discussing his anticipation of a particular guest; a running gag may be featured.
In 2005, after the death of Johnny Carson, it was revealed that Carson had made a habit of sometimes sending jokes to Letterman which Letterman would then incorporate into his monologues. The January 31, 2005, episode of the Late Show, which featured a tribute to Carson, began with a monologue made up entirely of jokes written by Carson since his retirement.[tpl]cite web|date=February 11, 2009| |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-207_162-667673.html |title=Carson Feeds Jokes To Letterman |publisher= CBS News |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/123709/letterman_pays_special_tribute_to_carson/ |title=Letterman Pays Special Tribute to Carson |publisher= redOrbit |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl]
Letterman reads the Top Ten List at this point before turning to guest interviews with a celebrity, politician, or other public figure. On most episodes, the first guest stays on through the commercial break and continues the interview.
Following the first guest is a short segment to bridge two commercial breaks sequentially. In earlier episodes, Letterman would return to his running gag during this break, or retry a failed stunt from earlier in the show. Later episodes include a brief comedy announcement from announcer Alan Kalter while showing the audience cheering.
The final segment consists of a live musical performance, a comedian performing a stand-up routine, or another guest interview. Musical guests have included artists from David Bowie, U2, Neil Young, Coldplay to indie bands like Grizzly Bear and MENEW. The CBS Orchestra frequently accompanies musical guests in performing their songs. Episodes occasionally conclude with Letterman recommending viewers stay tuned for 'Craig Ferguson', but usually he simply waves to the camera, saying, "Good night everybody!" Of late, the admonishment to watch Craig Ferguson has been delivered by Alan Kalter, via voiceover.

===Regular sketches===

Late Show has various repeated absurdist segments, including those involving cast members' and audience participation. The show will also take a camera crew into the Hello Deli to show games such as "What's on the iPod?" and "Beat the Clock," or onto 53rd Street or the roof to record various stunts there.

===High-definition broadcasts===

The show began broadcasting in high-definition television (HDTV) on August 29, 2005.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/the_wahoo_gazette/?year=2005&month=8&day=29&direct=true | title=The Late Show Wahoo Gazette| date= August 29, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2011[/tpl] About two weeks later, Tim Kennedy, the show's Technical Director, commented on the transition in the show's official newsletter:[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
 The biggest challenge in the HD conversion was to renovate and upgrade our old control room, audio room, videotape room, and edit room while still doing five shows a week... This entailed putting a remote production truck on 53rd Street running somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 feet of video and audio cable just to tie the truck to the existing technical plant... 
 The coolest piece of equipment is our new control room Virtual Wall. We have done away with the conventional monitor for every video source and replaced it with four 70-inch rear projection screens and within those screens we can "virtually" place as many video images as we want, anywhere we want them, and when we want it. 
Kennedy and his crew won an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Series" during the nearly-four-month-long transition to HDTV.

==Guest hosts==

In 2000, after Letterman had quintuple bypass surgery, the Late Show Backstage was aired. This featured many celebrities reminiscing about their experiences as guests on his show. Bandleader Paul Shaffer was among those who hosted, when he interviewed Jerry Seinfeld. These interviews were interspersed with past footage. Previously, only reruns without any special introductions had been aired since Letterman's temporary leave from the show.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/02/05/2000-02-05_dave_pals_to_cover_for_him_w.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Dave Pals To Cover For Him While He Heals | date=February 5, 2000[/tpl]
