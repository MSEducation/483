USS ''Zara'' (SP-133) was an armed yacht that served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919.
Zara was a steam yacht built in 1891 in the United Kingdom by Fleming and Ferguson at Paisley, Scotland.  Originally named Solgar, she had been renamed by the time the U.S. Navy purchased her from Mr. David H. Friedman of New York, New York, on 27 April 1917 for service in World War I, designated her SP-133, and commissioned her at New York City on 22 May  1917.
Assigned to the section patrol in the 3rd Naval District, Zara cruised the waters of Long Island Sound for almost a year. She was decommissioned on 13 April 1918 and put up for sale.
Though her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1918, Zara was retained by the Navy to serve as guard vessel at Whitestone, Queens, New York, near the western entrance to Long Island Sound.
Zara finally was sold on 13 September 1919 to an unrecorded buyer
