CATEGORIES: Novelty songs, 1941 songs

"The Hut-Sut Song (a Swedish Serenade)" is a novelty song from the 1940s with nonsense lyrics. The song was written in 1941 by Leo V. Killion, Ted McMichael and Jack Owens. The first and most popular recording was by Horace Heidt and His Musical Knights.
The lyrics state that a Swedish boy skipped school to sit by a stream and sing what is purportedly a Swedish folk song. The chorus goes in part:
The song then purports to define some of the words as relating to a boy and a girl by a river and their dreams. The song has an unusual and contagious rhythm.
The song was also recorded by various artists such as Mel Tormé, Freddy Martin and Spike Jones. The song is of the same genre as other novelty songs of the era, such as "Mairzy Doats" and "Three Little Fishies (Itty Bitty Pool)"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]all three of which were subjected to the musical arrangements of Spike Jones. Some contend that the song was a rewriting of an unpublished Missouri River song called "Hot Shot Dawson".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogerowenspeanutman.com/the%20peanut%20gallery_files/TIME_com%20Hot%20Shot%20and%20Hut-Sut%20--%20Jul%2028,%201941%20--%20Page%201.htm |title=TIME.com: Hot Shot and Hut-Sut[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Jul 28, 1941[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Page 1 |publisher=Rogerowenspeanutman.com |date=1941-07-28 |accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl]
The popularity of the song is lampooned in a 1940s film short.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/soundie_1 |title=Soundie – The Hut Sut Song : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl] In the film, The King's Men (who also performed on Fibber McGee and Molly), play young men living in a boarding house who are endlessly singing the song while getting dressed, eating dinner, playing cards, etc., until the exasperated proprietor finally has them removed to an insane asylum.
The song is featured in the movies From Here to Eternity, Ace in the Hole, and A Christmas Story. In the 1942 animated short from Warner Brothers, Horton Hatches the Egg, the lyrics are further garbled as "Hut sut ra, sat on a willowa, so on, so on, so forth". A snippet of the song was also sung by Rowlf the Dog in a Veterinarians' Hospital sketch on the Muppet Show.
In the UK, an episode of a 1970s sitcom Happy Ever After (a show that evolved into the later sitcom Terry and June), starring Terry Scott and comedy doyen June Whitfield, was built around the song. In the episode "The Hut-Sut-Song" (series 5, episode 2, first aired in September 1978) Terry remembers the Freddy Martin version of the song from his youth. Getting a copy of the record becomes a comedic quest throughout the episode, culminating is his finding an old 78RPM copy of it.
