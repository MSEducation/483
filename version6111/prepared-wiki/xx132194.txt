The Shocknife is notable for the electrical shock it delivers when used in a knife strike. The electrical shock stimulates the nerve fibers in the same way a real knife cut would but without causing injury. This is intended to simulate the pain that would be inflicted by a real cut and to induce similar responses, such as the fight or flight response.  The Shocknife is in use by law enforcement agencies and military training programs worldwide.[tpl]cite journal | last = Michalowski| first = Kevin| title = Shocknife Adds Fear to Training Scenarios| journal = Tactical Gear Magazine| volume = 11| issue = 4| page = 30 | publisher = FW Media Inc.| date = 2007-12-01[/tpl]
