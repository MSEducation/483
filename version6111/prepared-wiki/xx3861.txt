It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.
Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.
Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.
Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

Specific terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, colors and breeds.

===Lifespan and life stages===

Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21[/tpl] The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |work= TheHorse.com |publisher= The Horse[/tpl]
Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern HemisphereBritish Horse Society The Manual of Horsemanship of the British Horse Society p. 255 and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES |format=PDF |title= Rules of the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-07-09 |year= 2007 |publisher=Australian Jockey Club |page=7[/tpl] The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aerc.org/HorseAge.aspx|title= Equine Age Requirements for AERC Rides|accessdate=2011-07-25|publisher= American Endurance Riding Conference[/tpl]
The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:
In horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.equibase.com/newfan/glossary-full.cfm|title= Glossary of Horse Racing Terms|accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= Equibase.com|publisher= Equibase Company, LLC[/tpl] However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES|title=Rules of the Australian Stud Book|accessdate=2010-02-05|page=9|date=July 2008|publisher=Australian Jockey Club Ltd and Victoria Racing Club Ltd[/tpl]

===Size and measurement===

The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back.Whitaker and Whitelaw The Horse p. 77 This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.
The English-speaking world measures the height of horses in hands and inches: one hand is equal to [tpl]convert|101.6|mm|in|0|disp=flip[/tpl]. The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of [tpl]convert|62|in|cm|1[/tpl] in height.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship p. 51
The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. Light riding horses usually range in height from [tpl]hands|14|to|16|lk=off[/tpl] and can weigh from [tpl]convert|380|to|550|kg[/tpl].Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World entry 1,68,69 Larger riding horses usually start at about [tpl]hands|15.2|lk=off[/tpl] and often are as tall as [tpl]hands|17|lk=off[/tpl], weighing from [tpl]convert|500|to|600|kg[/tpl].Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World entry 12,30,31,32,75 Heavy or draft horses are usually at least [tpl]hands|16|lk=off[/tpl] high and can be as tall as [tpl]hands|18|lk=off[/tpl] high. They can weigh from about [tpl]convert|700|to|1000|kg[/tpl].Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World entry 86, 96, 97
The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848. He stood [tpl]hands|21.2+1/2|lk=off[/tpl] high and his peak weight was estimated at [tpl]convert|1500|kg[/tpl].Whitaker and Whitelaw The Horse p. 60 The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. She is [tpl]convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and weighs [tpl]convert|57|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409317&in_page_id=1770|title=Meet Thumbelina, the World's Smallest Horse |accessdate=2006-10-08 |author= Martin, Arthur |work= Daily Mail | location=London | date=2006-10-08[/tpl]

====Ponies====

Ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.
The traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is [tpl]hands|14.2|lk=off[/tpl]. An animal 14.2 h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 h a pony,Ensminger Horses and Tack pp. 11–12 but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under [tpl]hands|14|lk=off[/tpl],Howlett Ponies in Australia p. 14 For competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is [tpl]hands|14.1|lk=off[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/_IFrames/RuleBook/rulebooks.aspx |title=2012 United States Equestrian Federation, Inc. Rule Book | publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|page=Rule WS 101[/tpl] The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than [tpl]convert|148|cm|in|2[/tpl] at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 h, and [tpl]convert|149|cm|in|2[/tpl], or just over 14.2½ h, with shoes.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/Annex%20XVII%20-%20Extracts%20Ponies.pdf | title=Annex XVII: Extracts from Rules for Pony Riders and Children, 9th edition |publisher=Fédération Equestre Internationale | year =2009| accessdate= 2010-03-07[/tpl]
Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies.  Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.For example, the Missouri Fox Trotter, or the Arabian horse. See McBane The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds pp. 192, 218 Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2 h, but are still considered to be ponies.For example, the Welsh Pony. See McBane The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds pp. 52–63
Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of equine intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages [tpl]hands|10|lk=off[/tpl], is considered a pony.Ensminger Horses and Tack p. 12 Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than [tpl]convert|30|in|cm[/tpl], are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.McBane The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds p. 200

===Genetics===

Horses have 64 chromosomes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/medgen/chromo/species.html |title=Chromosome Numbers in Different Species |publisher=Vivo.colostate.edu |date=1998-01-30 |accessdate=2013-04-17[/tpl] The horse genome was sequenced in 2007.

===Colors and markings===

Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.Vogel The Complete Horse Care Manual p. 14 Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,Mills, et al. A Basic Guide to Horse Care and Management pp. 72–73 which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4354|title=A Horse of a Different Color|journal=The Horse|format=Registration required|accessdate=2010-02-11|author=Corum, Stephanie J.|date=May 1, 2003[/tpl]
Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor,[tpl]cite journal |last=Marklund |first=L. |coauthors=M. Johansson Moller, K. Sandberg, L. Andersson |title=A missense mutation in the gene for melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MC1R) is associated with the chestnut coat color in horses |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=7 |pages=895–899 |year=1996 |doi=10.1007/s003359900264 |pmid=8995760 |issue=12[/tpl] also known as the "extension gene" or "red factor," as its recessive form is "red" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.  Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php|title= Horse Coat Color Tests|accessdate=2008-05-01 |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California[/tpl]
Horses which have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks "white" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php|title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|accessdate=2008-05-01|work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California[/tpl] Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene.[tpl]cite journal |author=Haase B |title=Allelic Heterogeneity at the Equine KIT Locus in Dominant White (W) Horses |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e195 |year=2007 |pmid=17997609 |pmc=2065884 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030195 |author-separator=, |author2=Brooks SA |author3=Schlumbaum A |display-authors=3 |last4=Azor |first4=Pedro J. |last5=Bailey |first5=Ernest |last6=Alaeddine |first6=Ferial |last7=Mevissen |first7=Meike |last8=Burger |first8=Dominik |last9=Poncet |first9=Pierre-André[/tpl] However, there are no "albino" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2004.00481.x?journalCode=jbg |title= Genetic mapping of dominant white (W), a homozygous lethal condition in the horse (Equus caballus) (2004)|accessdate=9 January 2009 |author= Mau, C., Poncet, P.

===Reproduction and development===

Gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days,Ensminger, Horses and Horsemanship p. 156 and usually results in one foal; twins are rare.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www2.okstate.edu/pio/twinfoals.html|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=Rare Twin Foals Born at Vet Hospital: Twin Birth Occurrences Number One in Ten Thousand| author=Johnson, Tom|work= Communications Services, Oklahoma State University|publisher= Oklahoma State University[/tpl] Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.Miller Revolution pp. 102–103 Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses and Horsemanship", p. 150 Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/29352/reducing-weaning-stress-in-foals| author=Kline, Kevin H.|title=Reducing weaning stress in foals|publisher=Montana State University eXtension|date=2010-10-07|accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl]
Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.Ensminger, Horses and Tack, p. 129 Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.equineortho.colostate.edu/questions/dod.htm |title=Developmental Orthopaedic Disease: Problems of Limbs in young Horses|accessdate=2008-04-20|author= McIlwraith, C.W.|publisher=Colorado State University|work=Orthopaedic Research Center[/tpl]
Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four.Thomas Storey's Guide to Training Horses p. 163 Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/factbook.asp?section=11|title= 2-Year-Old Racing (US and Canada)|accessdate=2008-04-28 |work= Online Fact Book|publisher= Jockey Club[/tpl] horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.Bryant The USDF Guide to Dressage pp. 271–272 For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.

===Anatomy===

====Skeletal system====

The horse skeleton averages 205 bones.Evans The Horse p. 90 A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 21–25

====Hooves====

The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship p. 367 The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of essentially the same material as a human fingernail.Giffin Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook p. 304 The end result is that a horse, weighing on average [tpl]convert|500|kg[/tpl],Giffin Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook p. 457 travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118|title= Yes, The Shin Bone Is Connected to the Ankle Bone|accessdate=2008-04-05 |author= Fuess, Ph.D., Theresa A.|work= Pet Column|publisher= University of Illinois |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060909161307/http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118 |archivedate = September 9, 2006[/tpl] For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,Giffin Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook pp. 310–312 though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

====Teeth====

Horses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or "bars" of the horse's mouth when the horse is bridled.Kreling Horses' Teeth and Their Problems pp. 12–13
An estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 46–50

====Digestion====

Horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A [tpl]convert|450|kg|adj=on[/tpl] horse will eat [tpl]convert|7|to|11|kg[/tpl] of food per day and, under normal use, drink [tpl]convert|38|L[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|45|L[/tpl] of water. Horses are not ruminants, so they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can digest cellulose, a major component of grass. Cellulose digestion occurs in the cecum, or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.Giffin Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook p. 175

====Senses====

The horses' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 309–310 They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,Sellnow Happy Trails p. 46 and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15938 | title=Eye Position and Animal Agility Study Published|journal = The Horse | date =March 7, 2010 |nopp=Press Release, citing February 2010 Journal of Anatomy, Dr. Nathan Jeffery, co-author, University of Liverpool|accessdate=2010-03-11|author1 = [/tpl] This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9670|title= In Living Color |format=registration required|accessdate=2007-07-27 |author= McDonnell, Sue |work= The Horse |date= June 1, 2007|publisher= The Horse, Inc.[/tpl] 
Their sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment.  Horses have two olfactory centers.  The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors.  The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.[tpl]cite web|last=Briggs|first=Karen|title=Equine Sense of Smell|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10055/equine-sense-of-smell?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=breeding&utm_campaign=12-15-2013|publisher=The Horse|accessdate=2013-12-15|date=2013-12-11[/tpl] 
A horse's hearing is good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.Myers Horse Safe p.7 Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress:  A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music.

===Movement===

All horses move naturally with four basic gaits: the four-beat walk, which averages [tpl]convert|6.4|km/h[/tpl]; the two-beat trot or jog at [tpl]convert|13|to|19|km/h[/tpl] (faster for harness racing horses); the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is [tpl]convert|19|to|24|km/h[/tpl]; and the gallop.Harris Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement p. 32 The gallop averages [tpl]convert|40|to|48|km/h[/tpl],Harris Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement pp. 47–49 but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is [tpl]convert|88|km/h[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aqha.com/Home/Racing/~/media/Files/Racing/Guides%20and%20Information/AQHA%20Racing%20NOG.ashx|title=2011 New Orders Guide|accessdate=2013-08-14|publisher=American Quarter Horse Association[/tpl] Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.Harris Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement p. 50 There also are several four-beat "ambling" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lieberman, Bobbie | year=2007 |title=Easy Gaited Horses|journal=Equus|issue= 359|pages=47–51[/tpl] Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses.[tpl]cite journal |author=Equus Staff  | year=2007 |title=Breeds that Gait|journal=Equus |issue= 359|pages=52–54[/tpl] Often, gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.Harris Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement pp. 50–55

===Behavior===

Horses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/23342/horse-fight-vs-flight-instinct |title=Horse Fight vs Flight Instinct |publisher=eXtension |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2013-04-17[/tpl] They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.McBane A Natural Approach to Horse Management pp. 226–228 Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 305–309 However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.Prince Basic Horsemanship pp. 214–223

====Intelligence and learning====

Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. They also have good spatial discrimination abilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/features/horseintelligence-119.shtml|title=Understanding horse intelligence|author=Clarkson, Neil|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=Horsetalk 2007|publisher=Horsetalk[/tpl] Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory.  Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement. One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between "more or less" if the quantity involved is less than four.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15396 | title=Horses Demonstrate Ability to Count in New Study |author=Lesté-Lasserre, Christa |accessdate=2009-12-06|work=The Horse, Online Edition|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications[/tpl]
Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural. Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/nicanor/archive/2008/06/17/equine-iq-what-big-brown-couldn-t-tell-you-and-mr-ed-kept-to-himself.aspx|title=What Big Brown Couldn't Tell You and Mr. Ed Kept to Himself (part 1)|author=Coarse, Jim|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=The BloodHorse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications[/tpl]

====Temperament====

Horses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy,Belknap Horsewords p. 255 while the "cold-bloods", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer.Belknap Horsewords p. 112 Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 71–73 with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship p. 84
"Hot blooded" breeds include "oriental horses" such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds. Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed. They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.DeFilippis The Everything Horse Care Book p. 4 The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.Whitaker and Whitelaw The Horse p. 43Whitaker and Whitelaw The Horse pp. 194–197
Muscular, heavy draft horses are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people. They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".Price Whole Horse Catalog p. 15 Well-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale. Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World entry 87 Others, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship pp. 124–125 The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.
"Warmblood" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 122–123 Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.Examples are the Australian Riding Pony and the Connemara, see Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 178–179, 208–209 Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".
Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping.Price et al. Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary p. 231 Strictly speaking, the term "warm blood" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.Belknap Horsewords p. 523 Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.Price, et al. Whole Horse Catalog p. 18

====Sleep patterns====

Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "stay apparatus" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.[tpl]cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|title= How Horses Sleep |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch[/tpl] Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.
Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,[tpl]cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title= How Horses Sleep, Pt. 2 – Power Naps|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine|work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch[/tpl] mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship p. 310. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.[tpl]cite journal|title=40 Winks?|author=Holland, Jennifer S. |journal=National Geographic|volume=220|date=July 2011|issue=1[/tpl]
Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.[tpl]cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title= Equine Sleep Disorder Videos|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=EQUUS Magazine Editors |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch[/tpl] This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.Smith Large Animal Internal Medicine pp. 1086–1087

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not.Budiansky The Nature of Horses p. 31 Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), the tapir, and the rhinoceros—have survived to the present day.[tpl]cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Perissodactyla.html|title= Order Perissodactyla|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Myers, Phil|work= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= University of Michigan[/tpl]
The earliest known member of the Equidae family was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/hyraco1.htm|title= Hyracotherium|accessdate=2008-07-09 |work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History[/tpl] The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/mesoh1.htm|title= Mesohippus|accessdate=2008-07-09|work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History[/tpl] Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/horse/?section=evolution&page=evolution_b|title= The Evolution of Horses|accessdate=2008-07-09 |work= The Horse |publisher= American Museum of Natural History[/tpl] known informally as splint bones.Miller Understanding the Ancient Secrets of the Horse's Mind p. 20 Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5 million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/equus1.htm|title= Equus|accessdate=2008-07-09|work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History[/tpl] Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.
By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species. Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America.[tpl]cite journal|last=Weinstock|first=J.|year=2005|title=Evolution, Systematics, and Phylogeography of Pleistocene Horses in the New World: A Molecular Perspective|journal=PLoS Biology|pmid=15974804|volume=3|issue=8|pmc=1159165|pages=e241| doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030241|display-authors=1|last2=Willerslev|first2=Eske|last3=Sher|first3=Andrei|last4=Tong|first4=Wenfei|last5=Ho|first5=Simon Y.W.|last6=Rubenstein|first6=Dan|last7=Storer|first7=John|last8=Burns|first8=James|last9=Martin|first9=Larry[/tpl] Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere.[tpl]cite journal |last=Vila|first=C.|coauthors= et al.|year=2001|title=Widespread Origins of Domestic Horse Lineages|journal=Science|volume=291|doi=10.1126/science.291.5503.474|url=http://www.uky.edu/Ag/Horsemap/Maps/VILA.PDF|format=PDF|pages=474–7|pmid=11161199 |issue=5503[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Luís|first= Cristina|coauthors= et al.|year=2006|title=Iberian Origins of New World Horse Breeds|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=97|issue=2| url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/97/2/107|pages=107–113|doi=10.1093/jhered/esj020|pmid=16489143 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Ancient DNA reveals late survival of mammoth and horse in interior Alaska |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912510106 |author=Haile, James|journal=PNAS|year=2009 |volume=106|issue= 52 |pages=22352–22357|display-authors=1|last2=Froese|first2=D.

===Wild species surviving into modern times===

A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.Olsen "Horse Hunters of the Ice Age" Horses Through Time p. 46 Only two never-domesticated subspecies, the Tarpan and the Przewalski's Horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.
The Przewalski's Horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian Wild Horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people call it a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.zsl.org/about-us/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title= An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date=2005-12-19|accessdate=2012-06-06|work= ZSL Press Releases|publisher= Zoological Society of London[/tpl] Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.treemail.nl/takh/|title= Home|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= The Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse[/tpl]Dohner "Equines: Natural History" Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds pp. 298–299 There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.
The Tarpan or European Wild Horse (Equus ferus ferus) was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo.Dohner "Equines: Natural History" Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds p. 300 Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts have been made to recreate the Tarpan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/tarpan/|title=Tarpan|publisher=Oklahoma State University|work=Breeds of Livestock|accessdate=2009-01-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090116022102/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/TARPAN/|archivedate=2009-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&dat=20020621&id=YiALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yFIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6481,3069519|journal=The Daily Courier|date=June 21, 2002|accessdate=2009-10-21|title=Ponies from the past?: Oregon couple revives prehistoric Tarpan horses|author1=[/tpl] which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.
Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences with domesticated horses.Peissel Tibet p. 36 Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics,[tpl]cite journal| url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/6/663#TBL2 |title=The Origins of Iberian Horses Assessed via Mitochondrial DNA |journal=Journal of Heredity|author=Royo, L.J., I.

===Other modern equids===

Besides the horse, there are seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the mountain zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14100020 |title=Equus hemionus |author=Pallas |year=1775 |work=Wilson & Reeder's mammal species of the world |publisher=Bucknell University |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl]
Horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a jenny (female donkey).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britishmulesociety.org.uk/|title= Mule Information|accessdate=2008-07-10 |work= BMS Website|publisher= British Mule Society[/tpl] Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1408717.stm|title=Zebra hybrid is cute surprise|date=June 26, 2001|accessdate=2010-02-06|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12260255 |title=Befuddling Birth: The Case of the Mule's Foal|accessdate=2008-08-16|work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio[/tpl]

==Domestication==

Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.
The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC.Outram, A.K., Stear, N.A., Bendrey, R., Olsen, S., Kasparov, A., Zaibert, V., Thorpe, N. and Evershed, R.P. 2009 The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking Science. 323(5919): 1332–1335Matossian Shaping World History p. 43 See also: [tpl]cite news |title=Horsey-aeology, Binary Black Holes, Tracking Red Tides, Fish Re-evolution, Walk Like a Man, Fact or Fiction |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2009/03/07/horsey-aeology-binary-black-holes-tracking-red-tides-fish-re-evolution-walk-like-a-man-fact-or-ficti/|work=Quirks and Quarks Podcast with Bob Macdonald |publisher= CBC Radio |date=2009-03-07|accessdate=2010-09-18[/tpl] By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.Evans Horse Breeding and Management p.56 The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.[tpl]cite journal | last = Kuznetsov | first = P.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.Bennett Conquerors p. 7 Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication.Edwards, G. The Arabian pp 1, 3 However, the lack of a detectable substructure  in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.

===Feral populations===

Feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse p. 291Anthony "Bridling Horse Power: The Domestication of the Horse" Horses Through Time pp. 66–67 Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/anthro/olsen_horse.html | author=Olsen, Sandra L.|title= Horses in Prehistory|work=Anthropology Research | publisher=Carnegie Museum of Natural History|accessdate=2008-08-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080525183100/http://www.carnegiemnh.org/anthro/olsen_horse.html |archivedate = May 25, 2008[/tpl] as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15037&src=RA|title=Mares' Social Bonds Might Enhance Reproductive Success|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-21|journal=The Horse|format=Registration required|author=Lesté-Lasserre, Christa[/tpl]
There are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in "wild" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dartmoorcommonerscouncil.org.uk/menu_page.php?id=53 |publisher=Dartmoor Commoners' Council|title=Animals on the Moor|accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl]Fear New Forest Drift p. 75

===Breeds===

The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry.Ensminger Horses and Horsemanship p. 424 Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.Edwards The Arabian pp. 22–23 These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.waho.org/History.html|title= Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |work= WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998|publisher= World Arabian Horse Organization[/tpl] In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian |accessdate=2008-04-29|work= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080312061526/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|archivedate=2008-03-12[/tpl]
Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.Sponenberg "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds" Horses Through Time p. 155 Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage. Heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons.Sponenberg "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds" Horses Through Time pp. 156–57 Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.Sponenberg "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds" Horses Through Time p. 162 Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp|title= History of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2008-04-03|work= Britishhorseracing.com|publisher= British Horseracing Authority[/tpl] There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.Hedge Horse Conformation pp. 307–308

==Interaction with humans==

Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=573#ancor|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-05|title=FAO Stat — Live Animals[/tpl] The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Most Comprehensive Horse Study Ever Reveals A Nearly $40 Billion Impact On The U.S. Economy|accessdate=2005-06-20|work= American Horse Council Press Release|publisher= American Horse Council |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060625083812/http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2006[/tpl] In a 2004 "poll" conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.iol.co.za/news/back-page/tiger-tops-dog-as-world-s-favourite-animal-1.228797|title=Tiger tops dog as world's favourite animal |accessdate=2011-06-01 |work= Independent Online|publisher= Independent[/tpl]
Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.Edwards Horses pp. 32–34 Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,Self Riding Simplified p. 55 and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.Thorson "Rugged Lark" Legends 7 p. 218 Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.Mettler Horse Sense pp. 47–54

===Sport===

Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.Olsen "In the Winner's Circle" Horses Through Time pp. 105, 111–113, 121 Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.Olsen "In the Winner's Circle" Horses Through Time p. 105
Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 346–356, 366–371 Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as "In-hand" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 376–377
Sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse p. 360 Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,Collins Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports pp. 173–174 and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.
Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 332–337 A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.Campbell National Gambling Impact Study Commission Final Report p. 111

===Work===

There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/uspp/fhorsepage.htm |title= Horse Mounted Unit|accessdate=2008-04-07|work= United States Park Police|publisher= National Park Service[/tpl] Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.Edwards The Encyclopedia of the Horse pp. 226–227 Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sbcsheriff.org/msru_job.html|title= Volunteer Mounted Search and Rescue Unit|accessdate=2008-07-08|work= Employment|publisher= San Benito County Sheriff's Office[/tpl] Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/publications/success_story_updates/2003-05.pdf |format=PDF|title=Success Stories |accessdate=2008-04-20 |author=US Forest Service |date=May 2003 |chapter=Mules Key in Accomplishing Trail Work |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |page=4 [/tpl]

===Entertainment and culture===

Modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.blackhorsetroop.org/activities/|title= Unit Activities|accessdate=2008-04-29|author= Stoddard, Samuel |work= Co H, 4th Virginia Cavalry|publisher= Washington Webworks, LLC[/tpl] Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes.

===Therapeutic use===

People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.Bush, et al. The Principles of Teaching Riding p. 58 The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage|title= About Para Equestrian Dressage|accessdate=2010-03-07 |publisher= Federation Equestre Internationale[/tpl] Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.narha.org/PDFFiles/FAQ_Hippotherapy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Frequently Asked Questions About Hippotherapy|accessdate=2008-07-08 |work= FAQ – AHA, April 2005|publisher= American Hippotherapy Association |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070919090815/http://www.narha.org/PDFFiles/FAQ_Hippotherapy.pdf |archivedate = September 19, 2007[/tpl]
Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp|title=Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-07-08 |publisher= Equine Facilitated Mental Health Association |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430025532/http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp |archivedate = April 30, 2008[/tpl] There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings.

===Products===

Horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.
Products collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/25/050425fa_fact4|title= Invaders: Destroying Baghdad|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author= Frazier, Ian |journal= The New Yorker|publisher= CondeNet[/tpl] Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling.
