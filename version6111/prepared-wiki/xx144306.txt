==History==

The Adelaide Christmas Pageant was founded by Sir Edward Hayward, owner of the Adelaide department store John Martin's, who was inspired by the Toronto Santa Claus Parade and Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Sly |title=Spirit of Johnnies lives on |url=http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_10_29/history_story1.shtml | publisher=The Adelaide Review |date=2004-10-29 | accessdate=2006-10-16[/tpl] He opened the first pageant on 18 November 1933 at the height of the Great Depression. It was a success; running for around 40 minutes with just 8 floats and 3 bands, it attracted 200,000 spectators.[tpl]cite web | title=Adelaide's First Pageant | publisher=Credit Union Christmas Pageant| date=2006-10-20 | url=http://www.cupageant.com.au/history_first_pageant.php | accessdate=2006-10-20 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Father Christmas was introduced in 1934 and tradition of the pageant finishing at the Magic Cave (itself created in 1905) was established.[tpl]cite web | title=Credit Union Pageant Tradition | publisher=Credit Union Christmas Pageant| date=2006-10-20 | url=http://www.cupageant.com.au/history_cu_pageant_tradition.php | accessdate=2006-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070306222018/http://www.cupageant.com.au/history_cu_pageant_tradition.php  |archivedate = 2007-03-06[/tpl]
During the war years of 1941-1944, the pageant was in abeyance. It was restored in 1945. By 1969, the event had grown significantly, with attendances reaching 500,000 and television broadcasting commencing. In 1979, the largest induction of new floats took place, with 16 joining the pageant.
In 1985, John Martin's was acquired by David Jones Limited, who continued the pageant under the John Martin's name. However, with the collapse of the Adelaide Steamship Group (of which David Jones was a significant member), and the public float of the David Jones retailing arm, in the mid-1990s the South Australian Government acquired the event. It sought sponsorship from the South Australian business community, and in 1996 sold the naming rights to the six South Australian Credit Unions: Australian Central, Savings & Loans,Christmas Pageant, Savings & Loans Credit Union Community CPS,Credit Union Christmas Pageant, Community CPS Credit Union PowerState,Christmas Pageant competition, PowerState Credit Union SatisfacAbout the Christmas Pageant, Satisfac Credit Union and the Police Credit Union. Today, the pageant is managed by Events South Australia,The people behind the Credit Union Christmas Pageant, cupageant.com.au a division of the South Australian Tourism Commission. As a result of mergers, the current naming right sponsors are People's Choice Credit Union, Beyond Bank Australia, Credit Union SA and Police Credit Union.[tpl]cite web|title=Pageant Partners|url=http://www.cupageant.com.au/pageant-partners.htm|publisher=Credit Union Christmas Pageant[/tpl]
