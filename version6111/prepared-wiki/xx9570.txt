Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock.
It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimum crystal growth.  Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high silica content) induces a high viscosity and polymerization degree of the lava. The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Obsidian is hard and brittle; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges, which had been used in the past in cutting and piercing tools, and has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.[tpl]cite book|author1=Brian Cotterell|author2=Johan Kamminga|title=Mechanics of pre-industrial technology: an introduction to the mechanics of ancient and traditional material culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0-xOM8y6Uc8C&pg=PA127|accessdate=9 September 2011|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42871-2|pages=127–[/tpl]

Tektites were once thought by many to be obsidian produced by lunar volcanic eruptions, though few scientists now adhere to this hypothesis.
Obsidian is mineral-like, but not a true mineral because as a glass it is not crystalline; in addition, its composition is too complex to comprise a single mineral. It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid. Though obsidian is usually dark in color similar to mafic rocks such as basalt, obsidian's composition is extremely felsic. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), usually 70% or more. Crystalline rocks with obsidian's composition include granite and rhyolite. Because obsidian is metastable at the Earth's surface (over time the glass becomes fine-grained mineral crystals), no obsidian has been found that is older than Cretaceous age. This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water.
Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance, though the color varies depending on the presence of impurities. Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark brown to black color. Very few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, the inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals of cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (snowflake obsidian). It may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (sheen obsidian). An iridescent, rainbow-like sheen (rainbow obsidian) is caused by inclusions of magnetite nanoparticles (Nadin, 2007).[tpl]cite journal |last=Nadin |first=E. |year=2007 |title= The secret lives of minerals |work=Engineering & Science, No. 1, 10-20 |url= http://www.its.caltech.edu/~chima/publications/Secret_Lives_of_Minerals.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]

==Occurrence==

Obsidian can be found in locations which have experienced rhyolitic eruptions. It can be found in Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Chile, Georgia, Greece, El Salvador, Guatemala, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Scotland, Turkey and the United States. Obsidian flows which may be hiked on are found within the calderas of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America, and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada in California. Yellowstone National Park has a mountainside containing obsidian located between Mammoth Hot Springs and the Norris Geyser Basin, and deposits can be found in many other western U.S. states including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Washington,Washington Obsidian Source Map.

Obsidian can also be found in the eastern U.S. states of Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

The first archaeological evidence known of usage were made from within Kariandusi and other sites of the Acheulian age (beginning 1.5 million years previously) dated 700,000 BC, although the number of objects found at these sites were very low relative to the Neolithic.S Bunny.

Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture. It was also polished to create early mirrors. Modern archaeologists have developed a relative dating system, obsidian hydration dating, to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts.

===Americas===

Lithic analysis can be instrumental in understanding prehispanic groups in Mesoamerica. A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of considerable use to reconstruct commerce, production, distribution and thereby understand economic, social and political aspects of a civilization. This is the case in Yaxchilán, a Maya city where even warfare implications have been studied linked with obsidian use and its debris.Brokmann, Carlos, Tipología y análisis de la obsidiana de Yaxchilán, Chiapas, Colección Científica, no. 422, INAH, 2000 Another example is the archeological recovery at coastal Chumash sites in California indicating considerable trade with the distant site of Casa Diablo, California in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.C.

Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans' use of obsidian was extensive and sophisticated; including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects.  Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a macuahuitl, the weapon was capable of inflicting terrible injuries, combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon.
Native American people traded obsidian throughout the Americas. Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian, making it possible for archaeologists to trace the origins of a particular artifact. Similar tracing techniques have allowed obsidian to be identified in Greece also as coming from Melos, Nisyros or Yiali, islands in the Aegean Sea. Obsidian cores and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

Obsidian was also used on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) for edged tools such as Mataia and the pupils of the eyes of their Moai (statues).

==Current use==

Though not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans, obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, as well-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick.[tpl]cite journal |last = Buck |first = BA|authorlink = |coauthors = |date=March 1982|title = Ancient Technology in Contemporary Surgery|journal = The Western journal of medicine|volume = 136|issue = 3|pages = 265–269|pmid= 7046256|pmc = 1273673[/tpl] Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even.[tpl]cite book|last=Haviland|first=W.A.|coauthors=Prins H.E.L., Walrath D. & McBride B.|title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|edition=13|pages=196|isbn=9780495810841|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fm2RY5ZKmDIC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=%22payson+sheets%22+obsidian+blade&source=bl&ots=lPEVk9xhIE&sig=2eQYjt85YyzkTbykp1nbQBEHLGk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VqxkUN-DHMGv0QWVm4C4Aw&sqi=2&ved=0CFYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22payson%20sheets%22%20obsidian%20blade&f=false|accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl] One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at 7 days, in a group of rats.[tpl]cite journal |last = Disa |first = JJ|authorlink = |coauthors = Vossoughi, J; Goldberg, NH|date=October 1993|title = A comparison of obsidian and surgical steel scalpel wound healing in rats|journal = Plastic and reconstructive surgery|volume = 92|issue = 5|pages = 884–887|pmid = 8415970|doi = 10.1097/00006534-199392050-00015[/tpl] Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject.

Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone. It possesses the property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut: when cut in one direction it is jet black; in another it is glistening gray. "Apache tears" are small rounded obsidian nuggets embedded within a grayish-white perlite matrix.
Plinths for audio turntables have been made of obsidian since the 1970s; e.g. the grayish-black SH-10B3 plinth by Technics.
