==Childhood, education and personal life==

Wolf was born in San Francisco, to a Jewish family.Wolf, in an interview on The Alex Jones Show podcast October 22, 08 @ 2:40:38 into the program: "Well, you know, I'm Jewish and so, you know, I think there's this very deep reaction in people with my ancestry because my dad's family was largely wiped out by the holocaust, a sensitivity to travel restrictions because for people of my ethnicity there's a giant divide between people who got out before the border hardened during the National Nazi Socialist regime and those who waited a little too long. So I watch with concern when I travel, the growth of the US watchlist which is growing by 20,000 names a month..."[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-05-15/books/17371864_1_naomi-wolf-tree-house-father |title=Naomi Wolf starts listening to her dad / 12 tidy lessons in wisdom of the heart |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=August 21, 2009 |work=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Bob |last=Blaisdell[/tpl] Her mother is Deborah Goleman, an anthropologist and the author of The Lesbian Community.[tpl]cite news|last=Hix|first=Lisa|title=Did Father Know Best?

She attended Lowell High School and debated in regional speech tournaments as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Wolf then attended Yale University where in 1984, she received her Bachelor of Arts in English literature. From 1985 to 1987, she was a Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford.[tpl]cite web|title=Naomi Wolf (biography and blog)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-wolf|work=Huffington Post |accessdate=December 15, 2010[/tpl]
In 2004, Wolf worked to report an incident of "sexual encroachment" by professor Harold Bloom she had experienced when she was a Yale undergraduate working on poetry with Bloom. Frustrated in her efforts to gain satisfaction that the university would take such an incident seriously, Wolf made her complaint public.
Wolf was married to former Clinton speechwriter David Shipley. They have two children, Rosa (b. 1995) and Joseph (b. 2000).

==Works==

===The Beauty Myth===

In the early 1990s, Wolf garnered international fame as a spokesperson of third-wave feminismProject Syndicate "The Next Wave."Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth. New York: Bantham Doubleday Dell Publishing, 1991; p. 281: "The beauty myth can be defeated only through an electric resurgence of the woman-centered political activism of the seventies—a feminist third wave—updated to take on the new issues of the nineties...I've become convinced that here are thousands of young women ready and eager to join forces with a peer-driven feminist third wave that would take on, along with the classic feminist agenda, the new problems that have arisen with the shift in Zeitgeist and beauty backlash." as a result of the success of her first book The Beauty Myth, which became an international bestseller. In the book, she argues that "beauty" as a normative value is entirely socially constructed, and that the patriarchy determines the content of that construction with the goal of reproducing its own hegemony.
Wolf posits the idea of an "iron-maiden," an intrinsically unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it. Wolf criticized the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but added that the beauty myth extended into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have "the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically". Wolf argues that women were under assault by the "beauty myth" in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty.The Beauty Myth, pp. 17–18, 20, 86, 131, 179, 218. In her introduction, Wolf positioned her argument against the concerns of second-wave feminists and offered the following analysis:
Wolf's book was a bestseller, receiving polarized responses from the public and mainstream media, but winning praise from most feminists. Second-wave feminist Germaine Greer wrote that The Beauty Myth was "the most important feminist publication since The Female Eunuch, and Gloria Steinem wrote, "The Beauty Myth is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it."[tpl]cite web|last=Abbott |first=Carl |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780385423977-7 |title=Reviews |publisher=Powells.com |accessdate=October 20, 2011[/tpl] British novelist Fay Weldon called the book "essential reading for the New Woman".Kim Hubbard, The Tyranny of Beauty, To Naomi Wolf, Pressure to Look Good Equals Oppression, People, June 24, 1991. Betty Friedan wrote in Allure magazine that "'The Beauty Myth' and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness."
However, Camille Paglia, whose Sexual Personae was published the same year as The Beauty Myth, derided Wolf as unable to perform "historical analysis", and called her education "completely removed from reality".Paglia, Camille. Sex, Art, and American Culture. New York: Random House, 1992. p. 262 Her comments touched off a series of contentious debates between Wolf and Paglia in the pages of The New Republic.Naomi Wolf. "Feminist Fatale." The New Republic. March 16, 1992. pp. 23–25Camille Paglia. "Wolf Pack." The New Republic. April 13, 1992. pp. 4–5Naomi Wolf and Camille Paglia. "The Last Words." The New Republic. May 18, 1992. pp. 4–5
Likewise, Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for publishing the estimate that 150,000 women were dying every year from anorexia. Sommers wrote that the actual number is closer to 100, a figure which others, such as Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards, stated to be much too low. In the same interview, Sommers stated that Wolf had retracted the figure.Think Tank. "Has Feminism Gone too Far?"
In the mainstream press, The New York Times published a harshly critical assessment of Wolf's work: Caryn James lambasted the book as a "sloppily researched polemic as dismissible as a hackneyed adventure film...Even by the standards of pop-cultural feminist studies, 'The Beauty Myth' is a mess."Caryn, James. The New York Times. "Feminine Beauty as a Masculine Plot." In a comparatively positive review, The Washington Post called the book "persuasive" and praised its "accumulated evidence."Yalom, Marilyn. The Washington Post. "Feminism's Latest Makeover."

===Promiscuities===

Promiscuities reports on and analyzes the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature is rife with examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth, and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Promiscuities |location=New York |publisher=Balantine Publishing Group |year=1997 |oclc=473694368[/tpl]
Promiscuities received, in general, negative reviews. The New York Times published a review that characterized Wolf as a "frustratingly inept messenger: a sloppy thinker and incompetent writer. She tries in vain to pass off tired observations as radical aperçus, subjective musings as generational truths, sappy suggestions as useful ideas".[tpl]cite news |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DB133CF933A25755C0A961958260 |title=Feminism Lite: She Is Woman, Hear Her Roar |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 10, 1997[/tpl] Two days earlier, however, a different Times reviewer praised the book, writing, "Anyone—particularly anyone who, like Ms. Wolf, was born in the 1960s—will have a very hard time putting down 'Promiscuities'. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire."[tpl]cite news |first=Courtney |last=Weaver |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDD133AF93BA35755C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Growing Up Sexual |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 1997[/tpl] In contrast, The Library Journal excoriated the work, writing, "Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation....There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument."The Library Journal, June 1997.

===Misconceptions===

Misconceptions examines modern assumptions surrounding pregnancy and childbirth. Most of the book is told through the prism of Wolf's personal experience of her first pregnancy. She describes the "vacuous impassivity" of the ultrasound technician who gives her the first glimpse of her new baby. Wolf both laments her C-section and examines why the procedure is commonplace in the United States, and advocates a return to more personal approaches to childbirth such as midwifery. The second half of the book catalogs a series of anecdotes about life after giving birth, focusing in particular on inequalities that arise in men and women's approaches and adjustments to child care.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-385-49302-4[/tpl]

===The End of America===

In The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot, Wolf takes a historical look at the rise of fascism, outlining 10 steps necessary for a fascist group (or government) to destroy the democratic character of a nation-state and subvert the social/political liberty previously exercised by its citizens:
The book details how this pattern was implemented in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and elsewhere, and analyzes its emergence and application of all the 10 steps in American political affairs since the September 11 attacks.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot |location=White River, VT |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-933392-79-0[/tpl]
The End of America was adapted for the screen as a documentary by filmmakers Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern, best known for The Devil Came on Horseback and The Trials of Darryl Hunt. It had its worldwide premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 17, 2008. It has since been screened at Sheffield DocFest in the UK, as well as in limited release at New York City's IFC Center. The film became available online on October 21, 2008 at SnagFilms.

===Give Me Liberty===

Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries was written as a sequel to The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot.
In the book, Wolf looks at times and places in history where citizens were faced with the closing of an open society and successfully fought back, and looks back at the ordinary people of the Founding Fathers of the United States' generation, the ones not named by history, all of whom had this "vision of liberty" and moved it forward by putting their lives on the line to make the vision real. She is an outspoken advocate for citizenship and wonders whether younger Americans have the skills and commitment to act as true citizens. She wrote in 2007:

===Vagina: A New Biography===

Published in 2012 on the topic of the vagina, Vagina: A New Biography was widely criticized, especially by feminist authors. Calling it "ludicrous" at Slate.com, Katie Roiphe wrote, "I doubt the most brilliant novelist in the world could have created a more skewering satire of Naomi Wolf’s career than her latest book."Roiphe, Katie, "Naomi Wolf’s New Book About Her Vagina: It’s as ludicrous as you think it is.", Slate.com, September 10, 2012. In The Nation, Katha Pollitt said the book was "silly" and contained "much dubious neuroscience and much foolishness"; she concluded, "It’s lucky vaginas can’t read, or mine would be cringing in embarrassment."Pollitt, Katha, " Naomi Wolf's 'Vagina': No Carnations, Please, We're Goddesses", The Nation, September 12, 2012. Although writing that "Wolf’s ideas and suggestions in 'Vagina' are valuable ones," Toni Bentley said in The New York Times Book Review that the book contained "shoddy" research and "is undermined by the fact that she has rendered herself less than unreliable over the past couple of decades, with one rant more hysterical than another."[tpl]cite news|last=Bentley|first=Toni|title=Upstairs, Downstairs ‘Vagina: A New Biography,’ by Naomi Wolf|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/vagina-a-new-biography-by-naomi-wolf.html?pagewanted=1&ref=books|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 14, 2012[/tpl] Los Angeles Times columnist Meghan Daum decried the book’s "painful" writing and its "hoary ideas about how women think."Daum, Meghan, "Daum: Naomi Wolf's vaginal sideshow", Los Angeles Times, September 13, 2012. In The New York Observer, Nina Burleigh suggested that critics of the book were so vehement "because (a) their editors handed the book to them for review because they thought it was an Important Feminist Book when it's actually slight and (b) there’s a grain of truth in what she’s trying to say."Burleigh, Nina, "Who’s Afraid of Vagina Wolf? Why Female Critics Are Piling On", New York Observer, September 13, 2012.
In response to the criticism, Wolf stated the following in a television interview:
 ...anything that shows documentation of the brain and vagina connection is going to alarm some feminists... ...also feminism has kind of retreated into the academy and sort of embraced the idea that all gender is socially constructed and so here is a book that is actually looking at science... ... though there has been some criticisms of the book from some feminists ... who say, well you can’t look at the science because that means we have to grapple with the science... ... to me the feminist task of creating a just world isn’t changed at all by this fascinating neuroscience that shows some differences between men and women.Allen Gregg TV interview "Naomi Wolf on her new book, Vagina: A New Biography", January 18, 2013.

Wolf's other books include Fire with Fire on politics, female empowerment and women's sexual liberation.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Fire with Fire |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-679-42718-6[/tpl] The New York Times assailed the work for its "dubious oversimplifications and highly debatable assertions" and its "disconcerting penchant for inflationary prose," nonetheless noting Wolf's "efforts to articulate an accessible, pragmatic feminism, ...helping to replace strident dogma with common sense."[tpl]cite news|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DB1E39F930A35751C1A965958260&scp=1&sq=naomi%20wolf%20fire%20with%20fire&st=cse |title=Books of The Times; Helpful Hints for an Era of Practical Feminism|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 3, 1993[/tpl] The Time magazine reviewer dismissed the book as "flawed," noting however that Wolf was "an engaging raconteur" who was also "savvy about the role of TV – especially the Thomas-Hill hearings and daytime talk shows – in radicalizing women, including homemakers." The reviewer characterized the book as advocating an inclusive strain of feminism that welcomed abortion opponents.[tpl]cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Martha|title=Tremors of Genderquake|journal=Time|date=Dec 27, 1993|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979918,00.html|accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, Wolf published The Treehouse: Eccentric Wisdom from my Father on How to Live, Love, and See, which chronicled her midlife crisis attempt to reclaim her creative and poetic vision and revalue her father's love, and her father's force as an artist and a teacher.

==Feminist positions==

In publishing an article in The New Republic that criticized contemporary pro-choice positions, Wolf argued that the movement had "developed a lexicon of dehumanization" and urged feminists to accept abortion as a form of homicide and defend the procedure within the ambiguity of this moral conundrum. She continues, "Abortion should be legal; it is sometimes even necessary. Sometimes the mother must be able to decide that the fetus, in its full humanity, must die."[tpl]cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |journal=The New Republic |title=Our Bodies, Our Souls |volume=213 |issue=16 |pages=26–35 |date=Oct 16, 1995 |postscript=,[/tpl] reprinted here http://www.priestsforlife.org/prochoice/ourbodiesoursouls.htm.
Wolf concluded by speculating that in a world of "real gender equality," passionate feminists "might well hold candlelight vigils at abortion clinics, standing shoulder to shoulder with the doctors who work there, commemorating and saying goodbye to the dead." More recently, in an article on the subtle manipulation of George W. Bush's image among women, Wolf wrote "Abortion is an issue not of Ms. Magazine-style fanaticism or suicidal Republican religious reaction, but a complex issue."[tpl]cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/columns/thesexes/9911/ |title=Female Trouble |date=May 21, 2005 |journal=New York magazine[/tpl]
Pro-life commentators said Wolf "fails to carry through fully in her analysis...this simply is not, or should not be, the unqualified response of our society to the destruction of innocent life."[tpl]cite journal |first1=Kathryn |last1=Getek |first2=Mark |last2=Cunningham |title=A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing: Language and the Abortion Debate |journal=Princeton Progressive Review |date=February 1996 |postscript=,[/tpl] reprinted here http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~rauch/nvp/consistent/naomi_wolf.html.
Wolf suggested in 2003 that the ubiquity of Internet pornography tends to enervate the sexual attraction of men toward typical real women. She writes, "The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women, and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as 'porn-worthy.' Far from having to fend off porn-crazed young men, young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood, they can scarcely get, let alone hold, their attention." Wolf advocates abstaining from porn not on moral grounds, but because "greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity."[tpl]cite news|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|title=The Porn Myth|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/nymetro/news/trends/n_9437/|newspaper=New York Magazine |date=October 20, 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AujtfvsI|archivedate=September 24, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
Wolf has examined how Western women, born in inclusive, egalitarian liberal democracies, are assuming positions of leadership in neofascist political movements:
[tpl]quotation|Second-wave feminist theory abounds in assertions that war, racism, love of hierarchy, and general repressiveness belong to “patriarchy”; women’s leadership, by contrast, would naturally create a more inclusive, collaborative world. The problem is that it has never worked out that way, as the rise of women to leadership positions in Western Europe’s far-right parties should remind us. Leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front, Pia Kjaersgaard of Danish People's Party, and Siv Jensen of Norway’s Progress Party reflect the enduring appeal of neofascist movements to many modern women in egalitarian, inclusive liberal democracies.[tpl]cite news |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |date=March 31, 2008 |newspaper=Project Syndicate |title=Fascism with a Feminist Face |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/naomi-wolf-examines-the-rise-of-women-to-leadership-positions-in-major-far-right-european-political-parties[/tpl][/tpl]
Wolf has spoken about the dress required of women living in Muslim countries:
[tpl]quotation|The West interprets veiling as repression of women and suppression of their sexuality. But when I traveled in Muslim countries and was invited to join a discussion in women-only settings within Muslim homes, I learned that Muslim attitudes toward women's appearance and sexuality are not rooted in repression, but in a strong sense of public versus private, of what is due to God and what is due to one's husband. It is not that Islam suppresses sexuality, but that it embodies a strongly developed sense of its appropriate channeling – toward marriage, the bonds that sustain family life, and the attachment that secures a home.[tpl]cite news |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |date=August 30, 2008 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Behind the veil lives a thriving Muslim sexuality |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/behind-the-veil-lives-a-thriving-muslim-sexuality/2008/08/29/1219516734637.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1[/tpl][/tpl]
The December 20, 2010 airing of Democracy Now! featured a segment titled "Naomi Wolf vs. Jaclyn Friedman: Feminists Debate the Sexual Allegations Against Julian Assange" in which Jaclyn Friedman argues the sexual assault allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange shouldn't be dismissed just because they may be politically motivated. Wolf argues that the alleged victims should have said no, that they consented to having sex with Assange, that the charges are politically motivated and demean the cause of legitimate rape victims.

=="Sexual encroachment" incident at Yale==

In 2004 Wolf wrote an article for New York Magazine accusing literary scholar Harold Bloom of a sexual "encroachment" more than two decades earlier, by touching her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge."[tpl]Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|title=The Silent Treatment|journal=New York (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]New York|date=March 1, 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/ |accessdate=May 19, 2010[/tpl]
Reflecting on Yale University's sexual harassment guidelines, Wolf writes, "Sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission."
A formal complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights on March 15, 2011, by 16 current and former Yale students—12 female and 4 male—describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale. A federal investigation of Yale University began in March 2011 in response to the complaints.Gassó, Jordi, "Yale under federal investigation for possible Title IX violations", Yale Daily News, April 1–2, 2011. Retrieved 2012-09-21. "Wolf said on CBS's The Early Show: 'Yale has been systematically covering up much more serious crimes than the ones that can be easily identified. What they do is that they use the sexual harassment grievance procedure in a very cynical way, purporting to be supporting victims, but actually using a process to stonewall victims, to isolate them, and to protect the university'", as quoted in the Daily Mail."Feminist author Naomi Wolf accuses Yale of covering up sexual harassment as federal probe is launched", Daily Mail, 5 April 2011. Retrieved 2012-09-21. Yale settled the Federal complaint in June 2012, acknowledging "inadequacies" but not "facing disciplinary action with the understanding that it keeps in place policy changes instituted after the complaint was filed. The school must report on its progress to the Office of Civil Rights until May 2014."Ariosto, David; Remizowski, Leigh. "Yale settles sexual harassment complaint", CNN, June 15, 2012.

On Sunday morning, October 31, just four days after the jeering of Gore, the magazine released a news report headlined, "GORE'S SECRET GURU."

In the piece, Michael Duffy and Karen Tumulty reported an underwhelming fact: Author Naomi Wolf, the "secret guru" in question, was advising the Gore campaign-had been doing so since January. Within days, this underwhelming piece of news had turned into a major press frenzy. For the next month, Gore and Wolf would be relentlessly trashed, in ways which were often remarkably ugly and often profoundly inane.[/tpl] According to a report by Michael Duffy in Time, Wolf was paid a monthly salary of $15,000 "in exchange for advice on everything from how to win the women's vote to shirt-and-tie combinations."

In an interview with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times, Wolf denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe.

I used those terms as shorthand in talking about the difference in their job descriptions".[tpl]cite news |last=Henneberger |first=Melinda |date=November 5, 1999 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DC1F3BF936A35752C1A96F958260 |title=Naomi Wolf, Feminist Consultant to Gore, Clarifies Her Campaign Role |newspaper=New York Times |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AulS7P2t |archivedate=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Occupy Wall Street==

On October 20, 2011, Wolf was arrested in New York during the Occupy Wall Street protests. She was held in custody for an hour.[tpl]cite news|author=Wells, Matt |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/19/naomi-wolf-occupy-wall-street-arrested |title=Occupy Wall St: Naomi Wolf condemns 'Stalinist' erosion of protest rights |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= October 19, 2011|accessdate=October 20, 2011 [/tpl]  Speaking about her arrest, Wolf said, "I was taken into custody for disobeying an unlawful order.  The issue is that I actually know New York City permit law ... I didn’t choose to get myself arrested. I chose to obey the law and that didn’t protect me."[tpl]cite news|author=Cherkis, Jason |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/19/naomi-wolf-arrest-occupy-wall-street_n_1020986.html |title=Author Naomi Wolf Speaks Out About Her Arrest At Occupy Wall Street Protest |work=The Huffington Post |location=London |date= October 19, 2011|accessdate=August 21, 2011 [/tpl]
A month later, Wolf wrote an article that argued that attacks on the Occupy movement were a coordinated plot, orchestrated by federal law enforcement agencies and implemented by American mayors.[tpl]cite news|author=Wolf, Naomi | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/25/shocking-truth-about-crackdown-occupy |title=The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= November 25, 2011|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012 [/tpl] The response to this article ranged from praise to criticism of Wolf for being overly speculative and creating a "conspiracy theory".[tpl]cite news|author=Wolf, Naomi | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/28/naomi-wolf-reception-responses-critics |title=Naomi Wolf: reception, responses, critics |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= November 28, 2011|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012 [/tpl] Wolf responded that there is ample evidence for her argument, and proceeded to review the information available to her at the time of the article, and new evidence since that time.[tpl]cite news|author=Wolf, Naomi | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/02/crackdown-occupy-controversy-rebuttal-naomi-wolf |title=The crackdown on Occupy controversy: a rebuttal |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= December 2, 2011|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012 [/tpl]
In early 2012, Wikileaks began publishing the Global Intelligence Files, a trove of e-mails obtained via a hack by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond. Among them was an email with an official Department of Homeland Security document from October 2011 attached. The document revealed that DHS was watching Occupy nationally closely and considered it a national security threat. Still, this was not yet enough evidence to prove that DHS had coordinated the crackdown upon the encampments; that would come at the end of the year.
In late December 2012, FBI documents released following a FOIA request from the Partnership for Civil Justice validated Wolf's argument; a coordinated plot to crush Occupy was revealed. It involved the FBI, Homeland Security and private banking institutions.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/nyregion/occupy-movement-was-investigated-by-fbi-counterterrorism-agents-records-show.html | title=F.B.I.
