==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Stephen Cook awarded the album 4 stars and states "listeners new to the work of Kenny Dorham should definitely consider this somewhat overlooked Riverside date from 1959. The set features plenty of Dorham's varied and sophisticated horn work and four of his top-drawer originals... Essential listening for Dorham fans".Cook, S. Allmusic Review accessed 19 October 2009 The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3 stars stating "Dorham enjoyed a brief resurgence towards the end of the '50s".[tpl]cite book|last = Cook|first = Richard|authorlink = Richard Cook (journalist)|coauthors = Brian Morton|title = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings|origyear = 1992|edition = 8th|series = The Penguin Guide to Jazz|year = 2006|publisher = Penguin|location = London|isbn = 978-0-141-02327-4|pages = 365[/tpl]
