[[Fractal compression]]

CATEGORIES: Image compression, Lossy compression algorithms, Fractals

Fractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on fractals. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] Fractal algorithms convert these parts into mathematical data called "fractal codes" which are used to recreate the encoded image.

==Iterated Function Systems==

Fractal image representation can be described mathematically as an iterated function system (IFS).

===For Binary Images===

According to these mapping functions, the IFS describes a two-dimensional set S as the fixed point of the Hutchinson operator
That is, H is an operator mapping sets to sets, and S is the unique set satisfying H(S) = S. The idea is to construct the IFS such that this set S is the input binary image. The set S can be recovered from the IFS by fixed point iteration: for any nonempty compact initial set A0, the iteration Ak+1 = H(Ak) converges to S. 
The set S is self-similar because H(S) = S implies that S is a union of mapped copies of itself:
So we see the IFS is a fractal representation of S.

===Extension to Grayscale===

===Encoding===

A challenging problem of ongoing research in fractal image representation is how to choose the ƒ1,...,ƒN such that its fixed point approximates the input image, and how to do this efficiently. A simple approach for doing so is the following:
In the second step, it is important to find a similar block so that the IFS accurately represents the input image, so a sufficient number of candidate blocks for Di need to be considered. On the other hand, a large search considering many blocks is computationally costly. 
This bottleneck of searching for similar blocks is why fractal encoding is much slower than for example DCT and wavelet based image representations.

==Features==

With fractal compression, encoding is extremely computationally expensive because of the search used to find the self-similarities. Decoding, however is quite fast. While this asymmetry has so far made it impractical for real time applications, when video is archived for distribution from disk storage or file downloads fractal compression becomes more competitive.
At common compression ratios, up to about 50:1, Fractal compression
provides similar results to DCT-based algorithms such as JPEG.
 At high compression ratios fractal compression may offer superior quality. For satellite imagery, ratios of over 170:1 have been achieved with acceptable results. Fractal video compression ratios of 25:1-244:1 have been achieved in reasonable compression times (2.4 to 66 sec/frame).Fractal encoding of video sequences 
Compression efficiency increases with higher image complexity and color depth, compared to simple grayscale images.

===Resolution independence and fractal scaling===

An inherent feature of fractal compression is that images become resolution independentWalking, Talking Web Byte Magazine article on fractal compression/resolution independence after being converted to fractal code. This is because the iterated function systems in the compressed file scale indefinitely. This indefinite scaling property of a fractal is known as "fractal scaling".

===Fractal interpolation===

The resolution independence of a fractal-encoded image can be used to increase the display resolution of an image. This process is also known as "fractal interpolation". In fractal interpolation, an image is encoded into fractal codes via fractal compression, and subsequently decompressed at a higher resolution. The result is an up-sampled image in which iterated function systems have been used as the interpolant.Interpolation decoding method with variable parameters for fractal image compression College of Mathematics and Physics, Chongqing University, China

==History==

Michael Barnsley led development of fractal compression in 1987, and was granted several patents on the technology.[tpl]US patent|4941193[/tpl] – Barnsley and Sloan's first iterated function system patent, filed in October 1987 The most widely known practical fractal compression algorithm was invented by Barnsley and Alan Sloan. Barnsley's graduate student Arnaud Jacquin implemented the first automatic algorithm in software in 1992.Using Fractal Coding to Index Image Content for a Digital Library Tech reportArnaud E. Jacquin. Image Coding Based on a Fractal Theory of Iterated Contractive Image Transformations. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 1(1), 1992. All methods are based on the fractal transform using iterated function systems. Michael Barnsley and Alan Sloan formed Iterated Systems Inc.Iterated Systems Inc. changed its name to MediaBin Inc. Inc. in 2001 and in turn was bought out by Interwoven, Inc. in 2003) in 1987 which was granted over 20 additional patents related to fractal compression. 
A major breakthrough for Iterated Systems Inc. was the automatic fractal transform process which eliminated the need for human intervention during compression as was the case in early experimentation with fractal compression technology. In 1992 Iterated Systems Inc. received a $2.1 million government grantgovernment grant to develop a prototype digital image storage and decompression chip using fractal transform image compression technology.
Fractal image compression has been used in a number of commercial applications: onOne Software, developed under license from Iterated Systems Inc., Genuine Fractals 5Genuine Fractals Product Review which is a Photoshop plugin capable of saving files in compressed FIF (Fractal Image Format). To date the most successful use of still fractal image compression is by Microsoft in its Encarta multimedia encyclopedia,Mathematics Awareness Week - April 1998 reference to Microsoft's Encarta fractal image compression also under license. 
Iterated Systems Inc. supplied a shareware encoder (Fractal Imager), a stand alone decoder, a Netscape plug-in decoder and a development package for use under Windows. As wavelet-based methods of image compression improved and were more easily licensed by commercial software vendors the adoption of the Fractal Image Format failed to evolve.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] The redistribution of the "decompressor DLL" provided by the ColorBox III SDK was governed by restrictive per-disk or year-by-year licensing regimes for proprietary software vendors and by a discretionary scheme that entailed the promotion of the Iterated Systems products for certain classes of other users.[tpl]cite news | title=The big squeeze | last=Aitken | first=William | journal=Personal Computer World |date=May 1994 [/tpl]
During the 1990s Iterated Systems Inc. and its partners expended considerable resources to bring fractal compression to video. While compression results were promising, computer hardware of that time lacked the processing power for fractal video compression to be practical beyond a few select usages. Up to 15 hours were required to compress a single minute of video.
ClearVideo — also known as RealVideo (Fractal) — and SoftVideo were early fractal video compression products. ClearFusion was Iterated's freely distributed streaming video plugin for web browsers. In 1994 SoftVideo was licensed to Spectrum Holobyte for use in its CD-ROM games including Falcon Gold and Star Trek: The Next Generation A Final Unity.1994 Manual specifying on page 11 SoftVideo under license to Spectrum Holobyte
In 1996 Iterated Systems Inc. announcedMitsubishi Corporation ClearVideo press release an alliance with the Mitsubishi Corporation to market ClearVideo to their Japanese customers. The original ClearVideo 1.2 decoder driver is still supportedMicrosoft ClearVideo support by Microsoft in Windows Media Player although the encoder is no longer supported.
