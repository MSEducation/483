==History==

Reeves College was founded in 1961 in Lloydminster, Alberta by C.J. Reeves. Reeves developed secretarial programs based on his experiences as a secretary and instructor. Programs were designed to train the whole individual. Therefore, key curriculum elements included practical skill development (typing, dictation, etc.) as well as professionalism and personal deportment. The college quickly gained a reputation for cultivating knowledgeable business office professionals as local businesses began hiring Reeves College graduates.
In 2003, the Eminata Group purchased Reeves College and introduced health care career programs. In 2004, Reeves College opened a campus in downtown Edmonton, Alberta. The Calgary campus opened in 2006. In 2008, the college opened a second campus in Calgary and a campus in Lethbridge
