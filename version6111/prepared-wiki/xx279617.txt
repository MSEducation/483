[[The Barbed Wire Patent]]

CATEGORIES: Fences, 1892 in case law, Patent case law

The Barbed Wire Patent Case, 143 U.S. 275 was a significant patent dispute in 1892 between plaintiff Joseph Glidden and the USPTO regarding the right of barbed wire.  Lucian Smith was the original inventor in 1867 and held patent rights for it, with Glidden making changes to it in 1874 that he believed were novelty enough to merit a new invention and thus new patent.[tpl]cite web| title =U.S. Supreme Court: The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U.S. 275 (1892)| work =Justia: US Supreme Court Center| url =http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/143/275/case.html[/tpl]
