==Reviews==

David Thomson on Claude Chabrol's Madame Bovary: "Huppert has to rate as one of the most accomplished actresses in the world today, even if she seems short of the passion or agony of her contemporary, Isabelle Adjani". Stuart Jeffries of The Observer on The Piano Teacher: "This is surely one of the greatest performances of Huppert's already illustrious acting career, though it is one that is very hard to watch." Director, Michael Haneke: "Huppert has such professionalism, the way she is able to represent suffering. At one end you have the extreme of her suffering and then you have her icy intellectualism. No other actor can combine the two."[tpl]Cite news | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,582099,00.html | title = Just don't ask her to play cute | first = Stuart | last = Jeffries | work = The Guardian | agency = The Observer | date = 28 October 2001 | location = London[/tpl] Of her performance in 2011's Hidden Love, Roger Ebert said "Isabelle Huppert makes one good film after another.... she is fearless. Directors often depend on her gift for conveying depression, compulsion, egotism and despair. She can be funny and charming, but then so can a lot of actors. She is in complete command of a face that regards the void with blankness."[tpl]Cite news | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110224/REVIEWS/110229992 | title = Hidden Love Review | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 24 February 2011 | work = Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl] In 2010, S.T.
