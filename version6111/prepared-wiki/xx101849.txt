==Early years==

Lieberman was born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 1, 1958, to Jerome and Renee Lieberman. She was raised Jewish, and has become a born-again Christian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Lieberman.html |title=Nancy Lieberman |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27[/tpl] Her family lived in Brooklyn, when she was born, but soon moved to Far Rockaway, New York where she grew up with her older brother Clifford.Woolum p 175 Her mother brought up the children after a separation and divorce. While growing up, she was very interested in a variety of sports, playing baseball, softball and football with boys, before settling on basketball as her primary sport. She played basketball primarily on pickup teams with boys, not playing on a girl's team until she was a high school sophomore.
While attending Far Rockaway High School in Queens, New York, she established herself as one of the top women's basketball players in the country by earning one of only 12 slots on the USA's National Team. In 1975, Lieberman was named to the USA Team designated to play in the World Championships and Pan American Games, where she brought home a gold medal [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=wpag_1975|title=SEVENTH PAN AMERICAN GAMES – 1975|accessdate=July 6, 2009[/tpl] and a silver medal in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=wpag_1979|title=EIGHTH PAN AMERICAN GAMES – 1979|accessdate=July 6, 2009[/tpl]
Lieberman's mother, Renee, was not supportive of her daughter's passion for basketball.  During one instance when Lieberman was practicing dribbling techniques indoors, because it was cold outside, her mother demanded she stop dribbling because of all the noise. When she did not stop, her mother punctured the basketball with a screwdriver. Lieberman found another ball and continued, but her mother punctured that one as well. This continued until five balls were ruined. Nancy then decided she had better go outside before she ran out of basketballs.Grundy p 171
During the school year, she played for her high school team, but in the summer, played with an AAU team in Harlem, the New York Chuckles.Woolum p 176

The games were  originally planned for Santiago, Chile, then Sao Paulo, Brazil and finally held in Mexico City, Mexico in October. The Pan Am team had failed to win the gold in 1967 and 1971. This year, the team would be more successful, compiling a 7–0 record, and winning the gold medal for the first time since 1963.
