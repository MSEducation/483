CATEGORIES: Companies of New Zealand, Lists of companies by country, Lists of companies of New Zealand

This is a list of notable companies based in New Zealand, grouped by their Industry Classification Benchmark sector. For further information on the types of business entities in this country and their abbreviations, see "Business entities in New Zealand".
For convenience, the word "Limited", which every company registered or re-registered under the Companies Act 1993 (with one historic exception) must have at the end of its name, is reduced to the common and universally recognized term "Ltd", which is a specifically permitted abbreviation under the Act. In the New Zealand registration system, unlike those of some other countries, the term "Incorporated" is restricted to societies (generally nonprofit) under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908.
