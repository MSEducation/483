The Avro Type G was a two seat biplane designed by A.V. Roe to participate in the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition. It is notable in having  a fully enclosed crew compartment, and was also the first aircraft to have recovered from a spin in front of witnesses.http://Parke's DiveFlight magazine25 August 1912

==Design and development==

The Avro Type G was a two-seat two bay biplane with a fully enclosed crew compartment.  The fuselage occupied the entire gap between upper and lower wings, which were of Roe's characteristic high aspect ratio.  Two prototypes were started, one with a Green engine, the other with an ABC. The latter engine was not delivered in time, and the second prototype was abandoned.
At the trials, the Type G was placed first in the assembly tests (erected in 14½ minutes) and the fuel consumption tests, but its poor rate of climb prevented it from winning a major prize, although Avro were awarded £100.
However, the Type G did later set a British endurance record of 7 hours 31 minutes piloted by F. P. Raynham at Brooklands on 24 October (a record broken only one hour later by Harry Hawker).
It was the second British airplane to have recovered from a spin, and the first to do so in front of witnesses.http://Parke's DiveFlight magazine25 August 1912 Early on the morning of 25 August Lt Wilfred Parke, with Lt Breton as passenger, took off to make an endurance trial. After having flown for three hours, he was executing a series of dives and while turning entered a spin at about [tpl]convert|700 |ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. By a combination of luck and cool nerves coupled with flying skill, he was able to recover when barely [tpl]convert|50 |ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] feet above the ground, the craft suddenly righting itself and flying off under perfect control. Parke's ability to clearly report on his experience to expert witnesses of the event was most important, since going into a spin had previously meant almost certain death.
