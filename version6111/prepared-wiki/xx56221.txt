[[Anthropopathy]]

CATEGORIES: Emotion, Anthropomorphism

Anthropopathy (Greek ανθρωπος, anthropos, "human", παθος, pathos, "suffering") is the attribution of human emotions, or the ascription of human feelings or passions to a non-human being, generally to a God, or to a polytheistic deity. 
By comparison, the term anthropomorphism originally referred to the attribution of human form to a non-human being, but in modern usage, anthropomorphism has come to encompass both meanings.
