Dimitrie Sturdza ([tpl]IPA-ro|diˈmitri.e ˈsturza|lang[/tpl], in full Dimitrie Alexandru Sturdza-Miclăușanu; 10 March 1833 – 21 October 1914) was a Romanian statesman and author of the late 19th century, and president of the Romanian Academy between 1882 and 1884.

==Biography==

Born in Iași, Moldavia, and was educated there at the Academia Mihăileană. He continued his studies in Germany at Munich, Göttingen, Bonn, and Berlin.[tpl]Cite NIE|wstitle=Sturdza, Demeter|year=1905[/tpl] He took part in the political movements of the time.
Sturdza was private secretary to Prince Alexander John Cuza.  He afterwards turned against the increasingly unsanctioned rule of Cuza:  He became Minister of Public Instruction in 1859, and was one of the most zealous promoters of the overthrow of Cuza. In 1866, he joined Ion Brătianu and others in the deposition of Cuza, and the election of Prince Charles of Hohenzollern (later Carol I of Romania).  He became a member of the Liberal government. In the cabinet of Bratianu, 1876–88, he repeatedly held ministerial posts.
In 1899 he was elected leader of the National Liberal Party in succession to Brătianu, and was four times Prime Minister.  For his last time in office, in 1907, Sturdza was called by King Carol I to handle the crisis created by the peasants' revolt of March. Although noted for his capacity for work, he was also a nationalist, resentful of "aliens" (in line with the anti-Jewish policies of his party), and supported blocking non-Romanians from a large number of social positions.
He was appointed permanent secretary of the Romanian Academy, and became a recognized authority on Romanian numismatics. As secretary of the academy he was instrumental in assisting the publication of the collections of historic documents made by Constantin Hurmuzachi (30 vols., Bucharest, 1876-1897), and other acts and documents besides a number of minor political pamphlets of transitory value.
His son Alexandru Sturdza, by then a Colonel in the Romanian Army, defected to the Germans in 1916, during the World War I.
