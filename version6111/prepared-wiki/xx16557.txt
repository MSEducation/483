[[Hanlon's razor]]

CATEGORIES: Adages, Critical thinking, Principles, Razors (philosophy)

Hanlon's razor is an eponymous adage that allows the elimination of unlikely explanations for a phenomenon. It reads:
[tpl]quote|Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.[/tpl]
This particular form is attributed to a Robert J. Hanlon. However, earlier utterances that convey the same basic idea are known.

==Origins and etymology==

The adage was popularized in this form and under this name by the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer slang.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/Hanlons-Razor.html | title = Hanlon's Razor | work = Jargon File, as of v4.3.2 | date = 2002-03-03 | publisher = Eric S.

This definition comes from "The Jargon File" (edited by Eric Raymond), but one poster attributes it to Robert Heinlein, in a 1941 story called "Logic of Empire."[/tpl] In 1990, it appeared in the Jargon File described as a "murphyism" parallel to Occam's Razor.[tpl]cite web | url = http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-2.1.1.dos.txt | title = THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 2.1.1 (DRAFT) 12 JUN 1990 | editor1 = Guy L.

The name was inspired by Occam's razor.Giancarlo Livraghi, Il potere della stupidit√†, Monti & Ambrosini, Pescara, Italy, 2004, p. 1 Later that same year, the Jargon File editors noted lack of knowledge about the term's derivation, and the existence of a similar epigram by William James.[tpl]cite web | url = http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-2.2.1.dos.txt | title = THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 2.2.1 15 DEC 1990 | editor2 = Guy L. Steele | editor1 = Eric S. Raymond | publisher = jargon-file.org | accessdate = 2013-06-01[/tpl] In 1996, the Jargon File entry on Hanlon's Razor noted the existence of a similar quotation in Robert A. Heinlein's 1941 short story "Logic of Empire" ("You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity"), with speculation that Hanlon's Razor might be a corruption of "Heinlein's Razor".[tpl]cite web | url = http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.0.0.dos.txt | title = THE JARGON FILE, VERSION  4.0.0,  24 JUL 1996 | editor = Eric S.

In 2001, Quentin Stafford-Fraser published two blog entries citing e-mails from one Joseph E.

Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a submission for a book compilation of various jokes related to Murphy's law published in 1980 in Arthur Bloch's Murphy's Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong!.[tpl]cite book | isbn = 0-417-06450-0 | title = Murphy's Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong! | publisher = Price Stern Sloan | author = Arthur Bloch | year = 1980 | page = 52[/tpl] Subsequently, in 2002, the Jargon File entry noted the same, though not definitively.[tpl]cite web | url = http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.3.2.dos.txt | title = THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 4.3.2, 3 MAR 2002 | editor = Eric S.

Another similar quotation appears in Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774):
Similarly, Jane West's The Loyalists (1812) includes:

A common (and more laconic) British English variation, coined by Bernard Ingham, is the saying "cock-up before conspiracy", deriving from this 1985 quotation:
[tpl]quote|Many journalists have fallen for the conspiracy theory of government. I do assure you that they would produce more accurate work if they adhered to the cock-up theory.|Bernard Ingham[tpl]cite book | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=SoyalAxDItYC&pg=PA17 |title=Conspiracy Theories: The Philosophical Debate|editor=David Coady |first=Charles|last=Pigden |year=2006 |page=17| chapter=Chapter 3: Popper Revised, or What is Wrong with Conspiracy Theories? | quote = Quoted in the Otago Daily Times, 3/4/85.[/tpl][/tpl]
Another similar instance from politics is the attribution by First Minister of Scotland, Henry McLeish, of financial irregularities that led to his resignation in 2001, to "a muddle not a fiddle".[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1640711.stm |title=First minister denies office fiddle |date=6 November 2001 |work=BBC News[/tpl]
"Heinlein's Razor" has since been defined as variations on Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity, but don't rule out malice. This quotation is attributed to Albert Einstein in Peter W. Singer's 2009 book Wired for War.[tpl]Cite book |first=Peter W. |last=Singer |title=Wired for War |year=2009 |isbn=1594201986 |page=434[/tpl]
A similar saying, patterned after Arthur C. Clarke's famous comment about technology and magic, has often been called Grey's Law: "Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice".  The origin of this attribution is unknown. [tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
