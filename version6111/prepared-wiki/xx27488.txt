Fag hag is a gay slang phrase referring to a woman who either associates mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men, or has gay and bisexual men as close friends. The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and was historically an insult.[tpl]cite journal |last=Moon |first=Dawne |title=Insult and Inclusion: The Term Fag Hag and Gay Male "Community" |journal=Social Forces |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=487–510 |year=1995 |doi=10.2307/2580489 |publisher=Social Forces, Vol. 74, No. 2 |jstor=2580489[/tpl]  Some women who associate with gay men object to being called fag hags while others embrace the term.  The male counterpart, for men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men is fag stag, part of hag-ism, the identification of a person with a group—usually united in terms of sexuality, gender identity, or shared sex—of which he or she is not officially a member.[tpl]cite book | last = Baker | first =Paul | page =140 | isbn =0-8264-7343-1 | title=Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | year=2008 | url =http://books.google.com/?id=T72TJfZoywAC| accessdate=2008-07-23[/tpl]

==Usage==

Fag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men.Dawne, 492–494.[tpl]cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Deborah |title=Calling All Fag Hags: From Identity Politics to Identification Politics |journal=Social Semiotics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/1035033042000202915 [/tpl]  In fact, many women who identify as fag hags are already in romantic relationships, either with straight men or with women but appreciate the alternative experience of socializing with gay men and may prefer the gay culture to the straight counterpart.
