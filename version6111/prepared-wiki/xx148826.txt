The Bronx Bunny Show is an Irish ten-part series originally broadcast in 2003 on E4 in the United Kingdom and later in Ireland. It was an adult puppet interview show which followed the premise of a semi-educational show for the good people of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The show was produced from a run-down tenement building in the Bronx where Bronx Bunny and his sidekick, a cigarette-smoking panda named Teddy T, would interview celebrities who "done good". The Bronx Bunny Show won "Best Entertainment Show" IFTA Award in 2003.IFTA Awards 2003
Also featured on the show were pseudo-educational items, such as 'The Internal Gerbil' who sang songs about internal organs from inside a gay man, numbers illustrated by pole dancing women who contorted into the shape of that week's number, and Spanish phrases such as "Your Mother bangs like a screen door in a tornado".
The show was broadcast sporadically on E4 and eventually on Channel 4. The series gained a cult following as it featured interviews with guests such as Hugh Hefner, Jessica Alba, William Shatner, and Larry Flynt. The show was created by Double Z Enterprises, an Irish production company behind such characters as Zig and Zag and Podge and Rodge.
In 2010, the entire Channel 4 season was made available to view on the 4OD site.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-bronx-bunny-show/4od|title=Channel 4 On Demand|date=2010-02-05|accessdate=2010-02-05|publisher=Channel 4[/tpl]
