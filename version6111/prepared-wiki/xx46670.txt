===History===

Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R&D1) began development of Metroid, an action game for the Family Computer Disk System that was released in Japan on August 6, 1986. In North America and Europe, Metroid was published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in August 1987 and on January 15, 1988, respectively.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2011-07-03 |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/metroid-other-m/0/0 |title=Iwata Asks: Metroid: Other M – Vol. 1: An NES Game with the Latest Technology |publisher=Nintendo of America Inc |date=2013-04-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/metroid/related/platform/nes/ |title=Metroid Related Games |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=2011-07-19[/tpl] Unlike the Japanese release, the Western versions of the game used passwords instead of a save system. Codes also allow for changes in gameplay; the "JUSTIN BAILEY" code lets the player play as Samus without her Power Suit, and "NARPAS SWORD" grants Samus infinite ammunition, health, all power-ups, and a modified Ice Beam.
A sequel, Metroid II: Return of Samus, was released for the Game Boy in 1991 in North America, and in 1992 in Japan. It was the first game of the Metroid series whose North American release featured a save system, allowing the player to have three separate save files. Metroid II also established the current "look" of Samus Aran and her Power Suit, namely the bulky look of the Varia Suit upgrade and the visual difference between the "Beam Mode" and "Missile Mode" of Samus's arm cannon. Dan Owsen of Nintendo acknowledged in an interview that Nintendo R&D1 planned to release a Game Boy Color version of Metroid II; however, the project was eventually canceled.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-02-21 |url=http://www.metroid-database.com/features/owsen.php |title=The MDb Interviews Dan Owsen |year=1998 [/tpl]
Director Yoshio Sakamoto began planning concepts for Super Metroid in early 1990, but his studio was committed to making another game, so developers from Intelligent Systems were brought in to help complete the game. After Super Metroid's release, there would not be another sequel for eight years. A Nintendo 64 title was considered during the period, but Nintendo "couldn't come up with any concrete ideas".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/metroid-prime-roundtable-qa?page=2|title=Metroid Prime Roundtable QA|publisher=IGN|date=2002-11-15|accessdate=2008-02-20[/tpl] In 1999, Retro Studios, a newly formed second-party developer based in Austin, Texas, was given the project for Metroid Prime. Nintendo rarely allows overseas teams to work on its games but this was one occasion when they allowed a high profile title to be developed by a studio outside of Japan.[tpl]cite web|author=IGN Staff|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/quotes-from-metroid-prime-roundtable|title=Quotes from Metroid Prime Roundtable|publisher=IGN|date=2002-11-11|accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl] After it became a top seller on the GameCube, a trilogy was authorized.
Rumors abounded since 2005 about the development of a title called Metroid Dread, supposedly a 2D side-scroller for the Nintendo DS. In Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, there is a message in the Metroid breeding zone of the Space Pirate Homeworld on a computer panel that if scanned says "Experiment status report update: Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion." Developers from Retro Studios gave a full but cryptic denial of any connection with the rumored game, and Nintendo denied they were making another 2D Metroid title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/mail/2005-09-19.html|title=Nintendo DS Mailbag|accessdate=2005-09-19|author=Craig Harris|authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist)|date=2005-09-19|publisher=IGN[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=MTV Multiplayer|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/09/26/retro-studios-answers-the-dreaded-metroid-dread-question-and-other-prime-exclusives/|title=Retro Studios Answers The Dreaded "Metroid Dread" Question — And Other "Prime" Exclusives|date=2007-09-26|author=Stephen Totilo|accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/08/27/metroid-dread-nearing-completion|title=Metroid Dread Nearing Completion|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2007-08-27|author=Matt Casamassina[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Computer and Video Games Magazine| url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/171525/nintendo-denies-metroid-dread/|title=Nintendo denies Metroid Dread| date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2007-09-06|author=Mike Jackson[/tpl] However, at E3 2009, Sakamoto confirmed Metroid Dread existed at one point, and may still be in development,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Kotaku|url=http://kotaku.com/5277377/nintendo-new-metroid-is-not-metroid-dread|title=Nintendo: New Metroid Is NOT Metroid Dread|date=2009-06-03|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=IGN|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/04/e3-2009-metroid-other-m-heavy-on-action-and-story?page=2|title=E3 2009: Metroid: Other M Heavy on Action and Story|date=2009-06-04|first=Matt|last=Casamassina|accessdate=2009-06-05[/tpl] though in a later interview Sakamoto stated that Nintendo prefers to keep secrecy on the project, and also that he would like to "reset the situation at once and start from scratch."

===Creation and design===

Metroid was designed to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. The name of the game is a portmanteau of the words "metro" (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.selectbutton.net/archive/topic/5865 |title=Game Center CX (Fuji TV show) |publisher=Selectbutton.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08[/tpl] Half way through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the idea was accepted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/30/metroid-zero-mission-director-roundtable?page=3|title=Metroid: Zero Mission director roundtable|publisher=IGN|date=2004-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-20[/tpl] Ridley Scott's 1979 horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a "huge influence" after the world of the first Metroid had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Making of Super Metroid |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=65 |page=60 |date=July 2009 |publisher=Imagine Publishing Ltd.[/tpl]
Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, and Metroid: Zero Mission were all developed by Nintendo's internal R&D1 division. The games which have been developed by separate teams are Metroid Prime, 2, and 3 (Retro Studios), Metroid Prime Hunters (Nintendo Software Technology Corporation), Metroid Prime Pinball (Fuse Games), and Metroid: Other M (Project M). The central figures in the production and development of the Metroid series are Yoshio Sakamoto, who has directed or supervised the development of most games; Gunpei Yokoi, who headed the R&D1 division and produced the first two games; Makoto Kano, who wrote the scenario for Metroid, co-designed the second game, and produced the third; and Hiroji Kiyotake, who designed characters for the original game. Mario and The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto was involved with the Prime trilogy, having been the one that suggested Retro to work with the franchise.

===Audio===

The Metroid series has been noted and praised for its unique style of video game music. Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka, composer of the original Metroid, has said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a "living organism" and had no distinction between music and sound effects.[tpl]cite web|author=IGN Staff|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/08/top-ten-tuesday-best-8-bit-soundtracks|title=Top Ten Tuesday: Best 8-Bit Soundtracks|publisher=IGN|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2008-02-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Alexander Brandon|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2947/shooting_from_the_hip_an_.php|title=Shooting from the Hip: an Interview with Hip Tanaka|publisher=Gamasutra|date=2002-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl] The only time the main Metroid theme was heard was after Mother Brain is defeated; this is intended to give the player a catharsis. At all other times, no melodies are present in the game. The composer of Super Metroid, Kenji Yamamoto, came up with some of the games' themes by humming them to himself while riding his motorcycle to work. He was asked to compose the music for Metroid Prime to reinforce the series continuity. Metroid Prime's Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound was mixed by a member of Dolby.[tpl]cite web|author=Fran Mirabella III|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/metroid-prime|title=Metroid Prime|date=2002-11-11|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-02-27[/tpl] Developers from Retro Studios noted how the 6 MB memory budget for all sound effects of a level in Metroid Prime was crucial in producing a quality soundtrack, as each sound had to be of very high quality to be included. Composer Kenji Yamamoto utilizes heavy drums, piano, voiced chants, clangs of pipes, and electric guitar. Metroid Prime 3 took advantage of the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the GameCube to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality.[tpl]cite web|author=M4G Staff|url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=174|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080315081014/http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=174|archivedate=2008-03-15|title=Interview with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption Sound Team at Retro Studios and Composer Kenji Yamamoto|publisher=music4games|date=2007-10-05|accessdate=2008-03-19[/tpl] Kenji Yamamoto, who composed the music to Super Metroid and the Prime trilogy, copied the musical design of the original Metroid in  Metroid Prime 3, by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits.

In December 2012, Peer Schneider of IGN published an article explaining the fate and some production details of the proposed John Woo-directed Metroid movie with an exclusive interview with one of the former producers of the Metroid movie, Brad Foxhoven. The movie with John Woo as director was first pitched in 2004 and initially had Nintendo's full support. Foxhoven stated in the IGN interview, "Nintendo was quite supportive of the idea, as they were all fans of John's previous films" and that production studio Tiger Hill was "in it for the long haul" and had started a three-year development period. The Metroid movie was originally set for a 2006 release but slipped because Tiger Hill was spending most of the development time attempting to cope with Nintendo's restrictions on the Metroid franchise.  The reason for Nintendo's restrictions was the past critical and commercial failure of the Super Mario Bros. movie which, according to IGN, "had left an indelible impression on Nintendo and how it would approach future licensing deals with Hollywood." One writer that was brought in to write a script for the Metroid movie, among "several writers", was David Greenwalt of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Grimm fame, the furthest that the production process reached was "a treatment for a live action film that John would possibly direct.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/28/whatever-happened-to-the-metroid-movie|title=Whatever Happened to the Metroid Movie? Former producer talks about the ill-fated John Woo/Nintendo co-production|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|first=Peer|last=Schneider|date=2012-12-28|accessdate=2012-12-31[/tpl]
The article revealed that early scripts for the movie were going to focus on series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," and elaborating that, "We wanted to see her struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory." The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had "creative" and "licensing" walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: “What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" and further stated that "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" and at the end, Nintendo "felt uncomfortable with our team Hollywood being the ones to propose those answers” which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating at the end of the IGN interview that "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" and he revealed that "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process."
