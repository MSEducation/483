Sir George Grey, KCB (14 April 1812 – 19 September 1898) was a soldier, explorer, Governor of South Australia, twice Governor of New Zealand, Governor of Cape Colony (South Africa), the 11th Premier of New Zealand and a writer.

==Early life and exploration==

Grey was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the only son of Bvt. Lieutenant-Colonel George Grey, of the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot, who was killed at the Battle of Badajoz in Spain just a few days before. His mother, Elizabeth Anne, on the balcony of her hotel in Lisbon, overheard two officers speak of her husband's death and this brought on his premature birth. She was the daughter of a retired soldierGrace Lawless Lee, The Huguenot Settlements in Ireland Longmans, Green London 1936 turned Irish clergyman, Major later Rev. John Vignoles. Grey was sent to the Royal Grammar School, Guildford in Surrey,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Sir+George+Grey&pid=352 |title=Distinguished Old Guildfordians – Sir George Grey |work=Royal Grammar School Guildford Website |accessdate=7 February 2011[/tpl] and was admitted to the Royal Military College in 1826. Early in 1830, he was gazetted ensign in the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. In 1830, his regiment having been sent to Ireland, he developed much sympathy with the Irish peasantry whose misery made a great impression on him. He was promoted lieutenant in 1833 and obtained a first-class certificate at the examinations of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1836.
In 1837, at the age of 25, Grey led a catastrophically ill-prepared expedition of exploration of north-west Australia – only one man of his party had seen northern Australia before. It was at that time believed that a great river entered the Indian Ocean from the north-west of Australia, and that the country it drained might be suitable for colonisation. Grey, in conjunction with Lieutenant Franklin Lushington, of the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, offered to explore this country and on 5 July 1837 he sailed from Plymouth in command of a party of five, the others being Lushington; Dr William Walker, a surgeon and naturalist; and Corporals Coles and Auger of the Royal Sappers and Miners. Others joined the party at Cape Town, and early in December they landed at Hanover Bay. Wrecked, almost drowned, and completely lost, with Grey speared in the hip in a skirmish with Aborigines, they traced the course of the Glenelg River before giving up. They were picked up by the Beagle and Lynher and taken to Mauritius to recover.[tpl]cite web | url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/grey-sir-george-2125 | title = Grey, Sir George (1812–1898) | accessdate = 25 August 2011 | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography | publisher = National Centre of Biography, Australian National University[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last1 = Henderson | first1 = Graeme | title = The Wreck of the Elizabeth | volume = 1 | work = Studies in Historical Archaeology | publisher = Australian Society for Historical Archaeology | year = 1973 | location = Sydney | pages = 28 | url = http://www.ashadocs.org/studiesinhistoricalarchaeology/SHA01_Henderson.pdf | accessdate = 30 Oct 2013 | isbn = 0 909797 01 3[/tpl]
Two years later, Grey returned to Western Australia and was again wrecked with his party, again including Surgeon Walker, at Kalbarri; they were the first Europeans to see the Gascoyne River, but then had to walk to Perth, surviving the journey through the efforts of Kaiber, a Whadjuk Noongar, who organised food and what water could be found (they survived by drinking liquid mud). At about this time, Grey became one of the few Europeans to learn the Noongar language of south-west Western Australia.[tpl]cite news | last = Cygnet | title = Yesterday — and the Day Before | date = 7 March 1935 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38397901 | work = The Western Mail | pages = 11 | accessdate = 30 Oct 2013[/tpl]
Upon the death of Sir Richard Spencer RN KCH, the Government Resident Magistrate at King George Sound, Western Australia, in July 1839, Grey was promoted to captain and appointed temporary resident magistrate.

==Marriage and children==

On 2 November 1839 at King George Sound, Grey married Eliza Lucy Spencer (1822–1898), the daughter of the late Government Resident. Their only child, born in 1841 in South Australia, died aged 5 months. It was not a happy marriage. Grey, obstinate in his domestic affairs as in his first expeditions, accused his wife unjustly of flirting with Rear Admiral Sir Henry Keppel on the voyage to Cape Town in 1860 and sent her away from him to live a life of misery until old age brought sense to him and they were reunited formally but unhappily in 1897.
Grey adopted Annie Maria Matthews (1853–1938) in 1861, following the death of her father, Grey's half-brother, Sir Godfrey Thomas.[tpl]cite web| last = Sinclair | first = Keith | work = Dictionary of New Zealand Biography | title= Grey, George 1812–1898 | date = 7 April 2006|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1G21 | accessdate=14 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Grey family descendants reunite on Kawau |url= http://www.localmatters.co.nz/Mahurangi+Matters/News+-+February+2012/Grey+family+descendants+reunite+on+Kawau.html |accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Local Matters |date=February 2012[/tpl]  She married Seymour Thorne George[tpl]cite web|title=Sir George Grey 1812–1898|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/george-grey.pdf|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=5 March 2012|format=PDF[/tpl] on 3 December 1872 on Kawau Island.[tpl]cite news|title=Marriages|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18721205.2.7 |accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Daily Southern Cross|volume=XXVIII |issue=4768 |date=5 December 1872|page=2[/tpl]

==Governor of South Australia==

Grey was the third Governor of South Australia, from 1841 to 1845, as the British government was concerned about the treatment of aborigines by settlers, and Grey was known to have sympathies with the indigenous people. He oversaw the colony during a difficult formative period. Despite being seen as less hands-on than his predecessor, George Gawler, his fiscally responsible measures ensured the colony was in good shape by the time he left to govern New Zealand.

==Governor of New Zealand==

Grey served as Governor of New Zealand twice: from 1845 to 1853, and from 1861 to 1868. He was arguably the most influential figure during the European settlement of New Zealand during much of the 19th century.
During this time, European settlement accelerated, and in 1859 the number of Pākehā came to equal the number of Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, but there were also strong pressures to retain land - in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a discount price, and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision. Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand. The agreement was hailed by the company as "all that we could desire ... our Company is really to be the agent of the state for colonizing NZ."[tpl]cite book | author=Patricia Burns | title=Fatal Success: A History of the New Zealand Company | year= 1989 | isbn=0-7900-0011-3 | publisher= Heinemann Reed [/tpl] The Government waived its right of pre-emption in the Wellington region, Wanganui and New Plymouth in September 1841.

==First term==

Grey was appointed the third Governor of New Zealand in 1845. During the tenure of his predecessor, Robert FitzRoy, violence over land ownership broke out in the Wairau Valley in the South Island in June 1843. Then in March 1845  Hone Heke began the Flagstaff War, the causes of which can be attributed to the conflict between what the Ngāpuhi understood to be the meaning of the Treaty of Waitangi and the actions of succeeding governors of asserting authority over the Māori.

===Fighting in the Nelson area by Ngāti Toa===

A land dispute that began before Grey’s arrival in Zealand was a dispute as to sale of land on the Wairau plains to Captain John William Dundas Blenkinsop. He had negotiated with Ngāti Toa that he could take wood and water from Cloudy Bay in payment of a ship’s cannon. But the document that Blenkinsopp drew up in English, which the chiefs could not read, stated that 26,500 acres of the Wairau Plains were sold to Blenkinsopp.
A major clash came in 1843 when Te Rauparaha and his nephew Te Rangihaeata tried to prevent the survey of lands in the Wairau plains. These lands had been claimed by the New Zealand Company "on two grounds - alleged purchase by Captain Blenkinsop, master of a Sydney whaler in 1831-2; and the negotiations between their principal agent (Colonel Wakefield) and Rauparaha, the head of this tribe, in 1839".[tpl]cite web|last=Broad|first=Lowther|title=Chapter V.

The Ngāti Toa war party warned off the surveyors but they persisted. Te Rauparaha burnt down a whare (hut) which contained the surveyors' equipment. The local magistrate ordered his arrest and deputised about 50 settlers for this purpose. Te Rauparaha resisted, fighting broke out and 22 settlers and at least four Māori were killed. Te Rangihaeata, the warlike nephew of Te Rauparaha, insisted on killing the captured men as his wife, who was Te Rauparaha's daughter and Capt Benkinsop's ex-wife, had been accidentally shot and killed. The settlers were furious as many of those killed in utu were unarmed Quakers. Te Rauparaha was astonished not to face a strong British military reaction. He left the Rangitāne land he had conquered and never returned. These events took place during the Governorship of Robert FitzRoy. It was not until 1846 that Governor Grey had Te Rauparaha arrested, however his imprisonment, which remained controversial amongst the Ngāti Toa, was not related to the Wairau Affray.

===Hone Heke and the fighting in the Bay of Islands===

In 1845 George Grey arrived in New Zealand to take up his appointment as Governor. At this time Hone Heke challenged the authority of the British, beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill at Kororareka. On this flagstaff the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand had previously flown, now the Union Jack was hoisted; hence the flagstaff symbolised the grievances of Heke and his ally Te Ruki Kawiti, as to changes that had followed the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.
There were many causes of the Flagstaff War and Heke had a number of grievances in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi. While land acquisition by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) had been controversial, the rebellion lead by Heke was directed against the colonial forces with the CMS missionaries trying to persuade Heke to end the fighting.[tpl]cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |title= The Life of Henry Williams: "Early Recollections"  written by Henry Williams  |accessdate= 19 October 2013 |year= 1874 |publisher= Early New Zealand Books (ENZB), University of Auckland Library|pages=|chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1048&page=1&action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= Early New Zealand Books University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= Appendix to Vol. II. |chapterurl= http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1056&page=0&action=null |quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl] Despite the fact that Tāmati Wāka Nene and most of Ngāpuhi sided with the government, the small and ineptly led British had been beaten at Battle of Ohaeawai. Grey, armed with the financial support and far more troops armed with 32-pounder cannons, that had been denied to FitzRoy, attacked and occupied Kawiti's fortress at Ruapekapeka, forcing Kawiti to retreat. The Ngāpuhi were astonished that the British could keep an army of nearly 1000 soldiers in the field continuously. Heke's confidence waned after he was wounded in battle with Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors, and by the realisation that the British had far more resources than he could muster, including some Pākehā Māori, who supported the colonial forces.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = John | title = White Chief – The Story of a Pakeha Maori | publisher = Penguin Books (NZ) | year = 2006 | pages = 100–140 | isbn = 978-0-14-302022-6[/tpl]

===The Ngati Rangatahi and Hutt Valley Campaign===

Colonists arrived in Port Nicholson, Wellington in November 1839 in ships charted by the New Zealand Company. Within months the New Zealand Company purported to purchase approximately 20 million acres (8 million hectares) in Nelson, Wellington, Whanganui and Taranaki. Disputes arose as to the validity of purchases of land, which disputes remained unresolved when Grey became the governor.
The company saw itself as a prospective quasi-government of New Zealand and in 1845 and 1846 proposed splitting the colony in two, along a line from Mokau in the west to Cape Kidnappers in the east – with the north reserved for Maori and missionaries, while the south would become a self-governing province, known as "New Victoria" and managed by the company for that purpose. Britain's Colonial Secretary rejected the proposal. The company was known for its vigorous attacks on those it perceived as its opponents – the British Colonial Office, successive governors of New Zealand, and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) that was led by the Rev. Henry Williams. Williams attempted to interfere with the land purchasing practices of the company,[tpl]cite book | author=Caroline Fitzgerald | title= Te Wiremu - Henry Williams: Early Years in the North | year= 2011 | isbn=978-1-86969-439-5| publisher= Huia Press [/tpl] Henry Williams Journal (Fitzgerald, pages 290-291)[tpl]cite book | author=Caroline Fitzgerald | title= Te Wiremu - Henry Williams: Early Years in the North | year= 2011 | isbn=978-1-86969-439-5| publisher= Huia Press [/tpl] Letter Henry to Marianne, 6 December 1839[tpl]cite book | author=Caroline Fitzgerald | title= Te Wiremu - Henry Williams: Early Years in the North | year= 2011 | isbn=978-1-86969-439-5| publisher= Huia Press [/tpl] Henry Williams Journal 16 December 1839 (Fitzgerald, p. 302) which exacerbated the ill-will that was directed at the CMS by the Company in Wellington and the promoters of colonisation in Auckland who had access to the Governor and to the newspapers that had started publication.
The unresolved land disputes resulted from the operations of the New Zealand Company erupted into fighting in the Hutt Valley in 1846. The Ngati Rangatahi, were determined to retain possession of their land. They assembled a force of about 200 warriors led by Te Rangihaeata, the cousin of Te Rauparaha and the person who had killed the unarmed captives in the Wairau Affray. The Governor Grey moved troops into the area and by February had assembled nearly a thousand men together with some Māori allies from the Te Ati awa hapu to begin the Hutt Valley Campaign.
The Māori attacked Taita on 3 March 1846, but were repulsed by a company of the 96th Regiment. The same day Grey declared martial law in the Wellington area.[tpl]cite web| last =  | first = | work =Ministry for Culture and Heritage | title=A line in the bush - war in Wellington| date =20 December 2012 |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/wellington-war/line-in-the-bush |accessdate=26 October 2013[/tpl]
Richard Taylor, a CMS missionary from Whanganui, attempted to persuade the Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Rangatahi to leave the disputed land. Eventually Grey paid compensation for the potato crop they had planted on the land. He also gave them 300 acres at Kaiwharawhara by the modern ferry terminal. Chief Taringakuri agreed to these terms. But when the settlers tried to move onto the land they were frightened off.The Canoes of Kupe. R. McIntyre. Fraser books. Masterton (2012) p 51. On 27 February the British and their Te Ati Awa allies burnt the Māori Pa at Maraenuku in the Hutt Valley, which had been built on land that the settlers claimed to own. The Ngati Rangatahi retaliated on 1 and 3 March by raiding settlers’ farms, destroying furniture, smashing windows, killing pigs, and threatening the settlers with death if they gave the alarm. They murdered Andrew Gillespie and his son.The Canoes of Kupe. R. McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masterton (2012) p 51. 13 families of settlers moved into Wellington for safety. Governor Grey proclaimed martial law on 3 March. Sporadic fighting continued, including a major attack on a defended position at Boulcott's Farm on 6 May.  On 6 August 1846, one of the last engagements was fought – the Battle of Battle Hill – after which Te Rangihaeata left the area. The Hutt Valley Campaign was followed by the Wanganui Campaign from April to July 1847.
In January 1846 fifteen chiefs of the area, including Te Rauparaha, had sent a combined letter to the newly arrived Governor Grey, pledging their loyalty to the crown. After intercepting letters from Te Rauparaha, Grey realised he was playing a double game. He was receiving and sending secret instructions to the local Maori who were attacking settlers. In a surprise attack on his pā at Taupō (Plimmerton) at dawn on 23 July, Te Rauparaha, who was now quite elderly, was captured and taken prisoner.[tpl]cite web| last =  | first = | work =Dominion, Rōrahi 1, Putanga 16, 14 Whiringa-ā-nuku, Page 3 | title=Te Rauparaha.

While Grey’s declaration of Martial law was within his authority, internment without trial would only be lawful if it had been authorised by statute. Te Rauparaha was held prisoner on HMS Driver, then he was taken to Auckland on HMS Calliope and he remained imprisoned until January 1848.
His son Tamihana, was studying Christianity in Auckland and Te Rauparaha gave him a solemn message that their iwi should not take  utu against the government. Tamihana returned to his rohe to stop a planned uprising.

===Government at Auckland===

Auckland was made the new capital in February 1840 and by the time Grey was appointed governor in 1845, it had become a commercial centre as well as including the administrative institutions such as the Supreme Court.[tpl]Cite book |title=From Tamaki-Makau-Rau to Auckland |author=Russell Stone |publisher=University of Auckland Press |year=2002 |ISBN=1-86940-259-6[/tpl]
After the conclusion of the war in the north, government policy was to place a buffer zone of European settlement between the Ngāpuhi and Auckland.The Te Roroa Report 1992 (Wai 38), Waitangi Tribunal (1992) Chapter 1, Section 1.1. p 8 The background to the Invasion of Waikato in 1863 also, in part, reflected a belief that the Auckland was at risk from attack by the Waikato Māori.
Governor Grey had to contend with newspapers that were unequivocal to their support of the interests of the settlers: the Auckland Times, Auckland Chronicle, The Southern Cross, which started by William Brown as a weekly paper in 1843 and The New Zealander, which was started in 1845 by John Williamson. These newspapers were known for their partisan editorial policies – both William Brown and John Williamson were aspiring politicians. The Southern Cross supported the land claimants, such as the New Zealand Company, and vigorously attacked Governor Grey's administration, while the The New Zealander, supported the ordinary settler and the Māori. The northern war adversely affected business in Auckland, such that The Southern Cross stopped publishing from April 1845 to July 1847.[tpl]cite web |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.DSC&essay=1 |title=Daily Southern Cross |work=National Library of New Zealand  - Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa |accessdate=30 October 2012[/tpl] Hugh Carleton, who also became a politician, was the editor of The New Zealander then later established the Anglo-Maori Warder, which followed an editorial policy in opposition to Governor Grey.[tpl]cite book |last1= Fitzgerald  |first1= Caroline |authorlink1= |title= Te Wiremu: Henry Williams – Early Years in the North |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=2011|publisher= Huia Publishers, New Zealand |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=xii |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl]
At the time of the northern war The Southern Cross and The New Zealander blamed Henry Williams and the other CMS missionaries for the Flagstaff War.Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams, Pegasus Press, pp. 218-282 The New Zealander newspaper in a thinly disguise reference to Henry Williams, with the reference to "their Rangatira pakeha gentlemen correspondents", went on to state: "We consider these English traitors far more guilty and deserving of severe punishment, than the brave natives whom they have advised and misled. Cowards and knaves in the full sense of the terms, they have pursued their traitorous schemes, afraid to risk their own persons, yet artfully sacrificing others for their own aggrandizement, while, probably at the same time, they were most hypocritically professing most zealous loyalty."
Official communications also blamed the CMS missionaries for the Flagstaff War. In a letter of 25 June 1846 to William Ewart Gladstone, the Colonial Secretary in Sir Robert Peel's government, Governor Grey referred to the land acquired by the CMS missionaries and commented that "Her Majesty's Government may also rest satisfied that these individuals cannot be put in possession of these tracts of land without a large expenditure of British blood and money”.  By the end of his first term as governor Grey had changed his opinion as to the role of the CMS missionaries, which was limited to attempts to persuade Hone Heke bring an end to the fighting with the British soldiers and the Ngāpuhi, lead by Tāmati Wāka Nene, who remained loyal to the Crown.[tpl]cite web| title = Puketutu and Te Ahuahu - Northern War| date =3 April 2009|url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/northern-war/puketutu|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage - NZ History online | accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last = Fisher| first = Robin| work = Dictionary of New Zealand Biography |  title = Williams, Henry 1792 - 1867 |url= http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1W22|year = 2012 |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]

===Legacy of Grey's first term as Governor===

During Grey's first tenure as Governor of New Zealand, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (1848). When Grey was knighted he chose  Tāmati Wāka Nene as one of his esquires.
Grey was greatly to influence the final form of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, after the 1846 Act was largely suspended at his request (Grey was briefly "Governor-in-Chief"). Grey oversaw the establishment of the first provinces of New Zealand.
He earned particular respect for his handling of Māori affairs from 1845 to 1853. He took pains to show Māori that he observed the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi, assuring them that their land rights would be fully recognised. In the Taranaki district, Māori were very reluctant to sell their land, but elsewhere Grey was much more successful, and nearly 33 million acres (130,000 km²) were purchased from Māori, with the result that British settlements expanded quickly. Grey was less successful in his efforts to assimilate the Māori; he lacked the financial means to realise his plans. Although he subsidised mission schools, requiring them to teach in English, only a few hundred Māori children attended them at any one time.
Grey gave land for the establishment of Auckland Grammar School in Newmarket, Auckland in 1850. The school was officially recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act of the Provincial Government.[tpl]cite web|title=AUCKLAND GRAMMAR SCHOOL Historical Chronology |url=http://www.ags.school.nz/content/about/history.html |publisher=Auckland Grammar School|accessdate=7 September 2010 [/tpl]

==Second Term as Governor of New Zealand==

Grey was again appointed Governor in 1861, to replace Governor Thomas Gore Browne, serving until 1868. His second term as Governor was greatly different from the first, as he had to deal with the demands of an elected parliament, which had been established in 1852.

===Invasion of the Kingitanga===

Immediately prior to Grey’s re-appointment as governor there were rising tensions in Taranaki that eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at Waitara, in what is sometime called the First Taranaki War, from March 1860 until the fighting subsided in 1862.
The leaders of the King movement or Kingitanga, had written a letter to Governor Browne stating that the Waikato tribes had never signed the Treaty of Waitangi and that they were a separate nation.

Grey launched the invasion of the Waikato in 1863 to take control of the heartland of the Kingitanga. The war brought thousands of British troops to New Zealand: 18,000 men served in the British forces at some point during the campaign, with a peak of about 14,000 troops in March 1864.[tpl]cite book| first= James| last= Belich| year= 1986| title= The New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflict| pages = 125, 126|edition= 1st| publisher= Penguin | location= Auckland| isbn= 0-14-011162-X[/tpl]
In the later 1860s the British government determined to withdraw Imperial troops from New Zealand. At the time the Maori chiefs Te Kooti and Titokowaru had the colonial government and settlers extremely alarmed with a series of military successes. With the support of the Premier Edward Stafford, Grey evaded instructions from the Colonial Office to finalise the return of the regiments, which had commenced in 1865 and 1866. In the end the British government recalled Grey in February 1868. He was replaced by Sir George Bowen and during his term hostilities concluded with the abandoned pursuit of war leader Riwha Titokowaru — again in Taranaki — in 1869.

===The legacy of Sir George Grey===

Grey was greatly respected by Māori, and often travelled with a company of chiefs. He induced leading chiefs to write down their accounts of Maori traditions, legends and customs. His principal informant, Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikāheke, taught Grey to speak Māori. Historian Michael King noted: "He learned Māori and persuaded Māori authorities to commit their legends and traditions to writing, some of which were subsequently published ... His collected papers would turn out to be the largest single repository of Māori-language manuscripts."The Penguin History of New Zealand, p. 203.
Grey bought Kawau Island in 1862, on his return to New Zealand for his second term as governor. For 25 years he lavished large amounts of his personal wealth on the island's development, including enlarging and remodelling Mansion House, the former residence of the copper mine superintendent. Here he planted a huge array of exotic trees and shrubs, acclimatised many bird and animal species, and amassed a celebrated collection of rare books and manuscripts, artworks and curiosities, and artefacts from the Māori people over whom he had ruled.
In 1865, during Grey’s second term as governor, the capital was transferred to Wellington, which was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the South Island.

==Governor of Cape Colony==

Grey was Governor of Cape Colony from 5 December 1854 to 15 August 1861. He founded Grey College, Bloemfontein in 1855 and Grey High School in Port Elizabeth in 1856. in 1859 he laid the foundation stone of the New Somerset Hospital, Cape Town. When he left the Cape in 1861 he presented the National Library of South Africa with his remarkable personal collection of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and rare books. In South Africa Grey dealt firmly with the natives, but endeavoured by setting apart tracts of land for their exclusive use to protect them from the white colonists. He more than once acted as arbitrator between the government of the Orange Free State and the natives, and eventually came to the conclusion that a federated South Africa would be a good thing for everyone. The Orange Free State would have been willing to join the federation, and it is probable that the Transvaal would also have agreed. However, Grey was 50 years before his time and the colonial office would not agree to his proposals. In spite of their instructions, Grey continued to advocate union, and, in connection with other matters, such as the attempt to settle soldiers in South Africa after the Crimean War, he several times disregarded his instructions.
When all the circumstances are considered it is not surprising that he was recalled in 1859. He had, however, scarcely reached England before a change of government led to his being given another term, on the understanding that his schemes for the federation of South Africa should be abandoned and that he would in future obey his instructions. Grey was convinced that the boundaries of the South African colonies should be widened, but could not obtain the support of the British government. He was still working for this support when, war with the Māori having broken out, it was decided that Grey should again be appointed governor of New Zealand. When he left his popularity among the people of Cape Colony was unbounded, and the statue erected at Cape Town during his lifetime describes him as "a governor who by his high character as a Christian, a statesman, and a gentleman, had endeared himself to all classes of the community, and who by his zealous devotion to the best interests of South Africa and his able and just administration, has secured the approbation and gratitude of all Her Majesty's subjects in this part of her dominions".

==Premier of New Zealand==

In 1875 he was elected Superintendent of Auckland Province (24 March 1875 – 31 October 1875).[tpl]cite book |last= Scholefield |first= Guy Hardy |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1949 |authorlink=Guy Scholefield |edition= |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1950 |publisher= Govt. Printer |location= Wellington |page=179 [/tpl] He stood in the general election for both the Auckland West and the Thames electorates in the 1875–76 general election. In the two-member Auckland electorate, only Grey and Patrick Dignan were put forward as candidates, and were thus declared elected on 22 December 1875.[tpl]cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=NOT18751223.2.14.2 |title=(By Telegraph).

On election day (6 January 1876), Grey attracted the highest number of votes and, unexpectedly, Rowe beat Vogel into second place (Vogel also stood in Wanganui, where he was returned). Hence Grey and Rowe were declared elected for Thames.[tpl]cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18760108.2.16 |title=THE ELECTIONS|volume=XXXII |issue=5708 |date=8 January 1876 |publisher=The Daily Southern Cross |page=3|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] A protest against Grey's election was lodged with the returning officer the following day, stating that Grey had not been eligible to stand in Thames as he had already been elected in Auckland West.

With this controversy going on for several months unresolved, Grey advised in mid June 1876 in a series of telegrams that he had chosen to represent Auckland West.[tpl]cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18760617.2.12.4 |title=Sir George Grey and the seats for the Thames and City West.|volume=XXXII |issue=5205 |date=17 June 1876|publisher=The Daily Southern Cross |page=3|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] On 8 July, the report of the committee inquiring into his election for Thames was read to the House.

Grey opposed the abolition of the provinces, but his opposition proved ineffective, and the provincial system was abolished in 1876. On the defeat of Harry Atkinson as Premier on 13 October 1877, he was elected Premier by Parliament. His government did not operate particularly well, with Grey seeking to dominate the government and coming into conflict with the Governor. His term as Premier is regarded by historians as a failure. Towards the end of 1879, Grey's government got into difficulties over land tax. Eventually, Grey asked for an early election, in 1879.
Grey was elected in both the Thames and the City of Christchurch electorates in September 1879.[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=WH18790911.2.10|title=General Election News|volume=XII |issue=9511 |date=11 September 1879|publisher=Wanganui Herald|pages=2|accessdate=16 March 2010[/tpl] Grey came first in the three-member Christchurch electorate (Samuel Paull Andrews and Edward Stevens came second with equal numbers of votes,  23 votes ahead of Edward Richardson).[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18790911.2.28|title=The Christchurch Election|date=11 September 1879|issue=3563|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] Richardson petitioned against Grey's return on technical grounds, as Grey had already been elected in the Thames electorate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=THD18791030.2.5|title=The Timaru Herald|volume=XXXI |issue=1594 |date=30 October 1879|publisher=Timaru Herald|pages=2|accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18791103.2.25|title=The Christchurch Election|date=3 November 1879|issue=3608|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl] The electoral commission unseated Grey on 24 October,[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=THD18791025.2.12|title=Sir George Grey unseated for Christchurch|volume=XXXI |issue=1590 |date=25 October 1879|publisher=Timaru Herald|pages=2|accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl] with Richardson offered this vacancy a few days later.

In 1889, Grey put forward the Election of Governor Bill, which would have allowed for a "British subject" to be elected to the office of Governor "precisely as an ordinary parliamentary election in each district."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=THD18890718.2.23&e=-------10--1----0--|title=New Bills|publisher=The Timaru Herald|volume=XLIX|issue=4594|date=18 July 1889|page=3|accessdate=8 February 2011[/tpl]
Grey was now suffering from ill health and he retired from politics in 1890, leaving for Australia. On returning to New Zealand, a deputation requested him to contest the Newton seat in Auckland in the 1891 by-election. The retiring member, David Goldie, also asked Grey to take his seat. Grey was prepared to put his name forward only if the election was unopposed, as he did not want to suffer the excitement of a contested election.[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=PBH18910223.2.13|title=RESIGNATION OF MR GOLDIE, M.H.R|volume=XVIII |issue=6001 |date=23 February 1891|publisher=Poverty Bay Herald|pages=2|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=WC18910227.2.12|title=The Newton Seat.|volume=XXXIII |issue=11205 |date=27 February 1891|publisher=Wanganui Chronicle|pages=2|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] Grey declared his candidacy on 25 March 1891.[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=IT18910327.2.9|title=Telegrams|volume=XVI |issue=20216 |date=27 March 1891|publisher=Inangahua Times|pages=2|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] On 6 April 1891, he was declared elected, as he was unopposed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=MEX18910406.2.18|title=NEW ZEALAND|volume=XXVII |issue=79 |date=6 April 1891|publisher=Marlborough Express|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] In December 1893, Grey was again elected, this time to Auckland City.

==Places and institutions named after Grey==

Places named after Grey include Greytown in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand's North Island, the Grey River in the South Island's West Coast region (and thus indirectly the town of Greymouth at the river's mouth), and the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn; the Division of Grey, an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia and the town of Grey in Western Australia. Grey Street, Melbourne is also believed to have been named after George Edward Grey.
In South Africa, Grey was instrumental in the founding of the Grey Institute, later named the Grey High School, Port Elizabeth, Grey College, Bloemfontein and Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. Grey's Pass near Citrusdal and the towns of Greytown, KwaZulu-Natal and Greyton, Western Cape are named for him, while Lady Grey, Eastern Cape is named after his wife.

==Popular culture==

 The Governor, an historical drama miniseries based on Grey's life, was made by TVNZ and the National Film Unit in 1977, featuring Corin Redgrave in the title role. Despite critical acclaim, the miniseries attracted controversy at the time because of its then-large budget.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/tracking-shots/close-ups/The-Governor.html |title=Tracking Shots: Close Ups on NZ Film History — The Governor/Te Kawana |date=June 2007 |website=New Zealand Film Archive |publisher= |accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl]
