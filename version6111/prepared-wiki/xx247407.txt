Attack of the Mutant Penguins is an action video game developed by Sunrise Games and published by Atari for the Atari Jaguar in 1995.

==Background==

The game was developed by Sunrise Games for Atari UK. Its humour is typically British, and is best compared to games like LemmingsReview at AllGame inasmuch as it contains many puzzle-based levels. It was first demoed at the ECTS show in the UK, where many people thought it was a Jeff Minter title due to the offbeat style.

==Reception==

The game received mixed reviews from critics. It scored 5.9 out of 10 on GameSpot, based on 20 votes. The game's main problem is the confusion that ensues when trying to complete the game.
