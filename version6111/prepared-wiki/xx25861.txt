The Finnish word for thunder, Ukkonen, is the diminutive form of the name Ukko.Compare to English thunder (In the folk poems and prayers he is also given the epithet Ylijumala (English: Overgod), probably in reference to his status as the most highly regarded god and on the other hand his traditional domain in the heavens. Other names for Ukko include Pitkänen (pitkä, "long"), Isäinen (isä, "father"), Isoinen (iso, archaic form of the above, modern meaning "great"). Although portrayed active in myth, Ukko makes all his appearances in legend solely by natural phenomena when appealed to. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
According to Haavio, the name Ukko was sometimes used as a common noun or generalised epithet for multiple deities instead of denoting a specific god.[tpl]cite book|last=Haavio|first=Martti|title=Karjalan jumalat|year=1959|publisher=WSOY|location=Porvoo[/tpl]

==Origins==

It is likely that the figure of Ukko is mostly Indo-European, possibly Baltic, in origin. Ukko is held by researchers of religion to be parallel to Indo-European patriarchal sky deities, for example to Zeus and Jupiter of the Classical Greco-Roman pantheon and the Norse god Thor. Tuuri, a Germanic loan and cognate of Thor, was possibly an alternate name for Ukko.[tpl]cite book|last=Virrankoski|first=Pentti|title=Suomen historia 1&2|year=2009|publisher=SKS|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-952-222-160-5[/tpl] Tuuri is rarely encountered in Finnish mythology, and had been relegated to the mere role of deity of harvest and success. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
It is possible that when Ukko took the position of the preceding sky god Ilmarinen, Ilmarinen's destiny was to become a mortal smith-hero.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Stories tell about Ilmarinen vaulting the sky-dome.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Whether Ilmarinen was an earlier, assumably Uralic sky deity is regardless highly questionable. Some researchers hold Ilmarinen and Ukko equivalent.
The Sami worshipped a similar deity, called Aijeke, probably as result of cultural cross-contamination or common origin. The god was equated with Horagalles.

==Finnish folklore==

Ukko possessed a weapon, often a hammer called Ukonvasara (English: Ukko's hammer), sometimes also an axe (Finnish: Ukonkirves) or a sword, by which he struck lightning (see thunderbolt). Ukko's weapon was largely comparable to the Norse Mjölnir, and Iron Age emblematic pendants depicting hammers and axes similar or identical to Scandinavian specimens have been unearthed in Finland. Like Mjölnir, Ukko's weapon has been linked by some to the boat-shaped battle axes of the Corded Ware culture.
Thunderbolts were sometimes called Ukon vaaja (English: bolt of Ukko) or Ukon nuoli (English: arrow of Ukko). It is possible that the Birch bark letter no. 292, written in a Baltic-Finnic language and unearthed in Novgorod, makes use of the metaphor, also referring to Ukko as doom-god according to one interpretation.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The name Ukon vaaja was also used of Neolithic stone tools such as battles axes, which were often employed as thunderstones to be buried at the corners of dwellings, for example.
Thunderstorms were sometimes interpreted as result of Ukko copulating with his wife Akka ("old woman" in modern Finnish, whereas ukko carries the meaning of "old man").[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] He also was believed to cause thunderstorms by driving his chariot through the skies. 
A viper with a serrated line on its back was considered a symbol of thunder.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Neolithic stone carvings have been found in Russian Karelia which have features of both snakes and lightning. It is, however, uncertain whether these are directly connected to the figure of Ukko. Evidence for worship of snakes is found among different cultures around the Baltic, amongst them Estonians and Finns.[tpl]cite web|title=Suojelevat käärmeet|url=http://www.taivaannaula.org/2011/04/suojelevat-kaarmeet/[/tpl]
There is evidence that the rowan tree was held sacred to Ukko.[tpl]cite book|last=Haavio|first=Martti|title=Suomalainen mytologia|year=1967|publisher=WSOY|location=Porvoo, Helsinki[/tpl] Rauni, a vaguely defined being has been hypothesised to be cognate to Germanic words for the rowan tree through Old Norse *raunir.[tpl]cite book|last=Haavio|first=Martti|title=Karjalan jumalat|year=1959|publisher=WSOY|location=Porvoo[/tpl]
The ladybird was also considered sacred to Ukko and called ukonlehmä (English: Ukko's cow).[tpl]cite book|last=Virrankoski|first=Pentti|title=Suomen historia 1&2|year=2009|publisher=SKS|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-952-222-160-5[/tpl]

==Festivals dedicated to Ukko==

Before the advent of Christianity, the Midsummer festival in Finland, today known as Juhannus after John the Baptist (Finnish: Johannes Kastaja), was held in honor of Ukko and called Ukon juhla (English: Festival of Ukko). This tradition carried to the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|title=Juhannus, mittumaari, vuotuisjuhlista vehrein|url=http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=2338|accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl]
Also dedicated to Ukko were the Vakkajuhlat (English: Vakka festival) also known as Ukon vakat (Ukko's vakkas) or simply vakat (Vakkas). Vakkas was commonly held in May coinciding with the spring sowing. During vakkas it was customary to consume or otherwise offer a container or some other vessel (Finnish: vakka) of an alcoholic beverage or food as sacrifice. It appears that often the festival was held in the community's sacred grove or hiisi where an animal sacrifice was sometimes also performed as part of the same festival. This ceremony was believed to guarantee good weather for the coming year and thus a good harvest.[tpl]cite book|last=Haavio|first=Martti|title=Suomalainen mytologia|year=1967|publisher=WSOY|location=Porvoo, Helsinki[/tpl]
It appears that the vakka tradition was rather lively. The last uncontested reports of vakkas being held originate in the 19th century, although sporadic reports also surface in the 20th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Haavio|first=Martti|title=Suomalainen mytologia|year=1967|publisher=WSOY|location=Porvoo, Helsinki[/tpl] The festival is also mentioned by the Finnish reformer Mikael Agricola in his account of what from his point of view was Finnish idolatry.[tpl]cite web|title=I.

==Eponymy==

A number of toponyms in Finland and surrounding regions contain some form of the name Ukko.

==Ukko and the Christian God==

It is possible that during and after the Christianisation of Finland, the figure of Ukko became conflated with that of the Christian deity. It has been suggested that this was in part because of the relative similarity between the deities.

==Modern influence==

The Weather Channel list of winter storms for 2012 list Ukko as one of the alphabetic names they used.http://www.weather.com/news/why-we-name-winter-storms-20121001
