[[Anastrophe]]

CATEGORIES: Rhetorical techniques

Anastrophe (from the [tpl]lang-el|ἀναστροφή[/tpl], anastrophē, "a turning back or about") is a figure of speech in which the syntactically correct order of subject, verb and object is changed.  For example, the usual English order of  subject, object and verb might be changed to object-subject-verb, as in saying "potatoes I like" to mean "I like potatoes."[tpl]cite book | last1 = Cioffi | year = 2009 | title = The Imaginative Argument: A Practical Manifesto for Writers | publisher = Princeton University Press | page = 137 | isbn= 140082656X[/tpl]- silva rhetoricae

Yoda, a mentor character in the Star Wars movies, often uses anastrophe:
Yoda, as a non-native English speaker, may be doing this accidentally, not for deliberate emphasis.
In English, because its natural word order is settled, anastrophe emphasizes the displaced word or phrase. For example, the name of the City Beautiful urbanist movement emphasizes "beautiful"; similarly, in the line "This is the forest primeval" (from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline), "primeval" comes to the fore. Where the emphasis that comes from anastrophe is not an issue, "inversion" is a perfectly suitable synonym.
Anastrophe is common in Greek and Latin poetry.  For example, in the first line of the Aeneid:
the genitive case noun Troiæ ("of Troy") has been separated from the noun it governs (oris, "shores") in a way that would be rather unusual in Latin prose.  In fact, given the liberty of Latin word order, "of Troy" might be taken to modify "arms" or "the man", but it is not the custom to interpret the word that way.  
Anastrophe also occurs in English poetry.  For example, in the third verse of Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:
the word order of "his hand dropt he" is not the customary word order in English, even in the archaic English that Coleridge seeks to imitate.  However, excessive use of the device where the emphasis is unnecessary or even unintended, especially for the sake of rhyme or metre, is usually[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] considered a flaw; consider the clumsy versification of Sternhold and Hopkins's metrical psalter:
However, some poets have a style that depends on heavy use of anastrophe.  Gerard Manley Hopkins is particularly identified with the device, which renders his poetry susceptible to parody:
When anastrophe draws an adverb to the head of a thought, for emphasis, the verb is drawn along too, resulting in a verb-subject inversion:
