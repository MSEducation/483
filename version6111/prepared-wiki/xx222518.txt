Fr. Felix de Huerta was a Franciscan scholar and missionary to the Philippines, best known today as the author of Estado geográfico, topográfico, estadístico, histórico- religioso de la santa y apostólica Provincia de San Gregorio Magno, a record of the histories Catholic parishes which is now an essential tool local histories of Philippine municipalities.
Another of his achievements was convincing the Archbishop of Manila and the government to establish what later became the Manila's Monte de Piedad Savings and Mortgage Bank, with the intent of providing a savings bank for Manila’s poor which would charge moderate interest rates.
In 1859, having been assigned as administrator of San Lazaro Hospital for lepers, Fr. Huerta worked hard to have the hospital reconstructed instead of being closed for being run down.
In his search through financial documents during this effort, he discovered the existence of a previously forgotten fund by General Francisco Carriedo y Peredo for the creation of the first water system in Manila.  Fr. Huerta pursued this project as well, and as a result the water system, with 153 hydrants, was inaugurated on August 23, 1882.
