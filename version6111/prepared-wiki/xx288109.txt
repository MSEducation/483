George attended school in Fremantle until he joined his father's business at the age of seventeen. Alfred Davies, between 1849 and 1869, built extensive real estate holdings along some of Fremantle's main streets and operated a pawnbroking business between 1870 and 1874. George formed his own business after working with his father for a decade. Davies sold spirits but he was to become well known for his wine, which he bottled and sold at premises known as the Grosvenor Cellars, in High Street and Bannister Street in Fremantle. The cellars also held bottling equipment, which enabled his business to buy in grapes to supply the demand for his creation.[tpl]cite web|title=George Alfred Davies|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia/George_Alfred_Davies|work=History of West Australia|publisher=Wikisource|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] In 1892 Davies was one of only three people who had a colonial wine licence in Fremantle.[tpl]cite news|title=Fremantle Licensing Court|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3042889|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=The West Australian|date=7 December 1892[/tpl] 
In 1875 he married Letitia "Letty" King (1853-1948), with whom he had nine children: George (1872-1940),[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46728095 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=Perth Gazette |location=Perth, WA |date=23 July 1940 |accessdate=20 August 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] an unnamed girl (1878-1878), Emma Elizabeth (1879-), Mary Elizabeth (1879-), Ernest Edgar (1884-1914),[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92233867 |title=Personal Items |newspaper=Kalgoorlie Miner |location=WA |date=1 May 1913 |accessdate=20 August 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] Ethel May (1888-), Harold Alfred (1893-), Nellie Hannah (1895-) and Georgina Adeline (1897-).
Davies was active in public life and supported the idea of enterprises and facilities in public ownership. He was involved in establishing public baths on the sea front and in ensuring that the more attractive land around Fremantle was not sold off.
Davies owned a plot of land in 1880, which he rented out, but he appears to have had the land cleared by the time he planned a new hotel building. This building, which opened in 1887, was on the corner of South Terrace and Norfolk Street and was known as the Oddfellow's Hotel. This building is heritage listed and is still standing,[tpl]cite web|title=Oddfellow's Hotel|url=http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/0e34be66-9961-42e2-960f-b78f37e20f0f|publisher=stateheritage.wa.gov.au|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] and is now known as the Norfolk Hotel.[tpl]cite web|title=About the Norfolk Hotel|url=http://www.norfolkhotel.com.au/about/default.aspx|publisher=norfolkhotel.com.au|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] 
Davies and his brother Edward were directors of the Fremantle Building Society, which Davies saw as important as it enabled others to establish themselves as property owners.
Davies was elected Mayor of Fremantle in December 1894[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3069839 |title=Fremantle Municipality |newspaper=Perth Gazette |location=Perth, WA |date=4 December 1894 |accessdate=20 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] and was made a Justice of the Peace in March 1895. He is said to have been offered a second term but stood down to allow others to share the honour of being mayor.
