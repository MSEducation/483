USS ''Antrim'' (FFG-20) was the twelfth ship of the Oliver Hazard Perry class of guided-missile frigates. She was named for Rear Admiral Richard Nott Antrim (1907–1969).  Ordered from Todd Pacific, Seattle, WA on 28 February 1977 as part of the FY77 program, Antrim was laid down on 21 June 1978, launched on 27 March 1979, and commissioned on 26 September 1981.
On 10 February 1983, the USS Antrim was conducting a live fire exercise off the east coast of the United States using the Phalanx CIWS against a target drone.  Although the drone was successfully engaged at close range, the target debris bounced off the sea surface and struck the ship, causing significant damage and fire from the drone's residual fuel which killed a civilian instructor;http://www.navysite.de/ffg/FFG20.HTMhttp://www.historycentral.com/navy/FFG/Antrim.html
