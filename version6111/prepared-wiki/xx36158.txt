Air Canada ([tpl]tsx|AC.A|AC.B[/tpl]) is the flag carrier and largest airline of Canada. The airline, founded in 1936, provides scheduled and charter air transport for passengers and cargo to 178 destinations worldwide. It is the world's seventh-largest passenger airline by fleet size, and the airline is a founding member of Star Alliance, an alliance formed in 1997 which now has 28 member airlines.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/meta/airlines/AC.html | title=Star Alliance Member Airline - Air Canada | accessdate=4 April 2009 | publisher=Star Alliance | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090417050258/http://www.staralliance.com/en/meta/airlines/AC.html| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Air Canada's corporate headquarters are located in Montreal, Quebec,"Investors Contacts" Air Canada.

Air Canada had passenger revenues of CA$10.2 billion in 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aircanada.com/en/about/investor/documents/2011_FSN_q4.pdf |title=2011 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes |publisher=Air Canada |format=PDF |accessdate=8 August 2012[/tpl] The airline's regional service is Air Canada Express.
Canada's national airline originated from the Canadian federal government's 1936 creation of Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA), which began operating their first transcontinental flight routes in 1938. In 1965, TCA was renamed Air Canada following government approval. After the deregulation of the Canadian airline market in the 1980s, the airline was privatized in 1988. In 2001, Air Canada acquired their largest rival, Canadian Airlines. In 2003, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection and in the following year emerged and reorganized under the holding company ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. In 2006, 34 million people flew with Air Canada as the airline celebrated their 70th anniversary. Air Canada is presently recognized as the Skytrax Best International Airline in North America, as well as being ranked as a 4 Star Airline by Skytrax in 2013.[tpl]cite web|last=Skytrax|first=Customer Reviews|title=Air Canada Passenger Trip Reviews|url=http://www.airlinequality.com/Forum/air_can.htm|publisher=Skytrax|accessdate=28 December 2013[/tpl]
Air Canada has a fleet of Airbus A330, Boeing 767, and Boeing 777 wide-body jetliners on long-haul routes and uses the Airbus A320 family aircraft, including the A319, A320, and A321 variations, and Embraer E170/E190 family aircraft on short-haul routes. The carrier's operating divisions include Air Canada Cargo and Air Canada Jetz. Their subsidiary, Air Canada Vacations, provides vacation packages to over 90 destinations. Together with their regional partners, the airline operates on average more than 1,530 scheduled flights daily.[ref]

==History==

===Trans-Canada Airlines===

Air Canada's predecessor, Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA), was created by legislation of the federal government as a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway (CNR) on 11 April 1936. The newly created Department of Transport under Minister C. D. Howe desired an airline under government control to link cities on the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. Using $5 million in government seed money, two Lockheed Model 10 Electras and one Boeing Stearman biplane were purchased from Canadian Airways.[tpl]cite news | title=Indepth: Air Canada Timeline | date=20 June 2005 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aircanada/timeline.html | publisher=CBC News | accessdate=4 April 2009 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Experienced airline executives from United Airlines and American Airlines were brought in.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aircanada/history.html | title=Air Canada History | publisher=CBC News | date=14 May 2004 | accessdate=4 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090331113445/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aircanada/history.html| archivedate= 31 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Passenger flights began on 1 September 1937, with an Electra carrying two passengers and mail from Vancouver to Seattle, a $14.20 round trip. On 1 July 1938 TCA hired their first flight attendants.Mills, Albert J, Mills, Jean Helms. Masculinity and the Making of Trans-Canada Air Lines, 1937-1940: A Feminist Poststructuralist Account. Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, March 2006. findarticles.com Date accessed: 18 October 2007 Transcontinental routes from Montreal to Vancouver began on 1 April 1939, using 12 Lockheed Model 14 Super Electras and six Lockheed Model 18 Lodestars. By January 1940 the airline had grown to about 500 employees.
In 1942, Canadian Pacific Airlines suggested a merger with TCA. Prime Minister Mackenzie King rejected the proposal and introduced legislation regulating TCA as the only airline in Canada allowed to provide transcontinental flights. With the increase in air travel after World War II, CP Air was granted one coast-to-coast flight, and a few international routes.
Originally headquartered in Winnipeg, which was also the site of the national maintenance base, the federal government moved the headquarters to Montreal in 1949; the maintenance base later also moved east. With the development of the ReserVec in 1953 TCA became the first airline in the world to use a computer reservation system with remote terminals.John Vardalas, "From DATAR to the FP-6000", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol 16 No 2, 1994, pp. 20-30[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atwonline.com/magazine/article.html?articleID=2051|title=Air Canada: Celebrating 70 Years of Leadership|publisher=Aviation Week & Space Technology|accessdate=11 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100115010750/http://atwonline.com/magazine/article.html?articleID=2051| archivedate= 15 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
[/ref]
By 1964, TCA had grown to become Canada's national airline, and in 1964 future Prime Minister Jean Chrétien submitted a private member's bill to change the name of the airline from Trans-Canada Airlines to Air Canada, the name TCA had been using in French. This bill failed but it was later resubmitted and passed, with the name change taking effect on 1 January 1965.

===1970s: early years===

During the 1970s government regulations ensured Air Canada's dominance over domestic regional carriers and rival CP Air. Short-haul carriers were each restricted to one of five regions, and could not compete directly with Air Canada and CP Air. CP Air was subject to capacity limits on intercontinental flights, and restricted from domestic operations. Air Canada's fares were also subject to regulation by the government.
In the late 1970s, with reorganization at CNR, Air Canada became an independent Crown corporation. The Air Canada Act of 1978 ensured that the carrier would compete on a more equal footing with rival regional airlines and CP Air, and ended the government's direct regulatory control over Air Canada's routings, fares, and services.  The act also transferred ownership from Canadian National Railway to a subsidiary of the national government. Deregulation of the Canadian airline market, under the new National Transportation Act, 1987 officially opened the airline market in Canada to equal competition.[tpl]cite web | work=The Canadian Airline Industry | date=14 November 2002 | first=John | last=Christopher | first2=Joseph P. | last2=Dion | url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/892-e.htm | accessdate=4 April 2009 | title=Issue Definition | publisher=Government of Canada / Depository Services Program [/tpl] The carrier's fleet expansion saw the acquisition of Boeing 727, Boeing 747, and Lockheed Tristar jetliners.
With new fleet expenditures outpacing earnings, Air Canada officials indicated that the carrier would need additional sources of capital to fund their modernisation. By 1985 the Canadian government was indicating a willingness to privatise both Canadian National Railways and Air Canada. In 1988 Air Canada was privatised, and 43% of shares are sold on the public market, with the initial public offering completed in October of that year. By this time, long-haul rival CP Air had become Canadian Airlines International following their acquisition by Pacific Western Airlines.
On 7 December 1987, Air Canada became the first airline in the world with a fleet-wide non-smoking policy,[tpl]cite web | title=Air Canada Innovations | publisher=Air Canada | url=http://www.aircanada.com/en/about/media/facts/innovations.html | accessdate=24 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090430030117/http://www.aircanada.com/en/about/media/facts/innovations.html| archivedate= 30 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and in 1989 became completely privatised. The successful privatisation effort was aided by a public relations effort led by company president Claude I. Taylor and chief executive officer Pierre J. Jeanniot.

===1990s: strategic changes===

In the early 1990s, Air Canada encountered financial difficulties as the airline industry slumped in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. In response, the airline restructured management, hiring former Delta Air Lines executive Hollis L. Harris as its CEO. Harris restructured the airline's operations, reduced management positions, moved the corporate headquarters to Dorval Airport, and sold the enRoute card business to Diners Club in 1992.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED8163BF934A15750C0A964958260 | title=Air Canada Sells Credit Card Unit | publisher=The New York Times | accessdate=24 May 2009 | date=27 March 1992[/tpl] By 1994, Air Canada had returned to profitability. The same year also saw the carrier winning route access to fly from Canada to the new Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.
In 1995, taking advantage of a new U.S.-Canada open skies agreement, Air Canada added 30 new trans-border routes. In May 1997, Air Canada became a founding member of the Star Alliance, with the airline launching codeshares with several of the alliance's members. The second half of the 1990s saw the airline earn consistent profits, totaling $1 billion for the 1997 to 1999 period.
On 2 September 1998, pilots for Air Canada launched the company's first pilots' strike,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011771 | title=Air Canada Strike Settled | publisher=Maclean's | accessdate=24 May 2009 | date=21 September 1998[/tpl] demanding higher wages. At the end of 1999, the Canadian government relaxed some of the aviation regulations, aimed at creating a consolidation of the Canadian airline industry. That year, American Airlines in conjunction with Canadian financial company Onex Corp, launched a takeover bid of ailing rival Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, spurring Air Canada to submit a competing offer for their largest rival.

===2000s: merger and reorganization===

In January 2001, Air Canada acquired Canada's second largest air carrier, Canadian Airlines, merging the latter's operations, becoming the world's twelfth-largest airline in the first decade of the 21st century. As Air Canada gained access to their former rival's financial statements, officials learned that the carrier was in worse financial shape than was previously believed. An expedited merger strategy was pursued, but in summer 2000 integration efforts led to flight delays, luggage problems and other frustrations. However, service improved following Air Canada officials' pledge to do so by January 2001. The airline was confronted by the global aviation market downturn and increased competition, posting back-to-back losses in 2001 and 2002.

====Bankruptcy and restructuring====

As Air Canada had employed a scorched earth policy to prevent the Onex proposed acquisition as one of its lines of defence, they had burdened themselves with onerous contracts with virtually all of their suppliers. As a result, on 1 April 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act; they emerged from this protection on 30 September 2004, 18 months later.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][/ref] During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two competing bids from Cerberus Capital Management and Victor Li. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair Dan Quayle, the former Vice President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because they had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the CAW. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's Trinity Time Investments, which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-04-05-air-canada_x.htm |title=Air Canada unions dig in, rescue deal seen at risk |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=5 April 2004 |accessdate=21 February 2011[/tpl]
Finally, Deutsche Bank unveiled an $850 million financing package for Air Canada, if they would cut $200 million in annual cost cutting in addition to the $1.1 billion that the unions agreed on in 2003. It was accepted after last-minute talks between CEO Robert Milton and CAW president Buzz Hargrove got the union concessions needed to let the bid go through.Air Canada faces deadline on Deutsche Bank deal - 14 May 2004 - cbc.com Date accessed: 20 October 2008[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC815759 | title=Air Canada | publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia | accessdate=12 January 2010 | first=Sasha | last=Yusufali [/tpl]

===Financial difficulties===

Since the late 2000s, Air Canada has been facing a number of financial difficulties, including the global recession, leading to speculation that they could file for bankruptcy, less than a decade after they exited bankruptcy on 30 September 2004.FP Story[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]

Federal finance minister Jim Flaherty appointed retired judge James Farley, who had presided over Air Canada's 2003 bankruptcy, to mediate pension issues between the company and their unions and retirees. The contracts with four of their unions also expired around this time. The airline stated that their $2.85-billion pension shortfall (which grew from $1.2-billion in 2007) was a "liquidity risk" in its first-quarter report, and it required new financing and pension "relief" to conserve cash for 2010 operations. The company was obligated to pay $650-million into the pension fund but it suffered a 2009 Q1 loss of $400-million, so it requested a moratorium on its pension payments in 2009. The unions had insisted on financial guarantees before agreeing on a deal.

===Historic fleet===

In 1963, Air Canada claimed to be the first major air carrier to have adopted turbine technology on its entire fleet for lower maintenance costs and higher productivity. It also claimed to be the first world airline to introduce jet freighter service using DC-8 equipment.[tpl]cite web | url=http://unb.ca/transpo/mynet/mtx82.htm | publisher=University of New Brunswick, Transportation Group | work=Mynet | accessdate=24 May 2009 | title=Airplanes and Aircraft [/tpl]
Air Canada was also one of the first airlines to have its entire fleet of unpressurised aircraft equipped with fixed oxygen systems for use by flight crew and passengers, using the rebreathing bag principle.
The following is a list of aircraft that Air Canada has operated since 1937, and are now no longer in the fleet:
