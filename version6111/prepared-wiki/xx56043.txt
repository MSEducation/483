==History==

The incident occurred on October 26, 2001 when Mallard's car struck the homeless pedestrian Gregory Glen Biggs; at the time Mallard was believed to have been driving while intoxicated by a combination of marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90458,00.html |title=Windshield Killer Takes Stand in Sentencing Hearing |publisher=Fox News |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] The force of the impact sent Biggs flying through the windshield, lodging him there.
Mallard then drove home, leaving the injured Biggs stuck in her windshield, and parked her car in her garage.
After the accident Mallard did not notify the police nor did she get Biggs any medical attention, even though she was a former nurse's aide.CNN.com - Motorist given 50 year-sentence in windshield murder trial - Jun. 28, 2003 [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5uyIHuuka|date =2010-12-14[/tpl] When Biggs died an unknown number of hours later, still in the windshield of her car in her garage, she called a male friend, Clete Jackson, for assistance. Mallard, Jackson, and Jackson's cousin Herbert Tyrone Cleveland, took the body to a park and left it there, even going so far as to set fire to part of the car in an attempt to disguise the evidence. The three were each convicted on charges of tampering with evidence for this action.Ex-boyfriend of driver describes disposing of accident victim's body, by Rochelle Steinhaus, CourtTV.com, June 25, 2003 .

Other experts testified that they agreed that Biggs would have survived. "There's not a member of the Fort Worth Fire Department that could not have saved Mr. Biggs' life," testified Capt. Jim Sowder.2nd Jackson ref [tpl]specify|date=November 2012[/tpl] Mallard was convicted of murder in June 2003, with the 50-year murder sentence and 10-year tampering sentence to run concurrently.
