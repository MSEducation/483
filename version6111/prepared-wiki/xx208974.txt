==Symbols==

===Emblem===

The 2008 Summer Olympics emblem is known as Dancing Beijing ([tpl]Zh|舞动的北京[/tpl]) designed by Guo Chunning. The emblem combines a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character jīng (京, "national capital", also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolizes the invitation of China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was very happy with the emblem, saying, "Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people."[tpl]cite news |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200308/03/eng20030803_121618.shtml |title = Rogge's Message for Beijing Olympics Emblem Unveiling |publisher = People's Daily Online |date = 2003-08-03 |accessdate = 2006-12-19[/tpl]

===Mascot===

The Fuwa consist of five members that incorporate fish, giant panda, fire, Tibetan antelope, and swallow designs. The Fuwa each have as their primary color one of the colors of the five Olympic Rings that stand for the five continents. The five Fuwa are named Beibei, Jingjing, Huanhuan, Yingying, and Nini.
