[[District Council of Coober Pedy]]

CATEGORIES: Local Government Areas of South Australia

The District Council of Coober Pedy is a local government area located around the opal mining town of the same name in Outback South Australia.  The district is based around large opal deposits, and has become a major mining town, as well as  a popular tourist town.

==History==

The town of Coober Pedy was settled entirely for the large finds of opal nearby, with the first deposits uncovered in 1915, before substantially more miners moved in by 1917. The town was named ‘Coober Pedy’ by the local Progress and Miners Association in 1920 from the Aboriginal words "Kupa Piti", meaning white man's hole or waterhole.[ref]

With a growing population of over 3000 in 1980, the move was made to establish local government in the area. Although there was some initial controversy, the first elections were held in 1987, signalling the establishment of the council.

==Economy==

Since the establishment of the town, the district has relied nearly solely on the mining of the gemstone opal. After the initial discovery in 1915, a number of large strikes, particularly in 1946 saw renewed interest, and by the 1960s, opal mining was a multi million dollar industry, and has remained that way to the present day.
Tourism is a rapidly growing facet of the districts economy, with tourists visiting the area to see the opal mines and the unique underground lifestyle of the town.[ref]

==Localities==

The town of Coober Pedy is the only locality in the district, but the council is not confined exclusively to the town area, and includes the neighbouring opal mining fields.[tpl]Citation | last = LGA of South Australia | title = DC of Coober Pedy | url =  http://www.lga.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=4159 | accessdate = 2007-05-30 [/tpl]
