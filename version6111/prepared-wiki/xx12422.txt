===Other compounds===

Recently, there has been an interest in xenon compounds where xenon is directly bonded to a less electronegative element than fluorine or oxygen, particularly carbon.[ref]
</ref> Electron-withdrawing groups, such as groups with fluorine substitution, are necessary to stabilize these compounds.<ref name="henderson" /> Numerous such compounds have been characterized, including:<ref name="mackay1" /><ref>
</ref>
Other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include [tpl]chem|F–Xe–N(SO|2|F)|2[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|F–Xe–BF|2[/tpl]. The latter is synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate, [tpl]chem|O|2|BF|4[/tpl], at −100 °C.[ref]
</ref>
An unusual ion containing xenon is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, [tpl]chem|AuXe|4|2+[/tpl], which contains Xe–Au bonds.[ref]
