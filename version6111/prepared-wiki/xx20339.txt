==History==

===Colonial===

Albany County was created on November 1, 1683 by New York Governor Thomas Dongan, and later confirmed on October 1, 1691.[tpl]cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+albany+county&q= | page = 12[/tpl] The act creating the county vaguely defined its territory "to containe the Towns of Albany, the Collony Rensselaerwyck, Schonecteda, and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Plantaçons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelef's Creek, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creek (Saugerties) to the Sarraghtoga."[tpl]cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W.

Livingston Manor was annexed to Albany County from Dutchess County in 1717. Albany's boundaries were nailed down more specifically as various state statutes would add land to the county, or more commonly subtract land for the formation of new counties.[tpl]cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+albany+county&q= | page = 71[/tpl] In 1772 with the creation of Tryon County and Charlotte County Albany gained definitive boundaries and included what are now Albany, Columbia, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties; large parts of Greene and Washington counties; and the disputed southwest corner of Vermont.[tpl]cite web | title = The Districts of Albany County, New York, 1772–1784 | publisher = The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society | author = David Kendall Martin | url = http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&op=viewarticle&artid=72 | accessdate = 2009-08-30 | date = Fall 1990[/tpl]
The city of Albany was the first municipality within this large county, as the village (dorp in Dutch) of Beverwyck by the Director-General of New Amsterdam, Pieter Stuyvesant, who also established the first court in Albany.[tpl]cite book| title = The Settlement and Early History of Albany | author = William Barnes | publisher = Gould, Banks, & Gould | year = 1851 | accessdate = 2009-03-07 | page = 17[/tpl] Albany was then erected as a city in 1686 by Governor Dongan through the Dongan Charter. Schenectady was given a patent with some municipal rights in 1684 and became a borough in 1765. The Manor of Rensselaerswyck was created as a district within the county in 1772, and subsequently divided into two districts, one on each side of the Hudson River in 1779. The west district included all of what is now Albany County with the exception of what lands were in the city of Albany at that time.[tpl]cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+albany+county&q= | page = 72[/tpl] Though the Manor of Rensselaerswyck was the only district (along with the city of Albany) in what is today Albany County, it was not the only district in what was Albany County at the time. Pittstown in 1761, and Duanesburgh in 1764, were created as townships. However, when districts were created in 1772 those townships were incorporated into new districts, Pittstown in Schaghticoke and Duanesburgh into the United Districts of Duanesburgh and Schoharie. Schenectady was made from a borough to a district in 1772 as well.[tpl]cite book | title = Gazetteer of the State of New York | author = John French | page = 598 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=R_zHwh4xByQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gazetteer+new+york#v=onepage&q=saratoga%20county | year = 1860 | accessdate = 2009-08-30 | publisher = R. Pearsall Smith[/tpl] Other districts established in 1772 were Hoosick, Coxsackie, Cambridge, Saratoga, Halfmoon, Kinderhook, Kings, Claverack, Great Imboght, and the Manor of Livingston.
In a census of 1697, there were 1,452 individuals living in Albany County, two years later it would be counted as 2,016 at the beginning of King William's War. By the end of the war in 1698  the population had dropped to 1,482, but rebounded quickly and was at 2,273 by 1703. By 1723, it had increased to 6,501 and in 1731 to 8,573, which was slightly less than the population within the city of New York in the same year. In 1737, the inhabitants of Albany County would outnumber those of New York County by 17 people. In 1774, Albany County, with 42,706 people, was the largest county in colonial New York. According to the first Federal Census in 1790, Albany County reached 75,921 inhabitants and was still the largest county in the state.[tpl]cite web | title = Albany County | publisher = New York State Museum | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/albanycounty.html | accessdate = 2009-08-30[/tpl]

===Formation of towns===

On March 7, 1788, the state of New York divided the entire state into towns eliminating districts as administrative units by passing New York Laws of 1788, Chapters 63 and 64.[tpl]cite book | title = Laws of the State of New York | url = http://books.google.com/?id=GBWxAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA748&dq=an+act+for+dividing+the+counties+of+this+state+into+towns&q=an%20act%20for%20dividing%20the%20counties%20of%20this%20state%20into%20towns | page = 748 | publisher = State of New York | year = 1788 | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | author1 = (state), New York[/tpl]

===Timeline of boundary changes===

Albany County was one of the original twelve counties created by the Province of New York on November 1, 1683.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 4/1:122) At that time it included all of the present Bennington County, Vermont, all of New York state north of the counties of Dutchess and Ulster, and theoretically stretched west to the Pacific Ocean.Thorne, Kathryn Ford, Compiler & Long, John H., Editor: New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries; The Newbury Library; 1993.
On May 27, 1717, Albany County was adjusted to gain an indefinite amount of land from Dutchess County and other non-county lands.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 333/1:915).
On October 7, 1763, King George III, as part of his Proclamation of 1763, created the new province of Quebec, implicitly setting the northern limit of New York at the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude from the Atlantic-St. Lawrence watershed westward to the St. Lawrence River, implicitly setting the northern limit of Albany County, but it was never mapped.(Cappon, Petchenik, and Long, 1, 77, 90; Shortt and Doughty, 119—120).
On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. Albany County implicitly gained present-day Vermont. Although disputes occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, and has remained unchanged to the present. When New York refused to recognize land titles through the New Hampshire Grants (towns created earlier by New Hampshire in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont in 1777.(Slade, 13—19; Van Zandt, 63).
On July 3, 1766, Cumberland County was partitioned from Albany County to cover all territory to the northern and eastern limits of the colony, including Windsor County, most of Windham County, and parts of Bennington and Rutland counties in present-day Vermont.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:904).
On June 26, 1767, Albany County regained all of Cumberland County.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:903).
On March 19, 1768, Albany County was re-partitioned, and Cumberland County restored.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:400).
On March 16, 1770, Albany County was again partitioned. Gloucester County was created to include all of Orange, Caledonia and Essex counties, most of Washington County, and parts of Orleans, Lamoille, Addison and Chittenden counties in present-day Vermont.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:401).
On March 12, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, this time into the counties of Albany, Tryon (now Montgomery), and Charlotte (now Washington). This established a definite area for Albany County of [tpl]convert|5,470|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl].(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1534/5:321).
On March 24, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, with an additional [tpl]convert|50|sqmi[/tpl] handed over to Cumberland County.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:402).
On March 9, 1774, Albany County was partitioned again, this time passing [tpl]convert|1090|sqmi[/tpl] to Ulster County.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1665/5:662).
On April 1, 1775, Albany was again partitioned, this time giving up [tpl]convert|60|sqmi[/tpl] to Charlotte County, who then exchanged this land with a like parcel in Cumberland County.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1719/5:779).
On January 15, 1777, Albany County was again partitioned, this time on account of the independence of Vermont from New York, reducing Albany County by an additional [tpl]convert|300|sqmi[/tpl].(Slade, 70–73; Van Zandt, 64; C. Williamson, 82–84, map facing 95, 100–102, 112–113).
On June 26, 1781, Bennington County, Vermont attempted to annex a portion of Albany County that today includes portions of Washington and Rensselaer counties to form what they called "The West Union".(Vt. State papers, 13:45–46). The fledgling United States – under the Articles of Confederation – arbitrated this annexation, and condemned it, resulting in Vermont ceasing the annexation on 1782-02-23.(Vt. State papers, vol 3, pt. 2; pp. 67–68).
On April 4, 1786, Columbia County was created from [tpl]convert|650|sqmi[/tpl] of Albany County land.(N.Y. Laws 1786, 9th sess., ch. 28/p. 49).
On March 7, 1788, New York, refusing to recognize the independence of Vermont, and the attendant elimination of Cumberland County, attempted to adjust the line that separated Cumberland from Albany County in present-day Vermont, but to no effect.(N.Y. Laws 1788, 11th sess., ch. 63/pp. 746–747).
On February 7, 1791, Albany County was partitioned again, this time to form Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. Rensselaer received [tpl]convert|660|sqmi[/tpl], while Saratoga received [tpl]convert|850|sqmi[/tpl]. Also the town of Cambridge was transferred to Washington County. A total of [tpl]convert|1680|sqmi[/tpl] changed hands.(N.Y. Laws 1791, 14th sess., ch. 4/p. 201).
On June 1, 1795, Albany County was once again partitioned, this time losing [tpl]convert|460|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] to Schoharie County.(N.Y. Laws 1795, 18th sess., ch. 42/p. 588).
On April 5, 1798, another partition took place, with [tpl]convert|90|sqmi[/tpl] passing to Ulster County.(N.Y. Laws 1798,21st sess., ch. 93/p. 273).
On March 25, 1800, once again Albany County was partitioned, with [tpl]convert|360|sqmi[/tpl] being used to create Greene County.(N.Y. Laws 1800, 23rd sess., ch. 59/p. 503).
On April 3, 1801, all New York counties were redefined, with Albany County gaining [tpl]convert|10|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl].(N.Y. Laws 1801,24th sess., ch. 123/p. 290).
On March 3, 1808, Albany County turned Havre Island over to Saratoga County, with no resultant loss in land.(N.Y. Laws 1888, 111th sess., ch. 42/p. 85).
On March 7, 1809, Schenectady County was created from [tpl]convert|230|sqmi[/tpl] of Albany County land.(N.Y. Laws 1808, 32nd sess., ch. 65, sec. 1/p. 458).
The result was the production of Albany County as it exists today.

==Geography==

Albany County is in the east central part of New York, extending southward and westward from the point where the Mohawk River joins the Hudson River. Its eastern boundary is the Hudson; a portion of its northern boundary is the Mohawk.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [tpl]convert|533|sqmi[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|523|sqmi[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|10|sqmi[/tpl] (1.83%) is water.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl]
The terrain of the county ranges from flat near the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers to high and hilly to the southwest, where the Helderberg Escarpment marks the beginnings of the Catskill Mountains. The highest point is one of several summits near Henry Hill at approximately 2,160 feet (658 m) above sea level; the lowest point is sea level along the Hudson.

===Climate===

The Capital District has a humid continental climate, with cold, snowy winters, and hot, wet summers. Albany receives around [tpl]convert|36.2|in|mm[/tpl] of rain per year, with 135 days of at least [tpl]convert|0.01|in|mm[/tpl] of precipitation. Snowfall is significant, totaling about [tpl]convert|63|in|mm[/tpl] annually,[tpl]cite web | title = Climate information for Albany, New York | publisher = climate-zone.com | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | url = http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/new-york/albany/| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090511025254/http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/new-york/albany/| archivedate= 11 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] but with less accumulation than the lake-effect areas to the north and west, being far enough from Lake Ontario. Albany County is however, close enough to the coast to receive heavy snow from Nor'easters, and the region gets the bulk of its yearly snowfall from these types of storms. The county also occasionally receives Alberta clippers. Winters are often very cold with fluctuating conditions, temperatures often drop to below 0 °F (−18 °C) at night. Summers in the Albany can contain stretches of excessive heat and humidity, with temperatures above [tpl]convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] and dew points near 70. Severe thunderstorms are common but tornadoes are rare. Albany receives on average per year 69 sunny days, 111 partly cloudy days, and 185 cloudy days;[tpl]cite web | title = Cloudiness | url = http://www.met.utah.edu/jhorel/html/wx/climate/cldy.html | publisher = University of Utah, Department of Atmospheric Sciences | accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and an average, over the course of a year, of less than four hours of sunshine per day, with just over an average of 2.5 hours per day over the course of the winter.[tpl]cite web | title = Sunshine Hours Page | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | url = http://www.thewellers.com/weller43/sunshine.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090515033306/http://www.thewellers.com/weller43/sunshine.htm| archivedate= 15 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The chance during daylight hours of sunshine is 53%, with the highest percentage of sunny daylight hours being in July with 64%, and the lowest month is November with 37%.

==Culture and contemporary life==

Albany is often derided as "Smallbany" (also spelled Smalbany) for its perceived lack of culture and as a backwater in tourism circles,[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JwvE1F2zyXoC&pg=PA184&dq=smallbany#PPA184,M1 | title = USA | page = 184 | publisher = Lonely Planet | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | author = Jeff Campbell | isbn = 978-1-74104-675-5[/tpl] even though it consistently ranks high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd in the book Cities Ranked & Rated.[tpl]cite web | title = America's Top Cities for Culture | url = http://www.move.com/new-homes/real-estate-news/the-top-10-cultural-cities.aspx | publisher = Move, Inc. | accessdate = 2009-06-04[/tpl] To locals the Smallbany title references the perceived notion that all residents are interconnected and know each other in some way.

==Transportation==

Albany County has long been at the forefront of transportation technology from the days of turnpikes and plank roads to the Erie Canal, from the first passenger railroad in the state to the oldest municipal airport in the United States. Today, Interstates, Amtrak, and the Albany International Airport continue to make the Albany County a major crossroads of the Northeastern United States.
The Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC) is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Every metropolitan area in the United States with a population of over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation funding. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) uses an MPO to make decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate versus long term funding. The USDOT will not approve federal funds for transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list.[tpl]cite web | title = Capital District Transportation Committee | publisher = Capital District Transportation Committee | accessdate = 2009-04-23 | url = http://www.cdtcmpo.org/whatcdtc.htm[/tpl]

===Interstate and other major highways===

Albany County is situated at a major crossroads of the Northeastern United States. Even before the Interstate Highway System and the US Highway system, Albany County was the hub of many turnpikes and plank roads that connected the region. Today, it is in Albany County that Interstate 87 and Interstate 90 meet. The Thomas E. Dewey New York State Thruway is a toll-road that from Exit 24 in the city of Albany is I-87 and travels south to connect the county with downstate New York. West from Exit 24 the Thruway is I-90 and connects the county with Schenectady, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo. North of Exit 24, I-87 is the Adirondack Northway and connects the city and county of Albany with their suburbs in Saratoga County and provides long-distance travel to Montreal. East of Exit 24, I-90 travels along the northern boundary of the city of Albany and exits the county on the Patroon Island Bridge into Rensselaer County to access Albany's eastern suburbs. Interstate 787 connects the Thruway (I-87) to Downtown Albany, Menands, Watervliet, and Cohoes. US Route 9 enters the county on the Dunn Memorial Bridge and travels through the city of Albany north connecting it with the suburbs in the Colonie and Saratoga County. US Route 20 also enters the county on the Dunn Memorial Bridge and then travels west through Albany (city) and then the town of Guilderland. New York State Route 5 and New York State Route 7 are two important highways that bisect the county and serve as important shopping strips.
