William Alton "Billy" Carter III (March 29, 1937 – September 25, 1988) was an American businessman who promoted Billy Beer, was a candidate for Mayor of Plains, Georgia, and was the younger brother of former Georgia Governor and United States President, Jimmy Carter.

==Early years==

Born in Plains, Georgia, Carter attended Emory University in Atlanta but did not complete a degree. He served four years in the United States Marine Corps, then returned to Plains to work with his brother in the family business of growing peanuts. In 1955, he married Sybil Spires (born 1938), also of Plains, Georgia. They were the parents of six children: Kim, Jana, William "Buddy", Marle, Mandy and Earl, who was 12 years old when his father died.

==1970s and later==

In 1972, Billy Carter purchased a gas and service station in Plains. He owned and operated it for most of the decade.http://www.plainsgeorgia.com/billys_station.html
Carter ran for mayor of Plains in 1976, but lost the election. It was his only attempt to win elective office.
In 1977, he endorsed Billy Beer, capitalizing upon his colorful image as a beer-drinking Southern good ol' boy that developed in the press when his brother ran for President. Carter's name was occasionally used as a gag answer for a Washington, D.C., trouble-maker on 1970s episodes of The Match Game. He was known for his outlandish public behavior; he once urinated on an airport runway in full view of the press and dignitaries.Billy Carter Curbs Tongue, Spokane Daily Chronicle, January 15, 1979
After the failure of Billy Beer, Carter was forced to sell his house to settle back taxes owed to the IRS.

==Libya==

In late 1978 and early 1979, Billy Carter visited Libya three times  with a contingent from Georgia.  He eventually registered as a foreign agent of the Libyan government and received a $220,000 loan. (Edwin P. Wilson claimed he had seen a telegram showing that Libya paid Billy Carter $2 million.Joseph J. Trento, Prelude to Terror: Edwin P. Wilson and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network (Carroll and Graf, 2005), 162.) This led to a Senate hearing on alleged influence peddling which the press named Billygate.[tpl]cite news|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=Billygate – 1980|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/billy.htm|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=July 21, 1998[/tpl]  A Senate sub-committee was called To Investigate Activities of Individuals Representing Interests of Foreign Governments (Billy Carter-Libya Investigation). On August 4, 1980, President Jimmy Carter wrote: "I am deeply concerned that Billy has received funds from Libya and that he may be under obligation to Libya. These facts will govern my relationship with Billy as long as I am president. Billy has had no influence on U.S. policy or actions concerning Libya in the past, and he will have no influence in the future."Trento, Prelude to Terror, 164.  Trento asserts that Libya's involvement with Billy Carter was instigated by Israeli intelligence in order "to compromise the president," who had ended Israel's "special status inside the CIA."  Ibid., 160, 157.
A 1985 Wall Street Journal investigation suggested that a series of Billygate articles written by Michael Ledeen and published in The New Republic in October 1980 were part of a disinformation campaign intended to influence the outcome of that year's presidential election. According to the reporting, Francesco Pazienza, an officer of the Italian intelligence agency SISMI, alleged that Ledeen was paid $120,000 for his work on Billygate and other projects. Pazienza was later tried and convicted in absentia for using "extortion and fraud to obtain embarrassing facts about Billy Carter".[tpl]cite journal|last=Unger|first=Craig|title=The War They Wanted, the Lies They Needed|journal=Vanity Fair|date=July 2006|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/07/yellowcake200607|accessdate=5 August 2013|quote=A 1985 investigation by Jonathan Kwitny in The Wall Street Journal reported that the New Republic article was part of a larger disinformation scam run by Ledeen and SISMI to tilt the election, and that “Billy Carter wasn’t the only one allegedly getting money from a foreign government.” According to Pazienza, Kwitny reported, Michael Ledeen had received at least $120,000 from SISMI in 1980 or 1981 for his work on Billygate and other projects. Ledeen even had a coded identity, Z-3, and had money sent to him in a Bermuda bank account, Pazienza said. Ledeen told the Journal that a consulting firm he owned, I.S.I., worked for SISMI and may have received the money. He said he did not recall whether he had a coded identity. Pazienza was subsequently convicted in absentia on multiple charges, including having used extortion and fraud to obtain embarrassing facts about Billy Carter. Ledeen was never charged with any crime, but he was cited in Pazienza’s indictment, which read, “With the illicit support of the SISMI and in collaboration with the well-known American ‘Italianist’ Michael Ledeen, Pazienza succeeded in extorting, also using fraudulent means, information … on the Libyan business of Billy Carter, the brother of the then President of the United States.”[/tpl]

==Death==

Carter was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the autumn of 1987, and received unsuccessful treatments for the disease. He died in Plains the following year at the age of 51. His death came just five years after the death of his sister Ruth Carter; like Billy, Ruth also died of pancreatic cancer when she was in her 50s.[tpl]cite news |first= ROBERT D.|last= HERSHEY Jr|title= Billy Carter Dies of Cancer at 51.
