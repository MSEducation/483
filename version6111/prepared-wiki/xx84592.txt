Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium is a 6,200-seat baseball park in Newark, New Jersey, USA, that hosted its first regular season baseball game on July 16, 1999, with former 1940's bear Yogi Berra throwing the ceremonial first pitch, as the tenants of the facility, the Newark Bears, took on the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds.  It was built as  the home of the Newark Bears baseball team, as well as to the college baseball teams of the Newark campus of Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.[tpl]Citation   | last = Cvornyek   | first = Robert   | title = Baseball in Newark    | publisher = Arcadia Publishing   | year = 2003    | url = http://books.google.nl/books?id=J0rdOAhfTZoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Baseball+in+Newark&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k7SsUuelFoez0QXXu4H4Dg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Baseball%20in%20Newark&f=false   | isbn =    | quote = [/tpl]

==History==

The Newark Bears had joined the Atlantic League at its founding in 1998 but played their 'home' games at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut during that first season, sharing the park with the Bridgeport Bluefish. Since construction of the stadium was still not finished in 1999, the Bears played their first 20 home games at Skylands Park in Augusta, New Jersey, sharing the facility with the New Jersey Cardinals.
The Bears have nicknamed the stadium "Brick City Bears" or "The Den" representing the home of a bear. 
Originally, the stadium was to be built along the Passaic River, perhaps at or near Riverbank Park, but the eventual site was at Broad and Orange Streets. The block of Orange Street, between Broad Street and McCarter Highway, was vacated to allow for the ballpark to be built.
In 2001, the Bears added "Bears & Eagles" to the name of the park, to reflect the heritage represented by both the International League's Bears, and the Negro National League Newark Eagles, both of whom had played at Ruppert Stadium (demolished in 1967) in the area now called the Ironbound.

==Transportation==

The stadium is across the street from a New Jersey Transit's Broad Street Station. Opened July 17, 2006, the Riverfront Stadium station on the Newark Light Rail provides service from Newark Penn Station.
