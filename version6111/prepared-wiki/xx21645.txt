A nickel–metal hydride battery, abbreviated NiMH or Ni–MH, is a type of rechargeable battery. Its chemical reactions are somewhat similar to the largely obsolete nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd). NiMH use positive electrodes of nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), like the NiCd, but the negative electrodes use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium, being in essence a practical application of nickel–hydrogen battery chemistry. A NiMH battery can have two to three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd, and their energy density approaches that of a lithium-ion cell.
The typical specific energy for small NiMH cells is about 100 W·h/kg, and for larger NiMH cells about 75 W·h/kg (270 kJ/kg). This is significantly better than the typical 40–60 W·h/kg for NiCd, and similar to the 100–160 W·h/kg for lithium-ion batteries. NiMH has a volumetric energy density of about 300 W·h/L (1,080 MJ/m3), significantly better than NiCd at 50–150 W·h/L, and about the same as lithium-ion at 250–360 W·h/L.
NiMH batteries have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries. NiMH batteries are very common for AA (penlight-size) batteries, which have nominal charge capacities (C) of 1.1–2.8 A·h at 1.2 V, measured at the rate that discharges the cell in five hours. Useful discharge capacity is a decreasing function of the discharge rate, but up to a rate of around 1×C (full discharge in one hour), it does not differ significantly from the nominal capacity.See graph, p.8 of [tpl]cite web | title = Ni–MH Batteries Technical Bulletin | url = http://208.173.184.182/oem/rechargeable/Nickel/nickel_metal_tech.asp | publisher = Duracell | accessdate = 4 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] NiMH batteries normally operate at 1.2 V per cell, somewhat lower than conventional 1.5 V cells, but will operate most devices designed for that voltage.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
About 22% of portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan in 2010 were NiMH.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.baj.or.jp/e/statistics/06.html | title = Secondary battery sales statistics by volume | publisher = Battery Association of Japan | accessdate = 10 September 2011[/tpl] In Switzerland in 2009, the equivalent statistic was approximately 60%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://inobat.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_09/Absatz_Statistik_2008.pdf | title=Batterien-Absatzstatistik 2008 | publisher = INOBAT (the Swiss interest organisation for battery disposal) | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | page=2 | language = German | trans_title = Battery Sales Statistics 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] This percentage has fallen over time due to the increase in manufacture of lithium-ion batteries: in 2000, almost half of all portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan were NiMH. By 2011, NiMH only represented about 22% of secondary batteries.
The significant disadvantage of NiMH batteries is the high rate of self-discharge; NiMH batteries typically lose 4% of their charge per day of storage. In 2005, a low self-discharge (LSD) variant was developed. LSD NiMH batteries significantly lower self-discharge, but at the cost of lowering capacity by about 20%.
