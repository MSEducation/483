===Notes===

A limited vinyl picture-disk edition of 500 was released by Stand Up! Records.  The edition was signed by Black before the manufacturing process was completed.  His signature is part of the vinyl art, under the grooves.
The CD version of the album features a hidden track including outtakes of Lewis yelling at hecklers and muffing a couple jokes. The track can be heard by playing the beginning of track one and then using the rewind/search button to go back 14:53.
