The Children's Food Festival is a food festival held every two years in Oxfordshire, organised by the Earth Trust. It is fronted by patrons Raymond Blanc and Sophie Grigson, who give hands-on demos, inviting children to help them chop, stir, smell and taste. Other guests have included Annabel Karmel, Jane Fearnley Whittingstall (author of The Good Granny Cookbook), Sam Stern (the Teenage Chef), Nora Sands (Jamie’s School Dinner Lady)and children’s cookery writer Amanda Grant.
The idea for a food festival for children came to Eka Morgan, the Festival's Director, in 2005. "Parents say that one of the best ways to encourage children to eat good food is to get them to cook it themselves. I thought that a festival which conveyed positive messages about food, with plenty of colour, humour and hands-on cooking, could go some way to transform young people’s approach to eating."
