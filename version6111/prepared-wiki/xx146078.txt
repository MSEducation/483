His father was an Orthodox Jew who moved to New York City from Evansville, Indiana, and eventually established a successful art framing shop on East Ninth Street in Manhattan. Friedman’s mother was born in eastern Europe. Friedman grew up as an aspiring artist and earned pocket money as a young man from the sale of his sketches.  He entered Brooklyn College in 1932 as an art major, but ended up with a degree in physics. He was influenced by his first physics professor, Dr. Bernhard Kurrelmeyer, who eventually helped him get a scholarship to Johns Hopkins.
His service to science included membership on the General Advisory Committee to the Atomic Energy Commission during Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, on President Nixon’s Science Advisory Committee, and on the Space Science and Governing boards of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Death==

Friedman died of cancer at his home in Arlington, Virginia, on 9 September 2000, at the age of eighty four.
