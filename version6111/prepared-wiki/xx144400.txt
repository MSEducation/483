==History==

The channel first launched on April 13, 1986 as Pirates Cable Network, exclusively serving the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, with the first sports event telecast being a Mike Lange-announced Pittsburgh Pirates 8-0 win over the Chicago Cubs from Three Rivers Stadium; it then went off the air until continuous broadcasting commenced on April 24, 1986 with its first regular broadcast being a Pirates game against the New York Mets from Three Rivers. At this point, the channel's name was changed to KBL in order to allow other sports to be included.Analysis: What happens if Armstrong takes over Penguins broadcast rights? Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 22, 1999  It was initially owned by TCI (now part of Comcast), then the Pittsburgh market's largest cable television provider. On May 9, 1986, KBL expanded close to its present day six-state broadcast area.
During TCI ownership, while KBL showed primarily sports-related programming, the station also served as a general entertainment channel, essentially filling the void left after independent station WPGH-TV (channel 53) became a charter affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company around the time KBL debuted. It aired children's programming for part of the day, including reruns of the John Candy series Camp Candy.
TCI sold the channel in 1994 to Prime Network, who immediately dropped all the non-sports related programming and made KBL an affiliate of Prime SportsChannel America when Prime and SportsChannel America merged. In 1995, Prime Network's retail subsidiary, Prime Sports Merchandising, purchased some sports apparel stores located inside shopping malls and rebranded them as Prime Sports Shops, promoting them on its networks including KBL.Liberty Sports acquires Fan Fair retail stores; subsidiary Prime Sports Merchandising, Inc. will capitalize on regional network resources The Free Library, August 7, 1995. In 1996, News Corporation bought out Prime SportsChannel and rebranded KBL to Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh, with the retail stores keeping the Prime Sports name for many years after the Fox Sports rebranding of the parent networks.
