Seawater or salt water is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately [tpl]convert|35|g|oz[/tpl] of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium ([tpl]chem|Na||+[/tpl]) and chloride ([tpl]chem|Cl||-[/tpl]) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 g/ml. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 g/ml @ [tpl]convert|4|C|F[/tpl]) because the dissolved salts add mass without contributing significantly to the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity it freezes at about [tpl]convert|-2|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |title= U.S. Office of Naval Research Ocean, Water: Temperature [/tpl] The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured [tpl]convert|-2.6|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web |author= Sylte, Gudrun Urd |title= Den aller kaldaste havstraumen |url= http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2010/mai/250690 |language= Norwegian |date= May 24, 2010 |work= forskning.no |accessdate= May 24, 2010[/tpl] Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4, and the speed of sound in seawater is, on average, roughly 1,500 meters per second.

==Geochemistry==

The thermal conductivity of seawater is 0.6 W/mK at 25 °C and a salinity of 35 g/kg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf |title=Desalination and Water Treatment |publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date = April 2010|accessdate=17 October 2010 [/tpl]
The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature.[tpl]cite web |url=http://twt.mpei.ac.ru/tthb/2/Tab-5-5-13-2-Ther-Cond-Seawater.html |title=Thermal conductivity of seawater and its concentrates |accessdate=17 October 2010 [/tpl]

===Salinity===

Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 3.1% and 3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths or near melting glaciers, seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and river inflow, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water (for example, the Dead Sea) can be considerably greater still.
The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg/m3, depending on the temperature and salinity. Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1,050 kg/m3 or higher. Seawater pH is limited to the range 7.5 and 8.4. The speed of sound in seawater is about 1,500 m/s, and varies with water temperature, salinity, and pressure.

==Human impacts==

Climate change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing acidity, reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in mercury and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity. Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades, with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources.[tpl]cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott C.|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science Magazine|date=June 18, 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1512.full|accessdate=16 December 2011[/tpl]

==Compositional differences from freshwater==

Seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater. However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water based on molarity, the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions also constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% of all seawater ions. Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes; sodium and chlorine have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly. The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate and calcium.C. Michael Hogan. 2010. Calcium. eds. A. Jorgensen, C. Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth.

==Microbial components==

Research in 1957 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the Pacific Ocean. Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, and the presence of inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline, but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields.[tpl]cite journal| url= http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf |title= Bacterial Populations in Sea Water as Determined by Different Methods of Enumeration | first1= Holger W. |last1= Jannasch |first2= Galen E. |last2= Jones | volume= 4 | number= 2 | journal= Limnology and Oceanography | publisher= Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography |pages= 128–139| accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi=10.4319/lo.1959.4.2.0128[/tpl] In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of DNA, enabled researchers taking part in the Census of Marine Life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20 000 species. Dr. Mitchell Sogin from the Marine Biological Laboratory feels that "the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million."[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060829081744.htm| work= ScienceDaily | title= Ocean Microbe Census Discovers Diverse World Of Rare Bacteria | date= 2 September 2006 | publisher= | accessdate= 13 May 2013[/tpl]
Bacteria are found at all depths in the water column, as well as in the sediments, some being aerobic, others anaerobic. Most are free-swimming, but some exist as symbionts within other organisms - examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria. Cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes, enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere.
Some bacteria interact with diatoms, and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. One anaerobic species, Thiomargarita namibiensis, plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulphide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast, and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the Benguela Current upwelling zone, eventually falling to the seafloor.
Bacteria-like Archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments, such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Vibrio spp. survive in a pH range of 7.3 to 10.6, while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 10.6.[tpl]cite journal| url= http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/2/m002p105.pdf |title= Alkalotolerant and Alkalophilic Bacteria in Seawater |first1= M. |last1= Maeda |first2= N. |last2= Taga | journal= Marine Ecology - Progress Series |volume= 2 | pages= 105–108 | date= 31 March 1980 | publisher=  | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi=10.3354/meps002105[/tpl] Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean's biomass, clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes.[tpl]cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5232928.stm | date= 31 July 2006 | title= Thousands of microbes in one gulp | first= Louisa |last= Cheung | publisher= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013[/tpl] In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down methane, an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming.[tpl]cite news| url= http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/10/05-01.html | title= The Case of the Missing Methane | first= Mitchell |last= Leslie |date= 5 October 2000| work= ScienceNOW | publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science | accessdate= 13 May 2013 [/tpl] Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor, influencing seawater chemistry. Oil spills, and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity, as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life. The protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or Red tides, often after human-caused pollution. The process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins, which move along the ocean food chain, tainting higher-order animal consumers.
Pandoravirus salinus, a species of very large virus, with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species, was discovered in 2013. Like the other very large viruses Mimivirus and Megavirus, Pandoravirus infects amoebas, but its genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of Megavirus, and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.
In 2013 researchers from Aberdeen University announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that has evolved in deep sea trenches, hoping to find "the next generation" of antibiotics, anticipating an "antibiotic apocalypse" with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs. The EU-funded research will start in the Atacama Trench and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21457149 |title= Antibiotics search to focus on sea bed | date= 14 February 2013 | publisher= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013[/tpl]
The ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material.[tpl]cite web| url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=nKkrAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PR1&dq=inauthor%3A%22National%20Research%20Council%20(U.S.).%20Panel%20on%20Radioactivity%20in%20the%20Marine%20Environment%22&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Radioactivity in the marine environment| work= National Academies, 1971 page 36 [/tpl]
While this may be true on a small scale, the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems, and rendered them life-threatening. Pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters, such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae the cause of cholera,  hepatitis A, hepatitis E and polio, along with protozoans causing giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis. These pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels, and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Microbes-in-the-Ocean.html |title= Microbes in the Ocean |first1= Brian D. |last1= Hoyle | first2= Richard |last2= Robinson | work= Water Encyclopedia [/tpl]
