[[File:Medea-fragment-4th-5th-CE.gif|thumb|right|Fragment of a vellum codex from the 4th-5th centuries AD, showing choral anapaests from Medea, lines 1087-91. Tiny though it is, the fragment influences modern editions of the play.[ref]
After this creation of a standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, apart from the slight and gradual corruption produced by the tedium of frequent copying. Many of these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in script from uncial to minuscule, and many were 'homophonic' errors, when scribes accidentally substituted homophones for words in the text[tpl]emdash[/tpl]equivalent in English to substituting 'right' for 'write', except that there were more opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make these errors because the Greek letters η, ι, οι and ει were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine period.
Around 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophocles[tpl]emdash[/tpl]the only plays of theirs that survive today: "The rise of Goths and Tartars throughout the Roman world from the gutter to the throne, the destruction of libraries by choleric and fanatical popes and emperors, were unfavourable to the progress but not entirely fatal to the preservation of literary studies."Denys L. Page, Euripides: Medea, Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction page xlii Euripides however was more fortunate than the other tragedians in the survival of a second edition of his work, compiled in alphabetical order as if from a set of his collect works, but without scholia attached. This 'Alphabetical' edition was combined with the 'Select' edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The 'Select' plays are found in many medieval manuscripts but only two manuscripts preserve the 'Alphabetical' plays[tpl]emdash[/tpl]often denoted L and P, after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing The Trojan Women and latter part of The Bacchae.
In addition to L, P and many other medieval manuscripts, there are also fragments of plays recorded on papyrus. The papyrus fragments are often recovered only through modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at Oxford University worked on a joint project with Brigham Young University, using multi-spectral imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References). Some of this work employed infrared technology—previously used for satellite imaging—to detect previously unknown material by Euripides in fragments of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/news/independent.html |title=POxy Oxyrhynchus Online |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |date=17 April 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Papyrology Websites |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=30 August 2013[/tpl]
It is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost. Thus for example two extant plays, The Phoenicean Women and Iphigenia at Aulis, are significantly corrupted by interpolationsJustina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in A Companion to Greek Tragedy, Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), page 259 (the latter possibly being completed post mortem by the poet's son) and the very authorship of Rhesus is a matter of dispute.William Ritchie, The Authenticity of the Rhesus of Euripides, Cambridge University Press (1964) In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualities[tpl]emdash[/tpl]most of his least 'tragic' plays are in the Alphabet edition and possibly the other two tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this "restless experimenter" if we possessed more than their 'select' editions.Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in A Companion to Greek Tragedy, Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), page 254

===Chronology===

The original production dates of some of Euripides's plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the Dionysia, and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as Aristophanes, the known dates of whose own plays thus serve as a terminus ad quem for those of Euripides, though sometimes the gap can be considerable (e.g. twenty-seven years separate Telephus, known to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in Thesmophoriazusae in 411 BC.) References in Euripides's plays to contemporary events provide a terminus a quo, though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074-89 in Ion describe a procession to Eleusis, which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the Peloponnesian War).A.S.Owen, Euripides: Ion, Bristol Classical Press, Introduction pages xl-xli Other indications of dating are obtained by stylometry and this section therefore is an appropriate place to consider some aspects of his style as a Greek poet.
Greek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in iambic trimeter (three pairs of iambic feet per line). Euripides sometimes 'resolved' the two syllables of the iamb (˘¯) into three syllables (˘˘˘) and this tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a play can be understood to indicate the approximate date of composition (see Extant plays below for one scholar's list of resolutions per hundred trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing vocabulary for tragic dialogue, often involving prefixes to refine meanings, allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm while also becoming ever more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety.B. Knox,'Euripides' in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 337
The trochaic tetrameter catalectic[tpl]emdash[/tpl]four pairs of trochees per line, with the final syllable omitted[tpl]emdash[/tpl]was identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (Poetics 1449a21). Euripides however employs it here and there in his later plays.Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in A Companion to Greek Tragedy, Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), page 257 He seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, The Trojan Women being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play - it is symptomatic of a curious archaizing tendency evident in his later works.M. Platnauer, Iphigenia in Tauris, Oxford University Press (1938), Introduction page 14E.R.Dodds, Euripides: Bacchae, Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction pages xxxvi
The later plays also feature extensive use of stichomythia (i.e. a series of one-liners).John Gould, 'Tragedy in performance' in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 281 The longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in Ion (lines 264-369). In contrast, Aeschylus never exceeded twenty lines of stichomythia; Sophocles's longest such scene was fifty lines and it is interrupted several times by αντιλαβή (Electra, lines 1176-1226).A.S. Owen, Euripides: Ion, Bristol Classical Press (1990), Introduction page 91
Euripides's use of lyrics in the sung portion of his work shows the influence of Timotheus of Miletus in the later plays[tpl]emdash[/tpl] the individual singer gained prominence and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets between actors, as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes begin to take on something of the form of dithyrambs reminiscent of the poetry of Bacchylides, featuring elaborate treatment of myths.Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in A Companion to Greek Tragedy, Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), page 258 Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The Bacchae however shows a reversion to old forms,B. Knox,'Euripides' in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 338 possibly as a deliberate archaic effect or maybe because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia, where it is said to have been written.Moses Hadas, Ten Plays by Euripides, Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, page xvi

===Lost and fragmentary plays===

The following plays have come down to us today only in fragmentary form, if at all. They are known through quotations in other works, sometimes as little as a single line, or through pieces of papyrus or partial copies in manuscript form; some are known thanks to the survival of part of a collection of hypotheses (or summaries) in papyrus, and others through being parodied in the works of Aristophanes. Some of the fragments are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.
A two-volume selection from the fragments, with facing-page translation, introductions, and notes, was published by Collard, Cropp, Lee, and Gibert,[tpl]cite book|last=Euripides|title=Selected Fragmentary Plays: Volume I|year=1995|editor1-last=Collard|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Cropp|editor2-first=M.J.|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=K.H.|publisher=Aris & Phillips|isbn=0-85668-619-0[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Euripides|title=Selected Fragmentary Plays: Volume II|year=2005|editor1-last=Collard|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Cropp|editor2-first=M.J.|editor3-last=Gibert|editor3-first=J.|publisher=Aris & Phillips|isbn=0-85668-621-2[/tpl] as were two Loeb Classical Library volumes derived from them,[tpl]cite book|last=Euripides|title=Fragments: Aegeus-Meleager (Loeb Classical Library No. 504)|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-99625-9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Euripides|title=Oedipus-Chrysippus & Other Fragments|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-99631-3[/tpl] and there are critical studies in T.
