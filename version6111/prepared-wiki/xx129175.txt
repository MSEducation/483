Vasilis Konstantinou ([tpl]lang-el|Βασίλης Κωνσταντίνου[/tpl]; born 19 November 1947) was a Greek football goalkeeper whose career spanned three decades: the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

==Career==

Born in Marousi, Konstantinou played football for Panathinaikos' youth team before becoming Takis Oikonomopoulos' backup and understudy. He filled in successfully for his "mentor" when the situation called for it as was the case in the 1971 Champions' Cup semi-final against Crvena Zvezda (3-0) which sent PAO to the final. Eventually, Konstantinou became the first team's keeper, a position he held until the 1983 season. He ended his career in 1984, playing for OFI.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Evrytania News|author=Kolokotsios, Lambros|title=Αθλητικοί Φάκελοι (ΚΩΝΣΤΑΝΤΙΝΟΥ)|trans_title=Sporting Capsules (Konstantinou)|url=http://www.evrytanika.com/article.php?id=3158|language=Greek|date=9 January 2010[/tpl]
