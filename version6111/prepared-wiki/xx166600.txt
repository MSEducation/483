[[Waffen-SS divisions]]

CATEGORIES: Waffen-SS divisions

All divisions in the Waffen-SS were ordered in a single series as formed, regardless of type. Those tagged with nationalities were at least nominally recruited from those nationalities. Many of the higher-numbered units were small battlegroups (Kampfgruppen), i.e., divisions in name only. 
As a general rule, an "SS Division" is made up of Germans, or other Germanic peoples, while a "Division of the SS" is made up of non-Germanic volunteers.
