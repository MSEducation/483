==History==

Barbour County was established on December 18, 1832, from former Creek Indian homelands  and a portion of Pike County. The Creek were removed to territory west of the Mississippi River. The fertile land was developed by southern migrants as large cotton plantations dependent on slave labor. Its boundaries were altered in 1866 and 1868.Alabama Counties: Barbour The Election Riot of 1874 occurred near Comer.
In 1833, Louisville was chosen as the first county seat for Barbour County. The county seat was moved in 1834, after an eleven-member committee selected Clayton because of its central geographic location.  By the 1870s, Eufaula had surpassed Clayton in size, sparking debate about whether the county seat should be moved to the county's commercial center or remain at its geographic center. Reaching a compromise, the legislature passed Act No. 106 on February 12, 1879, to establish courts in both Eufaula and Clayton. Today, two count courthouses operate in Barbour County.
