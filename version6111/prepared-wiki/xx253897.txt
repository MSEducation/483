Pebble-mound mice are a group of rodents from Australia in the genus Pseudomys. They are small, brownish mice with medium to long, often pinkish brown tails. They construct mounds of pebbles around their burrows, which play an important role in their social life.
There are four complementarily distributed species of pebble-mound mice in northern Australia. Their distribution appears to be limited by climatic conditions and the availability of pebbles and is thought to be the result of early Pleistocene dispersal across areas that are now inhospitable to pebble-mound mice. None of the four species is endangered.

==Taxonomy==

Pebble-mound mice also known as field mice comprise four species, which have complementary distributions across northern Australia.Breed and Ford, 2007, p. 27 The four species are as follows:
Pebble-mound mice are currently classified within the genus Pseudomys, a diverse group that includes morphologically and behaviorally disparate species.Ford, 2006, pp. 119, 121 The four pebble-mound mice form a cohesive group supported by behavioral, morphological, and molecular similarities and may deserve recognition as a separate genus.Breed and Ford, 2007, p. 16; Ford, 2006, p. 131

==Description==

Pebble-mound mice are small, mouse-like animals, about [tpl]convert|12|to|15|g[/tpl] in mass. The upperparts are brownish, from grey-brown in some Kakadu pebble-mound mice to yellow-brown in the eastern pebble-mound mouse. The underparts are white and are sharply demarcated from the upperparts except in the eastern pebble-mound mouse. The tail ranges from about as long as the head and body in the Kakadu pebble-mound mouse to much longer in the western pebble-mound mouse. It is brown or grey above and white below in the central pebble-mound mouse and uniformly pinkish brown in the other species.Menkhorst and Knight, 2001, pp. 186, 188, 190, 194
