Club wrote "Getting On captures the drudgery of work and life in this ward, but it also catches glimpses of the beauty, and it’s in those moments that it feels like a series that deserves better than it’s going to get."[tpl]cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title=Getting On finds the beauty in pain and death—when it lets itself|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/getting-on-finds-the-beauty-in-pain-and-deathwhen-105908|publisher=Onion Inc|accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] On the more negative side, Mike Lechevallier of Slant Magazine writes "the show's setting is such an overwhelmingly depressing environment that much of the offbeat humor ends up flatlining."[tpl]cite web|last=Lechevallier|first=Mike|title=Getting On: Season 1[tpl]![/tpl]TV Review|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/getting-on-season-one|accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl]
