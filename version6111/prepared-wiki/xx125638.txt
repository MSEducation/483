==Career==

===Dundee United===

Livingston-born Robertson joined Dundee United as a youth player and was the top scorer in the 2004–05 SPL Youth League, despite playing from midfield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=17&ID=243|title=David Robertson|publisher=Dundee United FC website[/tpl] Robertson made his debut for United in January 2006, in the 1–1 draw against Aberdeen, when he came off the bench in the last few minutes to replace player/manager Craig Brewster who was injured while making his second debut. Robertson scored his first goal three months later in 3–1 league defeat to Livingston, and his late extra-time winner sent United through to the Scottish League Cup third round at the start of the following season. Further league goals came against Inverness Caledonian Thistle (twice) and Celtic, with a cup strike against St. Mirren ensuring that Robertson's goals in 2006–07 saw him never finish on the losing side. Indeed, Robertson's form saw him sign a new two-year contract during February of that season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/6361977.stm|title=Young stars extend United deals|date=14 February 2007|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
