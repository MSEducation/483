Christopher Edward Rudd is a Canadian-born immunologist-biochemist. He is currently Professor of Molecular Immunolology at the University of Cambridge, as well as the Head of the Cell Signalling Section.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/cer51@cam.ac.uk|title=Professor Christopher Rudd|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=11 January 2014[/tpl]

==Early life and education==

Rudd was born in Toronto, Canada. He was educated at the Jesuit-run Brebeuf College School and at McGill University in Montreal.  He received PhD and DSc degrees from University College, London. He held faculty positions at Harvard Medical School and Imperial College London before moving to Cambridge University.

==Research==

Rudd is credited with having had a major impact on the understanding of the intracellular signals that control T-cell immunity.  Rudd was the first to discover that intracellular protein kinases interact with surface receptors, by identifying the interaction of T-cell co-receptors CD4 (also the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1) and CD8 on T-cells with protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck.  His discovery provided a role for members of the proto-oncogene pp60src kinase family in normal cell signaling.  Other receptors were later found to use src-related kinases to regulate cell growth.  In terms of immunology, the CD4- and CD8-p56lck complexes are now widely accepted as the initiators of the T-cell activation, leading to the recruitment of a second tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 that control the ability of T-cells to respond to foreign pathogens, allogeneic transplants and cancer cells.  
In a second area, Rudd elucidated signaling mechanisms by which co-receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 modulate T-cell responses.  By showing that CTLA-4 activates T-cell motility and migration, he has proposed the 'reverse-stop signal model' to account for CTLA-4 down regulation of the responses of conventional T-cells to antigen.  His research has also shown that a mutant form of an adapter protein termed ADAP can block the infection of T-cells by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) by simultaneously interfering with HIV-1 replication and the transmission of the virus between T-cells. 

==Recognition==

He has received awards including the Cancer Research Institute/Benjamin Jacobson Family Investigator Award (New York), Claudia Adams Barr Research Award (Boston) and was a Scholar of the Leukemia Society of America and a Principal Research Fellow (PRF) of the Wellcome Trust.
