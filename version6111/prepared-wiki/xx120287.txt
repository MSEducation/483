Bedminster railway station is on the Bristol to Exeter Line and serves the districts of Bedminster and Windmill Hill in Bristol, England. It is [tpl]convert|0.9|mi|km[/tpl] to the west of [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl], and [tpl]convert|119|mi|km|0[/tpl] from London Paddington. Its three letter station code is BMT. It was opened in 1871 by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, was resited slightly further to the west in 1884 and was rebuilt in 1932. The station, which has three through-lines and two island platforms, but minimal facilities, was managed by First Great Western in 2012, the seventh company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly an hourly service between [tpl]rws|Bristol Parkway[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Weston-super-Mare[/tpl].
There is local support for the line to be electrified, as an extension of the planned electrification of the London to Bristol route, and the level of service would be improved if proposals for the reinstatement of a passenger service on the nearby Portishead Branch Line, which was reopened for freight in 2001, are successful.

==Description==

The station is built on the lower northern slopes of Windmill Hill, on the Bristol to Exeter Line [tpl]convert|119|mi|22|chain|km|2[/tpl] from London Paddington and [tpl]convert|71|chain|km|2[/tpl] from [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/ELRs/_mileages/M/MLN1.txt|title=Engineers' Line References: MLN1 Paddington to North Road Junction|accessdate=5 May 2012|author=Deaves, Phil[/tpl] It the first station along the line from Bristol.[tpl]cite book|first=S.K.|last=Baker|title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland|edition=12|year=2010|isbn=978-0-86093-632-9|publisher=Ian Allan[/tpl] To the south of the station is a primarily residential area, with terraced houses and several tower blocks; while to the north is an industrial estate and shopping area.[tpl]cite book |title=OS Landranger Map 172 – Bristol & Bath |year=2008 |publisher=Ordnance Survey |location=Southampton |isbn=978-0-319-22914-9[/tpl] The railway line serves as the boundary between the Southville and Windmill Hill council wards, although the area is generally considered part of Bedminster, it is not part of the Bedminster council ward.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.bristol.gov.uk/WardFinder/pdfs/windmill-hillmap-high.pdf|title=Windmill Hill Polling Districts|publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.bristol.gov.uk/WardFinder/pdfs/southvillemap-high.pdf|title=Southville Polling Districts|publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl] The area is also served by Parson Street railway station, [tpl]convert|74|chain|km|2[/tpl] further along the line.
The station has two island platforms, each [tpl]convert|240|yd|m[/tpl] long, but only the first [tpl]convert|100|-|110|yd|m|-1[/tpl] are in use, the rest fenced off. Platform 1 is on the north side of the southern island, on the "Down Main" line serving westbound trains, the other side of the island is not in use, having been converted to a carriage siding. Platforms 2 and 3 are on the northern island. Platform 3, on the north side "Up Relief" line, is used exclusively for eastbound trains. Platform 2, on the south side "Up Main" line, is used mostly for eastbound trains, but can be used for westbound services, as the line is signalled for bidirectional running. There is a carriage siding on the south side of the southern island, coming from the east and terminating within the station limits. The speed limit through the station is [tpl]convert|90|mph|kph[/tpl] on the Down Main and eastbound on the Up Main. The Up Relief and westbound Up Main have a speed limit of [tpl]convert|40|mph|kph[/tpl], the siding has a speed limit of [tpl]convert|25|mph|kph[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |title=Railway Track Diagrams 3: Western |edition=5th |date=August 2010 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=978-0-9549866-6-7 |at=map 5B |ref=harv [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/baseline%20capability/track%20and%20route%20mileage,%20permissible%20line%20speeds/table%20a_track_and_route%20miles_linespeed_western%20route.pdf|title=Network Capability - Baseline Declaration: (1) Track and Route mileage: (2) Line-speeds: Western Route|publisher=Network Rail|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=11 October 2013|page=53[/tpl] The line is not electrified.
Access between the platforms is via a subway with ramps at the west end of the platforms, although the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12. The subway exits onto Fraser Street, which is the sole entrance to the station.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/bmt.html |title=Bedminster (BMT) |publisher=National Rail |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] The subway is decorated with murals painted by local schoolchildren, reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.[tpl]cite book|title=Bristol Railway Stations 1840–2005|publisher=Redcliffe Press|author=Oakley, Mike|year=2006|isbn=1-904537-54-5[/tpl]
Facilities at the station are minimal - there is a metal and glass shelter on each of the two islands, and a bench on the eastbound island. The station is completely unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, and the nearest bus stop is [tpl]convert|200|yd|m[/tpl] away on Malago Road. There is some cycle storage available.

==Services==

The station is managed by First Great Western, who also operate all rail services from the station. As of the December 2013 timetable, the basic service from Monday to Friday consists of one train in each direction per hour between [tpl]rws|Bristol Parkway[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Weston-super-Mare[/tpl], calling at all stations. Some trains working between Cardiff and [tpl]rws|Taunton[/tpl] or [tpl]rws|Exeter St Davids[/tpl] call at peak hours and in the evening. All weekday trains at Bedminster also stop at [tpl]rws|Parson Street[/tpl] westbound and Bristol Temple Meads eastbound. On Saturday there is a similar pattern, but with no services beyond Bristol Parkway or Weston-super-Mare except during the early morning and late evening. Sunday sees a reduced service, with no trains eastbound until afternoon, and no trains westbound until 3pm. After that there is approximately one train every two hours, most of which do not call at Parson Street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/~/media/PDF/TicketsAndTrainTimes/TrainTimes/December%202013%20Timetables/TTC04_Web.ashx|title=Central 4: Guide to train times 8 December 2013 to 17 May 2014 - Cardiff and Bristol to Weston-super-Mare and Taunton|date=November 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|publisher=First Great Western[/tpl]
Services are formed by a mix of [tpl]brc|150[/tpl], [tpl]brc|153|n[/tpl] and [tpl]brc|158|n[/tpl] diesel multiple-unit trains. Until 2012, [tpl]brc|143[/tpl] Pacer units were a regular sight, but these have mostly been moved south to work in Devon and Cornwall following a cascade of Class 150/1 units from London Midland and London Overground.[tpl]cite news |title=LOROL Class 150s all with FGW |author=Miles, Tony |work=Modern Railways |location =London |date= December 2010 |page=90[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Salveson, Paul | editor = Abell, Paul | date = June 2012 | title = Severn Beach: Not your typical branch line! | journal = Today's Railways | issue =126 | pages =42–47 | location =Sheffield | publisher =Platform 5 [/tpl] CrossCountry services between Scotland and the South West pass non-stop throughout the day,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/SiteImages/Assets/3/Scotland_the_North_East_to_the_South_West_and_South_Coast_V2.pdf |title=Timetable: Scotland, the North East to the South West and South Coast; 11 December 2011 to 13 May 2012 |publisher=CrossCountry|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] with First Great Western services between London Paddington and Weston-super-Mare passing through during the morning and evening peaks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/~/media/PDF/TicketsAndTrainTimes/TrainTimes/December%202013%20Timetables/TTC01_Web.ashx|title=Central 1: Guide to train times 8 December 2013 to 17 May 2014 - London to Bristol, Cheltenham Spa and South Wales|date=November 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|publisher=First Great Western[/tpl]

==History==

The first section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway's main line opened on 14 June 1841 between Bristol and [tpl]rws|Bridgwater[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway, vol. II: 1863–1921 |year=1931 |publisher=Great Western Railway |location=Paddington |oclc=55853736 |pages=133–4, 617 |ref=harv [/tpl] The station at Bedminster, originally known as Ashton, opened in 1871,[tpl]Butt-Stations| page=20,31[/tpl] on the site of an earlier excursion platform which had closed in about 1870. Sited approximately [tpl]convert|57|chain|km[/tpl] from the Bristol & Exeter's northern terminus at [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|119|mi|08|chain|km[/tpl] from the Great Western Railway's London terminus at Paddington, there were two tracks, both originally [tpl]RailGauge|7ft[/tpl] broad-gauge, but the line was reconstructed as a mixed gauge line to accommodate local [tpl]RailGauge|ussg[/tpl]-gauge traffic by 1 June 1875. On 1 January 1876, the Bristol and Exeter was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR), who took over services. The station had been renamed Bedminster by 1884, when on 27 May the original station closed and a new station was opened some [tpl]convert|14|chain|m[/tpl] west. There were two separate platforms, one on each side of the two tracks. Broad-gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892, and in 1908 the new station was extended, with the addition of ornate station buildings and a footbridge at the west end of the platforms. Until the opening of [tpl]rws|Parson Street[/tpl] in 1927, Bedminster had served as the first station for trains heading for the Portishead Branch Line, which served the town of Portishead, the villages of Pill and Portbury, and the south side of the River Avon.[tpl]cite book |title=Lost Railways of Somerset |author=Yorke, Stan |year=2007 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury, Berkshire |isbn=978-1-84674-057-2 |pages=113–122[/tpl]
The station was rebuilt in 1932, opening on 30 April. The ornate buildings were demolished to enable the line to be four-tracked, and were replaced by more austere buildings on two island platforms between the tracks, including two waiting rooms, ticket and parcel offices. The new station was accessed, as now, by a subway from Fraser Street. The station employed 15 men in 1938. There was a 74 lever signal box to the east of the northern platform, and also a small siding to serve local coal merchants.
When the railways were nationalised in 1948, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways. Goods traffic at Bedminster ceased from 1 June 1964, traffic to Portishead ended with the closure of that line in September the same year, and the station became unstaffed from September 1968. The signal box was taken out of service in April 1970, and by 1979 all the station buildings had been demolished.
British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Bedminster passed to Regional Railways. Local services were franchised to Wales and West when the railway was privatised in 1997,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/11/99/track_record/regions/west_southwest.stm|title=Track record: West and South-West|publisher=BBC|date=November 1999|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=Frith, Malcolm[/tpl] which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.walesandwest.co.uk/|title=Wales and West|publisher=Wales and West|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl] The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of First Group.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theironroad.net/Operator/Train-Operating-Companies/Wessex-Trains/|title=Wessex Trains |work=The Iron Road: Railway Photography by Scott Borthwick|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4523592.stm|title=FirstGroup wins rail franchises|date=13 December 2005|accessdate=27 April 2012|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13351368|title=First Great Western bids for longer rail franchise deal|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]
In 2010, the Severnside Community Rail Partnership began a comprehensive scheme to improve the station. The work included removing foliage from the platforms, new lighting and artwork for the subway, community display panels and the installation of help points.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.severnside-rail.org.uk/data/downloads/progress%20report%202011.pdf|title=Progress Report January 2011|publisher=Severnside Community Rail Partnership|date=January 2011|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] The subway artwork came third in the arts category at the 2011 Community Rail Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.severnside-rail.org.uk/data/downloads/progress%20report%202012.pdf|title=Progress Report January 2012|publisher=Severnside Community Rail Partnership|date=January 2012|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl]

==Future==

First Great Western declined an option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise, of which services at Bedminster are a part, beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13351368|title=First Great Western bids for longer rail franchise deal|work=BBC News|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2012|publisher=BBC[/tpl] The franchise was put out to tender,[tpl]cite journal|title=First leads a field of seven bidding for rail franchises|author=Haigh, Philip|journal=RAIL magazine|publisher=Bauer Media|date=18 April 2012|pages=8–9|issue=694|location=Peterborough[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2012/07/19-great-western-franchise-to-be.html|title=Great Western franchise to be extended|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012|work=Railnews[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=New Great Western franchise to deliver new express trains |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120727a/ |publisher=Department for Transport |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012[/tpl] but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21272542|title=Great Western London to south Wales rail contest scrapped|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=31 January 2013|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl] A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, following negotiations between First Great Western and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin MP.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2013/10/03-first-celebrates-lastminute-great-western.html|title=First celebrates last-minute Great Western deal|work=Railnews|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24378053|title=First Great Western retains Wales and west rail franchise|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

The Invitation to Tender for the new Greater Western franchise asked bidders to include costs for two trains per hour each direction between Portishead and Bristol Temple Meads, calling at all stations, with one train per hour extended to [tpl]rws|Severn Beach[/tpl]. These services were initially due to operate from the December 2017 timetable change, running 18 hours a day Monday-Saturday and 9 hours a day on Sundays.[tpl]cite journal|journal=RAIL|author=Haigh, Philip|date=8 August 2012|title=Great Western priced options|pages=p9|volume=702[/tpl] However the date was pushed back to December 2018 due to planning requirements for the rest of the Bristol Metro. It is expected the scheme will cost up to £55 million.

==Incidents==

There have been several railway incidents in the Bedminster area over the years. On 1 May 2001, a [tpl]brc|153[/tpl] unit passed a red signal near Bedminster, but was stopped before it could head on to the Main line from the Relief line in front of a High Speed Train.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiffandavonside.org.uk/Magazines/Old_Magazines/2001/0107mag.htm|title=July 2001|publisher=Cardiff & Avonside Railway Society|date=July 2001|accessdate=6 May 2012|quote=01/05 ...

What used to be the westbound relief line at Bedminster was converted into a carriage siding, and is used to stable trains to avoid clogging the platforms at [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl].
