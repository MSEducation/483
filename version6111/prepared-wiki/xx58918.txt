Melbourne Airport [tpl]airport codes|MEL|YMML[/tpl], also known as Tullamarine Airport, is the primary airport serving the city of Melbourne, and the second busiest airport in Australia. It was opened in 1970 to replace the nearby Essendon Airport. Melbourne Airport is the sole international airport of the four airports serving the Melbourne metropolitan area.
The airport is [tpl]convert|23|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the city centre. The airport has its own postcode—Melbourne Airport, Victoria (postcode 3045).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auspostcode.com/postcode/3045 |title=Suburbs in postcode 3045 – Australia Post Codes |publisher=Auspostcode.com |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] This is adjacent to the suburb of Tullamarine.
The Melbourne–Sydney air route is the third most-travelled passenger air route in the world and the third busiest in the  Asia Pacific region. The airport features direct flights to 33 destinations in all states and territories of Australia in addition to numerous destinations in Oceania, Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. Melbourne is the most common destination for the airports of five of Australia's seven other capital cities.[tpl]ref|destinationexplanation|N1[/tpl] Melbourne serves as a major hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia, while Jetstar Airways and Tiger Airways Australia utilise the airport as home base. Melbourne is the busiest airport for international export freight as of August 2011, while second busiest for import freight. Domestically, Melbourne serves as headquarters for Australian air Express and Toll Priority and handles more domestic freight than any other airport in the nation.
In 2003, Melbourne received the International Air Transport Association Eagle Award for service and two National Tourism Awards for tourism services. The airport comprises four terminals: one international terminal, two domestic terminals and one budget domestic terminal. Most recently Melbourne Airport was awarded by Skytrax for having the best Airport hotel in the Australia/Pacific in the World Airport Awards. Melbourne Airport was also ranked the 43rd best airport for 2012. Melbourne reached 30 million passengers for the first time in the 12 months ending July 2013.http://melbourneairport.com.au/About-Melbourne-Airport/Media/Media-releases/melbourne-airports-july-passenger-traffic-results.html

==History==

===Establishment===

Before the opening of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially designated an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.
The search for a replacement for Essendon commenced in February 1958, when a panel was appointed to assess Melbourne's civil aviation
needs.
In 1959 the Commonwealth Government acquired [tpl]Convert|5300|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] of grassland in then-rural Tullamarine.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/train-derailed-by-buckpassing-and-vested-interests-20100625-z9sx.html | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |location=Australia | title=Melbourne Airport train link derailed by buck-passing | date=26 June 2010[/tpl]
In May 1959 it was announced that a new airport would be built at Tullamarine, with Prime Minister Robert Menzies announcing on 27 November 1962 a five-year plan to provide Melbourne with a A$45 million "jetport" by 1967. The first sod at Tullamarine turned in two years later in November 1964. In line with the five-year plan, the runways at Essendon were expanded to handle larger aircraft, with Ansett Australia launched the Boeing 727 there in October 1964, the first jet aircraft used for domestic air travel in Australia.[tpl]cite AHD|102718|Essendon Airport, Tullamarine Fwy, Strathmore, VIC, Australia| accessdate =27 September 2008[/tpl] Air Force One landed at Essendon on 22 December 1967, carrying United States President Lyndon B. Johnson.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl][/ref]
On 1 July 1970, Melbourne Airport was opened to international operations by Prime Minister John Gorton, ending Essendon's near 2 decade run as Melbourne International Airport. Essendon still was home to domestic flights for one year, until they were transferred to Melbourne Airport on 26 June 1971, with the first arrival of a Boeing 747 occurring later that year. In the first year of operations, Melbourne handled six international airlines and 155,275 international passengers.
Melbourne Airport was originally called Tullamarine Airport, after the adjacent suburb of the same name. Tullamarine derives from the indigenous name Tullamareena. International has sporadically been used in the name of the airport. After privatisation, the name changed to Melbourne Airport, following the lead of most other major Australian airports. Locally, the airport is commonly referred to as Tullamarine or simply as Tulla to distinguish the airport from the other three Melbourne airports: Avalon, Essendon and Moorabbin.
On opening Melbourne Airport consisted of three connected terminals: International in the centre, with Ansett to the South and Trans Australia Airlines to the North. The design capacity of the airport was eight Boeing 707s at a rate of 500 passengers per hour, with minor expansion works completed in 1973 allowing Boeing 747s to serve the airport.[tpl]cite book | author=Jim Eames | title = Reshaping Australia's Aviation Landscape: The Federal Airports Corporation 1986–1998 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 1998 |ISBN=1-875359-47-8 | page=53[/tpl] By the late 1980s peak passenger flows at the airport had reached 900 per hour, causing major congestion.
In late 1989, Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A. Rohead was put in charge of a bicentennial project to rename streets in Melbourne Airport to honour the original inhabitants, European pioneers and aviation history. Information on the first two categories was provided by Ian Hunter, Wurundjeri researcher, and Ray Gibb, local historian. The project was completed but was shelved, with the only suggested name that was allocated being Gowrie Park Drive, named after the farm at the heart of the airport. During the 1920s the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft, which were parked at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed.Federal Airports Corporation documents, "Bulla Bulla" I.W. Symonds, the late Harry Heaps and Wally Mansfield

===Expansion and privatisation===

In 1988, the Australian Government formed the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), placing Melbourne Airport under the operational control of the new corporation along with 21 other airports around the nation. In April 1994, the Australian Government announced that all airports operated by Federal Airports Corporation would be privatised in several phases. Melbourne Airport was included in the first phase, being acquired by the newly formed Australia Pacific Airports Corporation Limited for $1.3 billion. The transfer was completed on 30 June 1997 on a 50-year long-term lease, with the option for a further 49 years.[tpl]cite book | author=Jim Eames | title = Reshaping Australia's Aviation Landscape: The Federal Airports Corporation 1986–1998 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 1998 |ISBN=1-875359-47-8 | page=123 [/tpl] In July 1997, the Melbourne Airport website was launched, providing Australia's first real-time flight operations data over the internet.
The first major upgrades at the airport were carried out at the domestic terminals, with an expansion of the Ansett domestic terminal approved in 1989 and completed in 1991, adding a second pier added for use by smaller regional airlines.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] Work on an upgrade of the international terminal commenced in 1991, with the 'SkyPlaza' retail complex completed in late 1993 on a site flanking the main international departure gates. The rest of the work was completed in 1995, when the new three-level satellite concourse was opened at the end of the existing concourse. Diamond shaped and measuring [tpl]Convert|80|m|abbr=on[/tpl] on each side, the additional 10 aerobridges provided by the expansion doubled the international passenger handing capacity at Melbourne Airport.[tpl]cite book | author=Jim Eames | title = Reshaping Australia's Aviation Landscape: The Federal Airports Corporation 1986–1998 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 1998 |ISBN=1-875359-47-8 | page=55[/tpl]
Since privatisation, further improvements to infrastructure have begun at the airport, including expansion of runways, car parks and terminals. The multi-storey carpark outside the terminal was completed between 1995 and August 1997 at a cost of $49 million, providing 3,100 parking spaces, the majority undercover. This initially four-level structure replaced the previous open air carpark outside the terminal. Work commenced on the six-story 276-room Hilton Hotel (now Park Royal) above the carpark in January 1999, which was completed in mid-2000 at a cost of $55 million. Expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal was completed in 1999, featuring a second pier and 9 additional aircraft stands.
In December 2000, a fourth passenger terminal was opened: the Domestic Express Terminal, located to the south of the main terminal building at a cost of $9 million. It was the first additional passenger terminal facility to be built at Melbourne Airport since 1971.[tpl]cite web |url= http://data.iguana2.com/hastings/news-item?Number=170882&Code=AIX |author=Australian Infrastructure Fund |title=Media Release: New Domestic Express Terminal opens at Melbourne Airport |work=data.iguana2.com |date=5 December 2000 |accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl]
Expansion of carparks has also continued with a $40 million project commenced in 2004, doubling the size of the short term carpark with the addition of 2,500 spaces over six levels, along with 1,200 new spaces added to the 5,000 already available in the long term carpark. Revenue from retail operations at Melbourne Airport broke the $100 million mark for the first time in 2004, this being a 100 per cent increase in revenue since the first year of privatisation.
Widening of the main north–south runway by [tpl]Convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl] was completed over a 29-day period in May 2005, enabling the operation of the Airbus A380. The works were followed in March 2006 by a [tpl]Convert|5000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] expansion of Terminal 2, and the construction of an additional level of airline lounges above the terminal. In 2008 a further [tpl]Convert|25000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] expansion of Terminal 2 commenced, costing $330 million with completion in 2011. The works added 5 additional aerobridges on a new passenger concourse, and a new [tpl]Convert|5000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] outbound passenger security and customs processing zone.

==Terminals==

Melbourne Airport's terminals have 56 gates: 40 domestic and 16 international. There are five dedicated freighter parking positions on the Southern Freighter Apron.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] The current terminal numbering system was introduced in July 2005; they were previously known as Qantas Domestic, International, and South (formerly Ansett Domestic).

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 hosts domestic services for Qantas Group airlines, Qantas, Jetstar and QantasLink and is located to the northern end of the building. Departures are located on the first floor, while arrivals are located on the ground floor. The terminal has 16 parking bays served by aerobridges; 12 are served by single aerobridges whilst four are served by double aerobridges. There are another five non-aerobridge gates, which are used by QantasLink and Jetstar.
Opened with Melbourne Airport in 1970 for Trans Australia Airlines, the terminal passed to Qantas in 1992 when they acquired the airline. Work on improving the original terminal commenced in October 1997 and was completed in late 1999 at a cost of $50 million, featuring a second pier, stands for 9 additional aircraft, an extended access roadway and the expansion of the terminal.complete.
Today, a wide range of shops and food outlets are situated at the end of the terminal near the entrance into Terminal 2. Qantas has a Qantas Club, Business Class and a Chairman's lounge in the terminal.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 handles all international flights out of Melbourne Airport and the city and opened with the airport in 1970. The terminal has 20 gates with aerobridges. Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas (which includes two lounges in Terminal 2, a First lounge and a Business lounge/Qantas Club), Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand/United Airlines and Emirates Airline all operate airline lounges in the terminal.
The international terminal contains works by noted Australian Indigenous artists including Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri and Gloria Petyarre.[tpl]cite journal|last=Battersby|first=Jean|year=1996|title=Art and Airports 2|journal=Craft Arts International|volume=37|pages=49–64[/tpl]
A $330 million expansion programme for Terminal 2 was announced in 2007. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.melbourneairport.com.au/t2/facts.asp|title=$330m Expansions to Melbourne's International Terminal|date=25 August 2007|publisher=Melbourne Airport|accessdate=25 August 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070831031001/http://www.melbourneairport.com.au/t2/facts.asp |archivedate=31 August 2007[/tpl]
Although described as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2. Departures take place on the lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 – opened with the airport as the Ansett Australia terminal, but is now owned by Melbourne Airport. Terminal 3 is home to Virgin Australia and Regional Express Airlines. It currently has eleven parking bays served by single aerobridges and eight parking bays not equipped with aerobridges.
An expansion of the terminal was approved in 1989 and completed in 1991 when a second pier was added by Ansett to the south for use by smaller regional airline Kendell. The terminal was used exclusively by the Ansett Group for all its domestic activities until its collapse in 2001. It was intended to be used by the "New" Ansett, under ownership of Tesna – however, following the Tesna group's withdrawal of the purchase of Ansett in 2002, the terminal was sold back to Melbourne Airport by Ansett's administrators.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] As a result, Melbourne Airport undertook a major renovation and facelift of the terminal, following which Virgin Australia (then Virgin Blue) moved in from what was then called Domestic Express (now Terminal 4),[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] and has since began operating The Lounge in the terminal, using the former Ansett Australia Golden Wing Lounge area.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] Regional Express also operates an airline lounge in the terminal.

===Terminal 4===

Terminal 4 – originally called the Domestic Express or South Terminal – is dedicated to budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.melbourneairport.com.au/about_airport/media_releases_item.asp?id=138|title=Domestic Multi-User Terminal For Melbourne Great For Competition|date=26 August 2002|work=Melbourne Airport Media Releases|accessdate=2 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] A $5 million refit began in June 2007[tpl]cite news|last=Platt|first=Craig|title=Tiger offers more discount fares|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/08/1191695789803.html|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 October 2007[/tpl] along the lines of the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the main terminal building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.
Jetstar Airways confirmed its involvement in discussions with Melbourne Airport regarding the expansion of terminal facilities to accommodate for the growth of domestic low-cost services. The proposed expansion of Terminal 4 includes infrastructure to accommodate Tiger Airways Australia and Jetstar Airways flights. These plans are currently in development, and the expansion of Terminal 4 would include the relocation of the current freight centre. If approved, the development is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take five years to complete. In March 2012 it was announced that in October the same year T4 is to break ground, with an expected completion of date of July 2014. The new T4 terminal will be [tpl]Convert|35000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] and linked "under one roof" with T3. The airport is yet to confirm which airline(s) will use the new terminal once operational.

===Southern Freighter Apron===

The Southern Freighter Apron has five dedicated freighter parking positions which host 21 dedicated freighter operations a week. In August 1997, the fifth freighter parking position and the apron was extended.

==Other facilities==

Melbourne Airport is served by four hotels. A Parkroyal Hotel is located [tpl]convert|100|m|abbr=on[/tpl] from Terminal 2 atop the multi-level carpark. Work commenced on the six-story 280-room hotel in January 1999, which was completed in mid-2000. The hotel was originally a Hilton but was relaunched as the Parkroyal on 4 April 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitymagazine.com.au/article/Parkroyal-returns-to-Melbourne-with-new-GM/528781.aspx |title=Parkroyal returns to Melbourne with new GM |work=Hospitality |location=Australia |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] Holiday Inn has an outlet located [tpl]convert|400|m|abbr=on[/tpl] from the terminal precinct.

==Operations==

Melbourne is the second busiest airport in Australia. The airport is curfew-free and operates 24 hours a day, although between 2 am and 4 am, freight aircraft are more prevalent than passenger flights.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] In 2004, the environmental management systems were accredited ISO 14001, the world's best practice standard, making it the first airport in Australia to receive such accreditation.

===Airbus A380===

Construction works were undertaken to prepare the airport for the arrival of the double-decker Airbus A380. The A380 has been purchased by several airlines using the airport, namely Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, Vietnam Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates. The improvements included the construction of dual airbridges (Gates 9 and 11) with the ability to board both decks simultaneously to reduce turnaround times, the widening of the North-South runway and remote stands and taxiways by [tpl]convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl], the extension of the international terminal building by [tpl]convert|20|m|abbr=on[/tpl] to include new penthouse airline lounges, and the construction of an additional baggage carousel in the arrivals hall. As a result the airport was the first in Australia to be capable of handling the A380.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] The A380 made its first test flight into the airport on 14 November 2005. On 15 May 2008 the A380 made its first passenger flight into the airport when a Singapore Airlines Sydney-bound flight was diverted from Sydney Airport because of fog.
Beginning services in October 2008, Qantas was the first airline to operate the A380 from the airport, flying nonstop to Los Angeles International Airport twice a week. This was the inaugural route for the Qantas A380.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] Qantas was followed by Singapore Airlines, who now opearates the A380 daily to Singapore Changi Airport. Singapore Airlines services began on 29 September 2009, and will become double daily from August 2012. Emirates intend to fly the A380 to Dubai International Airport from 1 October 2012

===Runways===

Melbourne Airport has two intersecting runways: one [tpl]convert|3657|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] north–south and one [tpl]convert|2286|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] east–west. Due to increasing traffic, several runway expansions are planned, including an [tpl]convert|843|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] extension of the north-south runway to lengthen it to [tpl]convert|4500|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl], and a [tpl]convert|1214|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] extension of the east–west runway to a total of [tpl]convert|3500|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl]. Two new runways are also planned: a [tpl]convert|3000|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] runway parallel to the current north–south runway and a [tpl]convert|3000|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] runway south of the current east–west runway. The 3rd runway is expected to cost $500 million and will be open by 2020.Melbourne Airport plans $500m third runway for 2018-2022 - Flights | hotels | frequent flyer | business class - Australian Business Traveller Traffic movement is expected to reach 248,000 per annum by 2017, necessitating a third runway.
On 5 June 2008, it was announced that the airport would install a Category III landing system, allowing planes to land in low visibility conditions, such as fog. This system will be the first of its kind in Australia, and was commissioned March 2010 at a cost of $10 million.

==Access==

===Car===

Melbourne Airport is [tpl]convert|23|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the city centre and is accessible via CityLink and the Tullamarine Freeway. One freeway offramp runs directly into the airport grounds, and a second to the south serves freight transport, taxis, buses and airport staff. Melbourne Airport has five car parks, all of which operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The short-term, multi-level long-term, business and express carparks are covered, while the long-term parking is not. The main multi-level carpark in front of the terminal was built in the late 1990s, replacing the pre-existing ground-level car parking. It has been progressively expanded ever since.

===Public transport===

The Skybus Super Shuttle service is the main public transport link to the airport, taking approximately 20 minutes to reach Southern Cross Station in the Melbourne central business district. From Southern Cross, travellers can access V/Line regional and Metro Trains Melbourne suburban trains, Yarra Trams and interstate train and bus services.
There are four local bus services to Melbourne Airport. The route 901 SmartBus service was introduced in September 2010,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/web23/Home.nsf/AllDocs/AB31264D6742EB4BCA2576D600119D1B?OpenDocument |title=SmartBus Route 901 |work=The Victorian Transport Plan |publisher=transport.vic.gov.au |accessdate=10 November 2010 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and is much more frequent than the other local bus services.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metrotrains.com.au/About-Us/News/New-SmartBus-direct-to-Melbourne-Airport.html |title=New SmartBus direct to Melbourne Airport |date=21 September 2010 |author=Metro Trains Melbourne |publisher=metrotrains.com.au |accessdate=10 November 2010 [/tpl] The publicly funded Route 901 SmartBus runs at 15-minute intervals throughout the day (30 minutes at night) to and from Broadmeadows railway station, a 20-minute trip depending on traffic and road conditions, where travellers can connect with frequent Metro rail services to Southern Cross, Flinders Street and points beyond with a $6 full fare myki card or a $3 concession myki and top it up with value to travel. In some cases it is cheaper than skybus.
There are nine other bus companies serving the airport, with services to Ballarat, Bendigo, Dandenong, Frankston, Mornington Peninsula, Geelong, Melbourne's suburbs, Shepparton and the Riverina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.melbourneairport.com.au/to_from_airport/bus_services.asp |title=Other Bus Services – To and From the Airport |publisher=Melbourne Airport |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] These provide alternatives to transfer onto V/Line services.

====Rail link====

The possibility of installing a rail link from what was known as the Broadmeadows (now the Craigieburn Suburban Line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s, but little progress was made.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/airport-road-wont-cope-with-demand-study-shows-20100228-pb7g.html | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |location=Australia | title=Airport road won't cope with demand, study shows | first=Clay | last=Lucas | date=1 March 2010[/tpl]
In 2001, the state government investigated the construction of a heavy rail link to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme. Two options were considered; the first branched off the Craigieburn Suburban Line to the east, and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line, which passes close to the airport's boundary to the south. The second option was preferred.[tpl]cite press release| title = Melbourne Airport Rail Link Not Viable Now| publisher=Minister for Transport| date = 18 January 2002| url = http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/MediaRelArc02.nsf/0/15957d548af147904a256b4a008163bf?OpenDocument| accessdate =30 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car, and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on the viability of the project.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/03/1148956582240.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Why can't this train get us to the airport?|date=4 June 2006|work=The Age |location=Australia|accessdate=29 July 2008| location=Melbourne[/tpl] This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012. On 21 July 2008, the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government's commitment to a rail link and said that it would be considered within three to five years.[tpl]cite news| title = Surge in passenger demand prompts call for Airport rail link|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia| date = 22 July 2008| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24057028-661,00.html| accessdate =23 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] To maximise future development options, the airport is lobbying for the on-grounds section of the railway to be underground.[tpl]cite news| last = Ferguson| first = John| title = Melbourne airport seeks underground train line|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia| date = 29 April 2008| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23614070-661,00.html| accessdate =30 June 2008[/tpl]
In 2010, Martin Pakula of the Labor Party, newly appointed State Minister for Public Transport announced that the rail link had been taken off the agenda with new freeway options being explored instead,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/new-airport-link-proposed-20091111-i9yn.html | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |location=Australia | title=New airport link proposed | first=Clay | last=Lucas | date=12 November 2009[/tpl] however a change of government at the 2010 Victorian State Election to Liberals, saw policy for the introduction of the rail link return to the agenda, with a promise by the incoming Coalition government to undertake planning for its construction.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.vic.liberal.org.au/News/MediaReleases/tabid/159/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2442/COALITION-WILL-PLAN-MELB-AIRPORT-RAIL-LINK.aspx | location=Melbourne | work=Liberal Party Victoria | title=COALITION WILL PLAN MELB AIRPORT RAIL LINK | first=Simon | last=Troeth | date=15 November 2010[/tpl]
On 13 March 2013, the Victorian Liberal government under the newly installed Premier Dennis Napthine announced that the Melbourne Airport Rail Link (MARL) would be constructed sometime in the future running from the CBD via Sunshine station and the Albion–Jacana railway line.[tpl]cite web|title=Route chosen for Melbourne airport link|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/route-chosen-for-melbourne-airport-link/story-e6frg13c-1226596692140|work=Perth Now|accessdate=19 March 2013[/tpl]
