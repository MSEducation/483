Ridgway Awards
 Since 1992
]]The Marion Vannett Ridgway Award is an annual award which celebrates only debut appearances of American authors and illustrators of children's books. Established in 1992 as a memorial award, the Ridgway holds a unique place in the American publishing industry as one of the few debut awards.

==A Memorial Award==

Marion Vannett Ridgway was an artist's representative in the mid-20th century New York publishing community. According to The New York Times Ms. Ridgway was involved in the publishing industry for over 40 years. Elizabeth Park, a close friend, was said to have believed Ridgway was among the first women in this field. Ms. Park's wish was to continue the spirit of generosity and encouragement which Marion gave her young clients as they began their careers in publishing.
Ridgway's office was located at 299 Madison Avenue in Manhattan and represented commercial artists, photographers and writers for publishers and advertising companies. She wrote 11 books for children early in her career. Ridgway died on May 27, 1991 in Southbury, Connecticut of pneumonia. She was 88 years old.
