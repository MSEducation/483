Galileo found that for an object in free fall, the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time:
Galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the Earth’s gravitational field have a constant acceleration, and Galileo’s contemporary, Johannes Kepler, had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the Sun’s gravitational mass.  However, Galileo’s free fall motions and Kepler’s planetary motions remained distinct during Galileo’s lifetime.

==Newtonian mass==

Robert Hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating that, all Cœlestial Bodies whatsoever, have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own Centers and they do also attract all the other Cœlestial Bodies that are within the sphere of their activity. He further states that gravitational attraction increases by how much the nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center. In a correspondence of 1679–1680 between Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, Hooke conjectures that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies. Hooke urged Newton, who was a pioneer in the development of calculus, to work through the mathematical details of Keplerian orbits to determine if Hooke's hypothesis was correct.  Newton's own investigations verified that Hooke was correct, but due to personal differences between the two men, Newton chose not to reveal this to Hooke.  Isaac Newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend, Edmond Halley, that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits, but had misplaced the solution in his office. After being encouraged by Halley, Newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings.  In November 1684, Isaac Newton sent a document to Edmund Halley, now lost but presumed to have been titled De motu corporum in gyrum (Latin for "On the motion of bodies in an orbit"). Halley presented Newton's findings to the Royal Society of London, with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow.  Newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set, entitled Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin: "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy").  The first was received by the Royal Society on 28 April 1685–6, the second on 2 March 1686–7, and the third on 6 April 1686–7.  The Royal Society published Newton’s entire collection at their own expense in May 1686–7.[tpl]cite book|author1=Sir Isaac Newton |author2=N. W.

Isaac Newton had bridged the gap between Kepler’s gravitational mass and Galileo’s gravitational acceleration, and proved the following relationship:
where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist, μ is the gravitational mass (standard gravitational parameter) of the body causing gravitational fields, and R is the radial coordinate (the distance between the centers of the two bodies).
By finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field, Newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass.  The mass of the Earth can be determined using Kepler's method (from the orbit of Earth's Moon), or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the Earth's surface, and multiplying that by the square of the Earth's radius.  The mass of the Earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the Sun.  To date, no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.

===Newton's cannonball===

Newton's cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits.  It appeared in Newton's 1728 book A Treatise of the System of the World.  According to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the Earth.  However, Newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity) it follows a curved path.  "For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground.  And the greater the velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth."[tpl]rp|513[/tpl] Newton further reasons that if an object were "projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain" with sufficient velocity, "it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth, and return to the mountain from which it was projected."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Universal gravitational mass===

In contrast to earlier theories (e.g. Celestial spheres) which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material, Newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass: every object has gravitational mass, and therefore, every object generates a gravitational field.  Newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object. If a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the Earth or Sun, Newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body,[tpl]rp|397[/tpl] and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center.[tpl]rp|221[/tpl]These two properties are very useful, as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects.
For example, according to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, each carob seed produces a gravitational field.  Therefore, if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere, then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere.  Hence, it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the Earth or Sun.  In fact, by unit conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass.
Measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle, but extremely difficult in practice.  According to Newton's theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere.  However, from a practical standpoint, the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure. Newton's books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s, but the first successful measurement of the Earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units, the Cavendish experiment, did not occur until 1797, over a hundred years later. Cavendish found that the Earth's density was 5.448 ± 0.033 times that of water.  As of 2009, the Earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy, whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures.[tpl]clarify|reason='mass in kilograms' does not specify a experimental method. What's the distinction between the methods?|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Given two objects A and B, of masses MA and MB, separated by a distance RAB, Newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other, of magnitude
where G is the universal gravitational constant. The above statement may be reformulated in the following way: if g is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field, then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass M is
This is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing. In simple spring scales, for example, the force F is proportional to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan, as per Hooke's law, and the scales are calibrated to take g into account, allowing the mass M to be read off. Assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance, a balance measures relative weight, giving the relative gravitation mass of each object.

===Inertial mass===

Inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration. The simple classical mechanics definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of special relativity, but the essential  meaning is the same.
In classical mechanics, according to Newton's second law, we say that a body has a mass m if, at any instant of time, it obeys the equation of motion
where F is the resultant force acting on the body and a is the acceleration of the body's centre of mass.In its original form, Newton's second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass. For the moment, we will put aside the question of what "force acting on the body" actually means.
This equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body. Consider two objects with different masses. If we apply an identical force to each, the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration, and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration. We might say that the larger mass exerts a greater "resistance" to changing its state of motion in response to the force.
However, this notion of applying "identical" forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is. We can sidestep this difficulty with the help of Newton's third law, which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object, it will experience an equal and opposite force. To be precise, suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses m1 and m2. We isolate the two objects from all other physical influences, so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2, which we denote F12, and the force exerted on m2 by m1, which we denote F21. Newton's second law states that
where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2, respectively. Suppose that these accelerations are non-zero, so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero. This occurs, for example, if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another. Newton's third law then states that
and thus
If |a1| is non-zero, the fraction is well-defined, which allows us to measure the inertial mass of m1. In this case, m2 is our "reference" object, and we can define its mass m as (say) 1 kilogram. Then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations.
Additionally, mass relates a body's momentum p to its linear velocity v:
and the body's kinetic energy K to its velocity:

==Atomic mass==

The name atom comes from the Ancient Greek ἄτομος, which means uncuttable, something that cannot be divided further.  Despite its early origin, this philosophical assertion that matter is composed of discrete indivisible units remained very abstract, and was generally ignored. This changed in the late 18th century, when chemists uncovered increasing evidence for the existence of a law of multiple proportions. They noticed that when two or more elements combined to form a compound,  the ingredients held to a fixed and definite ratio.  For example, the mass ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in nitric oxide is seven eights, and ammonia has a hydrogen to nitrogen mass ratio of three fourteenths.
In order to explain the existence of these ratios, the chemist John Dalton proposed that all matter was made of tiny atoms. His first table of relative atomic weights in 1805 listed six elements: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus; he assigned hydrogen an atomic weight of 1.  In 1815, the chemist William Prout concluded that the hydrogen atom was in fact the fundamental mass unit from which all other atomic masses were derived.
Prout's hypothesis, however, was somewhat inaccurate. Although elemental masses were near-multiples of the hydrogen mass,(within about 1%) the discrepancies could not be ignored. The light isotope of hydrogen, for example, with a single proton, has an atomic mass of 1.007825 u. The most abundant isotope of iron has 26 protons and 30 neutrons, so one might expect its atomic mass to be 56 times that of the hydrogen atom, but in fact, its atomic mass is only 55.9383 u, which is clearly not an integer multiple of 1.007825 (In this case, iron-56 has a mass 0.89% less than 56 hydrogens).The origin of the discrepancy was later explained by Einstein's theory of relativity, which says that when protons and neutrons come together to form an atomic nucleus, some of the mass of the nucleus is released in the form of binding energy. The more tightly bound the nucleus, the more energy is lost during formation and this binding energy loss (along with the slight difference in masses between protons and neutrons) causes the elemental masses not to be related through simple fractions. Despite its shortcomings, the concepts of Prout's theory, such as atomic mass and amount, continue to play an influential role in chemistry, and the atomic mass unit continues to be the unit of choice for very small mass measurements.

==Mass in relativity==

===Special relativity===

In Special relativity, there are two kinds of mass: rest mass (or invariant mass),It is possible to make a slight distinction between "rest mass" and "invariant mass". For a system of two or more particles, none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer. To avoid this confusion, some sources will use "rest mass" only for individual particles, and "invariant mass" for systems. and relativistic mass.(which increases with velocity) Rest mass is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object.  Relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by c2. The two are related by the following equation:
The invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames, while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's frame of reference. In order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values are do not change between observers, it is convenient to use rest mass. The rest mass of a body is also related to its energy E and the magnitude of its momentum p by the relativistic energy-momentum equation:
So long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy, both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference. The conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others. Matter particles may be converted to types of energy which are not matter,(e.g. light, kinetic energy, and the potential energy in magnetic, electric, and other fields) but this does not affect the amount of mass. Although things like heat may not be matter, all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass.For example, a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box, sitting on a scale, would in theory show no change in mass when detonated (although the inside of the box would become much hotter). In such a system, the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat. However, in that case, the removed energy would take its associated mass with it. Letting heat out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass. Thus, mass, like energy, cannot be destroyed, but only moved from one place to another. Thus, mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity; rather, both are names for the same thing, and neither mass nor energy appear without the other.
Both rest and relativistic mass can be  expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship E = mc2, yielding rest energy and "relativistic energy" (total system energy) respectively. 
The "relativistic" mass and energy concepts are related to their "rest" counterparts, but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum. Because the relativistic mass is proportional to the energy, it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists.[tpl]cite arXiv|author=G.

In bound systems, the binding energy must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound. Mass is not conserved in this process because the system is not closed during the binding process. For example, the binding energy of atomic nuclei is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed, leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles (nucleons) of which they are composed.

===General relativity===

In general relativity, the equivalence principle is any of several related concepts dealing with the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass. At the core of this assertion is Albert Einstein's idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference.
However, it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of invariant mass in general relativity.
At the core of the problem is the non-linearity of the Einstein field equations, which makes it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the Stress–energy tensor in a way that is invariant for all observers. For a given observer, this can be achieved by the Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor.

==Mass in quantum physics==

In classical mechanics, the inert mass of a particle appears in the Euler–Lagrange equation as a parameter m,
After quantization, replacing the position vector x with a wave function, the parameter m appears in the kinetic energy operator,
In the ostensibly covariant (relativistically invariant) Dirac equation, and in natural units, this becomes
Where the "mass" parameter m is now simply a constant associated with the quantum described by the wave function ψ.
In the Standard Model of particle physics as developed in the 1960s, there is the proposal that this term arises from the coupling of the field  ψ to an additional field Φ, the so-called Higgs field.
This shifts the explanandum of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown couplings Gψ.
The tentatively confirmed discovery of a massive Higgs boson is regarded as a strong confirmation of this theory. But there is indirect evidence for the reality of the Electroweak symmetry breaking as described by the Higgs mechanism, and the non-existence of Higgs bosons would indicate a "Higgsless" description of this mechanism.
