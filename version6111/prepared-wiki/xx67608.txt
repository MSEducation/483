==History==

===Formation and the Wildbunch years===

The band formed in 1996 and was initially known as The Wildbunch, eventually dropping that name due to pressure from the Bristol trip hop collective of the same name.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0314,phillips,43005,22.html | title = Sax as a Weapon: You Didn't Know that Rock 'n' roll Burned | first = Amy | last = Phillips | date = 2003-04-02 | work=The Village Voice | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] Throughout the later half of the '90s, they played regularly at the Old Miami and the Gold Dollar in Detroit,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.electricsix.com/meet.html | title = Meet the Electric Six | work=ElectricSix.com | accessdate = 2006-07-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060701160356/http://www.electricsix.com/meet.html  |archivedate = 2006-07-01[/tpl] the center of a scene that produced breakout acts like the White Stripes.[tpl]cite news | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=291943 | title = The White Stripes: Candy Coloured Blues – Unauthorized |work=The New York Times | first = Jeremy | last = Wheeler | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl]
The band was originally composed of Dick Valentine (Tyler Spencer, vocals), Rock and Roll Indian (Anthony Selph, guitar), Surge Joebot (Joe Frezza, guitar), Disco (Steve Nawara, bass, former member of The Detroit Cobras), and M (Cory Martin, drums). Dick Valentine is and has always been the primary songwriter (both music and lyrics) of Electric Six.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4421 | title = Fanning the Fire: Boozing with the boys of Electric Six | first = Eve | last = Doster | work=Metrotimes | date = 2002-12-25 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] During the band's temporary split at the end of the 1990s, Tyler Spencer formed his own band called The Dirty Shame[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/06/09/dick_valentine.php | title = Dick Valentine, Musician, Electric Six | work=Gothamist | first = Ben | last = Kharakh | date = 2006-09-06 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] and released one CD titled Smog Cutter Love Story which featured, among other tracks, a first version of Fire track "Vengeance and Fashion." The band reformed by 2001 to record and release the first release of "Danger! High Voltage" and record the track "Dealin' in Death and Stealin' in the Name of the Lord" with Troy Gregory for his Sybil album.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fallofrome.com/sybil.htm | title = Troy Gregory: Sybil | work=Fall of Rome Records | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl]

===Mainstream success (2001–2003)===

The 2003 release of "Danger! High Voltage" (produced and mixed by Damien Mendis and Stuart Bradbury) proved a massive hit, particularly in the United Kingdom. The single also garnered the band public attention after a rumor got out that a pre-fame Jack White from The White Stripes sang backup vocals on single track "Danger! (High Voltage)" when it was recorded.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17417/Electric_Six_Danger_High_Voltage_EP | title = Review: Danger!

[tpl]cquote|'What about the Jack White rumors? Who sings with Dick Valentine in the song?' Surge responds, 'No, no it's a fan. We put a competition out, um and he won, he's a mechanic, it wasn't Jack White.' Disco adds, 'Yeah he was probably the only person that entered!'[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.antimusic.com/ug/2003/es.shtml | title = antiMUSIC article ''Electric Six – Detroit Rockers Invade the UK | first = Rachel | last = Rearden | work=antiMUSIC | accessdate = 2007-03-21 [/tpl] [/tpl]
In another interview, former drummer M. said: "My attorney has advised us to neither confirm nor deny the presence of Jack White."[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/august_2003/electric.html | title = Electric Six interview | first = Alexander | last = Laurence | work=Free Williamsburg | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2007-04-25 [/tpl]
Still, the rumor persisted that Jack White was featured on the song "Danger! High Voltage."Laurence, Alexander (2003).

"Detroit funk-rock to set the disco on fire" BBC.co.uk Retrieved on May 17, 2006
The band's 2003 debut Fire (also produced and mixed by Damien Mendis and Stuart Bradbury) earned the group significant critical success, landing the "Danger! High Voltage" single at number 2 on the UK singles chart. Their second single, "Gay Bar", released in 2003, reached No. 5 in the UK charts.
The album made it into several best-of-2003 lists,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/bests/2003.shtml | title = Best of 2003 | work=Metacritic | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/december_2003/best.html | title = Best in Music 2003 | work=FREEwilliamsburg: The Williamsburg Brooklyn Culture Guide | date = December 2003 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.furious.com/PERFECT/2003.html | title = Favorite Music of 2003 | work=Perfect Sound Forever | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] as well as reaching the top 10 in the UK album chart, and another single "Dance Commander", which gave Electric Six its third Top 40 single in the UK.

===Lineup changes and tour===

After finishing the recording of Fire, three members left in June, leaving Dick Valentine, M, and Tait Nucleus? (Christopher Tait). Johnny Na$hinal (John Nash, guitar, member of The Volebeats, The Witches and solo effort The Alphabet), The Colonel (Zach Shipps, guitar, ex member of Brendan Benson, The Atomic Numbers and Mood Elevator), John R. Dequindre (Chris Peters, bass/guitar) and Frank Lloyd Bonaventure (Mark Dundon, bass) (both-ex members of Ann Arbor's whirlingRoad, Getaway Cruiser and Six Clips) subsequently joined the group, although The Colonel had to opt out of early performances due to prior touring commitments.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.annarborpaper.com/content/issue24/electric6_24.html | title = Clocked In: Don't You Want to Know How They Keep Starting Fires? | first = Ray | last = Wagel | work=Ann Arbor Paper | date = September | accessdate = 2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061207174017/http://www.annarborpaper.com/content/issue24/electric6_24.html  |archivedate = 2006-12-07[/tpl] In time, Dequindre switched from guitar to bass and Bonaventure left to attain a law degree.
In early 2004, Electric Six played at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.virtual-festivals.com/festivals/festival.cfm?eventid=849&dbtable=eventgroup&section=eventhome | title = Coachella 2004 | publisher=Virtual-Festivals.com | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl]

===Señor Smoke (2005)===

The band's second album, Señor Smoke, was released in the United Kingdom on February 14, 2005. Since the band had been dropped from their previous American record label,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nyrock.com/conf/2006/fury54.asp | title = NY Rock Confidential | first = Jeanne | last = Fury | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] a North American release of the album was delayed until February 7, 2006, when it came out on Metropolis Records.
The first single from the album put the band at the center of controversy, especially with Queen fans following a cover of the Queen hit song "Radio Ga Ga."[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/electric%20six%20upset%20queen%20fans%20with%20radio%20ga%20ga%20video | title = Electric Six Upset Queen Fans With Radio Ga Ga Video | work=ContactMusic.com | date = 2004-11-24 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] The controversial music video shows lead singer Dick Valentine as the ghost of Queen's flamboyant lead singer Freddie Mercury and a backing band of poodles. Queen drummer Roger Taylor, who wrote the song, said that he was "unimpressed" with the video;[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.kerrang.com/nav?page=kerrang.news.detail&fixture_news=1569548 | title = Queen 'unimpressed' by Electric Six video | work=Kerrang! | date = 2004-12-03 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] Queen guitarist Brian May reportedly liked it.[tpl]cite news | url = http://ixfm.fimc.net/Article.asp?id=57400 | title = Electric Six Go Radio Ga Ga | work=XFM Online | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl]
According to Dick Valentine[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.electricsix.com/music.php | title = Electric Six official website – Music + Videos | accessdate = 2007-03-21[/tpl] [tpl]cquote | Though some have claimed this video portrays me dancing on Freddie Mercury's grave, but that wasn't the idea. Actually it's more like we are resurrecting Mr. Mercury for the duration of the song and his grave is the logical starting point. We just were trying to show him being resurrected from the grave for three and a half minutes. I guess a video like that can be taken the wrong way, but we hadn't looked at it like that. Anyhow, everyone knows we disliked the fact that we had to put this song on our record, so this ridiculous video took a little bit of the sting out of it for us and made it somewhat bearable. It was also very rewarding to work with dogs. In terms of the response we've had, some people think it's brilliant. To the others, we can only apologise. We never meant for it to be taken that way. But I definitely respect Freddie and his work.[/tpl]

===Switzerland (2006)===

In November 2004, drummer M. called it quits, leaving Dick Valentine as the sole original member of the former Wildbunch. Their new drummer, Percussion World (Mike Alonso), has been affiliated with the band and its members for some time, and has been named as a permanent member of the band.
Electric Six finished recording their third major album, titled Switzerland, in November 2005 and released it in North America on September 12, 2006. The band intends to record a video for every song on the album, "a lot of them...low budget." At present, eight videos have been released.[tpl]cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=ux2B3Vk7kIc | title = I Buy the Drugs |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=KAG8-qPv8yU | title = Chocolate Pope |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=zGn-cNmuzJo | title = Mr. Woman |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=_5NsgMOvbfs | title = Pulling the Plug on the Party |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qer8jKoEQZU&eurl= | title = There's Something Very Wrong With Us So Let's Go Out Tonight |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KET11SOC5YA | title = Infected Girls |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-08-23 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE60Npeyx6s&eurl | title = Rubber Rocket |publisher=YouTube | accessdate = 2007-03-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04647476/dick_valentine_of_electric_six.html | title = Electric Six | work=craveonline.com | first = Johnny | last = Fire cloud | date = 2007-02-20 | accessdate = 2007-03-13 [/tpl]

==Sound, style, and influences==

Electric Six incorporates a variety of styles, resulting in being termed a "genre-blurring" band.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/41291/electric-six-revitalized-and-ready-to-hit-the-road | title = Electric Six Revitalized and Ready to Hit the Road |work=Chart | date = 2006-06-06 | accessdate = 2009-07-25 | first=Max | last=Hayman [/tpl] The group's sound has been described as a synthesis of "disco, synth pop, glam, and arena rock,"[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r733199|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Review of Señor Smoke |publisher=Allmusic | first = Heather | last = Phares | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] including the falsetto vocals of disco, laden with "rampant solos, be they guitar riffs, synth wails, or strutting drums" that enforce the band's "energetic sound."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.epitonic.com/artists/electricsix.html | title = Electric Six | work=Epitonic.com | first = Sandy | last = Hunter | date = 2003-07-03 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl] However, the band members themselves have rejected such genre classifications as "disco-metal" and "disco-punk."[tpl] cite news | url = http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=201 | title = Detroit's Burning | first = Matt | last = Schild | work=Aversion.com | date = 2003-06-11 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 [/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=June 2009[/tpl]

Songs by Electric Six are often concerned with subjects such as human sexual behavior, masculinity, dancing, hypersexuality, fast food and fire (The band's official biography states that their debut album Fire was so named because they "noticed an abundance of the word fire on this record and...decided to go with it."). Lead singer Dick Valentine had commented on the aforementioned lyrical tendencies in song content with regards to the band's third album:
[tpl]quote|... for the first time, none of the songs have the word "dance" or variation of "dance" in the title. But fear not. We have songs with "drugs" and "girls" and "tonight" and "night" and "louder" and "party" in the title, so we haven't given up on our philosophy just yet.|[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.electricsix.com/archive/2006_01_01_archive.html#113769687042051658 | title = Frequently Asked Questions 2006 | date = 2006-01-19 | work=ElectricSix.com | accessdate = 2006-07-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615085005/http://www.electricsix.com/archive/2006_01_01_archive.html#113769687042051658  |archivedate = 2006-06-15[/tpl][/tpl]
