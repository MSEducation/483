==Fictional character biography==

In their future, Earth had colonized several planets in its solar system, including Pluto. Martinex was born on Cerberus Center, Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of Africa on Earth.
He grew up to become a scientist and technician. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystalline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Plutonian after the Badoon exterminated all the other Plutonians, as he was working on Pluto's moon Charon. The Pluvians had been forewarned of the attack, but the ship they were escaping on was destroyed by the Badoon. Martinex escaped the Badoon using a telepod and teamed with Vance Astro, a human astronaut from the 20th century with psychic powers, Charlie-27, a Jovian who was the last of his race as well, and Yondu, from Alpha Centauri, to fight the Badoon as the freedom fighters, the Guardians of the Galaxy.Marvel Super-Heroes Vol. 1 #18 It was later revealed Starhawk had manipulated events to bring them together.[tpl]Issue|date=July 2011[/tpl]

He possesses enhanced strength, speed, and stamina, and superhuman durability. His epidermis is composed of a silicon-isotope organic crystal. Martinex has the ability to convert bodily energy into laser-like beams of energy which he can project from his hands. His right hand can project infrared energy, stimulating heat in any object. His left hand can project microwave energy that reduces thermal energies in objects, thereby producing coldness. His body is highly resistant to intense heat and cold as well as other conventional forms of injury. Martinex can only use his superhuman powers to project heat and cold at maximum output for up to one half hour before having to rest in order to replenish them.
