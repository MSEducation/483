Shibolim ([tpl]lang-he-n|שִׁבֳּלִים[/tpl], lit. Ears) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and covering 4,000 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2008 it had a population of 350.
The village was established on 22 February 1952 by immigrants from Iran and Kurdistan, who had previously been living in Yakhini. It was initially named Sharsheret Bet, before adopting its current name, taken from the Tanakh. Notable residents include Eliezer Avtabi, a member of the Knesset for the National Religious Party
