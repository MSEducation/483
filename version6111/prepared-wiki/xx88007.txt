Moraes spent eight years in Britain, in London and Oxford, New York City, Hong Kong, Delhi and Mumbai.

Moraes conducted one of the first interviews of the Dalai Lama after the Tibetan spiritual leader fled to India in 1959. The Dalai Lama was then 23 and Moraes, 20.

He had a lifelong battle with alcoholism. Moraes suffered from cancer, but refused treatment and died from a heart attack in Bandra, Mumbai. He was buried in the city's Sewri Cemetery and as per his last wishes Sarayu Srivatsa buried the soil from his grave in Odcombe, Somerset, on 19 July 2002 (his birthdate).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071013/saturday/above.htm| title=Requiem to Dom Moraes| first=Khushwant| last=Singh| publisher=The Tribune| date=13 October 2007[/tpl] Many of Dom's old friends and publishers attended the memorial service in Odcombe.

En 1961-62 he was one of the very few public Indian figures to strongly criticize -along with the UN- the Indian Army takeover of Goa -land of his forefathers- Daman and Diu from Portugal.
When the Gujarat riots erupted in 2002, with their heavy toll of Muslim dead, Moraes left for Ahmedabad the minute the news came through, claiming that since he was a Catholic, Muslims would not see him as an enemy. Even though he was physically in considerable pain by then, he was one of the first on the scene.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jun/04/guardianobituaries.india| title=Dom Moraes - Naseem Khan writes| date=4 June 2004| publisher=The Guardian| location=London| first=Alan| last=Brownjohn[/tpl]
