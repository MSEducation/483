State Route 12 (SR 12) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that travels in an east–west direction from Sebastopol in Sonoma County to State Route 49 just north of San Andreas in Calaveras County. It is constructed to freeway standards from the Fulton Road/South Wright Road stoplight in Santa Rosa, to its partial interchange with Farmers Lane (also in Santa Rosa).

There are six segments that are overlaps with other highways:  in the Napa and Sonoma valleys with SR 121, in the southern Napa Valley with SR 29, a short overlap with I-80 at Cordelia Junction in Fairfield, another short overlap with SR 99 in Lodi, and overlaps with SR 88 and SR 26 in the Sierra foothills. The highway is mainly two lane rural highway, with the exception of short segments in Santa Rosa and Fairfield/Suisun City, the overlaps with I-80 and SR 99, and segments within developed areas, such as Santa Rosa and Lodi.California State Automobile Association map San Francisco Bay, 1-09 edition
SR 12 begins in the west at its junction with SR 116 in Sebastopol. After passing east through Santa Rosa on a mix of freeway, surface street, and expressway, it turns south into the Sonoma Valley, passing the Jack London State Historic Park at Glen Ellen. It winds through Sonoma on surface streets, where the historic Vallejo Estate and Sonoma Mission, both part of the Sonoma State Historic Park, are.
South of Sonoma, SR 12 turns east, joining SR 121 for nearly nine miles, then turns south briefly as it leaves SR 121 and joins the four-lane expressway SR 29 to cross the Napa River. Four miles after joining SR 29 it splits off towards the east on Jameson Canyon Road. After a brief merge with Interstate 80, SR 12 branches off to the east as an expressway through Fairfield and Suisun City. East of Suisun it becomes two lanes again and crosses south of Travis Air Force Base, through rolling fields with numerous wind turbines. Just past Braid's Bridge is the Western Railway Museum. At Rio Vista, SR 12 crosses the Helen Madere bridge over the Sacramento River, entering the California Delta.
This stretch of the river has twice been the site of much-publicized inland excursions by humpback whales, presumably veering off course while making their annual migrations along the Pacific coast. In 1985 Humphrey the whale swam about as far as the Rio Vista Bridge. In 2007 a humpback mother and calf dubbed Delta and Dawn circled for several days just upstream of the bridge, seemingly reluctant to pass under it again after having spent the previous three or four weeks upriver near Sacramento.
From the Sacramento River to the junction with Interstate 5, SR 12 crosses several of the waterways of the California Delta and the low lying fields between them.  Through Lodi it becomes a wide four lane business route. After another brief merger with another freeway, this time SR 99, SR 12 heads east into the Sierra foothills (with shared segments with SR 88 and SR 26) before ending at the junction with SR 49 just north of San Andreas.

==History==

Before the 1964 renumbering, this route was signed as Sign Route 12 for most of its length. However, SR 12 was designated as LRN 51 from SR 116 to SR 121 before the 1964 renumbering. Portions of the route from SR 29 to I-80 ran concurrently with State Route 29 or with State Route 37; this was also LRN 8 and a former routing of U.S. 40. The portion from I-80 to then-US 99 was designated as LRN 53 in 1919; from US 99 to SR 49, it was designated as LRN 24.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cahighways.org/009-016.html#012 |title=California Highways (www.cahighways.org): Routes 9 through 16 |publisher=www.cahighways.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl]
In 1976, the discontinuity resulting from the concurrency with State Route 84 was removed.

==Future==

Plans call for a western extension of its western terminus to State Route 1 near Bodega Bay.Democrat: County OKs bypass around Forestville, accessed 2010-06-15 Plans also call for Route 12 to be built from Farmers Lane to Melita Road, in Santa Rosa, however this project was delayed due to community opposition. There will be interchanges at Yulupa Avenue, Summerfield Road, Channel Drive and Sonoma Highway.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
