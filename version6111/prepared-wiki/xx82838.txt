Wahta Mohawk Territory is a Mohawk First Nation reserve in the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada.  It is bounded on the west by Highway 400, a major north-south artery in the province.  About one-third of the citizens of Wahta Mohawk Territory live in the community of Wahta, along District Road 38, another third live within 100Â km, and the remainder live elsewhere.
The land is made up of forest and lakes typical of the rugged Canadian Shield.  The territory is home to the Iroquois Cranberry Growers, which is Ontario's largest cranberry farm.  Iroquois is owned and operated by the people of Wahta and welcomes visitors year round.  They offer tours during harvest and have a store open year round.
Wahta Mohawk Territory was founded in 1881 when a group of Mohawks moved from the community of Kanesatake, Quebec because of political and religious strife.

=="Wahta Gap"==

Due to a land-claim dispute with the provincial government, the Wahta Territory, formerly known as the Gibson Reserve, prevented completion of a freeway through its land. It was consequently the site of an eight-kilometre gap in Highway 400, where the roadway remained a two-lane highway for several years after construction of the freeway was completed further north.  In 2003 the government and the Mohawk Nation reached an agreement allowing freeway construction through the reserve lands. Begun in 2004, construction was completed in 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

==Demographics==

According to the 2006 Statistics Canada Census:
Population figures are not available because the Wahta Mohawk Territory is an Incompletely Enumerated Indian Reserve, meaning that enumeration was either not permitted or it was interrupted before it could be completed.
