Patashnik (1994) is an ambient house album, the second release by musician Biosphere (alias Geir Jenssen). It was released by Origo Sound in Norway and by Apollo in the rest of the world. Its track "Novelty Waves" was used for a 1995 Levi's ad campaign.

==Overview==

According to Jenssen, the word patashnik is allegedly Russian cosmonaut slang for "a traveler"Thompson 2000 or "a goner", a cosmonaut who didn't return from a space mission because his security cable disengaged and he was lost in space.Pettersen 2003Temirov 2004 There seem to be no such word in contemporary Russian but such surnames exist,The Russian -nik suffix is well known, but no word or root for "patash" is found in usual Russian dictionaries. It could derive from a misspelled or misheard word "ptashka" (пташка, a bird – cf. O'Brien 1944) or "propavshij" (пропавший, lost, missing in action); and in Ukrainian, "ptashnik" means "aviary, poultry house"http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/av/aviary.html. Indeed, the Russian surname Пташникhttp://books.google.com/books?q=%D0%9F%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA/Ptashnikhttp://books.google.com/books?q=Ptashnik+-Biosphere+-Jenssen and the variant Паташникhttp://books.google.com/books?q=%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA/Patashnikhttp://books.google.com/books?q=Patashnik+-Biosphere+-Jenssen abounds. However, though ptashnik/patashnik may mean "a bird-like thing, a traveler", no direct source could be located that such word was an actual slang for a "lost cosmonaut" among space-faring Russians. and it still sheds light on Jenssen's intent with the title.
Through Patashnik, Jenssen continued to explore his ambient-house stylings to an even greater extent. Patashnik contained the first hints of the reduction in beat-driven song structure that would mark later Biosphere releases. Unlike the first album, Patashnik was quickly picked up by a comparatively large international audience, which brought Biosphere greater recognition. A music video made for the track "The Shield" was often played on MTV's Chill Out Zone show.
In 1995, Levi Strauss & Co. was searching for a new angle to add to their television advertisement campaign (which up to that point had never featured electronic music), and they decided to use the uptempo track "Novelty Waves" from Patashnik. Shortly thereafter, "Novelty Waves" was released as a single (featuring remixes by various other artists), and managed to chart in several countries. Although Jenssen never regretted his approval for use of the track, he also never sought this kind of fame and subsequently turned down various requests by his record company and peers to collaborate with well-known techno and drum 'n bass artists or to create a follow-up album in the same style.
In 2007, Patashnik was reissued by Beatservice Records with a new cover and the same contents.
