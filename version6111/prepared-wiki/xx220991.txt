===The Name Game===

"The Name Game" is a rapid-fire question and answer segment, in which two players' values are compared against each other, with one ultimately being deemed the better choice based upon the fantasy league being discussed.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] The players discussed are often requested by listeners of the show, who submit their questions via email.

===Man's League===

The Man's League is a fantasy league in which the listeners of the show play against the show's producer, Jay Soderberg (aka Pod Vader).http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/leagueoffice?leagueId=555623&seasonId=2008 [tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The name "Man's League" comes from the high number of team owners the league has, forcing each owner to use lesser known professional players to complete their roster, thus increasing the difficulty. Competition to be chosen for the league is very high, and listeners often have to go to extreme lengths to be selected to play.

===The Board===

Ravitz, Berry, Karabell and Cockcroft make contradicting predictions on many zany issues, including how players will fare in an upcoming fantasy season, single week performance, and pop culture issues. These predictions are tracked "on the board", with the winner being the host who has the most accurate predictions at the end of the season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/fantasyfocus/theboard |title=ESPN Radio Fantasy Focus – The Board – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/news/story?id=3515811 |title=Fantasy Focus Football: The Board – ESPN Radio – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/fantasyfocus/theboard |title=ESPN Radio Fantasy Focus – The Board – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl]
