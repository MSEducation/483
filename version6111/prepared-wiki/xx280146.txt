According to the Jerusalem Post, Girotti worked as a theology professor at the Saint Maria della Rose Dominican Seminary in Turin. Following the Nazi occupation of Italy in 1943, he saved many Jews by arranging safe hideouts and escape routes from Italy. Caught in the act of assisting a wounded Jewish person, Girotti was arrested on 29 August 1944, and sent to Dachau. He died at the camp on 1 April 1945.Mordecai Paldiel; A litany of World War Two saints; Jerusalem Post; 11 April 2008
