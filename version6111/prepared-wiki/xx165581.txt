CATEGORIES: Local government areas of Queensland, Rockhampton Region, 2008 establishments in Australia

The Rockhampton Region is a local government area in Central Queensland, Queensland, Australia. Established in 2008, it was preceded by four previous local government areas extending to almost the beginning of local government in Queensland. On 1 January 2014, one of those local government areas, the Shire of Livingstone was restored as an independent council.
It has an estimated operating budget of A$132.4 million.

==History==

Prior to the 2008 amalgamation, the Rockhampton Region existed as four distinct local government areas:
Rockhampton was proclaimed as Queensland's fourth municipality (after Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba) on 13 December 1860 under the Municipalities Act 1858,22 Vic No. 13 (Imp), assented 27 October 1858 a piece of New South Wales legislation inherited by Queensland when it became a separate colony in 1859. It held its first election on 26 February 1861 and its inaugural meeting on 1 March 1861. The municipality had an area of [tpl]convert|13|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] located on the south bank of the Fitzroy River and had a population of about 600. In 1864, the council was divided into three wards—Fitzroy, Archer and Leichhardt. A proposal to greatly expand its area southwards to include Gracemere and Bouldercombe was rejected in part due to opposition from influential squatters in the area.[tpl]cite book|title=Rockhampton : a history of city and district|last=McDonald|first=Lorna|publisher=Rockhampton City Council|year=1995|isbn=0-9599897-3-0|pages=108–109[/tpl] It achieved a measure of autonomy in 1878 with the enactment of the Local Government Act.
On 11 November 1879, the Gogango Divisional Board was established as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. It covered an area of [tpl]convert|16239|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] surrounding the municipality—an area significantly greater than the modern Rockhampton Region covers. Capital and people came to the area in greater numbers after the discovery of gold in 1882 at Mount Morgan, about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Rockhampton. A Municipal Borough was proclaimed there on 22 May 1890.
A bridge was built spanning the Fitzroy River in 1882, and a year later in September 1883, the North Rockhampton Borough was proclaimed. North Rockhampton had a somewhat unhappy 36-year existence—its small population and location opposite the stronger and wealthier Rockhampton borough made comparisons inevitable and development of its own identity almost impossible. In 1919, it was described as a "small and straggling hamlet". Nevertheless, it was able to get a loan to construct a Municipal Chambers in 1885, which was completed in December of that year. The town clerk's arrest for embezzlement in 1890 marked the beginning of a period of difficulties characterised by disputes with the surrounding Gogango Divisional Board over road construction, and internal conflict between members of council, in which the Queensland Government was often requested to intervene. It did not have a reliable water supply and at the time of its amalgamation was still trying to raise funds for a dam.[tpl]cite QHR|16133|North Rockhampton Borough Chambers|accessdate=2008-04-20[/tpl]
The Fitzroy Division was proclaimed on 6 April 1899 out of the southern part of Gogango. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Rockhampton became one of three former municipalities, alongside Brisbane and Townsville, to become a City on 31 March 1903, while North Rockhampton and Mount Morgan became Towns and the divisions of Gogango and Fitzroy became Shires. Gogango was renamed Livingstone on 8 August 1903.
The State Government became concerned in 1918 after both the City of Rockhampton and Town of North Rockhampton councils proposed separate water infrastructure projects. On Saturday 25 January 1919, an amalgamation referendum held in North Rockhampton passed with 884 of the 1,029 votes cast in favour. On 15 March 1919, elections for the new four-ward council with 11 councillors took place, with their first meeting being held five days later. North Rockhampton's chambers, located in Stapleton Park, North Rockhampton, became a Main Roads office for about four decades, and eventually was restored and, since 1985, has been the home of Rockhampton and District Historical Society.
Wards were abolished at some point and were not reintroduced until 1982, when the council was restructured with 10 divisions each electing one councillor, plus a mayor elected by the entire City. On 1 July 1984, the City grew northwards by annexing Parkhurst, where its water treatment facility was being constructed, from the Shire of Livingstone. The council tried on several occasions to expand further into the Livingstone and Fitzroy areas, but a referendum in Fitzroy on 9 February 1991 was opposed by 83% of valid votes cast.
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released a report making recommendations for statewide reform of local government boundaries, and recommended that the four areas of Rockhampton, Fitzroy, Livingstone and Mount Morgan amalgamate, due to a community of interest centred upon Rockhampton. The very weak sustainability rating given to the Shire of Mount Morgan was of particular concern.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission|author=Queensland Local Government Reform Commission|volume=2|pages=273–278|isbn=1-921057-11-4|date=July 2007|url=http://www.dlgp.qld.gov.au/resources/map/reform/rockhampton-rationale.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] On 15 March 2008, the City and Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.
In 2012, a proposal was made to de-amalgamate the Shire of Livingstone from the Rockhampton Region.[tpl]cite web|title=Capricorn Coast Regional Council & Rockhampton Regional Council: a Partnership Approach for Sound Regional Governance: Unity and strength with community of interest representation: De-amalgamation Submission to the Queensland Boundary Commissioner August 2012|url=http://www.dlg.qld.gov.au/resources/report/local-government/bc/livingstone-proposal.pdf|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] On 9 March 2013, the citizens of the former Livingstone shire voted in a referendum to de-amalgamate. The Shire of Livingstone was re-established on 1 January 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=De-amalgamation|url=http://www.dsdip.qld.gov.au/bc/|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Local Government  (De-amalgamation  Implementation) Regulation  2013|url=https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/L/LocalGovDeamallmpR13.pdf|work=Local Government Act 2009|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]
