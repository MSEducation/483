James Burton Coffman (May 24, 1905 â€“ June 30, 2006) was "one of the most influential figures among Churches of Christ in the 20th century.""Burton Coffman dies at 101," accessed August 19, 2008 He was known, especially during the second half of the 20th century, throughout the Churches of Christ for his exhaustive writing and study of Old Testament and New Testament scriptures.

Most of his career defined him as a teacher and administrator in school systems, congregational contexts, and even as a military chaplain.

Throughout thirty years of congregational ministry, Coffman served and preached at the Central Church of Christ in Houston, Texas, and at the Manhattan Church of Christ in New York City, New York. He also served for a short time in the District of Columbia."Minister Burton Coffman dies at 101," accessed August 19, 2008. His contributions were considerable in every setting to which he devoted himself. He helped the Central Church of Christ build a facility on Montrose Boulevard. In New York, Coffman initiated The Manhattan Project, in which he helped to raise more than $1 million to build the first facility for the Churches of Christ in New York County on what happened to be the most expensive real estate in the world."Coffman still 'normal, booming self' at 100," accessed August 19, 2008. Coffman noted that "For 100 years, Churches of Christ in (New York City) have worshipped in converted residences, lodge halls, mortuaries, theaters and other make-shift facilities. A hundred years is long enough to prove that success cannot be attained by such means." Manhattan Church of Christ still stands and serves on the Upper East Side today.
Later serving as a chaplain in the United States Armed Forces, Coffman held many gospels meetings internationally. He also formed an initiative to increase the number of personnel serving as United States Air Force chaplains from the Churches of Christ. He is also known for conducting hundreds of gospel meetings throughout the United States.
