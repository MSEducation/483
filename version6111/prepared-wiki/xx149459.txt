6 April 2013

==Police Accusations==

The Indian Police had initially suspected that the blasts were masterminded by the banned SIMI and carried out by the LeT with substantial help from the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI. When the Mumbai Police Chief, AN Roy, made the above allegations, and reiterated that there was good evidence of the ISI's hand in it. However, he said that they would need more evidence to prove the fact in a court of law.
Police have said that majority of the Indian conspirators in the blasts have been arrested. 2 have escaped to Pakistan. Also, one Indian conspirator died in the blast, whose body had remained unidentified since the blasts. 
Police have also stated that out of the 11 Pakistanis involved, 2 were gunned down in an encounter in North Mumbai on 21 August. Police say they have evidence and locations of all the other 9, who they say are in Pakistan.

==Aftermaths==

Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan soured after the allegations, with Pakistan denying all the allegations as "baseless" and saying it "definitely" won't hand over any suspect to India. India's PM has also repeatedly said there is "concrete" evidence against Pakistan and it will be presented to them. Indian Home Ministry officials have also vociferously backed up that claim. Also, an Indo-Pak "joint anti-terror mechanism" had been signed between the Indian PM and Pakistani President in Cuba in September 2006, under which the two countries agreed to "mutually combat terrorism". The Indian PM has repeatedly said that Pakistan's response to the evidence presented by India will be a "litmus test to their commitment to the joint anti-terror mechanism and its efforts to combat terrorism." However, most Indian analysts have lambasted the joint-anti terror mechanism saying it is a "farce"
