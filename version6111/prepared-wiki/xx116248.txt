Glen Ridge is a New Jersey Transit station at the intersection of Bloomfield Avenue and Ridgewood Avenue in Glen Ridge, New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line.
The Glen Ridge, Bloomfield and Watsessing Avenue stations along the Montclair branch were all built in 1912 during a grade separation program by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad. The Glen Ridge station, like the Watsessing Avenue station, was set below street level.
This was the site of the train station scene in the 2003 film Mona Lisa Smile that starred Julia Roberts, and in the film Far From Heaven.
