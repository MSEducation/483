Salyut 2 (OPS-1) ([tpl]lang-ru|Салют-2[/tpl] meaning Salute 2) was a Soviet space station which was launched in 1973 as part of the Salyut programme. It was the first Almaz military space station to fly. Within two weeks of launch the station had lost attitude control and depressurised, leaving it unusable. Its orbit decayed and it re-entered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973, without any crews having visited it.

Salyut 2 was an Almaz military space station.[ref]

Soon after, Salyut 2 lost stability and began tumbling. In 1992, Mikhail Lisun, backup cosmonaut for the Soyuz 24 flight to Almaz station Salyut 5, attributed the loss of Salyut 2 to an electrical fire, followed by depressurization. Salyut 2 broke up on April 14, and all trackable pieces reentered by May 28, 1973. This was a huge discovery|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl][/ref] 
It was designated part of the Salyut programme in order to conceal the existence of the two separate space station programmes.[tpl]cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=OPS-1 (Salyut-2) space station|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_ops1.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl]
Salyut 2 was [tpl]convert|14.55|m[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] with a diameter of [tpl]convert|4.15|m[/tpl], and had an internal habitable volume of [tpl]convert|90|m3[/tpl]. At launch it had a mass of [tpl]convert|18950|kg[/tpl]. A single aft-mounted docking port was intended for use by Soyuz spacecraft carrying cosmonauts to work aboard the station. Two solar arrays mounted at the aft end of the station near the docking port provided power to the station, generating a total of 3,120 watts of electricity.[tpl]cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=Almaz space station technical overview - Transfer section|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_po.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=5 January 2011[/tpl] The station was equipped with 32 attitude control thrusters, as well as two RD-0225 engines, each capable of generating [tpl]convert|3.9|kN[/tpl] of thrust, for orbital manoeuvres.[tpl]cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=Almaz space station technical overview|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_ops.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=5 January 2011[/tpl]

==Launch==

Salyut 2 was launched from Site 81/23 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a three-stage Proton-K rocket, serial number 283-01.[tpl]cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=Proton-K|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/protonk.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2 January 2011|quote=1973 April 3...Launch Vehicle: Proton-K. LV Configuration: Proton-K 283-01...Salyut 2[/tpl] The launch took place at 09:00:00 UTC on 3 April 1973,[tpl]cite web|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|title=Launch Log|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl] and successfully placed Salyut 2 into low Earth orbit. Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 2 was assigned the International Designator 1973-017A, whilst NORAD gave it the Satellite Catalog Number 06398.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-017A|title=Salyut 2|publisher=United States National Space Data Center|date=8 October 2010|accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl] The third stage of the Proton-K rocket entered orbit along with Salyut 2. On 4 April, it was catalogued in a [tpl]convert|192|by|238|km|mi[/tpl] orbit, inclined at 51.4 degrees.[tpl]cite web|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|title=Satellite Catalog|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl]

==Failure==

Three days after the launch of Salyut 2, the Proton's spent third stage exploded. Thirteen days into its mission, Salyut 2 began to depressurise, and its attitude control system malfunctioned. An inquiry into the failure initially determined that a fuel line had burst, burning a hole in the station. It was later discovered that a piece of debris from the third stage had collided with the station, causing the damage.
Several pieces of debris separated from the space station at around the time of its failure, including both solar panels, which removed its ability to generate power. Three pieces of debris from the station were catalogued, and had decayed from orbit by 13 May. The remainder of the station reentered the atmosphere on May 28, 1973 over the Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=1973.04.03 - Salyut 2|url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/sal21518.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl]
