==Etymology==

According to Saudi writer Abdul Aziz Qassim, it was the Ottomans who "first labelled Abdul Wahhab's school of Islam in Saudi Arabia as Wahhabism". The British also adopted it and expanded its use in the Middle East. 
In the US the term "Wahhabi" was used in the 1950s to refer to "puritan Muslims", according to Life magazine.[tpl]cite news|title=The King of Arabia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MU4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=31 May 1943|journal=Life|pages=72|id=[tpl]ISSN|00243019[/tpl][/tpl]
Wahhabis do not like—or at least did not like—the term. Ibn Abd-Al-Wahab's was averse to the elevation of scholars and other individuals, including using a person's name to label an Islamic school.  
According to social scientist Quintan Wiktorowicz, "Wahhabi" has been used by its opponents "to denote foreign influence", particularly in countries where they are "a small minority of the Muslim community, but have made recent inroads in `converting` the local population to the movement ideology".Wiktorowicz, Quintan. "Anatomy of the Salafi Movement" in Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Vol. 29 (2006): p. 235, footnote.

===Naming controversy: Wahhabism and Salafism===

According to Robert Lacey "the Wahhabis have always disliked the name customarily given to them" and preferred to be called Muwahhidun. English translation of that term, "Unitarians," however causes confusion with the Christian denomination (Unitarian Universalism) and other terms have not not caught on. Like the Christian Quakers then, Wahhabis have "remained known by the name first assigned to them by their detractors."[tpl]cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=The Kingdom|year=1981|publisher=Harcourt Brace Javonoich|location=New York and London|pages=56[/tpl]
According to Saudi author Abdul Aziz Qassim, the name Wahhabis prefer is "the reform or Salafi movement of the Sheikh".There is no such thing as Wahabism, Saudi prince says| Wael Mahdi| The National| March 18, 2010   Wiktorowicz also urges use of the term Salafi, maintaining  one would be hard pressed to find individuals who refer to themselves as Wahhabis or organizations that use "Wahhabi" in their title, or refer to their ideology in this manner (unless they are speaking to a Western audience that is unfamiliar with Islamic terminology, and even then usage is limited and often appears as "Salafi/Wahhabi"). 
However, authors at Global Security and Library of Congress state the term is now commonplace and used even by Wahhabi scholars in the Najd, often called the "heartland" of Wahhabism.[tpl]cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce O.|title=The Arab Awakening: America and the Transformation of the Middle East|publisher=Brookings Institute Press|page=160|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2Bmejr8WaRkC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=najd+wahhabi+heartland&source=bl&ots=bwxLv8zabK&sig=tWoyTv17DLznQ7jE1STM0rstkaM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QEMrU9jyOcrlqgG_3YH4Bw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=najd%20wahhabi%20heartland&f=false|chapter=Saudi Arabia, Elephant in the Living Room[/tpl]
One American Scholar (Christopher M. Blanchard)"Christopher M. Blanchard, Analyst in Middle Eastern Affairs Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division" distinguishes between the two by using Wahhabism to refer to "a conservative Islamic creed centered in and emanating from Saudi Arabia," and Salafiyya to refer to "a more general puritanical Islamic movement that has developed independently at various times and in various places in the Islamic world."[tpl]cite web|last=Blanchard|first=Christopher M.|title=The Islamic Traditions of Wahhabism and Salafiyya|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21695.pdf|work=Updated January 24, 2008|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=12 March 2014[/tpl]

==Practices==

As a religious revivalist movement that works to bring Muslims back from what it believes are foreign accretions that have corrupted Islam,Lewis, Bernard,  The Middle East, p.333 and believes that Islam is a complete way of life and so has prescriptions for all aspects of life, Wahhabism is quite strict in what it considers Islamic behavior.
While other Muslims might urge abstinence from alcohol, modest dress, and salat prayer, for Wahhabis prayer "that is punctual, ritually correct, and communally performed not only is urged but publicly required of men." Not only is wine forbidden, but so are "all intoxicating drinks and other stimulants, including tobacco." Not only is modest dress prescribed, but the type of clothing that should be worn, especially by women (a black abaya, covering all but the eyes and hands) is specified.
Practices that have been forbidden by Wahhabi preachers include performing or listening to music, dancing, fortune telling, amulets, television programs (unless religious), smoking, playing backgammon, chess, or cards, drawing human or animal figures, acting in a play or writing fiction (both are considered forms of lying), dissecting cadavers (even in criminal investigations and for the purposes of medical research).(from The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists, by Khaled Abou El Fadl, Harper San Francisco, 2005 , p.160)  Common Muslim practices Wahhabis believe are contrary to Islam include listening to music in praise of Muhammad, praying to God while visiting tombs (including the tomb of Muhammad), celebrating mawlid (birthday of the Prophet)[tpl]cite book|last=Battram|first=Robert A.|title=Canada in Crisis (2): An Agenda for Survival of the Nation|publisher=Trafford|pages=415–416|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pBc9349sw4QC&pg=PA415&dq=%22canada+in+crisis%22+%22wahabbi+beliefs%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mrkgU6fwCZChqAGopYDYDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22canada%20in%20crisis%22%20%22wahabbi%20beliefs%22&f=false[/tpl] building of minarets or use of  ornamentation on or in mosques.[tpl]cite web|last=Sharp|first=Arthur G.|title=What’s a Wahhabi?|url=http://www.netplaces.com/middle-east-guide/saudi-arabia-crossroads-of-islam/whats-a-wahhabi.htm|publisher=net places|accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]  The driving of motor vehicles by women is allowed in every country but Wahhabi-dominated Saudi Arabia,[tpl]cite book|last=Anderson|first=Shelly|title=Falling Off the Edge of the World|year=2013|publisher=Lulu|page=137|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cpOvFaOkVUkC&pg=PA137&dq=saudi+%22only+country%22+women+driving&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jQ8hU5_TA8SRqQHW4YHYDw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=saudi%20%22only%20country%22%20women%20driving&f=false[/tpl] the famously strict Taliban practiced dream interpretation, discouraged by Wahhabis.[tpl]cite book|last=Roy|first=Olivier|title=Globalized Islam: The Search for a New Ummah|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=239|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b9eFGcsWnwEC&pg=PA239&dq=roy+olivier+salafi+wahhabi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0gwhU-yEHMidqgHrv4HwAg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=roy%20olivier%20salafi%20wahhabi&f=false|quote=The Taliban, despite their similarity to Wahhabis, never destroyed the graves of pirs (holy men) and emphasised dreams as a means of revelation, which is not a Wahhabi trait.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=|first=The General Mufty of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|title=Interpretation of dreams and being wary of expansion in this matter|url=http://www.alifta.com/Search/ResultDetails.aspx?languagename=en&lang=en&view=result&fatwaNum=&FatwaNumID=&ID=72&searchScope=15&SearchScopeLevels1=&SearchScopeLevels2=&highLight=1&SearchType=exact&SearchMoesar=false&bookID=&LeftVal=0&RightVal=0&simple=&SearchCriteria=allwords&PagePath=&siteSection=1&searchkeyword=100114101097109032105110116101114112114101116097116105111110#firstKeyWordFound|publisher=Portal of the General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Ifta|accessdate=23 March 2014|author=Shaykh `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al Al-Shaykh|quote=Fatwa ... Moreover, the interpretation of dreams is not part of the general knowledge that, if spread among Muslims, benefits them through providing a better understanding of correct beliefs and actions. Rather, it is as the Prophet (peace be upon him) described it, i.e. Ru'yas are glad tidings. In this regard, some of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) stated: "Ru'ya pleases and never harms a believer." Having said this, the field of interpreting dreams has expanded to the extent that there are now special programs on satellite channels, phone lines that reply to inquiries from the public, columns in newspapers and magazines, and places in clubs that aim to attract people and unjustly consume their wealth. All these practices are a great evil and trifle with this type of knowledge, which is part of prophethood.[/tpl]
Following the preaching and practice of Abdul Wahhab that coercion should be used to enforce following of sharia, an official committee has been empowered to "Command the Good and Forbid the Evil" (the so-called "religious police") [tpl]cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=158|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U1l9acGQJQkC&pg=PA157&dq=gilles+kepel+salafi+wahhabi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QwMhU-2xBsfcqQGosICoAg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gilles%20kepel%20salafi%20wahhabi&f=false|quote=Ibn Taymiyya and Abdul Wahhab counseled the strictest possible application of sharia in the most minuscule aspects of daily life and the use of coercion on subjects who did not conform to dogma.

Wahhabism puts great store in behavior and appearance, robes for men long enough to cover the ankle are considered an example of unseemly pride, although not forbidden.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Like many conservative Muslims, Wahhabis believe that the different physiological structures and biological functions of the different genders mean that each sex is assigned a different role to play in the family. As a consequence Wahhabis believe Islam forbids wives' traveling or working outside the home at any particular job without their husband's permission—permission which may be revoked at any time.
