==History==

===1865 to 1967===

The predecessors of the modern Nokia were the Nokia Company (Nokia Aktiebolag), Finnish Rubber Works Ltd (Suomen Gummitehdas Oy) and Finnish Cable Works Ltd (Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century|title=Nokia – Nokia's first century – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Eduard Polón (1861-1930), Nokia's founder, was a Finnish business leader.Nokia Corporation 's official history, pages 12–13, Martin Häikiö, Edita, 2001 He was founder, CEO, Chairman of the Board and the largest shareholder of the Finnish Gummitehdas ("Rubberfactory"). He led the development of a new rubber industry in Finland. His group of companies built a modern wood and cable industry in Finland. Polón decided to use the name "Nokia", the town where his factories were based, as a brand name for his products to differentiate his products from Russian competitors.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Although these three companies—Suomen Gummitehdas, Suomen Kaapelitehdas and Nokia Ab—were not formally merged, as the law did not allow it at the time, Polón continued to create a successful conglomerate that later became Nokia PLC. Polòn was the chairman, managing director, and the largest owner of the group for 30 years.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Nokia Ab's history started in 1865 when mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a ground wood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland (part of the Russian Empire).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century/the-birth-of-nokia|title=Nokia – The birth of Nokia – Nokia's first century – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, fifteen kilometers (nine miles) west of Tampere, by the Nokianvirta river, which had better hydropower resources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=4296|title=Idestam, Fredrik (1838–1916)|last=Helen|first=Tapio|publisher=Biographical Centre of the Finnish Literature Society|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl] In 1871, Idestam, with the help of close friend and statesman Leo Mechelin, renamed and transformed his firm into a share company, thereby founding Nokia Ab. The company's name came from the Nokianvirta river, nearby which Polón's factories were located a few years later.http://company.nokia.com/en/about-us/our-company/our-storyhttps://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081223041513AAkg86m
Towards the end of the 19th century, Mechelin sought to expand into the electricity business, but his aspiration was initially thwarted by Idestam's opposition. However, Idestam's retirement in 1896 allowed Mechelin to become the company's chairman (from 1898 until 1914), and he subsequently convinced shareholders. In 1902, Nokia added electricity generation to its business activities.

====Industrial conglomerate====

In 1898, Polón founded Finnish Rubber Works, manufacturer of galoshes and other rubber products, which later became Nokia's rubber business. At the beginning of the 20th century, Finnish Rubber Works established its factories near the town of Nokia and began using its name as its product brand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokianfootwear.fi/eng/our_story/|title=Nokian Footwear: History|publisher=Nokian Footwear|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In 1912, Arvid Wickström founded Finnish Cable Works, producer of telephone, telegraph and electrical cables and the foundation of Nokia's cable and electronics businesses. At the end of the 1910s, shortly after World War I, the Company was nearing bankruptcy.[tpl]cite book|last=Palo-oja|first=Ritva|coauthors=Willberg, Leena|title=Kumi – Kumin ja Suomen kumiteollisuuden historia|publisher=Tampere Museums|location=Tampere, Finland|year=1998|pages=43–53|isbn=9789516090651|language=Finnish[/tpl] To ensure the continuation of electricity supply from Nokia's generators, Finnish Rubber Works acquired the business of the insolvent company. In 1922, Finnish Rubber Works acquired Finnish Cable Works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kaapelitehdas.fi/php/image.php?id=4856|title=Finnish Cable Factory – Brief History|format=PDF|publisher=Kaapelitehdas.fi|accessdate=16 March 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070705233815/http://www.kaapelitehdas.fi/php/image.php?id=4856 |archivedate = 5 July 2007[/tpl] In 1937, Verner Weckman, a wrestler and Finland's first Olympic Gold medalist, became president of Finnish Cable Works, after 16 years as its technical director.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century/verner-weckman|title=Nokia – Verner Weckman – Nokia's first century – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=20 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] After World War II, Finnish Cable Works supplied cables to the Soviet Union as part of war reparations. This gave the company a foothold for later trade.
The three companies, jointly owned since 1922, were merged to form a new industrial conglomerate, Nokia Corporation, in 1967.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century/the-merger|title=Nokia – The merger – Nokia's first century – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The new company was involved in many industries, producing at various times paper products, car and bicycle tires, footwear (including rubber boots), communications cables, televisions and other consumer electronics, personal computers, electricity generation machinery, robotics, capacitors, military communications and equipment (such as the SANLA M/90 device and the M61 gas mask for the Finnish Army), plastics, aluminum and chemicals. Each business unit had its own director who reported to the first Nokia Corporation President, Björn Westerlund. As the president of the Finnish Cable Works, he had been responsible for setting up the company's first electronics department in 1960, sowing the seeds of Nokia's future in telecommunications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/nokias-first-century/first-electronic-dept|title=Nokia – First electronic dept – Nokia's first century – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The company decided to exit consumer electronics in the 1990s and focused solely on the fastest growing segments in telecommunications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/mobile-revolution/jorma-ollila|title=Nokia – Jorma Ollila – Mobile revolution – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Nokian Tyres, manufacturer of tires, split from Nokia Corporation in 1988[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokiantyres.com/history-in-brief|title=History in brief|publisher=Nokian Tyres|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl] and two years later Nokian Footwear, manufacturer of rubber boots, was founded. In 1989, Nokia also sold the original paper business; currently this company (Nokian Paperi) is owned by SCA. During the rest of the 1990s, Nokia divested itself of all other businesses.

===1967 to 2000===

The electronics section of the cable division was founded in 1960 and the production of its first electronic devices began in 1962: a pulse analyzer designed for use in nuclear power plants. In the 1967 fusion, that section was separated into its own division, and began manufacturing telecommunications equipment. A key CEO and subsequent chairman of the board was vuorineuvos Björn "Nalle" Westerlund (1912–2009), who founded the electronics department and let it run at a loss for 15 years. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Westerlund encouraged researchers to work on their own projects, which one top executive directly linked to the company's later expertise in mobile communications technologies.[tpl]cite book|last=Cord|first=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=April 2014|publisher=Schildts & Söderströms|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|page=202[/tpl] 

====Networking equipment====

In the 1970s, Nokia became more involved in the telecommunications industry by developing the Nokia DX 200, a digital switch for telephone exchanges. The DX 200 became the workhorse of the network equipment division. Its architecture enabled it to be developed into various switching products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/kerola/tkhist/k2000/alustukset/puhelinkeskukset/|title=Automaattisten puhelinkeskusten historia|last=Kaituri|first=Tommi|year=2000|language=Finnish|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl] In 1984, development of a version of the exchange for the Nordic Mobile Telephony network was started.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etla.fi/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dp855.pdf|title=Overcoming a Technological Discontinuity – The Case of the Finnish Telecom Industry and the GSM|last=Palmberg|first=Christopher|coauthors=Martikainen, Olli|date=23 May 2003|format=PDF|publisher=The Research Institute of the Finnish Economy|accessdate=14 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
For a while in the 1970s, Nokia's network equipment production was separated into Telefenno, a company jointly owned by the parent corporation and by a company owned by the Finnish state. In 1987, the state sold its shares to Nokia and in 1992 the name was changed to Nokia Telecommunications.[tpl]cite web|title=Nokia : The Journey of a Company from Paper Pulp to Mobile Phones|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/nokia-the-journey-of-a-company-from-paper-pulp-to-mobile-phones/|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]
In the 1970s and 1980s, Nokia developed the Sanomalaitejärjestelmä ("Message device system"), a digital, portable and encrypted text-based communications device for the Finnish Defence Forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.fi/maavoimat/kalustoesittely/index.dsp?level=81|title=Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely – Sanomalaitejärjestelmä|date=15 June 2005|publisher=The Finnish Defence Forces|language=Finnish|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl] The current main unit used by the Defence Forces is the Sanomalaite M/90 (SANLA M/90).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.fi/maavoimat/kalustoesittely/00030_en.dsp|title=The Finnish Defence Forces: Presentation of equipment: Message device|publisher=The Finnish Defence Forces|accessdate=14 June 2009[/tpl]
In 1998, Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, bundling Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.

====First mobile phones====

The technologies that preceded modern cellular mobile telephony systems were the various "0G" pre-cellular mobile radio telephony standards. Nokia had been producing commercial and some military mobile radio communications technology since the 1960s, although this part of the company was sold some time before the later company rationalization. Since 1964, Nokia had developed VHF radio simultaneously with Salora Oy. In 1966, Nokia and Salora started developing the ARP standard (which stands for Autoradiopuhelin, or car radio phone in English), a car-based mobile radio telephony system and the first commercially operated public mobile phone network in Finland. It went online in 1971 and offered 100% coverage in 1978.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.it.lut.fi/kurssit/06-07/Ti5312600/luentokalvot/luento07-08.pdf|title=Siirtyvä tietoliikenne, luennot 7–8: Matkapuhelinverkot|last=Juutilainen|first=Matti|format=PDF|publisher=Lappeenranta University of Technology|language=Finnish|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl]
In 1979, the merger of Nokia and Salora resulted in the establishment of Mobira Oy. Mobira began developing mobile phones for the NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephony) network standard, the first-generation, Finaland's first fully automatic cellular phone system that went online in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/the-move-to-mobile/mobile-era-begins|title=Nokia – Mobile era begins – The move to mobile – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=20 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In 1982, Mobira introduced its first car phone, the Mobira Senator for NMT-450 networks.
Nokia bought Salora Oy in 1984 and changed the company's telecommunications branch name to Nokia-Mobira Oy. The Mobira Talkman, launched in 1984, was one of the world's first transportable phones. In 1987, Nokia introduced one of the world's first handheld phones, the Mobira Cityman 900 for NMT-900 networks (which, compared to NMT-450, offered a better signal, yet a shorter roam). While the Mobira Senator of 1982 had weighed [tpl]convert|9.8|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] and the Talkman just under [tpl]convert|5|kg|abbr=on[/tpl], the Mobira Cityman weighed only [tpl]convert|800|g|abbr=on[/tpl] with the battery and had a price tag of 24,000 Finnish marks (approximately €4,560).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/the-move-to-mobile/mobira-cityman|title=Nokia – Mobira Cityman – The move to mobile – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Despite the high price, the first phones were almost snatched from the sales assistants' hands. Initially, the mobile phone was a "yuppie" product and a status symbol.
Nokia's mobile phones got a publicity boost in 1987, when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was pictured using a Mobira Cityman to call from Helsinki to his communications minister in Moscow. This led to the phone's nickname of the "Gorba".
In 1988, Jorma Nieminen, resigning from the post of CEO of the mobile phone unit, along with two other employees from the unit, started a notable mobile phone company of their own, Benefon Oy (since renamed to GeoSentric).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.talouselama.fi/sijoittaminen/article165594.ece|title=Tähdet syöksyvät, Benefon|last=Karttunen|first=Anu|date=2 May 2003|work=Talouselämä|publisher=Talentum Oyj|language=Finnish|accessdate=28 July 2009[/tpl] One year later, Nokia-Mobira Oy became Nokia Mobile Phones.

====Involvement in GSM====

Nokia was a key developer of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications),[tpl]cite press release|url=http://press.nokia.com/1997/10/17/nokia%C2%B4s-pioneering-gsm-research-and-development-to-be-awarded-by-eduard-rhein-foundation|title=Nokia's Pioneering GSM Research and Development to be Awarded by Eduard Rhein Foundation|date=17 October 1997|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl] the second-generation mobile technology that could carry data as well as voice traffic. NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephony), the world's first mobile telephony standard to allow international roaming, provided expertise for Nokia in developing GSM, which was adopted in 1987 as the new European standard for digital mobile technology.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/2070.htm|title=Global Mobile Communication is 20 years old|date=6 September 2007|publisher=GSM Association|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/leader/0,1000002982,39289154,00.htm|title=Happy 20th birthday, GSM|date=7 September 2007|work=ZDNet.co.uk|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl]
Nokia delivered its first GSM network to Finnish operator Radiolinja in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/the-move-to-mobile/first-gsm-call|title=Nokia – First GSM call – The move to mobile – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=20 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The world's first commercial GSM call was made on 1 July 1991 in Helsinki, over a Nokia-supplied network, by then-Prime Minister of Finland Harri Holkeri, using a prototype Nokia GSM phone. In 1992, the first GSM phone, the Nokia 1011, was launched.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/11/09/ft_nokia_1011/|title=15 years ago: the first mass-produced GSM phone|last=Smith|first=Tony|date=9 November 2007|work=Register Hardware|publisher=Situation Publishing Ltd|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl] The model number refers to its launch date, 10 November. The Nokia 1011 did not yet employ Nokia's characteristic ringtone, the Nokia tune, which was introduced as a ringtone in 1994 with the Nokia 2100 series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/company/story-of-nokia/mobile-revolution/nokia-tune|title=Nokia – Nokia Tune – Mobile revolution – Story of Nokia|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
GSM's high-quality voice calls, easy international roaming and support for new services like text messaging (Short Message Service) laid the foundations for a worldwide boom in mobile phone use. GSM came to dominate mobile telephony in the 1990s, by mid-2008 accounting for about three billion subscribers, with more than 700 mobile operators across 218 countries and territories. Connections were growing at the rate of 15 per second, or 1.3 million per day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/2008/1108.htm|title=3 Billion GSM Connections on the Mobile Planet – Reports The GSMA|date=16 April 2008|publisher=GSM Association|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

====Personal computers and IT equipment====

In the 1980s, Nokia's computer division Nokia Data produced a series of personal computers called MikroMikko.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=630|title=Nokia MikroMikko 1|publisher=Old-Computers.com|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl] MikroMikko was Nokia Data's attempt to enter the business computer market. The first model in the line, MikroMikko 1, was released on 29 September 1981,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fujitsuservices.fi/historia/net/1980.htm|title=Net – Fujitsun asiakaslehti, Net-lehden historia: 1980-luku|publisher=Fujitsu Services Oy, Finland|language=Finnish|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl] around the same time as the first IBM PC. However, the personal computer division was sold to the British ICL (International Computers Limited) in 1991, which later became part of Fujitsu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fujitsu.com/fi/about/history/1991/|title=Historia: 1991–1999|publisher=Fujitsu Services Oy, Finland|language=Finnish|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] MikroMikko remained a trademark of ICL and later Fujitsu. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.
Fujitsu later transferred its personal computer operations to Fujitsu Siemens Computers, which shut down its only factory in Espoo, Finland (in the Kilo district, where computers had been produced since the 1960s) at the end of March 2000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2000/02/feature/fi0002136f.html|title=Closure of Fujitsu Siemens plant – a repeat of Renault Vilvoorde?|last=Hietanen|first=Juha|date=28 February 2000|publisher=EIRO, European Industrial Relations Observatory on-line|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2000/02/word/fi0002136ffi.doc|title=Fujitsu Siemens tehdas suljetaan – toistuiko Renault Vilvoord?|last=Hietanen|first=Juha|date=28 February 2000|format=DOC|publisher=EIRO, European Industrial Relations Observatory on-line|language=Finnish|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl] thus ending large-scale PC manufacturing in the country.
Nokia produced high quality CRT and early TFT LCD displays for PC and larger systems applications. The Nokia Display Products' branded business was sold to ViewSonic in 2000.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://press.nokia.com/PR/200001/775025_5.html|title=ViewSonic Corporation Acquires Nokia Display Products' Branded Business|date=17 January 2000|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=22 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] In addition to personal computers and displays, Nokia used to manufacture DSL modems and digital set-top boxes.
Nokia re-entered the PC market in August 2009 with the introduction of the Nokia Booklet 3G mini laptop.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://press.nokia.com/2009/08/24/nokia-booklet-3g-brings-all-day-mobility-to-the-pc-world/|title=Nokia Booklet 3G brings all day mobility to the PC world|date=24 August 2009|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]

====Challenges of growth====

In the 1980s under CEO Kari Kairamo, Nokia expanded into new fields, mostly by acquisitions. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the corporation ran into serious financial problems, partly due to heavy losses in its television manufacturing division.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/arkisto/2000/09/27/kari-kairamon-nousu-ja-tuho/200026243/12|title=Kari Kairamon nousu ja tuho|last=Pietilä|first=Antti-Pekka|date=27 September 2000|work=Taloussanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl] Kairamo committed suicide in 1988. After Kairamo's death, Simo Vuorilehto became Nokia's chairman and CEO. In 1990–1993, Finland underwent a severe recession,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/PRESS/EP29%20finland.htm|title=Finland: How bad policies turned bad luck into a recession|publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research|accessdate=5 April 2009[/tpl] which also struck Nokia. Under Vuorilehto's management, Nokia was severely overhauled. The company responded by streamlining its telecommunications divisions and by divesting itself of the television and PC divisions.[tpl]cite book|last=Häikiö|first=Martti|coauthors=translated by Hackston, David|title=Nokia Oyj:n historia 1–3 (A history of Nokia plc 1–3)|publisher=Edita|location=Helsinki|year=2001|isbn=951-37-3467-6|url=http://www.finlit.fi/booksfromfinland/bff/102/nokia.htm|accessdate=21 March 2008|language=Finnish[/tpl]
Probably the most important strategic change in Nokia's history was made in 1992, however, when the new CEO Jorma Ollila made a crucial strategic decision to concentrate solely on telecommunications. Thus, during the rest of the 1990s, the rubber, cable and consumer electronics divisions were gradually sold as Nokia continued to divest itself of all of its non-telecommunications businesses.
As late as 1991, more than a quarter of Nokia's turnover came from sales in Finland.

====Loss of smartphone marketshare====

Originally launched in 2007, Apple's iPhone continued to be outsold and unfavoured by Nokia smartphones, most notably the Nokia N95 for some time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/03/the-better-iphone-nokia-n95/ |title=The better iPhone: Nokia N95? |publisher=Scobleizer |date=3 June 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] Symbian had a dominating 62.5% market share as of Q4 2007 – ahead of Microsoft's Windows Mobile (11.9%) and RIM (10.9%). However, with the launch of the iPhone 3G in 2008, Apple's year-over-year market share doubled by the end of that year and iPhone OS (now known as iOS) operating system market share pulled ahead of Windows Mobile. Although in Q4 2008, Nokia retained a 40.8% share, it saw a decline of over 10% from Q4 2007, replaced by Apple's increasing share.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/910112 |title=Gartner Says Worldwide Smartphone Sales Reached Its Lowest Growth Rate With 3.7 Per Cent Increase in Fourth Quarter of 2008 |publisher=Gartner |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] The Nokia N96, released in late 2008, proved to be much less successful, although the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic was mainly considered to be the iPhone 3G's main rival.

In early 2009, the Nokia N97 was released, a touchscreen device with a landscape QWERTY slider that focused on social networking. It was a commercial success despite its mainly mixed reception. The N97's closest competitor was the iPhone 3GS.

In May 2013 Nokia released the Asha platform for its low-end borderline smartphone devices.

In the same month, Nokia announced its partnership with the world's largest cellular operator China Mobile to offer Nokia's new Windows-based phone, the Lumia 920, as Lumia 920T, an exclusive Chinese variant. The partnership was a bid by Nokia to connect with China Mobile's 700 million-person customer base.[tpl]cite web|last=Einhorn |first=Bruce |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-07/nokia-deal-just-the-beginning-for-china-mobile |title=Nokia Deal Is Just the Beginning for China Mobile |publisher=Businessweek |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl]
Following the second quarter of 2013, Nokia made an operating loss of €115m (£98.8m), with revenues falling 24% to €5.7bn, despite sales figures for the Lumia exceeding those of BlackBerry's handsets during the same period. Over the nine-quarters prior to the second quarter of 2013, Nokia sustained €4.1 billion worth of operating losses. The company experienced particular problems in both China and the U.S.; in the former, Nokia's handset revenues are the lowest since 2002, while in the U.S., Francisco Jeronimo, analyst for research company IDC, stated: "Nokia continues to show no signs of recovery in the US market.

====Acquisition of Nokia Devices and Services business by Microsoft====

On 2 September 2013, Microsoft announced that it would acquire Nokia's mobile device business in a deal worth €3.79bn, along with another €1.65bn to license Nokia's portfolio of patents for 10 years; a deal totaling at over €5.4bn. Steve Ballmer considered the purchase to be a "bold step into the future" for both companies, primarily as a result of its recent collaboration.
Following the sale, Nokia will focus on three core business units; its Here mapping service (which Microsoft will license for four years under the deal), its infrastructure division Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), and on developing and licensing its "advanced technologies". Pending regulatory approval, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2014. As part of the deal, a number of Nokia executives will join Microsoft.

Microsoft will acquire rights to the Asha and Lumia brands as part of the deal, and will have a limited license to use the Nokia name on Series 30 and Series 40 devices for ten years.

==Controversies==

===NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran===

In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8112550.stm|title=Hi-tech helps Iranian monitoring|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=22 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and even change the content of everything from "e-mails and Internet phone calls to images and messages on social-networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter". The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes,". During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, and experts suspected this was due to the use of the interception technology.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124562668777335653.html#mod|title=Iran's Web Spying Aided By Western Technology|last=Rhoads|first=Christopher|coauthors=Chao, Loretta|date=22 June 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|pages=A1|accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]
The joint venture company, Nokia Siemens Networks, asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a 'lawful intercept capability' "solely for monitoring of local voice calls". "Nokia Siemens Networks has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship or Internet filtering capability to Iran," it said.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/global/Press/Press+releases/news-archive/Provision+of+Lawful+Intercept+capability+in+Iran.htm|title=Provision of Lawful Intercept capability in Iran|date=22 June 2009|publisher=Nokia Siemens Networks|accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted at those companies deemed to be collaborating with the Islamic regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/14/nokia-boycott-iran-election-protests|title=Iranian consumers boycott Nokia for 'collaboration'|last=Kamali Dehghan|first=Saeed|date=14 July 2009|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=27 July 2009 | location=London[/tpl]

===Lex Nokia===

In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/06/finland_nokia_snooping/|title='Lex Nokia' company snoop law passes in Finland|last=Ozimek|first=John|date=6 March 2009|work=The Register|accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] Contrary to rumors, Nokia denied that the company would have considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/35783.php|title=Nokia Denies Threat to Leave Finland|date=1 February 2009|work=cellular-news|accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. Until February 2013, no company had used its provisions. In 25 February the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently gave the required notice.Lex Nokian käytöstä ilmoitettiin ensimmäistä kertaa - Lex Nokia - Talous - Helsingin Sanomat

===Nokia–Apple patent dispute===

In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60H05R20100118?type=marketsNews|title=SCENARIOS-What lies ahead in Nokia vs Apple legal battle|last=Virki|first=Tarmo|date=18 January 2010|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 January 2010[/tpl] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in an ugly spat between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players, and computers."[tpl]cite news|url=http://pda-phone-reviews.in/latest-news/nokias-new-patent-suit-against-apple/|title=The war of the Smartphones: Nokia's new patent suit against Apple|date=6 January 2010|work=Snartphone Reviews|accessdate=25 January 2010[/tpl] Nokia went on to ask the court to bar all U.S. imports of the Apple products including the iPhone, Mac and the iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal-tech/smart-phones/230600172|title=Nokia's Patent Settlement With Apple Won't Help Much|date=14 June 2011|work=|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/14/apple-nokia-patent-lawsuit-settlement_n_876499.html|title=Apple Settles With Nokia in Patent Lawsuit|date=14 June 2011|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 June 2011|first=Catharine|last=Smith[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-14/nokia-apple-payments-to-nokia-settle-all-litigation.html|title=Nokia Wins Apple Patent-License Deal Cash, Settles Lawsuits|date=14 June 2011|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=29 June 2011|first1=Diana|last1=ben-Aaron|first2=Kati|last2=Pohjanpalo[/tpl]
