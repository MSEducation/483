The Kuiper belt [tpl]IPAc-en|'|k|ai|p|ər[/tpl], sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt (after the astronomers Kenneth Edgeworth and Gerard Kuiper), is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.[tpl]cite journal | author=Alan Stern | title=Collisional Erosion in the Primordial Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt and the Generation of the 30–50 AU Kuiper Gap | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=490 | issue=2 | pages=879–882 | year=1997 | doi=10.1086/304912 | last2=Colwell | first2=Joshua E. | bibcode=1997ApJ...490..879S[/tpl] It is similar to the asteroid belt, but it is far larger—20 times as wide and 20 to 200 times as massive.[tpl]cite web|title=The Solar System Beyond The Planets|author=Audrey Delsanti and David Jewitt|work=Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii|url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070925203400/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf |archivedate = September 25, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| authorlink= Georgij A.

Although some asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed "ices"), such as methane, ammonia and water. The classical belt is home to at least three dwarf planets:  Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, are also believed to have originated in the region.Johnson, Torrence V.; and Lunine, Jonathan I.; Saturn's moon Phoebe as a captured body from the outer Solar System, Nature, Vol. 435, pp. 69–71[tpl]cite web|title=Neptune's capture of its moon Triton in a binary-planet gravitational encounter|author=Craig B.

Since the belt was discovered in 1992, the number of known Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has increased to over a thousand, and more than 100,000 KBOs over [tpl]convert|100|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter are believed to exist.NEW HORIZONS The PI's Perspective The Kuiper belt was initially thought to be the main repository for periodic comets, those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. However, studies since the mid-1990s have shown that the classical belt is dynamically stable, and that comets' true place of origin is the scattered disc, a dynamically active zone created by the outward motion of Neptune 4.5 billion years ago;[ref]
