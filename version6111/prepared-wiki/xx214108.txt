Dubiel pitched for 14 seasons (1941–1954) in professional ball and spent five full seasons and part of two others in the Majors between 1944 and 1952.  His best season was his rookie [tpl]by|1944[/tpl] campaign for Yankees. He spilt 26 decisions, but logged 19 complete games, three shutouts and 232 innings pitched, with an earned run average of 3.38.  Sent to the minors for the first two seasons immediately after the end of World War II, he resurfaced in the National League in [tpl]by|1948[/tpl] as a "swing man" — working as a starting pitcher and a reliever — for the Phillies. After the 1948 campaign, Dubiel was traded to the Cubs in a four-player swap that brought first baseman Eddie Waitkus to the Phils. Although Waitkus would miss much of the [tpl]by|1949[/tpl] season after being shot by an obsessed fan, he would play a key role on the 1950 "Whiz Kids".
Dubiel pitched in 187 MLB games, 97 as a starter, and allowed 854 hits and 349 bases on balls in 879⅓ innings pitched. He struck out 289 and recorded 11 career saves.
