XDM (in full, the X Window Display Manager) is the default display manager for the X Window System. It is a bare-bones X display manager. It was introduced with X11 Release 3 in October 1988, to support the standalone X terminals that were just coming onto the market. It was written by Keith Packard.
Because of XDM's minimalism, most desktop environments tend to use later, more sophisticated display managers.
