[[Polyploid]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics, Speciation

Polyploid cells and organisms are those containing more than two paired (homologous) sets of chromosomes. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes—one set inherited from each parent. However, polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants. In addition, polyploidy also occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid, such as human muscle tissues.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMcibr0903347 |title=Cardiomyocyte Renewal |year=2009 |last1=Parmacek |first1=Michael S. |last2=Epstein |first2=Jonathan A. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |pages=86–8 |pmid=19571289 |issue=1[/tpl] This is known as endopolyploidy. Prokaryotes are haploid organisms, with only a single chromosome in each cell. Most eukaryotes have diploid cells, but produce haploid gametes by meiosis. In plants and multicellular algae the gametophyte generation is haploid, and produces gametes by mitosis. A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes, and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. Male bees and other Hymenoptera, for example, are monoploid.
Polyploidy refers to a numerical change in a whole set of chromosomes. Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or overrepresented are said to be aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning "not", "good", and "fold"). Therefore the distinction between aneuploidy and polyploidy is that aneuploidy refers to a numerical change in part of the chromosome set, whereas polyploidy refers to a numerical change in the whole set of chromosomes.[tpl]cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Anthony J.

Polyploidy may occur due to abnormal cell division, either during mitosis, or commonly during metaphase I in meiosis.
Polyploidy occurs in some animals, such as goldfish,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00293307 |title=Diploid-tetraploid relationship among old-world members of the fish family Cyprinidae |year=1967 |last1=Ohno |first1=Susumu |last2=Muramoto |first2=Junichi |last3=Christian |first3=Lawrence |last4=Atkin |first4=Niels B. |journal=Chromosoma |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9[/tpl] salmon, and salamanders, but is especially common among ferns and flowering plants (see Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), including both wild and cultivated species. Wheat, for example, after millennia of hybridization and modification by humans, has strains that are diploid (two sets of chromosomes), tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes) with the common name of durum or macaroni wheat, and hexaploid (six sets of chromosomes) with the common name of bread wheat. Many agriculturally important plants of the genus Brassica are also tetraploids. Polyploidization is a mechanism of sympatric speciation because polyploids are usually unable to interbreed with their diploid ancestors.
Polyploidy can be induced in plants and cell cultures by some chemicals: the best known is colchicine, which can result in chromosome doubling, though its use may have other less obvious consequences as well. Oryzalin also will double the existing chromosome content.

==Polyploid types==

Polyploid types are labeled according to the number of chromosome sets in the nucleus:

==Polyploidy in animals==

Examples in animals are more common in non-vertebrates[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.34.1.401 |title=Polyploidincidence Andevolution |year=2000 |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P |last2=Whitton |first2=Jeannette |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=34 |pages=401–437 |pmid=11092833[/tpl] such as flatworms, leeches, and brine shrimp. Within vertebrates, examples of stable polyploidy include the salmonids and many cyprinids (i.e. carp).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:RFBF.0000033049.00668.fe |title=Occurrence of polyploidy in the fishes |year=2003 |last1=Leggatt |first1=Rosalind A. |last2=Iwama |first2=George K. |journal=Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=237–46[/tpl] Some fish have as many as 400 chromosomes. Polyploidy also occurs commonly in amphibians; for example the biomedically-important Xenopus genus contains many different species with as many as 12 sets of chromosomes (dodecaploid).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.4.476 |title=Xenopus laevis as a Model Organism |year=1993 |last1=Cannatella |first1=David C. |last2=De Sa |first2=Rafael O. |journal=Society of Systematic Biologists |volume=42 |issue=4|pages=476–507[/tpl] Polyploid lizards are also quite common, but are sterile and must reproduce by parthenogenesis.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Polyploid mole salamanders (mostly triploids) are all female and reproduce by kleptogenesis,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1139/g06-152 |title=Unisexual salamanders (genus Ambystoma) present a new reproductive mode for eukaryotes |year=2007 |last1=Bonen |first1=L. |last2=Bi |first2=James P. |last3=Fu |first3=Ke |last4=Noble |first4=Jinzong |last5=Niedzwiecki |first5=Daniel W.A. |last6=Niedzwiecki |first6=John |journal=Genome |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=119–36 |pmid=17546077[/tpl] "stealing" spermatophores from diploid males of related species to trigger egg development but not incorporating the males' DNA into the offspring. While mammalian liver cells are polyploid, rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death.
An octodontid rodent of Argentina's harsh desert regions, known as the Plains Viscacha-Rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has been reported as an exception to this 'rule'.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.02.010 |title=Molecular cytogenetics and allotetraploidy in the red vizcacha rat, Tympanoctomys barrerae (Rodentia, Octodontidae) |year=2006 |last1=Gallardo |first1=M.H. |last2=González |first2=C.A. |last3=Cebrián |first3=I. |journal=Genomics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=214–21 |pmid=16580173[/tpl] However, careful analysis using chromosome paints shows that there are only two copies of each chromosome in T. barrerae, not the four expected if it were truly a tetraploid.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.12.004 |title=Molecular cytogenetics discards polyploidy in mammals |year=2005 |last1=Svartman |first1=Marta |last2=Stone |first2=Gary |last3=Stanyon |first3=Roscoe |journal=Genomics |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=425–30 |pmid=15780745[/tpl] The rodent is not a rat, but kin to guinea pigs and chinchillas. Its "new" diploid 2n number is 102 and so its cells are roughly twice normal size. Its closest living relation is Octomys mimax, the Andean Viscacha-Rat of the same family, whose 2n = 56. It was therefore surmised that an Octomys-like ancestor produced tetraploid (i.e., 2n = 4x = 112) offspring that were, by virtue of their doubled chromosomes, reproductively isolated from their parents.
Polyploidy was induced in fish by Har Swarup (1956) using a cold-shock treatment of the eggs close to the time of fertilization, which produced triploid embryos that successfully matured.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/1781124a0 |title=Production of Heteroploidy in the Three-Spined Stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus (L.) |year=1956 |last1=Swarup |first1=H. |journal=Nature |volume=178 |issue=4542 |pages=1124[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02984740 |title=Production of triploidy ingasterosteus aculeatus (L) |year=1959 |last1=Swarup |first1=H. |journal=Journal of Genetics |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=129[/tpl] Cold or heat shock has also been shown to result in unreduced amphibian gametes, though this occurs more commonly in eggs than in sperm.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00829 |title=Genome duplication in amphibians and fish: an extended synthesis |year=2011 |last1=Mable |first1=B.K. |last2=Alexandrou |first2=M.

B. S. Haldane hailed the work for its potential medical applications and, in describing the results, became one of the first to use the word “clone” in reference to animals. Later work by Shinya Yamanaka showed how mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, extending the possibilities to non-stem cells. Gurdon and Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this work.

===Polyploidy in humans===

True polyploidy rarely occurs in humans, although polyploid cells occur in highly differentiated tissue, such as liver parenchyman and heart muscle, and in bone marrow.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=3323647 |year=1987 |last1=Winkelmann |first1=M |last2=Pfitzer |first2=P |last3=Schneider |first3=W |title=Significance of polyploidy in megakaryocytes and other cells in health and tumor disease |volume=65 |issue=23 |pages=1115–31 |journal=Klinische Wochenschrift |doi=10.1007/BF01734832[/tpl] Aneuploidy is more common.
Polyploidy occurs in humans in the form of triploidy, with 69 chromosomes (sometimes called 69,XXX), and tetraploidy with 92 chromosomes (sometimes called 92,XXXX). Triploidy, usually due to polyspermy, occurs in about 2–3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as a miscarriage; those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases, survival past birth may occur longer if there is mixoploidy with both a diploid and a triploid cell population present.
Triploidy may be the result of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by reduplication of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg.[tpl]cite book |first1=Phil |last2=Monga |first2=Ash |last3=Baker |first3=Philip |title=Gynaecology by ten teachers |publisher=Arnold |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=0-340-81662-7 |last1=Baker[/tpl] Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploidy that survives into the fetal period.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases Complete tetraploidy is more rarely diagnosed than triploidy, but is observed in 1–2% of early miscarriages. However, some tetraploid cells are commonly found in chromosome analysis at prenatal diagnosis and these are generally considered 'harmless'. It is not clear whether these tetraploid cells simply tend to arise during in vitro cell culture or whether they are also present in placental cells in vivo. There are, at any rate, very few clinical reports of fetuses/infants diagnosed with tetraploidy mosaicism.
Mixoploidy is quite commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and includes haploid/diploid as well as diploid/tetraploid mixed cell populations. It is unknown whether these embryos fail to implant and are therefore rarely detected in ongoing pregnancies or if there is simply a selective process favoring the diploid cells.

==Polyploidy in plants==

Polyploidy is pervasive in plants and some estimates suggest that 30–80% of living plant species are polyploid, and many lineages show evidence of ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) in their genomes.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb01198.x |title=On the Abundance of Polyploids in Flowering Plants |year=2006 |last1=Meyers |first1=Lauren Ancel |last2=Levin |first2=Donald A. |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=1198–206 |pmid=16892970[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1137729 |title=Plant Speciation |year=2007 |last1=Rieseberg |first1=L.

Most polyploids display heterosis relative to their parental species, and may display novel variation or morphologies that may contribute to the processes of speciation and eco-niche exploitation. The mechanisms leading to novel variation in newly formed allopolyploids may include gene dosage effects (resulting from more numerous copies of genome content), the reunion of divergent gene regulatory hierarchies, chromosomal rearrangements, and epigenetic remodeling, all of which affect gene content and/or expression levels.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00015-5 |title=Understanding mechanisms of novel gene expression in polyploids |year=2003 |last1=Osborn |first1=Thomas C. |last2=Pires |first2=J. |last3=Birchler |first3=James A. |last4=Auger |first4=Donald L. |last5=Chen |first5=Z. |last6=Lee |first6=Hyeon-Se |last7=Comai |first7=Luca |last8=Madlung |first8=Andreas |last9=Doerge |first9=R.W. |last10=Colot |first10=Vincent |last11=Martienssen |first11=Robert A. |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=141–7 |pmid=12615008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.20374 |title=Mechanisms of genomic rearrangements and gene expression changes in plant polyploids |year=2006 |last1=Chen |first1=Z.

Lomatia tasmanica is an extremely rare Tasmanian shrub that is triploid and sterile; reproduction is entirely vegetative, with all plants having the same genetic constitution.
There are few naturally occurring polyploid conifers. One example is the Coast Redwood Sequoia sempervirens, which is a hexaploid (6x) with 66 chromosomes (2n = 6x = 66), although the origin is unclear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ahuja MR, Neale DB |title=Origins of Polyploidy in Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D.

===Polyploid crops===

The induction of polyploidy is a common technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, Triticale is the hybrid of wheat (Triticum turgidum) and rye (Secale cereale). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale.
In some situations, polyploid crops are preferred because they are sterile. For example, many seedless fruit varieties are seedless as a result of polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques, such as grafting.
Polyploidy in crop plants is most commonly induced by treating seeds with the chemical colchicine.

===Examples of polyploid crops===

Some crops are found in a variety of ploidies: tulips and lilies are commonly found as both diploid and triploid; daylilies (Hemerocallis cultivars) are available as either diploid or tetraploid; apples and kinnows can be diploid, triploid, or tetraploid.

==Polyploidy in fungi==

Besides plants and animals, the evolutionary history of various fungal species is dotted by past and recent whole-genome duplication events (see Albertin and Marullo 2012 for review). Several examples of polyploids are known:
In addition, polyploidy is frequently associated with hybridization and reticulate evolution that appear to be highly prevalent in several fungal taxa. Indeed, homoploid speciation (i.e., hybrid speciation without a change in chromosome number) has been evidenced for some fungal species (e.g., the basidiomycota Microbotryum violaceum [tpl]cite journal |doi=10.3852/09-192 |title=Using phylogenies of pheromone receptor genes in the Microbotryum violaceum species complex to investigate possible speciation by hybridization |year=2009 |last1=Devier |first1=B. |last2=Aguileta |first2=G. |last3=Hood |first3=M. E. |last4=Giraud |first4=T. |journal=Mycologia |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=689–96 |pmid=20524600[/tpl]).
As for plants and animals, fungal hybrids and polyploids display structural and functional modifications compared to their progenitors and diploid counterparts. In particular, the structural and functional outcomes of polyploid Saccharomyces genomes strikingly reflect the evolutionary fate of plant polyploid ones.

==Polyploidy in the Chromalveolata==

Other eukaryotic taxa have experienced one or more polyploidization events during their evolutionary history (see Albertin and Marullo, 2012 for review). The oomycetes, which are non-true fungi members, contain several examples of paleopolyploid and polyploid species, such as within the Phytophthora genus.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fgb.2006.02.006 |title=Genetic characterization of the natural hybrid species Phytophthora alni as inferred from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses |year=2006 |last1=Ioos |first1=Renaud |last2=Andrieux |first2=Axelle |last3=Marçais |first3=Benoît |last4=Frey |first4=Pascal |journal=Fungal Genetics and Biology |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=511–29 |pmid=16626980[/tpl] Some species of brown algae (Fucales, Laminariales [tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plr001 |title=Estimates of nuclear DNA content in 98 species of brown algae (Phaeophyta) |year=2011 |last1=Phillips |first1=N. |last2=Kapraun |first2=D.

==Terminology==

===Autopolyploidy===

Autopolyploids are polyploids with multiple chromosome sets derived from a single species. Autopolyploids can arise from a spontaneous, naturally occurring genome doubling, like the potato. Others might form following fusion of 2n gametes (unreduced gametes). Bananas and apples can be found as autotriploids. Autopolyploid plants typically display polysomic inheritance, and are therefore often infertile and propagated clonally perfect.

===Allopolyploidy===

Allopolyploids are polyploids with chromosomes derived from different species. Precisely it is the result of multiplying the chromosome number in an F1 hybrid. Triticale is an example of an allopolyploid, having six chromosome sets, allohexaploid, four from wheat (Triticum turgidum) and two from rye (Secale cereale). Amphidiploids are a type of allopolyploids (they are tetraploid, containing the diploid chromosome sets of both parents[tpl]cite book|author=Rieger, R.; Michaelis, A.; Green, M.M. |year=1968 |title= A glossary of genetics and cytogenetics: Classical and molecular[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]). Some of the best examples of allopolyploids come from the Brassicas, and the Triangle of U describes the relationships between the three common diploid Brassicas (B. oleracea, B. rapa, and B. nigra) and three allotetraploids (B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata) derived from hybridization among the diploids.

===Paleopolyploidy===

Ancient genome duplications probably occurred in the evolutionary history of all life. Duplication events that occurred long ago in the history of various evolutionary lineages can be difficult to detect because of subsequent diploidization (such that a polyploid starts to behave cytogenetically as a diploid over time) as mutations and gene translations gradually make one copy of each chromosome unlike the other copy. Over time, it is also common for duplicated copies of genes to accumulate mutations and become inactive pseudogenes.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10577-009-9055-9 |pmid=19802709 |title=Gene and genome duplications: the impact of dosage-sensitivity on the fate of nuclear genes |year=2009 |last1=Edger |first1=Patrick P. |last2=Pires |first2=Chris J. |journal=Chromosome Research |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=699–717[/tpl]
In many cases, these events can be inferred only through comparing sequenced genomes. Examples of unexpected but recently confirmed ancient genome duplications include baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mustard weed/thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and an early evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates (which includes the human lineage) and another near the origin of the teleost fishes. Angiosperms (flowering plants) have paleopolyploidy in their ancestry. All eukaryotes probably have experienced a polyploidy event at some point in their evolutionary history.

===Karyotype===

A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome complement of a eukaryote species.White M.J.D. 1973. The chromosomes. 6th ed, Chapman & Hall, London. p28Stebbins G.L. 1950. Variation and evolution in plants. Chapter XII: The Karyotype. Columbia University Press N.Y.[tpl]page needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytology and, more specifically, cytogenetics.
Although the replication and transcription of DNA is highly standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot be said for their karotypes, which are highly variable between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization despite being constructed out of the same macromolecules. In some cases, there is even significant variation within species. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in what might be called evolutionary cytology.

===Paralogous===

The term is used to describe the relationship between duplicated genes or portions of chromosomes that derived from a common ancestral DNA. Paralogous segments of DNA may arise spontaneously by errors during DNA replication, copy and paste transposons, or whole genome duplications.

===Homologous===

The term is used to describe the relationship of similar chromosomes that pair at mitosis and meiosis. In a diploid, one homolog is derived from the male parent (sperm) and one is derived from the female parent (egg). During meiosis and gametogenesis, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material by recombination, leading to the production of sperm or eggs with chromosome haplotypes containing novel genetic variation.

===Homoeologous===

The term homoeologous, also spelled homeologous, is used to describe the relationship of similar chromosomes or parts of chromosomes brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. In allopolyploids, the homologous chromosomes within each parental sub-genome should pair faithfully during meiosis, leading to disomic inheritance; however in some allopolyploids, the homoeologous chromosomes of the parental genomes may be nearly as similar to one another as the homologous chromosomes, leading to tetrasomic inheritance (four chromosomes pairing at meiosis), intergenomic recombination, and reduced fertility.

====Example of homoeologous chromosomes====

Durum wheat is the result of the inter-species hybridization of two diploid grass species Triticum urartu and Aegilops speltoides. Both diploid ancestors had two sets of 7 chromosomes, which were similar in terms of size and genes contained on them. Durum wheat contains two sets of chromosomes derived from Triticum urartu and two sets of chromosomes derived from Aegilops speltoides. Each chromosome pair derived from the Triticum urartu parent is homoeologous to the opposite chromosome pair derived from the Aegilops speltoides parent, though each chromosome pair unto itself is homologous.
