Reading ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Reading.ogg|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ɪ|ŋ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|RED|ing[/tpl]) is a large town and unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Berkshire, England. It is located in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet, and on both the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway. Reading is located [tpl]convert|36|mi|km[/tpl] east from Swindon, [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] south from Oxford, [tpl]convert|36|mi|km[/tpl] west of central London, and [tpl]convert|14|mi|km[/tpl] north from Basingstoke.
The Borough of Reading has a population of 145,700 (2008 estimate) and the town formed the largest part of the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area which had a population of 318,014 (2011 census).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| work= | publisher=ONS | accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] The town is currently represented in the UK parliament by two members, and has been continuously represented there since 1295. For ceremonial purposes the town is in the county of Berkshire and has served as its county town since 1867, previously sharing this status with Abingdon-on-Thames.
The first evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century. Reading was an important centre in the medieval period, as the site of Reading Abbey, a monastery with strong royal connections. The town was seriously impacted by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses.
Today Reading is a commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and, despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. Reading is ranked the UK’s top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtmlPWC/Demos Good Growth for Cities 2013. The town is also a retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the University of Reading. Every year it hosts the Reading Festival, one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include Reading Football Club and the London Irish rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the Reading Half Marathon.

==History==

Reading may have existed as early as the Roman occupation of Britain, possibly as a trading port for Calleva Atrebatum.[tpl]sfn|Lawes Long|1836|p=11–13[/tpl] However the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town came to be known as Readingum. The name probably comes from the Readingas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose name means Reada's People in Old English,[tpl]sfn|Cameron|1961|p=64[/tpl] or less probably the Celtic Rhydd-Inge, meaning Ford over the River.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/reading.html |title=History of Reading, Berkshire |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl]
In late 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the first Battle of Reading, King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to winter quarters in London.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=14–15[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364[/tpl]
After the Battle of Hastings and the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of Battle Abbey. In its 1086 Domesday Book listing, the town was explicitly described as a borough. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.[tpl]sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364[/tpl]
Reading Abbey was founded in 1121 by Henry I, who is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands in Reading, along with land at Cholsey.[tpl]sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Slade|2001|p=1–16[/tpl] It is not known how badly Reading was affected by the Black Death that swept through England in the 14th century, but it is known that the abbot of Reading Abbey, Henry of Appleford, was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby Henley lost 60% of its population.[tpl]sfn|Hylton|2007|p=34–38[/tpl]
The Abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church.[tpl]sfn|Slade|2001|p=17–25[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fasham|Hawkes|1983[/tpl]
By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant John Kendrick.[tpl]sfn|Hylton|2007|p=34–38[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Hylton|2007|p=51–52[/tpl]
Reading played an important role during the English Civil War. Despite its fortifications, it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent Siege of Reading by Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643. The town's cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town's economy did not fully recover until the 20th century.[tpl]sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work=Royal Berkshire History | publisher=Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_siege.html | title = The Siege of Reading | accessdate =27 April 2009[/tpl] Reading played a significant role during the Revolution of 1688: the second Battle of Reading was the only substantial military action of the campaign.[tpl]sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work=Royal Berkshire History | publisher=Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | title = The Battle of Broad Street | accessdate =27 April 2009[/tpl]
The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=84–89[/tpl] Reading's trade benefited from better designed turnpike roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to Oxford and the West Country. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town. After the opening of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810, one could go by barge from Reading to the Bristol Channel.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=75–80[/tpl] From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of county town of Berkshire was shared between Reading and Abingdon.[tpl]cite news |title=Berkshire Quarter Sessions |newspaper=Jackson's Oxford Journal |date=4 July 1868[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hunter|1995|p=103[/tpl]
During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. The Great Western Railway arrived in 1841,[tpl]cite web|title=Building the Great Western Railway|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/transport/gwr1.html|work=Reading History Trail|accessdate=14 June 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514074850/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/transport/gwr1.html |archivedate=14 May 2011[/tpl] followed by the South Eastern Railway in 1849 and the London and South Western Railway in 1856.[tpl]sfn|Kidner|1982|p=6[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Waters|1990|p=20[/tpl]
The Summer Assizes were moved from Abingdon to Reading in 1867, effectively making Reading the sole county town of Berkshire, a decision that was officially approved by the Privy Council in 1869. The town became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888.[tpl]cite web|title=Lords Hansard text for 16 Jul 1996 (160716-11)|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960716/text/60716-11.htm|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=16 July 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=English Counties, The Real Counties|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2501029|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=7 April 2004[/tpl] The town has been famous for the Three Bs of beer (1785–2010, Simonds' Brewery),[tpl]cite web|title=The Nineteenth Century|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents/history-of-reading/the-nineteenth-century/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Dellor|first=Amanda|title=Reading's Courage Brewery closing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8586000/8586089.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=24 March 2010[/tpl] bulbs (1837–1974, Suttons Seeds),[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Suttons|url=http://www.suttons.co.uk/About+UsHistory.htm|publisher=Sutton Seeds|accessdate=14 June 2011[/tpl] and biscuits (1822–1976, Huntley and Palmers).[tpl]cite web|title=Huntley & Palmers Collection|url=http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/collections/social-history/huntley-palmers-collection/|work=Reading Museum|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=7 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Huntley & Palmers Timeline|url=http://www.collectionsgateway.org.uk/collections/7/hp%20timeline.pdf|work=Reading Museum|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=14 June 2011|format=PDF|year=2001[/tpl]
The town continued to expand in the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911. Compared to many other English towns and cities, Reading suffered little physical damage during either of the two World Wars that afflicted the 20th century, although many citizens were killed or injured in the conflicts. One significant air raid occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single Luftwaffe plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAyADAANQB8AHwAVAByAHUAZQB8AHwAMAB8AA2 | title = Air Raid, February 1943 | work=Reading Museum|publisher=Reading Borough Council| accessdate =13 February 2012[/tpl]

Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied a small part of the site. It provides three storeys of shopping space and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs.[tpl]cite web|title=The founding of the Oracle|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/manufacture/oracle1.html|publisher=Reading History Trail|accessdate=21 April 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514072714/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/manufacture/oracle1.html |archivedate=14 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = John Kendrick (1573–1624) | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/jkendrick.html | work=Royal Berkshire History | publisher=Nash Ford Publishing | accessdate =21 April 2011[/tpl]
As one of the largest urban areas in the United Kingdom to be without city status, Reading has bid for city status on three recent occasions — in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium; in 2002 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II; and 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.

==Government==

Local government for the town of Reading is principally provided by the Borough of Reading, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status.
Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295.[tpl]cite news|title=Berkshire prepares for election|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/england/8606277.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=12 June 2011|date=6 April 2010|first=Peter|last=Henley[/tpl] Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough of Reading, and the parliamentary constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading East and Reading West.[tpl]cite web|title=New Parliamentary Constituencies for England|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04297.pdf|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=26 June 2011|format=PDF|date=5 November 2009[/tpl] The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.[tpl]cite web|title=Election Maps|url=http://www.election-maps.co.uk/|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=26 June 2011[/tpl]

===Borough of Reading===

Reading has had some degree of local government autonomy since 1253, when the local merchant guild was granted a royal charter. Since then, the town has been run by a borough corporation, as a county borough, and as a district of Berkshire. The Borough of Reading became a unitary authority area in 1998, when Berkshire County Council was abolished under the Banham Review, and is now responsible for all aspects of local government within the borough.[tpl]cite web|title=The Berkshire (Structural Change) Order 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1879/contents/made|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl]
Prior to the 16th century, civic administration for the town of Reading was situated in the Yield Hall, a guild hall situated by the River Kennet near today's Yield Hall Lane.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=42[/tpl] After a brief stay in what later became Greyfriars Church, the town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium of Reading Abbey.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=42[/tpl] For some 400 years up to the 1970s, this was to remain the site of Reading's civic administration through the successive rebuilds that eventually created today's Town Hall.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=88[/tpl] In 1976, Reading Borough Council moved to the new Civic Centre.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=168–9[/tpl]
The government of the Borough of Reading follows the leader and cabinet model. Following the 2011 local elections, a Labour minority administration replaced the previous Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition on the casting vote of the mayor.[tpl]cite news|title=Labour takes back control of council|url=http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/reading/articles/2011/05/12/52057-reading-headed-for-labour-return/|work=Reading Chronicle|publisher=Berkshire Media Group|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=12 May 2011[/tpl] The borough also has a (largely ceremonial) mayor. In 2011–12 this position is held by Councillor Deborah Edwards.

===Boundaries===

Since 1887, the borough has included the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst.[tpl]sfn|Phillips|1980|p=135[/tpl] By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham and still more of Tilehurst.[tpl]sfn|Dils|1998[/tpl] A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt to take over a small area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997.[tpl]sfn|Dils|1998[/tpl] Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.[tpl]cite web|title=Ward Profiles|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/key-statistics/ward-profiles/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]
Reading's municipal boundaries do not include all of the surrounding suburbs, some of which belong administratively to West Berkshire (administered in Newbury) and Wokingham Borough. This creates difficult policies for the town as it wishes to expand housing and roads. The diminishing amount of land available and suitable for development within the borough's boundary can bring the council into conflict with its neighbours' development plans. This particularly affects education (many schools have catchment areas that cross administrative boundaries), and transport. A perennial example is whether to construct a third road crossing of the Thames, which South Oxfordshire's politicians and residents oppose.[tpl]cite web | publisher=South Oxfordshire District Council | url = http://www.southoxon.com/sites/default/files/Wokingham_BC_EM5.pdf | title = Third Thames bridge | accessdate =14 June 2011 | date = 17 May 2011 | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Third Bridge|url=http://www.cadra.org.uk/Third_Bridge.asp|publisher=CADRA|accessdate=4 October 2011|date=August 2006[/tpl] On this subject, Rob Wilson, MP for Reading East, said in a House of Commons debate in January 2006:[tpl]cite web | publisher=Hansard | url = http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h04.htm | title = Transport (Greater Reading) | accessdate =3 August 2006 | date = 11 January 2006[/tpl]

==Geography==

Reading is [tpl]convert|36|mi|km[/tpl] due west of central London, [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Oxford, [tpl]convert|70|mi|km[/tpl] east of Bristol, and [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] north of the English south coast. The centre of Reading is on a low ridge between the River Thames and River Kennet, close to their confluence, reflecting the town's history as a river port. Just above the confluence, the Kennet cuts through a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames floodplain. The absence of a floodplain on the Kennet in this defile enabled the development of wharves.
As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to the west between the two rivers into the foothills of the Berkshire Downs (part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty); to the south and south-east on the south side of the Kennet; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.
The floodplains adjoining Reading's two rivers are subject to occasional flooding. However, in the 2007 floods that affected much of the UK, no properties were affected by flooding from the Thames and only four properties were affected by flooding from the Kennet.[tpl]cite web|title=2007 Floods photos|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/EmergencyPlanning/Flooding/2007-floods/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=July 2007 Flooding|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/Documents/adviceandemergencies/Emergency-Planning/July_2007_flooding_report_Cabinet.pdf|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=13 June 2011|date=29 October 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Definition===

Depending on the definition adopted, neither the town nor the urban area are necessarily coterminous with the borough. Historically, the town of Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old ecclesiastical parishes of the churches of St Mary, St Laurence and St Giles, or the even smaller pre-19th century borough.[tpl]sfn|Dils|1998[/tpl]
Today, as well as the town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading urban area, sometimes referred to as Greater Reading, incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley-on-Thames and Tilehurst.

===Climate===

Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a maritime climate, with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official Met Office weather station is located at the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory on the Whiteknights Campus, which has recorded atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=Reading University Atmospheric Observatory|url=http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/Data/fieldsite/docs/|publisher=University of Reading|accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl] The local absolute maximum temperature of [tpl]convert|36.4|C|F[/tpl] was recorded in August 1990 and the local absolute minimum temperature of [tpl]convert|-14.5|C|F[/tpl] was recorded in January 1982.

==Demography==

The borough has a population of [tpl]English district population|GSS=E06000038[/tpl] and a population density of [tpl]convert|[tpl]English district density|GSS=E06000038[/tpl]|/sqkm|/sqmi|0[/tpl] ([tpl]English statistics year[/tpl]),[tpl]English district population citation[/tpl] while the Office for National Statistics' definition of the urban sub-division of Reading is significantly larger at 218,705 people in an area of [tpl]convert|51.14|km²|2|abbr=out[/tpl]. This urban subdivision is itself a component of the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area with a population of 318,014 (2011 census), and is the most populous town in the United Kingdom not to have city status.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/CityStatusTable2.asp | title = Largest Towns without City Status | work=LoveMyTown.co.uk | accessdate =27 April 2009[/tpl]

==Transport==

Reading's location in the Thames Valley to the west of London has made the town an important location in the nation's transport system.
The town grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Thames and the Kennet. Both of these rivers are navigable, and Caversham Lock, Blake's Lock, County Lock, Fobney Lock and Southcote Lock are all within the borough. Today, navigation is exclusively for purposes of leisure: private and hire boats dominate traffic, while scheduled boat services operate on the Thames from wharves on the Reading side of the river near Caversham Bridge.[tpl]cite web | publisher=Salters Steamers | url = http://www.salterssteamers.co.uk/readhen.htm | title = Reading to Henley Service | accessdate =30 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher=Thames River Cruises | url = http://www.thamesrivercruise.co.uk/scheduled_trip2.asp | title = Boat service from Reading to Mapledurham | accessdate =29 April 2007[/tpl]
Reading was a major staging point on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been replaced for long distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road. National Express Coaches run out of Reading Coachway, at Junction 12 of the M4.[tpl]cite web|title=Destinations|url=http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/destinations/destinationdetails.cfm?t=own&location_code=61206&fromc=Reading%20-%20Calcot|publisher=National Express|accessdate=13 June 2011[/tpl] The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving one of which is High Bridge.[tpl]cite web|title=11 High Bridge|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/trail/trail11.html|work=Reading History Trail|accessdate=9 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514074400/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/trail/trail11.html |archivedate=14 May 2011[/tpl]
Reading is a major junction point of the National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a major transfer point and terminus. Reading station will be redeveloped at a cost of £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. The project is scheduled to finish in 2015.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/6339.aspx | title = Reading station area redevelopment | publisher=Network Rail | accessdate =13 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Reading rail station's £850m upgrade to finish early|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-13437508|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=13 June 2011|date=18 May 2011[/tpl] Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London.

An express bus service named RailAir links Reading with Heathrow, or the airport can be accessed by rail by taking the Paddington train and changing to the Heathrow Connect rail service at Hayes and Harlington railway station.
Today local public transport is largely by road, which is often affected by peak hour congestion in the borough. A frequent local bus network within the borough, and a less frequent network in the surrounding area, are provided by Reading Buses.
