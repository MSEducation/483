Tiger was a British comic magazine published from 1954 to 1985. The comic was launched under the editorship of Derek Birnage on 11 September 1954,[tpl]cite web | title=Comic Stories | work=Roy of the Rovers.com | url=http://www.royoftherovers.com/comicstories.htm | accessdate = 2005-06-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050205025452/http://www.royoftherovers.com/comicstories.htm  |archivedate = 2005-02-05[/tpl] under the name Tiger – The Sport and Adventure Picture Story Weekly,[tpl]cite web | title=Collectors Corner – Bibliography and Guide Prices | work=Roy of the Rovers.com | url=http://www.royoftherovers.com/collectorscorner/guideprices.htm | accessdate = 2005-06-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050210183935/http://www.royoftherovers.com/collectorscorner/guideprices.htm  |archivedate = 2005-02-10[/tpl] and featured predominantly sporting strips. Its most popular strip was Roy of the Rovers, a football-based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. This strip proved so successful it was spun out of Tiger and into its own comic.
The next Editor was Barrie Tomlinson.  Barrie became Group Editor in 1976, with Paul Gettens as
Editor.
Following successive mergers with other Fleetway publications in the 1960s the comic was known as Tiger and Hurricane, then Tiger and Jag, then it was coupled with the football magazine Scorcher in 1974, resulting in Tiger and Scorcher appearing for more than 6 years. Later there was a further, less successful, merger with another comic called Speed, in 1980. The end finally came on 30 March 1985, with some strips moving to The Eagle.[tpl]cite web | title=Comic Stories | url=http://www.royoftherovers.com/comicstories.htm [/tpl] In all, 1,555 issues were published, as well as a number of hard-cover annuals.[tpl]cite web | title=Tiger Comic | work=British Comics.com | url=http://www.britishcomics.com/tiger.htm | accessdate = 2005-06-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
