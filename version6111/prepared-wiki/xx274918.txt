[[Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet elections]]

CATEGORIES: Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet elections, National opposition cabinets

Until they were abolished in 2011 it had been the tradition for the British Labour Party to hold elections to the Shadow Cabinet whenever the Party was in Opposition. Cabinet members would be elected by the MPs within the Parliamentary Labour Party, usually at the beginning of a Parliamentary session. The PLP voted to abolish Shadow Cabinet elections at a meeting on 5 July 2011.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jul/06/labour-abolish-shadow-cabinet-elections |title=Labour MPs vote to abolish shadow cabinet elections |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |work=The Guardian |last=Neild |first=Barry[/tpl] The decision was later approved by Labour's National Executive Committee at the end of July, then at their annual conference in Liverpool in September.[tpl]cite web|last=King |first=Victoria |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15054351 |work=BBC News|title= Labour delegates vote to scrap shadow cabinet elections |publisher=BBC |date= 26 September 2011|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
