</ref> Ramsay suggested the name ''xenon'' for this gas from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ξένον'' [xenon], neuter singular form of ''ξένος'' [xenos], meaning 'foreign(er)', 'strange(r)', or 'guest'.<ref>

</ref> In 1902, Ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth's atmosphere as one part in 20 million.<ref>
</ref> The current symbol for Xenon is '''Xe''', however historically it was also written as '''X'''. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
During the 1930s, American engineer Harold Edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography. This led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp, in which light is generated by sending a brief electrical current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method.[ref]

In 1939, American physician Albert R. Behnke Jr. began exploring the causes of "drunkenness" in deep-sea divers. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic. Although Russian toxicologist Nikolay V. Lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by American medical researcher John H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully operated on two patients.[ref]

Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds. However, while teaching at the University of British Columbia, Neil Bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas (O2) to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate (O2+PtF6–).[ref]
