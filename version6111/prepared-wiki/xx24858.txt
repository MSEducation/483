==Population==

According to the 2011 population census the population of Iran was 75 million
, a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986 an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.3% between 2006 and 2011.

==Languages and ethnic groups==

The largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Luri, Talysh, and Balochi. Speakers of Turkic languages, such as the Azeri, Turkmen, and the Qashqai peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Assyrian. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as Armenian, Russian, Pashto; the isolate Dravidian language Brahui in the south-east; and Georgian (a member of the Kartvelian language family), spoken only by those Iranian Georgians that live in Fereydan, Fereydunshahr. Most of those Georgians who live in the the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, and in Tehran Province no longer speak the language but keep a Georgian conscience.
The Circassians, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have almost all been fully assimilated and absorbed in the past few centuries. However, small sockets do exist spread over the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118238/Circassian|title=Circassian (people)|accessdate=28 april 2014[/tpl]
The CIA World Factbook (which is based on 2013 statistics) gives the following numbers for the languages spoken in Iran today: Persian, Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani 66%; Azeri and other Turkic languages 18%; Kurdish 10%; Arabic 2%; Baloch 2%; others 1%.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html|title=The World Factbook - Iran|accessdate=2013-05-13[/tpl]

Bosworth (editor) give Iran's ethnic groups as following: Persians 65%, Azeris 16%, Kurds 7%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Baloch 2%, Turkmens 1%, Turkic tribal groups (e.g. Qashqai) 1%, and non-Persian, non-Turkic groups (e.g. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Pashtuns,) less than 1%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iran.pdf |title=Ethnic Groups and Languages of Iran |first=Library of Congress – Federal Research Division |last=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-12-02[/tpl] For sources prior to 2000, see Languages and ethnicities in Iran.

==Urban Population==

In addition to its international migration pattern, Iran also exhibits one of the steepest urban growth rates in the world according to the UN humanitarian information unit. According to 2005 population estimates, approximately 67 percent of Iran's population lives in urban areas, up from 27 percent in 1950.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=424 |title=Migration Information Source - Iran: A Vast Diaspora Abroad and Millions of Refugees at Home |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04[/tpl] The following is a list of the six most populous cities in the country.

==Religious affiliations==

More than 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the Shi'a branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the Sunni branch, which predominates in neighboring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Bahá'ís, Mandeans, and Yarsan. The Bahá'í Faith, Iran's openly persecuted religious minority with a population around 300 000, is not officially recognized(and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Bahá'ís has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment.[tpl]cite web |date=2003-08-01 |title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran |author=International Federation for Human Rights |publisher=fdih.org |accessdate=2007-03-19 |url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author= Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center | title= A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Bahá'ís of Iran | year= 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-19|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/pdfs/Reports/bahai_report.pdf[/tpl] Today, there are an estimated 8,000 Assyrian Christians in Iran, who belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church.

==Refugee population==

Iran hosts one of the largest refugee population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan (80%) and Iraq (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/452b78394.html |title=Tripartite meeting on returns to Afghanistan |first=UNHCR |last=United Nations |accessdate=2006-04-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=424#top |title=Migration Information Source - Iran: A Vast Diaspora Abroad and Millions of Refugees at Home |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04[/tpl] Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1 billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150 million on those in Iran. In 1999, the Iranian government estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10 million per day, compared with the US$18 million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999.

==Genetics==

===Y-chromosome DNA===

Y-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, the Iranian Y-chromosome pool is as follows where haplogroups J (33%), R1 (25%), G (14%), E1b1b (5%), L (4%), 
Q (4%),comprise more than 85% of the total chromosomes.Regueiro et al. 2006, Nasidze et al. 2008

===Mitochondrial DNA===

Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage The Iranian mitochondrial DNA shows more Western Eurasian lineages than the Y-DNA lineages.Kivisild et al. 2004, Nasidze et al. 2008
In Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted by the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaki's and Mazandarani's, who's genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicites, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's.
Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1-2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines resembling South Asian ethnic groups.

==People of Iranian Ancestry==

It is estimated that some 200 million people around the world have Iranian ancestry from the various Iranian peoples.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|title=Report for Iranian languages|journal=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|year=2005|edition=Fifteenth|location=Dallas|publisher=SIL International|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90019[/tpl]

===Parsis===

The Parsis are the close-knit Zoroastrian community based primarily in India but also found in Pakistan. Parsis are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago.
Indian census data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of Karachi and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000 (Eliade, 1991:254).

===Iranis===

In Pakistan and India, the term "Irani" has come to denote Iranian Zoroastrians who have immigrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most Parsis who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them immigrated during the Qajar era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran. Unlike the Parsis, they speak a Dari dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in Yazd and Kerman. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day Mumbai while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day Karachi. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses.http://www.iranian.ws/cgi-bin/iran_news/exec/view.cgi/5/12134 Some, such as Ardeshir Irani, have also become very famous in cinema.

===Ajam (Bahrain)===

The "Ajam" are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of Manama and Muharraq. The Iranians who adhere to Shiite sect of Islam are Ajam, and they are different from the Huwala, who are Sunnis and some of them have Arab origin.
In addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the Safavid rule of Bahrain (1501–1722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.

===Huwala===

Huwala are the descendants of Persians and Persian Arabs who belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.[tpl]cite web |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait |work=Newcastle University |year=2010 |page=11[/tpl] Huwala migrated from Ahwaz in Iran to the Persian Gulf in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.[tpl]cite book | last = Farmanfarmaian | first = Roxane | authorlink = |coauthors = | title = War and Peace in Qajar Persia | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 128 | url = | doi =| id = |isbn = 978-0415421195 [/tpl]
