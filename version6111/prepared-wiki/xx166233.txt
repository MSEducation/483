Sérgio Dutra Santos, known as Serginho or Escadinha (born 15 October 1975 in Diamante do Norte), is a Brazilian professional volleyball player who plays in the libero position. In 2009 he became the first Libero to be named MVP in the World League (an honor which is usually given to spikers or setters).
He is widely regarded as one of the best liberos of all time and is unquestionably the best libero of the 2000s, with more awards than any other libero. Known for his outstanding service reception and digging capabilities, teams often attempted to avoid Sergio when serving. Beyond his defensive abilities, he was also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter was forced to make the first contact. This was in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.
With Copra Piacenza he won the silver medal at the 2007–08 Indesit Champions League and also was individually awarded "Best Libero".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/mmp/online/website/news/news_archive/news_archive_2008/news_archive_2008_03/11444_EN.html|title=KAZAN takes Indesit European Champions’ League title to Russia|author=CEV|accessdate=2010-06-10[/tpl]
