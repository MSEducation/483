 | quote = The court documents state that in April 1997, Ben Slivka, the Microsoft manager responsible for executing the Java strategy, sent an E-mail to Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, noting "When I met with you last, you had a lot of pretty pointed questions about Java, so I want to make sure I understand your issues and concerns." Mr. Slivka goes on to ask if Mr. Gates's concerns included "How do we wrest control of Java away from Sun?" and "How we turn Java into just the latest, best way to write Windows applications?''

==Variant==

An older variant of the phrase is "embrace, extend then innovate" in J Allard's 1994 memo "Windows: The Next Killer Application on the Internet" to Paul Maritz and other executives at Microsoft. The memo starts with a background on the Internet in general, and then proposes a strategy on how to turn Windows into the next "killer app" for the Internet:

==Companies other than Microsoft==

During the browser wars, other companies besides Microsoft introduced proprietary, non-standards-compliant extensions. For example, in 1995, Netscape implemented the "font" tag, among other HTML extensions, without seeking review from a standards body. With the rise of Internet Explorer, the two companies became locked in a dead heat to out-implement each other with non-standards-compliant features.
In 2004, to prevent a repeat of the "browser wars", and the resulting morass of conflicting standards, Apple Inc. (maker of Safari), Mozilla Foundation (maker of Firefox), Google Inc. (maker of Google Chrome) and Opera Software (maker of the Opera browser) formed the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) to create open standards to complement those of the World Wide Web Consortium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.whatwg.org/faq/#whattf|title=What is the WHATWG and why did it form?|accessdate=2007-08-25[/tpl] Microsoft originally refused to join, citing the group's lack of a patent policy as the reason.[tpl]cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/podcasts/MSConversations_wilson_ch9.mp3 |accessdate=2009-07-28|title=MSConversations |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216101506/http://channel9.msdn.com/podcasts/MSConversations_wilson_ch9.mp3 |archivedate = 2008-02-16[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl] However, Microsoft Corporation is currently listed as a member. http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List
