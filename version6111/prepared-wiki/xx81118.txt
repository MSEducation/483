Newbiggin-by-the-Sea is a small town in Northumberland, England, lying on the North Sea coast. Once an important port for shipping grain and a coal mining town, it is still a small fishing port making use of traditional coble boats.

==History==

It is widely although mistakenly noted that the town was originally called 'South Wallerick', and renamed Newbiggin after the Danish invasion. However the document on which this is based refers to 'Sanctum Walericium', or St. Waleric.J. Raine ed., 'The Priory of Hexham, its Chroniclers, Endowmnents and Annals. Vol. I: Appendix', The Publications of the Surtees Society vol.44 (1864) This was the name of the church at Alnmouth, which was at one time called Newbiggin. There is no connection with Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. Newbiggin derives from OE nīwe (new) + ME bigging (building, house),Anthony David Mills, A Dictionary of British Place-Names (Oxford, 2003) and this may refer to an extension of the early settlement and parish of Woodhorn.

===Early history===

The church was for centuries from its early construction a chapel only, with a tower surmounted by a spire which was originally used as a beacon. In the 14th century, Newbiggin was a very important maritime centre, called upon to support Edward III in his campaigns against the Scots.  During part of the Middle Ages, Newbiggin was a major port for the shipping of grain – it is said that it was third such port only in importance after London and Hull.  Therefore the old town in the 43rd year of Henry III's reign was granted a charter for a weekly market on Monday and an annual fair.  Mention occurs of its pier and shipping in various old documents; and in 1337, as a borough of note, it sent bailiffs to a council on matters of state, convened by the Bishop of Lincoln, the Earl of Warwick and other noblemen.

===1800-date===

In 1805, two boats, with nineteen men, were lost in a storm off this place after which £1700 was donated by fund-raising in the Newcastle region to relieve the bereaved families.  As early as 1828, Newbiggin was a popular beach resort, with facilities to cater for visitors. By this time the small town had five public houses, one of which had a spa-like array of bathing facilities, several shops, and lodging houses with a township of 503 acres. The village featured a shore, which, being a fine smooth beach about a mile in length, was well suited for bathing, for which purpose the place, by 1848, was much frequented during warmer seasons. By this time, several well-built guesthouses took hold. The bay gave good anchorage for small vessels, but even then was very little used, except for the numerous boats belonging to the fishery, in which most of the inhabitants were employed. The plentiful fish caught were herring, cod, ling, haddock, salmon, trout, turbot, halibut, soles, lobsters, and crabs not only for the supply of the neighbouring markets but the region; and buildings for the curing of herrings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51170 |title=Nevendon – Newborough |author=Samuel Lewis (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1848 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |accessdate=11 April 2013 [/tpl]

==Summer Fair==

Until 2004 Newbiggin was host to a street fair that attracted thousands of people every year; a huge fair that expanded over many years. In its final years, the fair was set out in the following format: starting at the beginning of the shopping area of Front Street, up to the Cresswell Arms public house flowing into Church Point car park and continuing along the seafront promenade. The lifeboat house and boat yard became the music venue. A stage replaced the boats and the lifeboat house opened its doors, serving food and afternoon tea. Over the years, appearances were made by Slade, Leo Sayer and TV show Gladiators star Michael Van Wijk along with many others.
Starting in 2010, the annual Old Ship Music Festival is attempting to bring back a summer event to the village. It invites bands from the region and worldwide to play, as well as local comedians, and raises money for charity with the help of local businesses. In 2010 it raised £700 for Help for Heroes, where in 2011, the chosen charity was The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, and raised £1,100.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fortunate-events.com|title=The Old Ship Music Festival Website|accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl]
