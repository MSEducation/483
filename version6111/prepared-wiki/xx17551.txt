Lynn Margulis (born Lynn Alexander;[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/480458a[/tpl] March 5, 1938 – November 22, 2011)[tpl]cite pmid| 22267805[/tpl] was an American biologist and University Professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.Lynn Margulis biography at U. Mass. (Accessed July 15, 2006) She developed a theory of the origin of eukaryotic organelles, and contributed to the endosymbiotic theory, which is now generally accepted for how certain organelles were formed. She showed that animals, plants, and fungi all originated from Protists.  She is also associated with the Gaia hypothesis, based on an idea developed by the English environmental scientist James Lovelock.

===Endosymbiosis theory===

Lynn Margulis attended the University of Chicago, earned a master's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1960, and received her Ph.D. in 1963 in the faculty of Biological Sciences from UC Berkeley in Botany. In 1966, as a young faculty member at Boston University, she wrote a theoretical paper entitled The Origin of Mitosing Eukaryotic Cells.[tpl]cite  doi|10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3[/tpl] The paper however was "rejected by about fifteen scientific journals," Margulis recalled.John Brockman, The Third Culture, New York: Touchstone, 1995, 135. It was finally accepted by The Journal of Theoretical Biology and is considered today a landmark in modern endosymbiotic theory. Although it draws heavily on symbiosis ideas first put forward by mid-19th century scientists and by Merezhkovsky (1905) and Ivan Wallin (1920) in the early-20th century, Margulis's endosymbiotic theory formulation is the first to rely on direct microbiological observations (as opposed to paleontological or zoological observations which were previously the norm for new works in evolutionary biology). Weathering constant criticism of her ideas for decades, Margulis is famous for her tenacity in pushing her theory forward, despite the opposition she faced at the time.
The underlying theme of endosymbiosis theory, as formulated in 1966, was interdependence and cooperative existence of multiple prokaryotic organisms; one organism engulfed another, yet both survived and eventually evolved over millions of years into eukaryotic cells. Her 1970 book, Origin of Eukaryotic Cells, discusses her early work pertaining to this organelle genesis theory in detail. Currently, her endosymbiosis theory is recognized as the key method by which some organelles have arisen (see endosymbiotic theory for a discussion) and is widely accepted by mainstream scientists. The endosymbiosis theory of organogenesis gained strong support in the 1980s, when the genetic material of mitochondria and chloroplasts was found to be different from that of the symbiont's nuclear DNA.Acceptance Doesn't Come Easy (Accessed July 15, 2006)
In 1995, prominent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins had this to say about Lynn Margulis and her work:

===Theory of symbiotic relationships driving evolution===

She  later formulated a theory to explain how symbiotic relationships between organisms of often different phyla or kingdoms are the driving force of evolution. Genetic variation is proposed to occur mainly as a result of transfer of nuclear information between bacterial cells or viruses and eukaryotic cells. While her organelle genesis ideas are widely accepted, symbiotic relationships as a current method of introducing genetic variation is something of a fringe idea.
She also held a negative view of certain interpretations of Neo-Darwinism that she felt were excessively focused on inter-organismic competition, as she believed that history will ultimately judge them as comprising "a minor twentieth-century religious sect within the sprawling religious persuasion of Anglo-Saxon Biology."[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.252.5004.378[/tpl]
She also believed that proponents of the standard theory "wallow in their zoological, capitalistic, competitive, cost-benefit interpretation of Darwin – having mistaken him... Neo-Darwinism, which insists on slow accrual of mutations by gene-level natural selection, is in a complete funk."
She opposed such competition-oriented views of evolution, stressing the importance of symbiotic or cooperative relationships between species.

===AIDS/HIV theory===

In 2009 Margulis co-authored with seven others a paper stating "Detailed research that correlates life histories of symbiotic spirochetes to changes in the immune system of associated vertebrates is sorely needed" and urging the "reinvestigation of the natural history of mammalian, tick-borne, and venereal transmission of spirochetes in relation to impairment of the human immune system."Syphilis, Lyme disease & AIDS: Resurgence of “the great imitator”?, SYMBIOSIS Vol. 47, No. 1 (2009), pp. 51–58 Margulis later argued that "there's no evidence that HIV is an infectious virus" and that AIDS symptoms "overlap ... completely" with those of syphilis.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://discover.coverleaf.com/discovermagazine/201104?pg=68#pg72|title=Lynn Margulis: Q & A]|journal=Discover Magazine|date=April 2011|author=Teresi D|pages=66–70|accessdate=2011-04-14[/tpl] Seth Kalichman, HIV researcher and professor of psychology who spent a year infiltrating HIV denialist groups, cited her 2009 paper as an example of AIDS denialism "flourishing",[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7[/tpl] and argued that her "endorsement of HIV/AIDS denialism defies understanding." He also noted her position as a "9/11 Truth Seeker".[tpl]cite book|last=Kalichman|first=Seth C.|title=Denying AIDS: conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and human tragedy  By Seth C.

===Metamorphosis theory===

In 2009, via a then-standard publication-process known as "communicated submission", she was instrumental in getting the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) to publish a paper by Donald I. Williamson rejecting "the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor."[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0908357106[/tpl]http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=controversial-caterpillar-evolution-2009-10-29 Controversial caterpillar-evolution study formally rebutted, Scientific American Online  Williamson's paper provoked immediate response from the scientific community, including a countering paper in PNAS.[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0910229106[/tpl] Conrad Labandeira of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History said, "If I was reviewing paper I would probably opt to reject it," he says, "but I'm not saying it's a bad thing that this is published. What it may do is broaden the discussion on how metamorphosis works and…on…the origin of these very radical life cycles." But Duke University insect developmental biologist Fred Nijhout said that the paper was better suited for the "National Enquirer than the National Academy."[tpl]cite web|last=Borrell |first=Brendan |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=national-academy-as-national-enquirer |title=National Academy as National Enquirer ? PNAS Publishes Theory That Caterpillars Originated from Interspecies Sex |publisher=Scientific American |date= |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]  In September it was announced that PNAS would eliminate communicated submissions in July 2010. PNAS stated that the decision had nothing to do with the Williamson controversy.
