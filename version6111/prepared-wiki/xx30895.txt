==History==

Delta Air Lines was created as Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated, an aerial crop dusting operation, on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia. Formed with a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, the plane was deployed to combat the boll weevil in 1925. Delta Air Corporation owned the plane (now in the Southern Museum of Flight). The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana in 1925.  Collett E. Woolman, one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it Delta Air Service.  It began carrying passengers in late 1929. The single passenger sat in a chair placed in the bin where the pesticide was usually kept. The first routes were between Southeastern states.Jamil S. Zainaldin of the Georgia Humanities Council, "Delta Air Lines", The New Georgia Encyclopedia (updated May 31, 2007).
Delta grew through the addition of routes and the acquisition of other airlines. They replaced propeller planes with jets in the 1960s and entered international competition to Europe in the 1970s and across the Pacific in the 1980s. The logo of Delta Air Lines, originally unveiled in 1959, is reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8 airplanes. Often termed as the “widget” logo, the current version consists of two 3D triangles.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.famouslogos.net/delta-logo/ |title= Delta Air Lines Logo: Design and History|accessdate=August 31, 2011[/tpl]

===Predecessors===

The current Delta Air Lines is the result of many airline mergers over a period of more than 80 years. The most recent merger was with Northwest Airlines on October 29, 2008 and at the time formed the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept).[tpl]cite news| title=Delta, Northwest approved to fly under single operating certificate| url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2009/12/delta-northwest-approved-to-fly-under-single-operating-certificate/13205/1| date=31 December 2009| work=USA Today| author=Rebecca Heslin| publisher=usatoday.com| accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl] Delta completed the integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010 when their reservation systems and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines name and brand were officially retired.[tpl]cite news| title=Delta-Northwest Merger’s Long and Complex Path| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/business/19air.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0| author=Jad Mouawad| date=18 May 2011| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]

==Operations==

===Headquarters and offices===

Delta's corporate headquarters is located on a corporate campus on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta.[tpl]cite news| author=William E.

This location has served as Delta's headquarters since 1941, when the company relocated its corporate offices from Monroe, Louisiana to Greater Atlanta.Markiewicz, David.

Associated Press at St. Louis Post-Dispatch. September 1, 1988. 11A. Retrieved on December 27, 2009. Prior to 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an  [tpl]convert|80|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated Fulton County. On August 3, 1981 the Atlanta City Council approved the annexation of [tpl]convert|141|acres|ha=on[/tpl] of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981 the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal."Delta suing City of Atlanta." Associated Press at Rome News-Tribune. Wednesday September 2, 1981. p. 10A. Retrieved from Google News (6 of 29) on December 19, 2013. The City of Atlanta was only permitted to annex areas that are adjacent to areas already in the Atlanta city limits.
In addition to hosting Delta's corporate headquarters, Hartsfield-Jackson is also the home of Delta TechOps, Delta's Technical Operations Center, which is the airline's primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm and the largest full-service airline MRO in North America, specializing in engines, components, airframe and line maintenance.[tpl]cite web | url=http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/suppliers/delta-techops | title=Capa Centre For Aviation | accessdate=2013-05-22[/tpl]

===Branding===

Delta's current livery, "Upward & Onward", uses four colors. It features a "widget" (triangle) on each aircraft's vertical stabilizer to refer to Delta's origins as a carrier in the Mississippi Delta.[tpl]cite news| author=Jad Mouawad| title=On Jet Exteriors, a Parade of Vanilla| work=The New York Times| date=23 December 2011| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/business/on-the-exterior-of-jetliners-a-parade-of-plain-vanilla.html?_r=1&ref=business| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]
The previous livery, "Colors in Motion", used eight colors. Delta introduced its current branding in 2007 after it emerged from bankruptcy. The switch from the previous livery to the current livery removed one day from each aircraft's painting cycle, allowing the airline to save money. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines. The triangle logo, known internally as "the Widget", was introduced in 1959. It was not part of the "Colors in Motion" livery, but returned with the current livery.

===Air France–KLM and Alitalia joint venture===

Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major airline alliances including SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia. The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frequentbusinesstraveler.com/2012/01/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-of-deltaair-france-klm-joint-venture/ |title=EU Launches Antitrust Probe of Delta/Air France-KLM Joint Venture |publisher=Frequentbusinesstraveler.com |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-05[/tpl] On January 27, 2012, the European Commission launched an investigation into the impact of the joint venture on competition on the routes that it covers.

===Joint venture with Virgin Atlantic===

On December 11, 2012 Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic.  These share were previously held by Singapore Airlines.  As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated.  As of the announcement, the two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport).http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=1822  The two airlines applied for antitrust immunity with the United States Department of Transportation and immunity was granted on September 23, 2013http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=2114

==Fleet==

[tpl]As of|2013|01|[/tpl], Delta operates a fleet of more than 700 aircraft manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas.[tpl]cite web|title=Stats & Facts|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&cat=47|publisher=Delta Air Lines|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=January 2013[/tpl] The carrier operates the largest fleets of Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A330 aircraft of any US airline. Delta operates the largest fleet of McDonnell Douglas MD-88 and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft in the world. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft; Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger.
Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. As of February 2014, the average age of a Delta airliner is 17 years; [tpl]As of|2012|3|31|df=US[/tpl], the average age of the Delta fleet was 15.8 years, excluding grounded aircraft and those operated by contract carriers. The oldest aircraft in the fleet is the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s with an average age of 21.7 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.delta.com/about_delta/corporate_information/delta_stats_facts/aircraft_fleet/index.jsp |title=Aircraft Fleet |date=March 19, 2011 |work=delta.com |publisher=Delta Air Lines, Inc |accessdate=May 12, 2011[/tpl] Delta buys older airplanes as sources for spare parts. However, Delta is replacing some of the oldest airplanes in its fleet. To replace the DC-9s, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft in their fleet, Delta began discussing narrowbody replacement plans with manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier in early 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |title=Delta prepares for full narrowbody analysis in early 2011  |first=Lori |last=Ranson |date=December 17, 2011 |work=Flight International  |publisher=Reed Business Information |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vlN8ScN7 |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |quote=...Delta president Ed Bastian said: "We clearly need to get the DC-9s retired.

As part of its strategy to utilize less expensive used airplanes, On May 22, 2012, Delta announced an agreement to lease 88 Boeing 717s from Southwest Airlines that Southwest inherited from its acquisition of AirTran Airways[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=1624 |title=Delta to Take Delivery of Boeing 717 Aircraft Upon Ratification of Pilot Tentative Agreement [tpl]pipe[/tpl] Delta Air Lines News Archive |date=22 May 2012 |work=Delta Air Lines |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl] as replacements for the DC-9 aircraft and some 50-seat regional aircraft. Deliveries should begin in mid-2013 replacing some of Delta's over 250 CRJ-100 and -200 aircraft.
Delta's strategy has reaped dividends, both in financial performance and in flight performance.  Delta claims a flight dispatch rate in 2013 of 99.7%; its fleet had 120 days without a single maintenance failure.  That included the month of October 2013, when Delta recorded no domestic flight cancellations.  Delta posted a profit of $2.7 billion, the highest of any US carrier in 2013.Broderick, Sean, Better with age, Aviation Week and Space Technology, February 17, 2014, p.19
Delta officially retired the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 from its fleet on January 6, 2014; however, the DC-9 was used on an as needed basis until January 22, 2014 when the last DC-9 was removed from service.[tpl]cite web|last=Harty|first=Jack|title=End of an Era: Delta’s DC-9 Completes Final Scheduled Flight|url=http://airchive.com/blog/2014/01/06/dc-9-completes-final-scheduled-flight/|publisher=Airchive|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Harty|first=Jack|title=It’s Over: Delta Officially Retires the DC-9|url=http://airchive.com/blog/2014/01/23/delta-dc-9-officially-retired/|publisher=Airchive|accessdate=25 January 2014[/tpl]  Delta was the final US carrier operating the McDonnell Douglas DC-9.http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/11/travel/dc9-retirement/

Delta ended this buy on board program in 2005; instead, Delta began offering snacks at no extra charge on flights over 90 minutes to most U.S. domestic flights and some flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Beginning in mid-March 2005 the airline planned to stop providing pillows on flights within the 49 contiguous U.S. states, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America. In addition the airline announced that on Delta mainline flights the price of alcoholic beverages would increase from $4 ($[tpl]inflation|USD|4|2005|r=2[/tpl] when adjusted for inflation) to $5 ($[tpl]inflation|USD|5|2005|r=2[/tpl] when adjusted for inflation); the increase in alcohol prices did not occur on Song flights.

===In-flight entertainment===

====History====

In the 1960s audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the Lockheed L-1011, Boeing 767-200, and 767-300 fleet, had movies projected on to the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, CRT monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first IFE system with LCD monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the Rockwell Collins Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as Delta on Demand.[tpl]cite web |url=http://entertainment.delta.com/on_demand/ |title=In-flight Entertainment on your Delta flights |work= Delta Air Lines |accessdate=September 16, 2011[/tpl]
In the spring of 2010, Delta installed the Panasonic eFX AVOD system in Economy on six 767-300ERs that are used on routes that are 12 hours or longer.[tpl]cite web|author=2:10 am |url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1007665-767-international-fleet-seating-update.html |title=767 International Fleet seating update |publisher=Flyertalk.com |accessdate=July 7, 2011[/tpl] Delta also announced it would be installing AVOD in Economy class on all Boeing 767-300ER and 747 aircraft over the next 3 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=870|title=Delta to Invest in Customer Experience, Fleet Efficiency – Jan 25, 2010|publisher=News.delta.com|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl]

These seats will also be installed on the Boeing 757-300 and new Boeing 737-900ER fleet, and will replace the existing seats and monitors on the international Boeing 757-200 fleet.
In 2012, Delta began replacing the overhead CRT monitors on the pre-merger Delta 757-200 fleet with new LCD monitors.[tpl]cite web|author=12:32 pm |url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1239128-no-ptvs-regular-pmdl-752s-new-lcds-instead-2.html |title=No PTVs for regular PMDL 752s, new LCDs instead |publisher=Flyertalk.com |accessdate=2012-04-05[/tpl]  This was completed in late 2012.
The 767-400ER fleet initially featured LCDs over the aisles, but were replaced in 2009 by the Panasonic eFX AVOD system when the last of the 767-400ERs were converted from domestic to international use. CRT projectors were originally featured in economy class on Boeing 767–300s, with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are now in the process of being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system.
When Delta's ex-TWA ETOPS 757s were first delivered, they featured a system made by Sony Transcom (a former subsidiary of Sony now sold to Rockwell Collins) system that was factory installed for TWA. The system featured overhead drop-down LCD monitors similar to Delta's non-Transcon 737-800s and 757-300s. Delta replaced the Sony Transcom system with the Panasonic eFX system featuring in-seat video and AVOD at the same time as the new BusinessElite seats and slimline economy class seats were installed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.delta.com/2007/08/31/enhancing-the-entertainment-experience/#comment-122|title=Enhancing the Entertainment Experience|author=Chris Babb|date=September 2, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]

====Current fleet====

Audio and video are available on all aircraft except for the Airbus A320, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and MD-90, selected Boeing 757, and Delta Connection aircraft. Boeing 777-200ER, 777-200LR, and 747 aircraft, along with those 767-300 and A330 aircraft that have completed cabin modifications, feature the Panasonic eX2 system. Compared to the older eFX system, this offers greater storage capacity, as well as larger personal video screens.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Inflight/default.aspx?Action=-1000945703&ID=32c250df-e45e-42d1-9747-bac853a0dd69|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071107110406/http://www.shephard.co.uk/Inflight/default.aspx?Action=-1000945703&ID=32c250df-e45e-42d1-9747-bac853a0dd69|archivedate=November 7, 2007|title=US majors get with the cabin-upgrade programme|accessdate=December 16, 2006|publisher=Shepard Group|date=December 16, 2006[/tpl] Boeing 767-400ER aircraft, selected 757-200 aircraft, as well as the remaining internationally configured Boeing 767-300ER aircraft that have not completed cabin modifications, use the Panasonic eFX AVOD system. On these 767-300 aircraft, AVOD is available only in BusinessElite, while the system includes overhead LCD monitors and audio programming for passengers seated in the Economy cabin. The unmodified Airbus A330  aircraft feature the Panasonic 3000i AVOD system in all cabins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Delta-Air-Lines/Airbus-A330-323X/1934632/L/ |title=Delta A330-300 Cabin [tpl]pipe[/tpl] |publisher=Airliners.net |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05[/tpl]  This system includes supplemental LCD monitors over the aisles for displaying the safety video and moving map.
Domestic Boeing 767–300s, Boeing 737–700s, as well as selected transcontinental Boeing 757–200s and selected Boeing 737–800s using the Panasonic eFX system, also feature live television via Dish Network in both first class and economy.  Some Boeing 737-800s, as well as all Boeing 757–300s feature systems with drop-down LCD displays below the overhead bins.[tpl]cite web|last=No |first=Brisan |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/brisan/2242036182/ |title=Delta 737–800 Cabin [tpl]pipe[/tpl] Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2012-04-05[/tpl]
All aircraft with AVOD feature Panasonic's iXplor moving map program.  737-800s with overhead video and the coach sections of 767-300ER aircraft with overhead video feature the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map, which is often shown during takeoff and landing.  Other aircraft formerly equipped with the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map included the Lockheed L-1011-250 and -500, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, and Boeing 767-400ER and 777-200ER.  The L-1011 and MD-11 fleet have since been retired, while the 767-400ER and 777-200ER have since had their Airshow systems replaced by the Panasonic iXplor system built into the eFX and eX2 AVOD systems.

Delta has had many slogans throughout its history:

==Environmental initiatives==

In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Design for the Environment (DfE) program for their use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.
PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.[tpl]cite web|title=Delta Air Lines Accepts EPA Award for Use of Nontoxic Materials on Aircraft|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|work=Delta Air Lines News Release|publisher=Delta Air Lines|accessdate=March 18, 2011[/tpl]

Although Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was listed as a Northwest Airlines flight, the aircraft bore the Delta livery during the transitional period after the merger and therefore was reported in some media as a Delta flight.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Hijackings===

There have been over a dozen attempted hijackings which resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the often lone hijacker. These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or success in forcing the aircraft to fly to another country:
