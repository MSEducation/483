Coprophagia [tpl]IPAc-en|k|ɒ|p|.|r|ə|.|ˈ|f|eɪ|.|dʒ|i|.|ə[/tpl]Coprophagia. (2012). Dictionary.com September 2, 2012, from link or coprophagy is the consumption of feces.  The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος copros, "feces" and φαγεῖν phagein, "to eat".  Many animal species eat feces as a normal behavior; other species may not normally consume feces but do so under unusual conditions. Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces eating including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics),of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy), those once deposited or taken directly from the anus.[tpl]cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x[/tpl]

==In animals==

===Invertebrates===

Coprophagous insects consume and redigest the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested food (herbivores' digestive systems are especially inefficient).  A notable feces-eating insect is the dung-beetle and the most common is the fly.
Termites eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their hindgut protists. Termites and protists have a symbiotic relationship (e.g. with the protozoan Mixotricha paradoxa) that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet via the protists. It has also been proposed that hormones are passed to offspring in this way.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===Vertebrates===

Pigs sometimes eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semi-digested matter, including their own. In some cultures, it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed their pigs. However, allowing domestic pigs to consume feces contributes to the risk of parasite infection.  The pig toilet is an ancient method of feeding pigs on garbage and human feces, and is used in China.
Cattle in the United States are often fed chicken litter due to the high amount of protein and low cost of the feed compared to other sources of protein. It has been reported that this process is made safe in regards to bacteria loading by heating the chicken litter to [tpl]convert|160|F|C[/tpl] prior to consumption. There are, however, concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed bone meal in chicken feed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into livestock feed.FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle, 2009-11-02, L.A. Times Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.
Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and some other related species are hindgut fermenters which digest cellulose by microbial fermentation.  In addition, they extract further nutrition from grass by ingesting their feces meaning their food passes through the gut a second time. Soft fecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. Consuming these cecotropes (or night feces produced in the cecum), is important for obtaining vitamin B12, which intestinal bacteria produce from Cobalt salts. Vitamin B12 must then be re-introduced to the digestive system since only the stomach (and not the intestines) is capable of absorbing vitamin B12. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.
The young of elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation found on their ecosystems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature — Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl] When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are sterile).  Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.
Gorillas eat their own feces and the feces of other gorillas. Similar behavior has also been observed among chimpanzees.  Such behavior may serve to improve absorption of vitamins or of nutritive elements made available from the re-ingestion of seeds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29[/tpl]
Hamsters, guinea pigs and chinchillas eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of vitamins B and K, produced by bacteria in the gut. Apes have been observed eating horse feces for the salt content. Monkeys have been observed eating elephant feces. Coprophagia has also been observed in the naked mole rat.
Mother cats are known to eat the feces of their newborn kittens during the earliest phase after birth, presumably to eliminate cues to potential predators and to keep the den clean.
Some domesticated and wild mammals are known to consume feces. In the wild they either bury or eat waste to protect their trail from predators.

Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes, obtain nourishment from the feces of commensal animals.

===In medicine===

Fecal bacteriotherapy is when feces from a close relative or spouse are given to patients suffering from intractable diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile. The objective is to repopulate the intestines with the normal gut flora (intestinal bacteria) which kill the clostridium. The healthy stool is administered by nasogastric tube, enema, or in a capsule.
Consuming other people's feces carries the risk of contracting diseases and bacteria spread such as E. coli, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, pneumonia, polio, and influenza. Coprophagia also carries a risk of contracting intestinal parasites.
Lewin reported that "... consumption of fresh, warm camel feces has been recommended by Bedouins as a remedy for bacterial dysentery; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic subtilisin from Bacillus subtilis) was confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II".[tpl]cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 [/tpl]
The introduction of foreign bacteria into the human gastrointestinal tract via infusion of fecal enemas is an established medical practice in cases of ulcerative colitis, especially where the patient's own intestinal flora has been significantly depleted by prior use of antibiotics.Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Using Fecal Bacteriotherapy.

===In sex===

Some human coprophiles engage in coprophagia as a sexual fetish. Until 1995, the only documented cases of coprophagia in humans were those with schizophrenia or other mental illness, but it has now been shown to occur among mentally healthy individuals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wise TN, Goldberg RL |title=Escalation of a fetish: Coprophagia in a nonpsychotic adult of normal intelligence |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=272–75 |year=1995 |doi=10.1080/00926239508414647 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926239508414647 |pmid=8789509[/tpl] Psychiatrists using the classification system of the DSM-IV would consider this a symptom of the paraphilia called coprophilia - "if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning". Coprophagia is also depicted in pornography, usually under the term scat (from scatology).[tpl]cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |pages= p. 244[/tpl]
