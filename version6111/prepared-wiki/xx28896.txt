==History==

DJs Daddy G and Andrew Vowles and graffiti artist-turned-rapper Robert Del Naja met as members of partying collective The Wild Bunch. One of the first homegrown soundsystems in the UK, The Wild Bunch became dominant on the Bristol club scene in the mid-1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13625/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Massive Attack > Biography|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-20|last=Ankeny|first=Jason[/tpl]
Massive Attack started as a spin-off production trio in 1988, with the independently released song, "Any Love", sung by falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy,[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Carlton|title=Carlton Discography|publisher=discogs|accessdate=2009-05-21[/tpl]

In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003/4.

===Any Love beginnings===

Unsigned, Mushroom (Andy Vowles), Daddy G (Grant Marshall) and 3D (Robert Del Naja) put out "Any Love" as a single,[tpl]cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/ExtSearch.asp?DiscArtist=Massive-Attack|title=Massive Attack Discography – Page 1|publisher=eil.com|quote=Any Love (Mega rare 1988 UK self released debut 2-track 12" on Massive Attack Records, includes Bonus Version, stickered sleeve MASS001)|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] co-produced by Bristol double-act Smith & Mighty. 

===Blue Lines and "Unfinished Sympathy"'s impact===

3D co-wrote Neneh Cherry's "Manchild",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/vhvr|title=BBC – Music – Review of Neneh Cherry Raw Like Sushi|publisher=BBC|quote=The offbeat, ambient ballad Manchild (co-written with Massive Attack's 3D)|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Taylor|first=Angus[/tpl] which peaked at number 5 in the UK single chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120305174245/http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=16207 |title=Neneh Cherry – Manchild |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl] Cameron McVey and Neneh Cherry helped them to record their first LP Blue Lines, partly in their house, and the album was released in 1991 on Virgin Records.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r12541|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=allmusic ((( Blue Lines > Overview )))|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Bush|first=John[/tpl]
The album used vocalists including Horace Andy and Shara Nelson, a former Wild Bunch cohort. MC's Tricky and Willie Wee, also once part of The Wild Bunch, featured, as well as Daddy G's voice on "Five Man Army". Neneh Cherry sang backing vocals on environmentalist anthem, "Hymn of the Big Wheel".
That year they released "Unfinished Sympathy" as a single, a string-arranged track at Abbey Road studio, scored by Will Malone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/artists/andrea-parker|title=Andrea Parker|work=NME|quote=Will Malone, who had worked on horror film soundtracks and Massive Attack's classic "Unfinished Sympathy".|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] that went on to be voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by The Guardian.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/nov/08/millennium.uk1|title=How Robbie headed Amadeus in the race to be music's man of the millennium|work=The Guardian|date=8 November 1999|quote=Best song: 10. Unfinished Sympathy – Massive Attack.  |accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Wells|first=Matt| location=London[/tpl]
The group temporarily shortened their name to "Massive" on the advice of McVey to avoid controversy relating to the Gulf War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/whatson/unfinishedsympathy.shtml|title=BBC – Radio 2 – Sold on Song – Brits25 – Unfinished Sympathy|publisher=BBC|quote=Reaching number thirteen in the UK in 1991, Unfinished Sympathy was released under the group name Massive, due to the Gulf War of the same year|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] They went back to being "Massive Attack" for their next single, "Safe from Harm".

===Protection and Melankolic===

After Shara Nelson left, the band brought in Everything but the Girl's Tracey Thorn as a vocalist.
With McVey out of the picture, Massive Attack enlisted the production talents of ex-Wild Bunch Nellee Hooper to co-produce some songs on it, with Mushroom. Other tracks were co-produced by The Insects and 3D. A dub version, No Protection, was released the following year by Mad Professor. Protection won a Brit award for Best Dance Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/massive_attack/|title=Massive Attack presented in Music section|publisher=newsfinder.org|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] The other collaborators on Protection were Marius de Vries, Craig Armstrong, a Scottish classical pianist, and Tricky. Tricky's solo career was taking off at this time and he decided not to collaborate with Massive Attack after this.
1994-5 was also the period of Portishead's Dummy and Tricky's Maxinquaye albums and the term "trip hop" was coined.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/arts/pop-view-another-city-another-new-sound.html|title=POP VIEW; Another City, Another New Sound|work=The New York Times|date=28 May 1995|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Reynolds|first=Simon[/tpl] The media started to refer to the "Bristol scene".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/maryannehobbs/bristol.shtml|title=Bristol: Rise Up|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Slinger|first=Benjamin[/tpl]
In 1995, Massive Attack started a label distributed by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong and number of other artists such as Horace Andy, Alpha, Sunna, and Day One. The trio espoused a non-interference philosophy that allowed the artists to make their albums in the way they wanted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://melankolic.astralwerks.com/ |title=This is melankolic records (archived at web.archive.org)|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030210154818/http://melankolic.astralwerks.com/ |archivedate = 10 February 2003[/tpl]
The same year The Insects became unavailable for co-production and having parted ways with Nellee Hooper, the band were introduced to Neil Davidge,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A963542|title=BBC – collective – Massive Attack interview transcript part 3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] a relatively unknown producer whose main claim to fame thus far had been an association with anonymous dance-pop outfit DNA. The first track they worked on was "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game", a cover version sung by Tracey Thorn for the Batman Forever soundtrack. Initially, Davidge was brought in as engineer, but soon became producer.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.neildavidge.com/additional/soundonsound.html | title=Sound on Sound | accessdate=2013-06-13 | author=Davidge, Neil[/tpl]
The trio increasingly fractured in the lead up to the third album, Davidge having to co-produce the three producers' ideas separately. Mushroom was reported to be unhappy with the degree of the post-punk direction in which Del Naja, increasingly filling the production vacuum, was taking the band.
In 1997, the group contributed to the film soundtrack of The Jackal, recording "Superpredators (Metal Postcard)", a number containing a sample of Siouxsie and the Banshees' "Mittageisen"Massive Attack copyright of the song "Superpredators" and "Dissolved Girl", a new song with vocals by Sarah Jay (which was later remixed for the next album).
Later that year they released a single, "Risingson", from what would be their third album, Mezzanine.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r348738|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=allmusic ((( Mezzanine > Overview )))|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Bush|first=John[/tpl]

===Mezzanine, Teardrop, the Vowles split and Marshall's absence===

Mezzanine was their most commercially successful, selling nearly 4 million copies. Angelo Bruschini became their permanent lead guitarist both in recording and live.
The lead single, after "Risingson" was "Teardrop", sung by Cocteau Twin Elizabeth Fraser. The song was accompanied by a video directed by Walter Stern, of an animatronic singing fetus. Horace Andy was invited back to sing on three songs, including "Angel" and a track the band made for the film The Jackal, "Dissolved Girl", sung by Sara Jay, was remixed for inclusion on the record.
Mezzanine went on to win a Q Award for Best Album[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/awardq.html|title=The Q Awards|publisher=everyhit.com|accessdate=2009-05-22[/tpl] as well as being nominated for a Mercury Award. 
Touring extensively, friction between Mushroom and the others came to a head. Mushroom was unhappy with the direction of the group, Del Naja's dominating role and having to appear on tour.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/may/11/urbanmusic.culture|title=Massive Attack talk to Miranda Sawyer|work=The Observer|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=2009-05-20|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda| location=London[/tpl]
Around this time, Del Naja, with Davidge decanted into Ridge Farm studio with friends and band members of Lupine Howl (made up of former members of the band Spiritualized, including Damon Reece who went on to be Massive Attack's permanent drummer and one of two live drummers) towards a fourth Massive Attack LP, taking things even further into an experimental, psychedelic rock direction.
2001 also saw the release of Eleven Promos, a DVD of all Massive Attack's 11 music videos thus far, including "Angel", a £100,000+ promo[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r1215456|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=allmusic ((( Collected/Rarities/Eleven Promos > Overview )))|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Jurek|first=Thom[/tpl]

===Del Naja's 100th Window, Marshall's return and Collected===

With Daddy G temporarily no longer involved in the studio, Davidge and Del Naja steered "LP4" on their own. Enlisting the vocals of Sinéad O'Connor and Horace Andy, 100th Window was mastered in August 2002 and released in February 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r620022|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=allmusic ((( 100th Window > Overview )))|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Bush|first=John[/tpl]
Featuring no samples or cover versions, 100th Window was not as critically well received in Britain as the other records, although the album received a warmer reception internationally; scoring a 75 out of 100 on review aggregation site Metacritic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/massiveattack/100thwindow?q=massive%20attack|title=100th Window[/tpl] The group also collaborated with Mos Def on the track "I Against I", which appeared on the "Special Cases" single and the soundtrack for Blade II. "I Against I" is also notable as the only track from the 100th Window sessions that features a writing credit from Daddy G.
Also in 2003, Del Naja was arrested on child porn allegations, which were reported widely in the media.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/feb/27/arts.childprotection|title=Police question musician over child porn|work=The Guardian|date=27 February 2003|accessdate=2009-05-22|last=Staff| location=London[/tpl] Del Naja was soon eliminated as a suspect[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/22/1047749989803.html|title=Police clear Massive Attack star in child porn inquiry|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 March 2003|accessdate=2009-05-22|last1=Barnes|first1=Anthony|last2=Marshall|first2=Nina[/tpl] (although he was charged with ecstasy possession and unable to get a US visa for a while) with Daddy G and fans proffering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of the 100th Window tour schedule.
Despite the difficulties of 2003, 100th Window sold over a million copies and was toured extensively (including Queen Square, Bristol – a one-off sell out concert set up in the city centre park, which was seen as a homecoming).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/goingout/2003/08/26/massive_review.shtml|title=BBC – Going Out in Bristol – Massive Attack wow home crowd|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-20[/tpl]
Afterwards, Del Naja and Davidge agreed to an offer from director Louis Leterrier, to score the entire soundtrack for Danny The Dog, starring Jet Li. Dot Allison, who had sung with the band on the 100th Window tour, sang the end titles track, "Aftersun". Davidge also scored the soundtrack for the Bullet Boy film, with Del Naja on the end titles.
In 2005, Daddy G started coming into the studio, although little came of the material. He decided to instead work with a production duo, Robot Club, in another studio, feeling that he would be more free to develop tracks in the way he wanted. Meanwhile, Del Naja and Davidge recorded with a number of different singers as well as creating a track named "Twilight", for UNKLE's War Stories album. Later that year, Massive Attack decided to release their contractually obliged compilation album Collected in 2006. They released it with a second disc, made up of previously released non-album songs and unreleased sketches.

==="Weather Underground" / Heligoland era===

In 2007, Del Naja and Davidge scored three soundtracks, In Prison My Whole Life (which featured a track called "Calling Mumia" with vocals by American rapper Snoop Dogg), Battle in Seattle and Trouble the Water.
In February 2007, Massive Attack hosted a charity benefit for the Hoping Foundation, a charity for Palestinian children, cementing their reputation as one of Britain's politically engaged bands. In 2008, it was announced that Massive Attack were to curate the UK's Southbank Meltdown, a week-long event. It was suggested in interviews that this event would inspire Massive Attack back into action, having spent several years drifting towards the completion of their fifth studio album.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/feb/15/news.uk|title=Meltdown launches Massive Attack as festival curators|work=The Guardian|date=15 February 2008|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Gibson|first=Owen|location=London[/tpl]
Later that year, Del Naja and Daddy G headed to Damon Albarn's studios for some writing and jamming. Around this time, Davidge scored the soundtrack for a Paul McGuigan film, Push and in December, Del Naja completed the score for 44 Inch Chest with The Insects and Angelo Badalamenti.
Davidge and Del Naja got back together in 2009 with Daddy G to finish the fifth album, incorporating bits of the Albarn material. Later it was announced that the band were to headline the 2009 Bestival festival and soon after that they were to tour the UK[tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120229232037/http://www.seetickets.com/massiveattack/event.asp?e|title=Massive Attack|publisher=seetickets.com|accessdate=2009-05-21[/tpl] and Europe,
In May, Robert Del Naja's instrumental "Herculaneum", featured in the film Gomorra, won an Italian award for Best Song. Later that month, Del Naja and Marshall picked up a special Ivor Novello award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268565/massive-attack-to-return-with-huge-world-tour|title=Massive Attack to Return with Huge World Tour|work=Billboard|accessdate=2009-05-25[/tpl]
On 29 May Jonny Dollar died of cancer aged 45, survived by his wife and 4 children. Dollar was the programmer and hands-on producer behind Blue Lines, writing some of the melodies that were the basis for the string arrangements "Unfinished Sympathy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1037855&c=1|title=Blue Lines producer dies|publisher=musicweek.com|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl]
On 25 August their new EP, Splitting the Atom, was announced. The other new tracks on the EP were revealed to be Tunde Adebimpe's "Pray For Rain", Martina Topley-Bird's "Psyche" and Guy Garvey's "Bulletproof Love". The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the intended album versions and none of "LP5"'s tracks are expected to resemble the versions that were played on the previous tour, with some songs, such as "Dobro", dropped altogether.
"LP5" was finished on 12 November 2009, and it was called Heligoland, after the German archipelago of Heligoland. Del Naja said "I think it's got definitely a more organic feel".[tpl]cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Massive+Attack%3A+Heligoland+/|title=Interview w/ Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja re.

===New album and the return of Tricky===

In a 2013 interview for his first solo art show since 2008, Del Naja confirmed that not only was a new Massive Attack album in the works, but that rumors of a reunion with Tricky were indeed true.[tpl]cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/05/23/massive-attacks-robert-del-naja-confirms-tricky-reunion-ahead-of-art-show-3804789 |title=Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja confirms Tricky reunion ahead of art show |publisher=Metro News |accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl] Tricky hasn't been featured on a Massive Attack album since 1994's Protection.

On 5 February 2014, it was confirmed that Massive Attack would headline at Secret Solstice, a new music festival in Reykjavík on 20 June through 22 June.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsoficeland.com/entertainment/music/item/319-massive-attack-will-perform-at-secret-solstice-in-iceland-next-summer |title=Massive Attack will perform at Secret Solstice in Iceland next summer |publisher=News of Iceland |accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl]

==Musical style==

Some of their most noted songs have been without choruses and have featured dramatically atmospheric dynamics, conveyed through either distorted guitar crescendos, lavish orchestral arrangements or prominent, looped/shifting basslines, underpinned by high and exacting production values, involving sometimes copious digital editing and mixing. The pace of their music has often been slower than prevalent British dance music at the time. These and other psychedelic, soundtrack-like and DJist sonic techniques, formed a much-emulated style journalists began to dub "trip hop" from the mid-nineties onwards,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2644|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Trip Hop|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-20[/tpl] though in an interview in 2006, G said, "We used to hate that terminology trip-hop so bad,' laughs. 'You know, as far we were concerned, Massive Attack music was unique, so to put it in a box was to pigeonhole it and to say, "Right, we know where you guys are coming from."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hour.ca/music/music.aspx?iIDArticle=10216|title=Massive Attack in Montreal, September 11|work=Hour|publisher=Communications Voir Inc.|date=7 September 2006|accessdate=2009-05-26|last=Tousignant|first=Isa[/tpl]

==Other projects==

==='Fire Sale' exhibition===

Del Naja's solo art show was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, UK from 24 May to 22 June 2013. The show's content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off 'digital infinity mirrors', two of which contained phrases supplied by Reprieve that were extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed as a DJ during the opening night on 23 May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lazinc.com/exhibitions/582,3d-fire-sale|title=Exhibition 3D: Fire Sale|publisher=Lazarides|accessdate=2013-10-26[/tpl]

===Massive Attack vs Adam Curtis===

Del Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker Adam Curtis—in collaboration with UVA (United Visual Artists)— that premiered in Manchester, UK in July 2013.
