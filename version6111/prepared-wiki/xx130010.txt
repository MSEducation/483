Nevow (pronounced like the French nouveau) is a Python web application framework originally developed by the company Divmod.  Template substitution is achieved via a small Tag Attribute Language, which is usually embedded in on-disk XML templates, though there is also a pure-Python domain-specific language called Stan, for expressing this markup programmatically.  Nevow integrates well with Twisted, a framework for event-driven programming.
Nevow had 960 unit tests as of June 2008,Running Nevow on top of PyPy, June 20, 2008, PyPy Status Blog and was deployed on several high-profile web sites, most notably the official Python site.PythonWebsitePyramidDocs, Pyramid is the internal website templating system used to build the python.org pages. (It is not connected to the Pyramid web framework, formerly named BFG, that's used with Pylons.) Pyramid uses Nevow as its templating system and YAML as the format for its file based data - PythonInfo Wiki, python.org

==Athena==

Athena is a Nevow component which facilitates bi-directional, asynchronous communication between the Python and Javascript portions of a web application in the form of remote procedure calls.  This technique is typically called Ajax or Comet, though Nevow's implementation predates both of these labels.History, Nevow Athena from Scratch, or The Evolution of a Chat Application â€” Divmod Nevow vtrunk documentation  Athena also includes an inheritance-based Javascript object system, which forms the basis of a client-side widget abstraction, module system and in-browser unit testing kit.
