One example is Nightline — student-run listening and information services, based at universities across the country, offer a night time support service for students. Each service is run specifically for students at a particular university/geographical area, and most Nightlines are members of the Nightline Association, a registered charity in England and Wales.
Another example is Aware — a national voluntary organisation, based in Ireland, which provides supports to individuals who experience depression with their families and friends. Aware provides a Helpline service, as well as nationwide Support Groups and monthly lectures, which seek to educate and increase awareness of depression.Aware.ie
