Blastoise, known in Japan as [tpl]nihongo|Kamex|カメックス|Kamekkusu[/tpl], is a Water type Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Blastoise first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Its name is composed by the words "Blast" and "Tortoise" and is also a pun as "Blast Toys".

==Concept and characteristics==

Blastoise was one of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Originally called "Kamex" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|work=TIME|accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html |archivedate=2008-09-13[/tpl]
Blastoise, known as the Shellfish Pokémon, is the final stage in Squirtle evolution. It takes on an appearance radically different from its previous forms; the most obvious change is the addition of two retractable cannons on its shell. It is also a girthier and more imposing figure: the shape of its head is completely reformed; its limbs are now stout and segmented, bearing visible claws; and its once sought-after tail is short and somewhat stubby. The afore-mentioned cannon spouts are remarkable adaptations, allowing a Blastoise to shoot water with great power and accuracy. The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel,[tpl]Pokédex|diamond|The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.[/tpl] while their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet.Pokédex: The waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate.

Blastoise can be found living on island beaches near the ocean, but their preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes.

==Appearances==

===In the video games===

Blastoise first appeared in Pokémon Red and Blue as a Pokémon obtained by evolving the Pokémon Squirtle through leveling up. Squirtle is obtained at the beginning of the game where players may choose from it, Bulbasaur, or Charmander. It is the mascot for the Blue version. It also appears in the remakes Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Since then, Blastoise has appeared in each main Pokémon title. Outside of the main series, Blastoise is seen in Pokémon Pinball, Pokémon Trozei!, the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon titles, the Pokémon Ranger titles, Pokémon Rumble, and PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. Blastoise also appears in Super Smash Bros. Melee as both a Pokémon that can be summoned from the Poké Ball item to use against opponents and a collectible trophy. Blastoise is one of several Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y that will able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming Mega Blastoise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/ |title=Mega Pokémon |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2013-09-04[/tpl] It was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and Y. Squirtle (along with Bulbasaur and Charmander) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Blastoise's Mega Evolution.[tpl]cite web |title=Pokemon X/Y: WHY?!

===In the manga===

In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Green stole a Squirtle from Prof. Oak's Lab. This Squirtle ultimately becomes a Blastoise, nicknamed Blasty, with a tricky personality like its owner, and becomes the major powerhouse on Green's team.[tpl]cite book |last=Kusaka |first=Hidenori |author2=Mato |title=Zap!

Green lent Blasty to Red to assist his journey on Mt. Silver. Blasty inherited the ultimate water attack, Hydro Cannon, directly from Kimberly, without requiring the Jump Path, Catch Path, and Battle Path to master the skills.
