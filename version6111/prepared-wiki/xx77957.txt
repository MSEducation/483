The MITRE Corporation (stylized as MITRE) is an American not-for-profit organization based in Bedford, Massachusetts and McLean, Virginia. It manages Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) supporting the Department of Defense (DOD), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on behalf of the Federal Judiciary, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

==History==

Under the leadership of C. W. Halligan, MITRE was formed in 1958 to provide overall direction to the companies and workers involved in the US Air Force SAGE project.  Most of the early employees were transferred to MITRE from the Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where SAGE was being developed.  In April 1959, a site was purchased in Bedford, Massachusetts near Hanscom Air Force Base, to develop a new MITRE laboratory, which MITRE occupied in September 1959.[tpl]Cite book| last = Redmond | first = Kent C. | coauthors = Thomas M.

After the SAGE project ended in the early 1960s, the FAA selected MITRE to develop a similar system to provide automated air traffic control.  The result of the project formed the National Airspace System (NAS), that is still in use today.  To support the NAS project and continual operations with the US Department of Defense at the Pentagon, MITRE opened a second "main office" in McLean, Virginia.
Through the 1960s, MITRE developed and supported military Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) projects, including the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).  MITRE also worked on a number of projects with ARPA, including precursors to the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ARPANET.  Since the 1960s, MITRE has developed or supported most DoD early warning and communications projects, including the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System JTIDS and the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System JSTARS.
During the 1980s, the German hacker Markus Hess used an un-secured MITRE Tymnet connection as an entry point for intrusions into US Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA computer networks.[tpl]Cite book| last = Stoll | first = Clifford | authorlink = Clifford Stoll | coauthors = | title = The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage | publisher = Doubleday | date = 1989-09-26 | isbn = 978-0-385-24946-1 [/tpl]
