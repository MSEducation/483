New Zealand is divided into sixteen regions for local government. Eleven are administered by regional councils (the top tier of local government), and five are administered by unitary authorities, which are territorial authorities (the second tier of local government) that also perform the functions of regional councils.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/info-about-2013-census-data/2013-census-definitions-forms/definitions/u.aspx |title=2013 Census definitions and forms: U |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |accessdate=30 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpgurl/Resources-Glossary-Index |title=Glossary |work= localcouncils.govt.nz |publisher= Department of Internal Affairs |accessdate=30 April 2014[/tpl] The Chatham Islands Council is similar to a unitary authority, authorised under its own legislation.Chatham Islands Council Act 1995, Parliament of New Zealand, 1995, Statute No 041,  Commenced: 1 November 1995, retrieved 4 February 2008.

===History and statutory basis===

A regional council means one of the regional councils listed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Local Government Act 2002,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0084/latest/DLM170881.html|title=Local Government Act 2002 No 84 - Interpretation|accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl]

The current regions and most of their councils came about as a result of an amalgamation procedure under the Local Government Act 1974. The regional councils replaced the more than 700 ad-hoc bodies that had been formed in the preceding century â€“ roads boards, catchment boards, drainage boards, pest control boards, harbour boards, domain and reserve boards.[tpl]cite book|author=Bush, Graham|year=1995|edition=2nd|title=Local Government & Politics in New Zealand |ISBN=1-86940-126-3 |publisher=Auckland University Press[/tpl] In addition they took over some roles which had previously been performed by county councils. Auckland Council, a unitary authority, was formed in 2010, replacing the Auckland Regional Council.
The boundaries of the regions are based largely on drainage basins. This anticipated the responsibilities of the Resource Management Act 1991.New Zealand Historical Atlas[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 98 Most regional boundaries conform with territorial authority boundaries but there are many exceptions. An example is Taupo District, split between four regions, although most of its area is in the Waikato Region.

===Responsibilities===

Regional authorities are primarily responsible for environmental management, including water, contaminant discharge and coastal management, river and lake management including flood and drainage control, regional land management; regional transport (including public transport) and harbours, biosecurity or pest management; while territorial authorities are responsible for: local-level land use management (urban and rural planning); network utility services such as water, sewerage, stormwater and solid waste management; local roads; libraries; parks and reserves; and community development.  Property rates (land taxes) are used to fund both regional and territorial government activities. There is often a high degree of co-operation between regional and territorial councils as they have complementary roles.

===Resource management functions===

Regional councils have these specific functions under the Resource Management Act 1991.

===Other functions===

Regional councils have responsibility for functions under other statutes;Harris, R. (2004) 'Local government and development legislation', Chapter 3G, Handbook of Environmental Law, Editor Harris, R., ISBN 0-9597851-8-3, Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, Wellington 2004, page 130.

===List of regions===

===Areas outside regional boundaries===

Some outlying islands are not included within regional boundaries. The Chatham Islands is not in a region, although its council has some of the powers of a regional council under the Resource Management Act. The Kermadecs and the sub-Antarctic islands are inhabited only by a small number of Department of Conservation staff, and the Conservation Minister is empowered to act as a regional council for these islands.

===Governance===

Regional councils are popularly elected every three years in accordance with the Local Electoral Act 2001.Local Government Act 2002, s41(1)(a), Parliament of New Zealand. Councils may use a first past the post or single transferable vote system. The chairperson is selected by the elected council members.Local Government Act 2002, s41(1)(b), Parliament of New Zealand.

==Predecessors of current regional structure==

===Auckland Regional Council===

===Wellington Region===

Wellington had a regional council, and earlier the Wellington Regional Planning Authority.

===United Councils===

In 1978, legislation was passed enabling the formation of regions with United Councils. 20 regions were designated, excluding the ARA and WRC areas. For most of the country this was the first regional level of government since the abolition of provinces in 1876.
United Councils were not directly elected bodies - they consisted of appointed councillors from the various Territorial Local Authorities within the region.
The only responsibilities mandated by the legislation were coordination of civil defence and development of a regional plan, although the constituent TLAs could agree on additional responsibilities at the point of formation of each United Council. For example, in a number of cases the United Council took responsibility for the allocation of revenue from regional petrol taxes.
The United Councils were based in the facilities of the largest TLA in the region and largely dependent on the TLAs for resources. They were allowed to levy rates but in most cases had minimal operating budgets (below $100,000 per annum). The notable exception was Canterbury, where the United Council had a number of responsibilities. Only one united council undertook any direct operational activity - a forestry project in Wanganui.
