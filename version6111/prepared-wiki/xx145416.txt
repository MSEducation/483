[[FINA Swimming World Cup]]

CATEGORIES: FINA Swimming World Cup, Recurring sporting events established in 1988

The FINA Swimming World Cup is an international series of short course (25Â m) swimming meets organized by FINA, the International Federation for swimming. The series was started in the 1988/1989, and is open to swimmers from FINA member countries.
The series has traditionally been held in the northern hemisphere's winter-time (October-February range), placing it within the normal short course competition times for many countries (with long course competition predominating in summer months). In some years, the World Cup has been held across a New Year's, leading to dual-year designations for a given series (e.g. "2004-2005 World Cup"), and in other years, the series has been held entirely on one side of a New Year's Day, leading to a single year description. This latter is the current format in place (e.g. the "2010 World Cup").
Currently, the overall 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers are awarded prize money.FINA/ARENA Swimming World Cup 2008 - Scoring

==Events==

The events are the same for all meets, but the competition order may vary. All events are swum prelims/finals, with the exception of the 800m and 1500m freestyle which are swum as timed finals (all swimmers swim just once). The meets are held over two days, with preliminary heats in the morning, and finals in the evening. A noted exception to this style are the meets held in Brazil, where prelims have been in the evening with finals the following morning (and hence a 3-day format).
