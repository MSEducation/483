[[Null cipher]]

CATEGORIES: Classical ciphers, Steganography

A null cipher is an ancient form of encryption where the plaintext is mixed with a large amount of non-cipher material. It would today be regarded as a simple form of steganography.  Null ciphers can also be used to hide ciphertext, as part of a more complex system.
In classical cryptography  a null is intended to confuse the cryptanalyst. Typically, a null will be a character which decrypts to obvious nonsense at the end of an otherwise intelligible phrase. In a null cipher, most of the characters may be nulls.
An example follows (Kipper 9):
Taking the first letter in each word successively yields the real message: "Newt is upset because he thinks he is President."
You can also choose to instead use the last letter of every word, or something like a pattern such as:
''Susan sAys GaIl Lies. MAtt leTs Susan fEel joVial. Elated (or) aNgry? ''
Using the pattern ( 1,2,3,1,2,3 letter in each word ) gives the message: "Sail at seven."
