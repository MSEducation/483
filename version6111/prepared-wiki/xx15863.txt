Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).
Radiohead released their debut single "Creep" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "OK Computer" Allmusic.

Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences.  Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead initially self-released their seventh album In Rainbows (2007) as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.

==History==

===Formation and first years (1985–91)===

The musicians who formed Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.[tpl]cite news| last =McLean| first =Craig| title =Don't worry, be happy| newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| date = 14 July 2003| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/13/1055220766407.html| accessdate =25 December 2007[/tpl] Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood were in the same year, Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway were one year older and Jonny Greenwood two years younger than his brother. In 1985 they formed the band "On a Friday", the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny Greenwood was the last to join, having previously been in a band called "Illiterate Hands", with Nigel Powell and Thom Yorke's brother, Andy Yorke.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/this-is-what-radiohead-looked-like-in-the-80s | title= This Is What Radiohead Looked Like In The ’80s | work=Buzzfeed| first=Luke | last=Lewis | date=24 March 2013 | accessdate=24 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url= http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/9-photos-of-artists-before-they-hit-the-big-time | title= 9 Photos Of Artists Before They Hit The Big Time | work=NME| first=Lucy | last=Jones | date=26 March 2013 | accessdate=24 June 2013[/tpl] The group played their first gig in late 1986 at Oxford's Jericho Tavern;[tpl]cite book| last=Clarke| first=Martin| title=Radiohead: Hysterical and Useless| date=5 May 2006| isbn=0-85965-383-8| publisher=Plexus[/tpl] Jonny Greenwood originally joined as a harmonica and then keyboard player, but he soon became the lead guitarist.[tpl]cite journal| last = Randall| first = Mac| title = The Golden Age of Radiohead| magazine = Guitar World| date = 1 April 1998[/tpl]
Although Yorke, O'Brien, Selway, and Colin Greenwood had left Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, the band continued to rehearse often on weekends and holidays.[tpl]cite news| last = Ross| first = Alex| title = The Searchers| newspaper=The New Yorker| date = 20 August 2001| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/08/20/010820fa_FACT1| accessdate =16 March 2011|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080214053947/http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html |archivedate = 14 February 2008[/tpl] In 1991, when all the members except Jonny had completed their university degrees, On a Friday regrouped, began to record demos such as Manic Hedgehog, and performed live gigs around Oxford at venues such as The Jericho Tavern. Oxfordshire and the Thames Valley had an active independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred around shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive; On a Friday were never seen as fitting this trend, commenting that they had missed it by the time they returned from university.[tpl]cite journal| last =Kent| first =Nick| authorlink =Nick Kent| title =Happy now?| magazine = Mojo| date =1 June 2001[/tpl]
Nevertheless, as On a Friday's number of live performances increased, record labels and producers became interested. Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and the co-owner of Oxford's Courtyard Studios, attended an early On a Friday concert at the Jericho Tavern. Impressed by the band, he and his partner Bryce Edge produced a demo tape and became On a Friday's managers; they remain the band's managers to this day. Following a chance meeting between Colin Greenwood and EMI A&R representative Keith Wozencroft at the record shop where Greenwood worked, the band signed a six-album recording contract with the label in late 1991. At the request of EMI, the band changed their name; "Radiohead" was taken from the title of a song on Talking Heads' True Stories album.

===Pablo Honey, The Bends and early success (1992–95)===

Radiohead recorded their debut release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was very poor. Subsequently, the band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade—who had worked with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr.—to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the "Creep" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable. NME described them as "a lily-livered excuse for a rock band",[tpl]cite news| title=Radiohead: The right frequency| date=22 February 2001| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1182725.stm|newspaper=BBC News  | accessdate =24 November 2007[/tpl] and "Creep" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed "too depressing".[tpl]cite news| title =Creepshow| newspaper=Melody Maker| date = 19 December 1992[/tpl]
The band released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as "Creep" and its anthemic follow-up singles "Anyone Can Play Guitar" and "Stop Whispering" failed to become major hits. "Pop Is Dead", a non-album single later disavowed by the band, sold equally poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s—to the extent of Radiohead being dubbed "Nirvana-lite"—yet Pablo Honey failed to make either a critical or a commercial splash upon its initial release. Despite shared influences with popular guitar-heavy acts, and some notice for Yorke's falsetto voice, the band toured only British universities and clubs.[tpl]cite web| title = Radiohead gigography: 1993| publisher=Green Plastic Radiohead| url = http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/index.php?year=1993[/tpl]

In the first few months of 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. "Creep" had been played very frequently on Israeli radio by influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit in that country's charts, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first live gig overseas.[tpl]cite news| last = Rubinstein| first = Harry| title = The Radiohead — Israel connection| newspaper=israelity.com| url =http://israelity.com/2009/01/20/the-radiohead-israel-connection/| date = 20 January 2009[/tpl] Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station KITS added the song to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for "Creep" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The song rose to number two on the US modern rock chart, entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart, and finally hit number seven in the UK Singles Chart when EMI re-released it in the UK in September.
Unexpected attention to the single in America caused the label to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled back and forth between continents, playing over 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the Pablo Honey supporting tour extended into its second year.[tpl]cite news| last = Richardson| first = Andy| title = Boom! Shake The Gloom!| newspaper=NME| date = 9 December 1995[/tpl] Band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were "still playing the same songs that had recorded two years previously... like being held in a time warp", when they were eager to work on new songs.[tpl]cite news| first=Nigel| last=Harding| title=Radiohead's Phil Selway| year=1995| newspaper=consumable.com| url =http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/May08.1995/revradio.html| accessdate =28 May 2007[/tpl]
The band began work on their second album in 1994, hiring veteran Abbey Road Studios producer John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations on the band to deliver a superior follow-up to match or exceed the success of "Creep".[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] Recording felt unnatural in the studio, band members having over-rehearsed their material.[tpl]cite book| last=Randall | first=Mac| title=Exit Music: The Radiohead Story| date=12 September 2000| pages=127–134| isbn= 0-385-33393-5| publisher=Delta[/tpl] They sought a change of scenery, touring the Far East, Australasia and Mexico in an attempt to reduce the pressure. The band found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, confronted again by the fame he had achieved, Yorke became disillusioned at being "right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.[tpl]cite journal| last = Reynolds| first = Simon| authorlink = Simon Reynolds| title = Walking on Thin Ice| magazine = The Wire|date=June 2001[/tpl]
My Iron Lung, an EP and single released late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album.[tpl]cite journal| first=Steve| last=Mallins| title=Scuba Do| date=1 April 1995| magazine = Vox magazine[/tpl] Promoted through alternative radio stations, the hard-edged single's sales were better than expected, and suggested for the first time that the band had found a loyal fan base beyond one hit.[tpl]cite book| last=Randall| first=Mac| title=Exit Music: The Radiohead Story| date=12 September 2000| pages=98–99| isbn= 0-385-33393-5| publisher=Delta[/tpl] Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album by year's end, and they released The Bends in March 1995. The album was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from the band's three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than their debut. It also received stronger reviews for both songwriting and performances.
While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the Britpop scene that dominated the media's attention at the time, they were finally successful in their home country with The Bends, as singles "Fake Plastic Trees", "High and Dry", "Just", and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" made their way to UK chart success; the latter song placed Radiohead in the top five for the first time. In 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world. The buzz generated by such famous fans as Michael Stipe, along with distinctive music videos for "Just" and "Street Spirit", helped to sustain Radiohead's popularity outside the UK.
However, Radiohead's growing fan base was insufficient for them to repeat the commercial popularity of "Creep" worldwide. "High and Dry" became a modest hit, but The Bends peaked at 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there.[tpl]cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=20 January 2009[/tpl] Radiohead were satisfied with the album's reception. Jonny Greenwood said, "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after The Bends was released and it started appearing in people's of polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band".[tpl]cite journal| last = DiMartino| first = Dave| title = Give Radiohead to Your Computer| magazine = LAUNCH| date = 2 May 1997| accessdate =21 December 2007[/tpl]

===OK Computer, fame and critical acclaim (1996–98)===

In late 1995, Radiohead had already recorded one song that would make their next record. "Lucky", released as a single to promote the War Child charity's The Help Album,[tpl]cite news| last = Courtney| first = Kevin| title = Radiohead calling| newspaper=The Irish Times| date = 17 May 1997| url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/1997/0517/97051700184.html| accessdate =24 December 2007[/tpl] had come out of a brief session with Nigel Godrich, a young audio engineer who had assisted on The Bends and also produced a 1996 B-side, "Talk Show Host". The band decided to produce their next album with Godrich's assistance, and they began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire.[tpl]cite journal| first = Adrian| last = Glover| title = Radiohead — Getting More Respect| date = 1 August 1997| magazine = Circus[/tpl]
In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette, seeking to perfect their new songs live before completing the record. They then resumed recording, again outside a traditional music studio, settling instead at a 15th-century mansion, St. Catherine's Court, near Bath.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,OK_Computer,00.html| title = The All-Time 100 albums| magazine = Time| date = 13 November 2006| accessdate =11 March 2007[/tpl] The recording sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording songs in different rooms, and listening to The Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration. Radiohead contributed "Talk Show Host", as well as a newly recorded song called "Exit Music (For a Film)", to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of Romeo + Juliet late in the year. Most of the rest of the album was complete by the end of 1996, and by March 1997, the record was mixed and mastered.
Radiohead released their third album, OK Computer, in June 1997. Largely composed of melodic rock songs, the new record also found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating some ambient, avant garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone to call the album a 'stunning art-rock tour de force.'[tpl]cite web|author=Mark Kemp |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/ok-computer-19970710 |title=OK Computer | Album Reviews |work=Rolling Stone |date=10 July 1997 |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl] Radiohead denied being part of the progressive rock genre, but critics in the mid-'90s began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, a band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's best-seller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973),[tpl]Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=208–211[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Griffiths|2004|p=109[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=843[/tpl] although Thom Yorke said the album's lyrics had been inspired by observing the "speed" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called "end-of-the-millennium blues"[tpl]cite journal| title = Subterranean Aliens| date = 1 September 1997| magazine = Request Magazine[/tpl] in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. OK Computer met with great critical acclaim, and Yorke admitted that he was "amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."[tpl]cite journal| title = Renaissance Men| magazine = Select|date=December 1997[/tpl]
OK Computer was the band's first number one UK chart debut, propelling Radiohead to commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, receiving the first Grammy Awards recognition of the band's career, a win for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/grammys_98.html| title = Screen Source presents: The 40th Annual Grammy Awards| accessdate =20 November 2007| date = 27 February 1998| work=Screen Source| publisher=amug.com[/tpl] "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises" were released as singles from the album, of which "Karma Police" was most successful internationally.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=radiohead|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Radiohead: Artist Chart History|work=Billboard|accessdate=9 November 2007[/tpl]
The release of OK Computer was followed by the "Against Demons" world tour. Grant Gee, the director of the "No Surprises" video, accompanied and filmed the band, releasing the footage in the 1999 documentary Meeting People Is Easy.[tpl]cite news| url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/177943/Meeting-People-is-Easy/overview| title = Meeting People is Easy (1999)| accessdate =20 November 2007| last = Deming| first = Mark| date = 20 November 2007| newspaper=The New York Times[/tpl] The film portrays the band's disaffection with the music industry and press, showing their burnout as they progressed from their first tour dates in mid-1997 to mid-1998, nearly a year later. The film is also notable for documenting earlier versions of songs that were never released or were not released until years later, such as "How to Disappear Completely", "Life in a Glasshouse", "I Will" and "Nude". The film screened within festivals such as the 1999 Maryland Film Festival, and had a limited theatrical release in select cities. During this time the band also released a music video compilation, 7 Television Commercials, as well as two EPs, Airbag/How Am I Driving? and No Surprises/Running from Demons, that compiled their B-sides from OK Computer singles.

===Kid A, Amnesiac and a change in sound (1999–2001)===

Radiohead were largely inactive following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 was at an Amnesty International concert in Paris.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.artforamnesty.org/view_artist.php?id=32| title=Art for Amnesty| accessdate =22 December 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030120709/http://www.artforamnesty.org/view_artist.php?id=32 |archivedate = 30 October 2007[/tpl] Yorke later admitted that during that period the band came close to splitting up, and that he had developed severe depression.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eccleston| first=Danny|date=1 October 2000|magazine=Q[/tpl] In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although there was no longer any pressure or even a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke was experiencing writer's block, influencing him toward a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles in the band.[tpl]cite news| first=Andrew| last=Smith| title=Sound and Fury| date=1 October 2000| url =http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,375564,00.html| newspaper=The Observer| accessdate =17 March 2007| location=London[/tpl] After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.
In October 2000 Radiohead released their fourth album, Kid A, the first of two albums from these recording sessions. Rather than being a stylistic sequel to OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the Billboard chart marked a first for the band, and the first US number one album by any UK musician since the Spice Girls in 1996.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News |title=US Success for Radiohead|date=14 June 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1389135.stm|accessdate=22 March 2007[/tpl] This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of OK Computer.[tpl]cite news| title=CD Soars After Net Release: Radiohead's 'Kid A' premieres in No. 1 slot| last=Evangelista| first=Benny| accessdate =17 March 2007| date=12 October 2000| newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/10/12/BU108599.DTL&type=tech_article[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last = Menta| first = Richard| title = Did Napster Take Radiohead's New Album to Number 1?| newspaper=MP3 Newswire| date = 28 October 2000[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last = Oldham| first = James| title = Radiohead — Their Stupendous Return| newspaper=NME| date = 24 June 2000[/tpl] Although Radiohead did not release any singles from Kid A, promos of "Optimistic" and "Idioteque" received radio play, and a series of "blips", or short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released freely on the Internet.[tpl]cite news| last = Zoric| first = Lauren| title = I think I'm meant to be dead| newspaper=The Guardian| date = 22 September 2000[/tpl] The band had read Naomi Klein's anti-globalisation book No Logo during the recording, and they decided to continue a summer 2000 tour of Europe later in the year in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted Kid A with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.

Kid A received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a "commercial suicide note", labelling it "intentionally difficult" and longing for a return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/radiohead/kida| title=Kid A by Radiohead| accessdate =20 May 2007| magazine=Metacritic[/tpl] Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying, "I was really, really amazed at how badly A'' was being viewed ... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult ... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people ... What we're doing isn't that radical."
Amnesiac, released in June 2001, comprised additional tracks from the Kid A recording sessions. Radiohead's musical style on these songs was similar to that of Kid A in their fusion of electronic music and jazz influences, though more reliant on the use of guitars. The record was a critical and commercial success worldwide, it topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number two in the US, being nominated for a Grammy Award and the Mercury Music Prize. After Amnesiac's release, the band embarked on a world tour, visiting North America, Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, "Pyramid Song" and "Knives Out", Radiohead's first issued singles since 1998, were modestly successful, and "I Might Be Wrong", initially planned as a third single, expanded into Radiohead's thus far only live record. I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, released in November 2001, featured performances of seven songs from Kid A and Amnesiac along with the acoustic, previously unreleased "True Love Waits".

===Hail to the Thief and departure from EMI (2002–04)===

During July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of newly written songs. They then recorded the new material in two weeks in a Los Angeles studio with Nigel Godrich, adding several tracks later in Oxford, where the band continued their work into the next year. Radiohead members described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. The band's sixth album, Hail to the Thief, was released in June 2003. Mixing sounds from throughout their career, the album combined guitar-based rock with electronic influences and topical lyrics by Yorke.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/radiohead/hailtothethief?q=hail%20to%20the%20thief| title=Radiohead: Hail to the Thief (2003): Reviews| accessdate =17 March 2007| magazine=Metacritic[/tpl] Hail to the Thief enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK and number three on the Billboard chart and eventually being certified platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The album's singles, "There There", "Go to Sleep" and "2 + 2 = 5", achieved a level of play on modern rock radio. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for Best Alternative Album, while producer Godrich and engineer Darrell Thorp received the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2003/grammys.htm| title=Rock on the Net: 45th Annual Grammy Awards| accessdate =22 November 2007| date=23 February 2003| magazine=rockonthenet.com[/tpl]
Yorke denied that Hail to the Thief's title was a comment on the controversial 2000 US presidential election, explaining that he first heard the words in a BBC Radio 4 discussion of 19th-century American politics. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by news reports of war in 2001 to 2002 and "the feeling that we are entering an age of intolerance and fear where the power to express ourselves in a democracy and have our voices heard is being denied us"[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/08/entertainment/ca-sutcliffe8 |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil |title=Radiohead heeds the alarms |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 2003 [/tpl] but said, "Radiohead didn't write a protest record, we didn't write a political record." After the release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead embarked in May 2003 on a world tour, including a headlining performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the Coachella Festival. During their tour, the band released COM LAG, an EP compiling most of their B-sides from the time. Following their tour, the band began writing and rehearsing in their Oxford studio but soon went on hiatus. Free of their label contract, Radiohead spent the remainder of 2004 resting with their families and working on solo projects.[tpl]cite web| last=O'Brien| first=Ed| title=Here we go| work=Dead Air Space| publisher=Radiohead| date=21 August 2005| url =http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/index.php?a=65| accessdate =23 December 2007[/tpl]

===In Rainbows, independent work and "pay what you want" (2005–08)===

Radiohead began work on their seventh album in February 2005. In September 2005, the band recorded a piano-based song, "I Want None of This", for the War Child charity album Help: A Day in the Life. The album was sold online, with "I Want None of This" being the most downloaded track, although it was not released as a single.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4238542.stm| title=Rush to download War Child album| date=12 September 2005| accessdate =19 October 2007|newspaper=BBC News  [/tpl] Radiohead had already begun recording their next album on their own and then with producer Spike Stent.

The electronic music of Kid A and Amnesiac was inspired by Thom Yorke's admiration for glitch, ambient techno and IDM as exemplified by Warp Records artists such as Autechre and Aphex Twin, and the album also sampled from early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane, and Miles Davis, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period.[tpl]cite journal| first=Lauren | last=Zoric | title=Fitter, Happier, More Productive | date=1 October 2000 | magazine = Juice | accessdate =3 May 2007[/tpl] Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th century classical music also had a role, as the influence of both Penderecki and composer Olivier Messiaen was apparent; for several songs on Kid A and later albums, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen. While working on Hail to the Thief, Radiohead put renewed emphasis on guitar rock. Since beginning to record In Rainbows, Radiohead members have mentioned a variety of rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including Björk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock.[tpl]cite news|title=Radiohead's Secret Influences, from Fleetwood Mac to Thomas Pynchon | date=24 January 2008 |work=Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/18060334/radioheads_secret_influences_from_fleetwood_mac_to_thomas_pynchon | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090612012329/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/18060334/radioheads_secret_influences_from_fleetwood_mac_to_thomas_pynchon | archivedate = 12 June 2009 | accessdate =7 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Nick| last=Kent| title=Ghost in the Machine | date=1 August 2006| work=Mojo | pages =74–82 [/tpl] Since leaving their major label, the band members have been interviewed less frequently, more often posting "office charts" of their favourite songs of the moment on their blog Dead Air Space. In 2011, Thom Yorke denied Radiohead had ever set out deliberately to change musical styles or to make "experimental music", saying band members are "constantly absorbing music" and a variety of musicians are always influencing their work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/10/06/141093025/radiohead-everything-in-its-right-place |title=Radiohead: Everything In Its Right Place |publisher=NPR |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl]
Since their formation, Radiohead have been lyrically and musically spearheaded by Thom Yorke. Although Yorke is responsible for writing nearly all the lyrics, songwriting is a collaborative effort, and it has been noted in interviews that all the band members have roles in the process. As a result, all the band's songs are officially credited to "Radiohead". The Kid A/Amnesiac sessions brought about a change in Radiohead's musical style, and an even more radical change in the band's working method.[tpl]cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=14 September 2011[/tpl] Since the band's shift from standard rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, band members have had greater flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot rather than guitar, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulations, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that "his power within the band was absolutely unbalanced and he would subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But ... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy wise, than it used to be."[tpl]cite news| first=Stephen | last=Dalton | title=Are we having fun yet? | date=1 April 2004 | url =http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/11/1081326991553.html?from=storyrhs | newspaper=The Age | accessdate =26 March 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

==Collaborators==

Radiohead have maintained a close relationship with a number of frequent collaborators since early in their career. Record producer Nigel Godrich made his name with Radiohead, working with the band as an audio engineer since The Bends, and as their producer on all six studio albums since OK Computer.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/everything-in-its-right-place-1.587693 | title=Everything in Its Right Place| first = Matthew| last = McKinnon | date = 24 July 2006 | newspaper=CBC | accessdate =11 March 2007[/tpl] He has, at times, been dubbed the "sixth member" of the band in an allusion to George Martin being called the "Fifth Beatle". Graphic artist Stanley Donwood, another longtime associate of the band, met Thom Yorke when both were art students, and together with Yorke, has produced all of Radiohead's album covers and visual artwork since 1994.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eyestorm.com/artists/profile/Stanley_Donwood.html | title=Stanley Donwood | accessdate =29 May 2007 | publisher=Eyestorm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070516152202/http://www.eyestorm.com/artists/profile/Stanley_Donwood.html | archivedate=16 May 2007[/tpl] Donwood and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for a special edition of Amnesiac packaged as a library book. Dilly Gent has been responsible for commissioning all Radiohead music videos since OK Computer, working with the band to find a director suitable for each project.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mvdbase.com/tech.php?last=Gent&first=Dilly | title=Dilly Gent videography| accessdate =18 June 2007 | publisher=mvdbase.com[/tpl] Since the band's inception, Andi Watson has been their lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of Radiohead's live concerts, such as the carbon-neutral "LED forest" of the In Rainbows tour.[tpl]cite web|last=Fischer |first=Jonathan L. |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/strobe-lights-and-blown-speakers/ |title=Strobe Lights and Blown Speakers: Radiohead's Light Design |work=The New York Times |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] The band's chief live technician, Peter Clements, or "Plank", has worked with the band since before The Bends, overseeing the setup of their instruments for both studio recordings and live performances.
