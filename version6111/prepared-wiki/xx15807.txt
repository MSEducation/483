==Biography==

===Early years===

Tharp, born in 1941 on a farm in Portland, Indiana, was named for Twila Thornburg, the "Pig Princess" of the 89th Annual Muncie Fair in Indiana.
As a young child, Tharp spent a few months each year living with her Quaker grandparents on their farm in Indiana. Her mother insisted she take lessons in dance (ballet, tap, jazz and modern), and piano, drum, viola, violin, shorthand, German and French. In 1950 Tharp's family—younger sister Twanette, twin brothers Stanley and Stanford, mother Lecile and father William—moved to Rialto, California.[tpl]cite news | author=James Hebert | title=Twyla Tharp found a kindred spirit to inspire "The Times They Are A-Changin'" at Old Globe | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060129/news_lz1a29tharp.html | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=January 29, 2006 | accessdate=February 16, 2009[/tpl] Her parents opened a drive-in movie theater, where Tharp worked from the age of eight. The drive-in was on the corner of Acacia and Foothill, the major east–west artery in Rialto and the path of Route 66.[tpl]cite book | last=Adams | first=John Anthony | title=Rialto |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=54G6gAXOJFwC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=tharp+drive-in&source=web&ots=4bn_DSTnSl&sig=N889LqhZylRpL7-5SlKq28dVb5E&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result | year=2004 | accessdate=July 23, 2008 | series=Images Of America| publisher=Arcadia Publishing | isbn=0-7385-2892-7 |pages=85[/tpl] She attended Pacific High School in  San Bernardino and studied at the Vera Lynn School of Dance.

In 1965, Tharp choreographed her first dance Tank Dive. In 1966, she formed her own company Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often utilizes classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. From 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works.
In 1973, Tharp choreographed Deuce Coupe to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet.  Deuce Coupe is considered to be the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed Push Comes to Shove (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet.
In 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre, since which time ABT has held the world premieres of 16 of Tharp's works.

Tharp also created the dance roadshow Cutting Up, (1991) with Mikhail Baryshnikov, which went on to tour and appeared in 28 cities over two months.
In the summer of 2000, Twyla Tharp Dance regrouped with entirely new dancers. This Tharp dance company also performed around the world. It was with this company that Tharp developed the material that would go on to become Movin' Out, an award winning Broadway musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel and starring many of the dancers that were in the dance company.
In 2012, Tharp created the full-length ballet The Princess and the Goblin., based on the story by George MacDonald. The ballet is based on MacDonald's story The Princess and the Goblin and is Tharp's first to include children. The narrative ballet was co-commissioned by Atlanta Ballet and Royal Winnipeg Ballet and performed by both companies.
Tharp was the first Artist in Residency (A.I.R.) at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. During this time she created and premiered Waiting At The Station, a new work with music by R&B artist Allen Toussaint and sets & costumes by long-time collaborator Santo Loquasto.

===Film, television and print===

Television credits include choreographing Sue's Leg (1976) for the inaugural episode of the PBS program Dance in America,; co-producing and directing Making Television Dance (1977), which won the Chicago International Film Festival Award; and directing The Catherine Wheel (1983) for BBC Television. Tharp co-directed the award-winning television special "Baryshnikov by Tharp" in 1984.
Tharp has written three books: an early autobiography, Push Comes to Shove (1992; Bantam Books); The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life (2003, Simon & Schuster), translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Thai and Japanese; “The Collaborative Habit” (2009, Simon & Schuster), also translated into Thai, Chinese and Korean. As an interesting point, Ms. Tharp indicated that The Creative Habit is about cybernetics, especially in the several Greek-themed creative exercises, such as the Coin Drop; the Coin Drop, as an exercise in extracting ordered meaning from chaos, is derived from the astrological muse, Urania, in that random coins falling onto a flat surface can be used to develop pattern analysis skills. The astrological theme is, in fact, an etymological underpinning of cybernetics' tradition of "guiding a boat" by sighting stellar references in a dynamic and synthetic way according to ancient Greek navigation.
