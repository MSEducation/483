Walls of Jerusalem is a national park in Tasmania, Australia, [tpl]convert|144|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of Hobart.
Located in the Tasmanian Central Highlands east of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, and west of the Central Plateau Conservation Area.  It is south of Mole Creek, Tasmania, and Rowallan Lake. 
It forms part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.
The park takes its name from the geological features of the park which are thought to resemble the walls of the city of Jerusalem. As a result many places and features within the park also have Biblical references for names, such as Herods Gate, Lake Salome, Solomons Jewels, Damascus Gate, the Pool of Bethesda.
The most prominent feature of the park is King Davids Peak.
Much of the walking track consists of raised boards, from Wild Dog Creek through to Dixon's Kingdom, with the purpose of protecting the fragile alpine vegetation. Walking tracks elsewhere in the park consist of rock, rocky earth, grassland and marsh.
