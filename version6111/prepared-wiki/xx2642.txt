==Entry into popular culture==

The word "Dalek" has entered major dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as "a type of robot appearing in 'Dr. Who',[tpl]sic[/tpl] a B.B.C. Television science-fiction programme; hence used allusively."[tpl]cite book  |editor1-first=J. A. |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-link=John Simpson (lexicographer) |editor2-first=E. S. C. |editor2-last=Weiner |editor2-link=Edmund Weiner |title=Oxford English Dictionary, Volume IV: creel–duzepere |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-861216-8 |pages=221–222 [/tpl]  English-speakers sometimes use the term metaphorically to describe people, usually figures of authority, who act like robots unable to break from their programming; for example, John Birt, the Director-General of the BBC from 1992 to 2000, was publicly called a "croak-voiced Dalek" by playwright Dennis Potter in the MacTaggart Lecture at the 1993 Edinburgh Television Festival.

==Physical characteristics==

Externally, Daleks normally resemble human-sized pepper shakers with a single mechanical eyestalk mounted on a rotating dome, a gun mount containing an energy weapon ("gunstick" or "death ray") and a telescopic manipulator arm which is usually tipped by an appendage resembling a sink plunger. Daleks have been seen to be able to use their plungers to interface with technology, crush a man's skull by suction, measure the intelligence of a subject, and extract information from a man's mind. Dalek casings are made of a bonded polycarbide material dubbed "dalekanium" by a member of the human resistance in The Dalek Invasion of Earth and by the Cult of Skaro in "Daleks in Manhattan".
The lower half of a Dalek's shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions, or "Dalek bumps," which are shown in the episode "Dalek" to be spheres embedded in the casing. Both the BBC-licensed Dalek Book (1964) and The Doctor Who Technical Manual (1983) describe these items as being part of a sensory array,Harris (1983), p. 22 whilst in the 2005 series episode "Dalek", they are shown to serve a function in a Dalek's self-destruct mechanism. Their armour has a forcefield that evaporates most bullets and resists most types of energy weapon; this seems to be concentrated around the Dalek's midsection (where the mutant is located), as normally ineffective firepower can be concentrated on the eyestalk to blind a Dalek. Daleks have a very limited field of vision, with no peripheral sight at all, and are relatively easy to hide from in fairly exposed places. Their own energy weapons have also been shown to be capable of destroying them. Their weapons fire a beam that has electrical tendencies, is capable of propagating through water and may be a form of plasma. The eyepiece is a Dalek's most vulnerable spot, and impairing its vision often leads to a blind, panicked firing of its weapon whilst shouting, "My vision is impaired; I cannot see!"  Russell T Davies subverted the catchphrase in his 2008 episode "The Stolen Earth", in which a Dalek vaporises a paintball that has blocked its vision while proclaiming "My vision is not impaired!".[tpl]cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin|coauthors=Cribbins, Bernard|date=25 July 2008|title=Bernard Cribbins: Stargazer: Wilfred Mott|journal=Doctor Who Magazine|publisher=Panini Comics|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=398|page=p. 33[/tpl]
The creature inside the mechanical casing is depicted as soft and repulsive in appearance and vicious even without its mechanical armour. The first-ever glimpse of a Dalek mutant, in The Daleks, was a claw peeking out from under a Thal cloak after it had been removed from its casing. The actual appearance of the mutants has varied, but often adheres to the Doctor's description of the species in Remembrance of the Daleks as "little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour". In Resurrection of the Daleks a Dalek creature, separated from its casing, attacks and severely injures a human soldier; in Revelation of the Daleks, there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade) and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from Resurrection, the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen, a common misconception exists that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots.[tpl]cite news |title=Letters to the Editor – Inside a Dalek |work=The Times |location=UK |first=Terrance |last=Dicks |authorlink=Terrance Dicks |date=20 December 1974 |page=13[/tpl] In the new series Daleks are retconned to be mollusc-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes and an exposed brain.
The voice of a Dalek is electronic; the Dalek creature is apparently unable to make much more than squeaking sounds when out of its casing. Once the mutant is removed, the casing itself can be entered and operated by humanoids; for example, in The Daleks, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) enters a Dalek shell to masquerade as a guard as part of an escape plan.
For many years it was assumed that, due to their design and gliding motion, Daleks were unable to climb stairs, and that this was a simple way of escaping them. A well known cartoon from Punch pictured a group of Daleks at the foot of a flight of stairs with the caption, "Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21572725-ray-cusick-designer-daleks-died-february-21st-aged-84-ray-cusick|title=Ray Cusick, designer of the Daleks, died on February 21st, aged 84|work=The Economist|date=2 March 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] In a scene from the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, "If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us?" The Daleks generally make up for their general lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among Doctor Who fans goes, "Real Daleks don't climb stairs; they level the building."[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.warlord/browse_thread/thread/a4c1372fb5769f30/2aff27237eb980e9?lnk=st&q=%22Real+Daleks+don%27t+climb+stairs%22&rnum=75&hl=en#2aff27237eb980e9 |title=Federal Department of Transportation Bulletin #92–132 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Dippold |first=Ron |date=6 February 1992 |format=USENET post |work=alt.fan.warlord |publisher=Google Groups[/tpl] Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, The Daleks, they were capable of movement only on the conductive metal floors of their city; in The Dalek Invasion of Earth a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating that they not only had become freely mobile, but are amphibious; Planet of the Daleks showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor, Revelation of the Daleks showed Davros in his life-support chair and one of his Daleks hovering and Remembrance of the Daleks depicted them as capable of hovering up a flight of stairs. Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks' supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping up a flight of stairs in the 2005 episode "Dalek" made the same joke, and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase "ELEVATE", in a similar manner to their normal phrase "EXTERMINATE." The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.

===Prop details===

The non-humanoid shape of the Dalek did much to enhance the creatures' sense of menace[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]. A lack of familiar reference points differentiated them from the traditional "bug-eyed monster" of science fiction, which Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman had wanted the show to avoid.Howe (1992), pp. 3, 26–27 The unsettling form of the Daleks, coupled with their alien voices, made many believe that the props were wholly mechanical and operated by remote control.Howe (2004), p. 31
The Daleks were actually controlled from inside by short operatorsHowe (1997), p. 82 who had to manipulate their eyestalks, domes and arms, as well as flashing the lights on their heads in sync with the actors supplying their voices. The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section, and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.
In addition to being hot and cramped the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for the operators to hear the director's commands or studio dialogue. John Scott Martin, a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: "You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger. If you were related to an octopus then it helped."Howe (1997), p. 85
For Doctor Who's 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been re-designed to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look.[tpl]cite journal |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |journal=Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition |publisher=Panini Comics |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent |issue=11 |pages=pp. 62–70[/tpl] Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the "neck" section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights. The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode "Dalek".  These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control. A third person, Nicholas Briggs, supplies the voice in their various appearances.[tpl]cite journal |last=Briggs |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Briggs |date=25 May 2005 |title=Diary of a Dalek |journal=Doctor Who Magazine |publisher=Panini Comics |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent |issue=356 |pages=pp. 23–27[/tpl] In the 2010 season a new and larger model appeared in several colours representing different parts of the Dalek command hierarchy.

====Movement====

The original plan of Terry Nation's was for the Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon castors, propelled by the operator's feet. Although casters were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, for The Dalek Invasion of Earth Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.Howe (1997), pp. 84–85 The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.
Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek. This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the "new series" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.Russell (2006), p. 163

====Voices====

The staccato delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by voice actors Peter Hawkins and David Graham, who would vary the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Although the exact sound-processing devices used have varied, the original 1963 effect used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to ring modulation with a 30 Hz sine wave. The distinctive harsh grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial Revelation of the Daleks, for which director Graeme Harper deliberately used less distortion).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC – Doctor Who – Dalek Empire III with Nicholas Briggs |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News  [/tpl]
Besides Hawkins and Graham, notable voice actors for the Daleks have included Roy Skelton, who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story The Evil of the Daleks and went on to provide voices for five additional Dalek serials including Planet of the Daleks,Planet of the Daleks. Writer Terry Nation, Director David Maloney, Producer Barry Letts.  Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 7 April–12 May 1973. and for the one-off anniversary special The Five Doctors. Michael Wisher, the actor who originated the role of Dalek creator Davros in Genesis of the Daleks, provided Dalek voices for that same story, as well as for Frontier in Space, Planet of the Daleks and Death to the Daleks. Other Dalek voice actors include Royce Mills (three stories), Brian Miller (two stories), and Oliver Gilbert and Peter Messaline (one story).Day of the Daleks. Writer Louis Marks, Director Paul Bernard, Producer Barry Letts.  Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 1–22 January 1972. John Leeson, who performed the voice of K-9 in several Doctor Who stories, and Davros actors Terry Molloy and David Gooderson also contributed supporting voices for various Dalek serials.
Since 2005, the Dalek voice in the television series has been provided by Nicholas Briggs, speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator. Briggs had previously provided Dalek and other alien voices for Big Finish Productions audio plays. In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC asked him to do the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue ring modulator that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC's sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs went as far as to bring the voice modulator to the actors' readings of the scripts.

====Construction====

Manufacturing the props was expensive. In scenes where many Daleks had to appear, some of them would be represented by wooden replicas (Destiny of the Daleks)Destiny of the Daleks. Writer Terry Nation, Director Ken Grieve, Producer Graham Williams. Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 1–22 September 1979. or life-size photographic enlargements in the early black-and-white episodes (The Daleks, The Dalek Invasion of Earth and The Power of the Daleks).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/power/four/61.shtml |title=BBC – Doctor Who – Photonovels Power of the Daleks – Episode Four |accessdate=9 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News  [/tpl] In stories involving armies of Daleks, the BBC effects team even turned to using commercially available toy Daleks, manufactured by Louis Marx & Co and Herts Plastic Moulders Ltd. Examples of such use can be observed in the serials The Power of the Daleks, The Evil of the Daleks and Planet of the Daleks. Judicious editing techniques also gave the impression that there were more Dalek props than were actually available, and continue to be used to the present day, such as using split screen in "The Parting of the Ways".
Four fully functioning props were commissioned for the first serial "The Daleks" in 1963, and were constructed from BBC plans by Shawcraft Engineering.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/b.html |title=The Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=24 July 2006 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)[/tpl] These became known in fan circles as "Mk I Daleks". Shawcraft were also commissioned to construct approximately twenty Daleks for the two Dalek movies in 1965 and 1966 (see below). Some of these movie props filtered back to the BBC and were seen in the televised serials, notably The Chase, which was aired before the first movie's debut.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/r.html |title=The Chase |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=14 January 2010 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)[/tpl] The remaining props not bought by the BBC were either donated to charity or given away as prizes in competitions.Howe (1992), pp. 132, 137
The BBC's own Dalek props were reused many times, with components of the original Shawcraft "Mk I Daleks" surviving right through to their final classic series appearance in 1988.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/remembrance-of-the-daleks.htm |title=Dalek 6388 Remembrance |work=Dalek 6388 – A Dalek Prop History – Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] Years of storage and repainting took their toll, however. By the time of the Sixth Doctor's Revelation of the Daleks new props were being manufactured out of fibreglass, which were lighter and more affordable to construct than their predecessors.Howe (1997), p. 92 These Daleks were slightly bulkier in appearance around the mid-shoulder section, and also had a slightly redesigned skirt section which was more vertical at the back. Other minor changes were made to the design due to these new construction methods, including alterations to the fender and the incorporation of both the arm boxes, collars and slats into a single fibreglass moulding. These props were repainted in grey for the Seventh Doctor serial Remembrance of the Daleks and designated as "Renegade Daleks"; another redesign, painted in cream and gold, became the "Imperial Dalek" faction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7h.html |title=Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)[/tpl]
New Dalek props were built for the 21st century version of Doctor Who. The first, which appeared alone in the 2005 episode "Dalek", was built by modelmaker Mike Tucker.  Additional Dalek props based on Tucker's master were subsequently built out of fibreglass by Cardiff-based Specialist Models.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/services/film_and_tv/bbc_wales_dr_who_daleks_fibreglass_props |title=BBC Wales Dr Who Daleks Fibreglass Props |date=21 March 2010 |publisher=Specialist Models & Displays |accessdate=23 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Development==

Wishing to create an alien creature that did not look like a "man in a suit", Terry Nation stated in his script for the first Dalek serial that they should have no legs.Howe (1997), p. 80  He was also inspired by a performance by the Georgian National Ballet, in which dancers in long skirts appeared to glide across the stage. For many of the shows, the Daleks were operated by retired ballet dancers wearing black socks while sitting inside the Dalek. Raymond Cusick (who died on 21 Feb 2013)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21563344 |title=BBC News – Doctor Who Dalek designer Ray Cusick dies after illness |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-02-24 |accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl] was given the task of designing the Daleks when Ridley Scott, then a designer for the BBC, proved unavailable after having been initially assigned to their debut serial.Howe (1994), p. 61 An account in Jeremy Bentham's Doctor Who—The Early Years (1986) says that after Nation wrote the script, Cusick was given only an hour to come up with the design for the Daleks, and was inspired in his initial sketches by a pepper shaker on a table.[tpl]cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=Doctor Who—The Early Years |date=May 1986 |publisher=W.H. Allen |location=England |isbn=0-491-03612-4[/tpl] Cusick himself, however, states that he based it on a man seated in a chair, and only used the pepper shaker to demonstrate how it might move.Walker (2006), p. 61 
In 1964 Nation told a Daily Mirror reporter that the Dalek name came from a dictionary or encyclopaedia volume, the spine of which read "Dal – Lek" (or, according to another version, "Dal – Eks").Peel (1988), pp. 21–22 He later admitted that this book and the origin of the Dalek name was completely fictitious, and that anyone bothering to check out his story would have found him out. The name had in reality simply rolled off his typewriter.Howe (1998), p. 13  Later, Nation was pleasantly surprised to discover that in Serbo-Croatian the word "dalek" means "far", or "distant".Davies, Kevin (director) (1993). More than 30 Years in the TARDIS London, UK: BBC Video.
Nation grew up during World War II, and remembered the fear caused by German bombings. He consciously based the Daleks on the Nazis, conceiving the species as faceless, authoritarian figures dedicated to conquest and complete conformity.Howe (1992), p. 31 The allusion is most obvious in the Dalek stories penned by Nation, in particular The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964) and Genesis of the Daleks (1975).Miles (2006), pp. 105–109Howe (1998), p. 280[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/genesisofdaleks/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – Genesis of the Daleks – Details |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Howe |first=David J. |authorlink=David J. Howe|coauthors=Stephen James Walker |year=1998, 2003 |work=official Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC [/tpl]
Prior to writing the first Dalek serial, Nation was chief scriptwriter for comedian Tony Hancock. The two had a falling out, and Nation either resigned or was fired.Miles (2006), p. 40 When Hancock left the BBC, he worked on several series proposals, one of which was called From Plip to Plop, a comedic history of the world which would have ended with a nuclear apocalypse, the survivors being reduced to living in dustbin-like robot casings and eating radiation to stay alive. According to biographer Cliff Goodwin, when Hancock saw the Daleks, he allegedly shouted at the screen, "That bloody Nation—he's stolen my robots!"[tpl]cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Cliff |title=When the Wind Changed: The Life and Death of Tony Hancock |date=Nov 2000 |publisher=Arrow |location=England |isbn=0-09-960941-X[/tpl]
The naming of early Doctor Who stories is complex and sometimes controversial.[tpl]cite web |url=http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Pixley_3.htm |title=By Any Other Name |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |date=15 January 2001 |work=Earthbound Timelords[/tpl]Howe (1998), unpaginated "Authors' Note" [tpl]cite book |title=Doctor Who—The Legend: 40 Years of Time Travel |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |year=2003 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-48602-3 |page=19[/tpl]  The first Dalek serial is called, variously, The Survivors (the pre-production title), The Mutants (its official title at the time of production and broadcast, later taken by another unrelated story), Beyond the Sun (used on some production documentation), The Dead Planet (the on-screen title of the serial's first episode), or simply The Daleks.
The instant appeal of the Daleks caught the BBC off guard, and transformed Doctor Who from a Saturday tea-time children's educational programme to a must-watch national phenomenon. Children were alternately frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the Doctor Who production office was inundated by letters and calls asking about the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.
Nation jointly owned the intellectual property rights to the Daleks with the BBC, and the money-making concept proved nearly impossible to sell to anyone else; he was dependent on the BBC wanting to produce stories featuring the creatures.On-screen production notes, The Dalek Invasion of Earth London, UK: BBC Video, 2003. Several attempts to market the Daleks outside of the series were unsuccessful.Peel (1988), p. 56Howe (1997), p. 86 Since Nation's death in 1997, his share of the rights is now administered by his former agent, Tim Hancock.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3535588.stm|title=Daleks back to fight Doctor Who|publisher=BBC News  |date=4 August 2004|accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl]
Early plans for what eventually became the 1996 Doctor Who television movie included radically redesigned Daleks whose cases unfolded like spiders' legs.Segal (2000), pp. 48–53 The concept for these "Spider Daleks" was abandoned, but picked up again in several Doctor Who spin-offs.[ref]

==Fictional history==

Dalek in-universe history has seen many retroactive changes, which have caused continuity problems.Peel (1988), p. 78 When the Daleks first appeared in The Daleks, they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when their power supply is wrecked.The Daleks. Writer Terry Nation, Director Christopher Barry, Producer Verity Lambert. Doctor Who. BBC, London. 21 December 1963 – 1 February 1964. However they reappear in The Dalek Invasion of Earth, where they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in Genesis of the Daleks, where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which "Daleks" is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros.Genesis of the Daleks. Writer Terry Nation, Director David Maloney, Producer Philip Hinchcliffe. Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 8 March–12 April 1975. Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in tank-like "travel machines" whose design was based on his own life-support chair.
Genesis of the Daleks marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely referred to again.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |title=The second history of the Daleks |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |first2=Martin |last2=Day |authorlink2=Martin Day |first3=Keith |last3=Topping |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |work=Official Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC [/tpl] Future stories in the original Doctor Who series, which followed a rough story arc,Parkin (2006), p. 237 would also focus more on Davros, much to the dissatisfaction of some fans who felt that the Daleks should take centre stage rather than merely becoming minions of their creator.[tpl]cite book |authorlink1=David J.

One, the "Imperial Daleks", were loyal to Davros, who had become their Emperor, whilst the other, the "Renegade Daleks", followed a black Supreme Dalek. By the end of the story both factions have been wiped out and the Doctor has tricked them into destroying Skaro, though Davros escapes.
A single Dalek appeared in "Dalek", written by Robert Shearman, which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the Time War which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords. A Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in "The Parting of the Ways". The 2006 season finale "Army of Ghosts"/"Doomsday" featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the Cult of Skaro, led by a black Dalek known as "Sec", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the Tenth Doctor caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void. The Cult survived by utilising an "emergency temporal shift" to escape.[tpl]cite episode | title = Army of Ghosts | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 1 July 2006[/tpl]
These four, Daleks Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan returned in the two-part story "Daleks in Manhattan"/"Evolution of the Daleks", in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built Empire State Building and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The Cult then set about creating "Human Daleks" by "formatting" the brains of a few thousand captured humans, with the intention of producing hybrids which remain fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds.[tpl]cite episode | title = Evolution of the Daleks | episodelink = Evolution of the Daleks | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Helen Raynor, Director James Strong, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC1 | city = Cardiff | airdate = 28 April 2007[/tpl] Dalek Sec however starts to become so human, that he changes the DNA to make the hybrids more human.  This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids.  This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.
The Daleks returned in the 2008 seasons' two-part finale, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in "The Vault", a section of the Dalek flagship, the Crucible. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a "reality bomb" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of Donna Noble, a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.[tpl]cite episode | title = The Stolen Earth | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 28 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite episode | title = Journey's End | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 5 July 2008[/tpl] The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode "Victory of the Daleks", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the "Progenitor".[tpl]cite web | url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |work=BBC  | title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator | last=McKinstry | first=Peter[/tpl] This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA. The activation of the Progenitor results in the creation of a "new paradigm" of Daleks. The New Paradigm Daleks deem their creators inferior and exterminate them; their creators make no resistance to this, deeming themselves inferior as well. They are organised into different roles (drone, scientist, strategists, supreme and eternal), which are identifiable with colour-coded armour instead of the identification plates under the eyestalk used by their predecessors. They escape the Doctor at the end of the episode via time travel with the intent to rebuild their Empire.[tpl]cite journal  |date=3 March 2010 |title=The Eleventh Doctor is coming! |journal=Doctor Who Magazine |issue=418 |page=5 |publisher=Panini Comics |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent |issn=0957-9818[/tpl] The Daleks only came in subsequent finales "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang" (2010) as Steven Moffat decided to "give them a rest" and stated "There's a problem with the Daleks. They are the most famous of the Doctor's adversaries and the most frequent, which means they are the most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13594932 | work=BBC News | title=Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat to 'rest' Daleks | date=30 May 2011[/tpl] They next appear in "Asylum of the Daleks" (2012), where the Daleks are shown to have greatly increased numbers and have a Parliament; in addition to the traditional "modern" Daleks, several designs from both the original and new series appear. All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor", where they are seen being defeated
in the Time War. In "The Time of the Doctor," the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.

==Dalek culture==

Daleks have little, if any, individual personality, ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger, and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.The Evil of the Daleks. Writer David Whitaker, Director Derek Martinus, Producer Innes Lloyd. Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 20 May–1 July 1967. Dalek speech is characterised by repeated phrases, and by orders given to themselves and to others.Peel (1988), p. 4 Unlike the stereotypical emotionless robots often found in science fiction, Daleks are often angry; author Kim Newman has described the Daleks as behaving "like toddlers in perpetual hissy fits", gloating when in power and flying into rage when thwarted.Newman, p. 33 They tend to be excitable and will repeat the same word or phrase over and over again in heightened emotional states, most famously "Exterminate! Exterminate!"
In terms of their behaviour, Daleks are extremely aggressive, and seem driven by an instinct to attack. This instinct is so strong that Daleks have been depicted fighting the urge to kill or even attacking when unarmed.Death to the Daleks. Writer Terry Nation, Director Michael E. Briant, Producer Barry Letts.  Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 23 February–16 March 1974. The Fifth Doctor characterises this impulse by saying, "However you respond Daleks is seen as an act of provocation." The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race, and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms. Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.Resurrection of the Daleks. Writer Eric Saward, Director Matthew Robinson, Producer John Nathan-Turner.  Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 8–15 February 1984.
The Dalek obsession with their own superiority is illustrated by the schism between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks seen in Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks: the two factions each consider the other to be a perversion despite the relatively minor differences between them.Remembrance of the Daleks. Writer Ben Aaronovitch, Director Andrew Morgan, Producer John Nathan-Turner. Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 5–26 October 1988. This intolerance of any "contamination" within themselves is also shown in "Dalek," The Evil of the Daleks and in the Big Finish Productions audio play The Mutant Phase.The Mutant Phase. Writer and Director Nicholas Briggs. Producers Gary Russell and Jason Haigh-Ellery. Big Finish Productions, 2000. This superiority complex is the basis of the Daleks' ruthlessness and lack of compassion. This is shown in extreme in "Victory of the Daleks," where the new, pure Daleks destroy their creators, impure Daleks, with the latters' consent. It is nearly impossible to negotiate or reason with a Dalek, a single-mindedness that makes them dangerous and not to be underestimated.  The Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) is later puzzled in the "Asylum of the Daleks" as to why the Daleks don't just kill the sequestered ones that have "gone wrong."  Although The Asylum is subsequently obliterated, the Prime Minister of the Daleks explains that "it is offensive to us to destroy such divine hatred," and the Doctor is sickened at the revelation that hatred is actually considered beautiful by the Daleks.
Dalek society is depicted as one of extreme scientific and technological advancement; the Third Doctor states that "it was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe." However, their reliance on logic and machinery is also a strategic weakness which they recognise, and thus use more emotion-driven species as agents to compensate for these shortcomings.
Although the Daleks are not known for their regard for due process, they have taken at least two enemies back to Skaro for a "trial", rather than killing them immediately. The first was their creator, Davros, in Revelation of the Daleks,Revelation of the Daleks. Writer Eric Saward, Director Graeme Harper, Producer John Nathan-Turner. Doctor Who. BBC1, London. 23–30 March 1985. and the second was the renegade Time Lord known as the Master in the 1996 television movie.Doctor Who. Writer Matthew Jacobs, Director Geoffrey Sax, Executive Producer Philip Segal. 1996. DVD. BBC Video, 2001. The reasons for the Master's trial, and why the Doctor would be asked to retrieve the Master's remains, have never been explained on screen. The Doctor Who Annual 2006 implies that the trial may have been due to a treaty signed between the Time Lords and the Daleks.Davies, Russell T. "Meet the Doctor." Doctor Who Annual 2006. Ed. Clayton Hickman. Tunbridge Wells: Panini, 2005. pp. 20–21. The framing device for the I, Davros audio plays is a Dalek trial to determine if Davros should be the Daleks' leader once more.I, Davros: Innocence. Writer Gary Hopkins, Director Gary Russell. Producers Gary Russell and Jason Haigh-Ellery. Big Finish Productions, 2006.
Spin-off novels contain several tongue-in-cheek mentions of Dalek poetry, and an anecdote about an opera based upon it, which was lost to posterity when the entire cast was exterminated on the opening night. Two stanzas are given in the novel The Also People by Ben Aaronovitch.[tpl]cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Aaronovitch| year=1995 |title=The Also People| location=London |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-426-20456-5| page=199[/tpl] In an alternative timeline portrayed in Big Finish Productions audio adventure The Time of the Daleks, the Daleks show a fondness for the works of Shakespeare.The Time of the Daleks. Writer Justin Richards, Director Nicholas Briggs, Producers Gary Russell and Jason Haigh-Ellery. Big Finish Productions, 2002. A similar idea was satirised by comedian Frankie Boyle in the BBC comedy quiz programme Mock the Week; he gave the fictional Dalek poem "Daffodils; EXTERMINATE DAFFODILS!" as an "unlikely line to hear in Doctor Who".Mock the Week. 7 July 2007. Season 5, episode 3.
Because the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective arch-enemy and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as "Ka Faraq Gatri" ("Bringer of Darkness" or "Destroyer of Worlds"), and "The Oncoming Storm".  Both the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In "Doomsday", Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million Cybermen as "pest control", "one Doctor" visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).  To his indignant surprise, in "Asylum of the Daleks", the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) learns that the Daleks have designated him as "The Predator."
As The Doctor escapes The Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting The Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in The Time of the Doctor, when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.

===Measurements===

A rel is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of time, with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in "Evolution of the Daleks" and Journey's End, counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 rels.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of velocity. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).
The rel was first used in the non-canonical feature film Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.

==Licensed appearances==

Two Doctor Who movies starring Peter Cushing featured the Daleks as the main villains: Dr. Who and the Daleks, and Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD, based on the television serials The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth, respectively. The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called "Dr. Who" he built a time-travelling device named Tardis, instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called "the TARDIS".Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129
Four books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s. The Dalek Book (1964, written by Terry Nation and David Whitaker), The Dalek World (1965, written by Nation and Whitaker) and The Dalek Outer Space Book (1966, by Nation and Brad Ashton) were all hardcover books formatted like annuals, containing text stories and comics about the Daleks, along with fictional information (sometimes based on the television serials, other times made up for the books).Howe (1992), p. 138  Nation also published The Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide, which collected articles and features treating the Daleks as if they were real.Howe (2003), pp.126–127  Four more annuals were published in the 1970s by World Distributors under the title Terry Nation's Dalek Annual (with cover dates 1976–1979, but published 1975–1978).Howe (1992), pp. 74–75  Two original novels by John Peel, War of the Daleks (1997) and Legacy of the Daleks (1998), were released as part of the Eighth Doctor Adventures series of Doctor Who novels.[tpl]cite book |title=War of the Daleks |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1997 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40573-2[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |title=Legacy of the Daleks |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1998 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40574-0[/tpl] Howe (2003), pp. 83–84  A novella, The Dalek Factor by Simon Clark, was published in 2004, and two books featuring the Daleks and the Tenth Doctor (I am a Dalek by Gareth Roberts, 2006, and Prisoner of the Daleks by Trevor Baxendale, 2009) have been released as part of the New Series Adventures.[tpl]cite book |title=The Dalek Factor |last=Clark |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Clark (novelist) |year=2004 |publisher=Telos Publishing |location=Tolworth, Surrey |isbn=1-903889-30-8[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |title=I am a Dalek |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |authorlink=Gareth Roberts (writer) |year=2006 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=1-84607-641-2[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |title=Prisoner of the Daleks |last=Baxendale |first=Trevor |authorlink=Trevor Baxendale |year=2009 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-48648-1[/tpl] Howe (2006), p. 51
Nation authorised the publication of the comic strip The Daleks in the comic TV Century 21 in 1965. The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and "heroes", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for Earth, which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor did show up later on in the programme.Howe (1992), p. 143
At the same time, a Doctor Who strip was also being published in TV Comic. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the First Doctor battled the "Trods" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the Second Doctor appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in The Trodos Ambush (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the Third Doctor-era Dr. Who comic strip that featured in the combined Countdown/TV Action comic during the early 1970s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide[/tpl]

===Non-Doctor Who television and film===

Daleks have made cameo appearances in television programmes and films unrelated to Doctor Who from the 1960s to the present day.
