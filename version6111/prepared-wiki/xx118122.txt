All Songs Written By Bob Hartman, except where noted.

==Backwards Masking==

This album included the use of the backmasking technique. According to many people, backmasking was being used in rock music to include hidden satanic messages. This caused a backlash from the Christian community against the genre. In an attempt to divert people obsessed with this from it, Petra used the technique with the intent to send a message. During the song "Judas' Kiss", from 0:00 â€“ 0:03, the phrase "What are you lookin' for the devil for when you oughta be lookin' for the Lord?" is heard when played in backwards motion.
