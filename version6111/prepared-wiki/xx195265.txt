[[Optical granulometry]]

CATEGORIES: Mining, Image processing

Optical granulometry is the process of measuring the different grain sizes in a granular material,Definition of granularity at GEMET based on a photograph.  Technology has been created to analyze a photograph and create statistics based on what the picture portrays.  This information is vital in maintaining machinery in various trades worldwide.  Mining companies can use optical granulometry to analyze inactive or moving rock to quantify the size of these fragments.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 68  Forestry companies can zero in on wood chip sizes without stopping the production process, and minimize sizing errors.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 47
With more photoanalysis technologies being produced, mining companies have shown an increased interest in these types of systems because of their ability to maintain efficiency throughout the mining process.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 258 Companies are saving millions of dollars annually because of this new technology, and are cutting back on maintenance costs on equipment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In order for optical granulometry to be completely successful, an accurate photo must be taken – under sufficient lighting, and using proper[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2009[/tpl] technology – to obtain quantified results.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 115 If these requirements are met, an image analysis system can be implemented.

Software uses four basic steps in determining the average size of material:
