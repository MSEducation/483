[[Acrophobia]]

CATEGORIES: Phobias, Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders

Acrophobia (from the [tpl]lang-el|ἄκρον[/tpl], ákron , meaning "peak, summit, edge" and [tpl]lang|el|φόβος[/tpl], phóbos, "fear") is an extreme or irrational fear of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort that share both similar etiology and options for treatment.
Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, especially if there is little or no protection.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] 
Acrophobia sufferers can experience a panic attack in a high place and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Between 2 and 5 percent of the general population suffer from acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men.[ref]

"Vertigo" is often used (incorrectly) to describe a fear of heights, but it is more accurately a spinning sensation that occurs when one is not actually spinning. It can be triggered by looking down from a high place, or by looking straight up at a high place or tall object, but this alone does not describe vertigo. True vertigo can be triggered by almost any type of movement (e.g. standing up, sitting down, walking) or change in visual perspective (e.g. squatting down, walking up or down stairs, looking out of the window of a moving car or train). Vertigo is qualified as height vertigo when referring to dizziness triggered by heights.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]  

==Causes==

Traditionally, acrophobia has been attributed, like other phobias, to conditioning or a traumatic experience involving heights.  Recent studies have cast doubt on this explanation;[tpl]cite journal | author=Menzies, RG |author2=Clarke, JC. |year=1995 |title=The etiology of acrophobia and its relationship to severity and individual response patterns |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |issue=31 |pages=499–501 |id=7677717 | volume=33 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(95)00023-Q | pmid=7677717[/tpl] fear of falling, along with fear of loud noises, is one of the most commonly suggested inborn or non-associative fears. The newer non-association theory is that fear of heights is an evolved adaptation to a world where falls posed a significant danger.   The degree of fear varies and the term phobia is reserved for those at the extreme end of the spectrum. Researchers have argued that fear of heights is an instinct found in many mammals, including domestic animals and humans. Experiments using visual cliffs have shown human infants and toddlers, as well as other animals of various ages, to be reluctant in venturing onto a glass floor with a view of a few meters of apparent fall-space below it.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps05.html |author=Eleanor J. Gibson, Richard D. Walk |title=The "Visual Cliff" |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-05-13[/tpl]  While an innate cautiousness around heights is helpful for survival, an extreme fear can interfere with the activities of everyday life, such as climbing up a flight of stairs or a ladder or even standing on a chair.
A possible contributing factor is dysfunction in maintaining balance. In this case the anxiety is both well founded and secondary.  The human balance system integrates proprioceptive, vestibular and nearby visual cues to reckon position and motion.[tpl]cite journal |last=Furman |first=Joseph M |date=May 2005 |title=Acrophobia and pathological height vertigo: indications for vestibular physical therapy? |journal=Physical Therapy |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Acrophobia+and+pathological+height+vertigo:+indications+for+...-a0140560534 |accessdate= 2007-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Jacob |first=Rolf G |author2=Woody, Shelia R|author3=Clark, Duncan B.|author4= et al. |date=December 1993 |title=Discomfort with space and motion: A possible marker of vestibular dysfunction assessed by the situational characteristics questionnaire |journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=299–324 |issn=0882-2689 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x84403511772np14/ |accessdate= 2007-09-10 |doi=10.1007/BF00965035[/tpl] As height increases, visual cues recede and balance becomes poorer even in normal people.[ref]
