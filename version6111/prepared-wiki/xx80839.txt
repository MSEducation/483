CATEGORIES: Tea, Cocktails with rum

Jagertee (also Jägertee) is an alcoholic beverage made by mixing overproof rum with black tea. It is served warm and is typically consumed during winter in the cold parts of Central Europe.[tpl]citation |title=Little Tea Book |first=Rose Marie |last=Donhauser |publisher=Silverback Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59637-074-6 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9mS-6xfbS80C[/tpl]
Although Jagertee is easily made at home, ready-made mixtures which also contain sugar and spices are sold in shops. The Austrian Stroh rum is often used for making it; this brand also produces its own ready-made variety.
Jagertee has become a popular après-ski drink, especially among tourists in the Alps, where it has caused some serious skiing accidents when taken avant-ski.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Jagertee (alternatively Jagatee or Jägertee) is derived from the Austro-Bavarian pronunciation of the standard German Jäger "hunter" + Tee "tea". According to EC Regulation 110/2008, Annex III, No. 32, it is a Protected Designation of Origin reserved for the beverage made in Austria.[tpl]cite web |title= Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the EuPopean Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89  | work=Official Journal on EUR-Lex | publisher=EU Publications Office | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:039:0016:0054:EN:PDF | accessdate=2009-07-15[/tpl] Therefore varieties made in Germany are sold under names like Hüttentee ("hut tea") or Förstertee ("forester tea"). It has also been sold under the name of Grog in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Some rural establishments also serve Wilderertee ("poacher's tea"), which is even stronger.
