[[Australoid race]]

CATEGORIES: Australoid type, Historical definitions of race

The Australoid race is a broad racial classification. The concept originated with a typological method of racial classification.O'Neil, Dennis. "Biological Anthropology Terms." 2006. May 13, 2007. Palomar College.http://anthro.palomar.edu/tutorials/pglossary.htmhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/first/gill.html Does Race Exist? A proponent's perspective by George W. Gill.Moore, Ruth Evolution (Life Nature Library) New York:1962 Time, Inc. Chapter 8: "The Emergence of Modern Homo Sapiens" Page 173 – First page of picture section "Man and His Genes": The Australoid race is identified as one of the five major races of mankind, along with the Mongoloid, Negroid, Caucasoid, and Capoid races (pictures of a person typical of each race are shown) They were described as having dark skin with wavy hair, in the case of the Veddoid race of South Asia (including the eponymous Vedda people autochthonous to Sri Lanka) and Aboriginal Australians, or hair ranging from straight to kinky in the case of the Melanesian and Negrito groups.
According to this model of classification, Australoid peoples ranged throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, New Guinea, Melanesia, the Andaman Islands, the Indian subcontinent, as well as parts of the Middle East. In the mid-twentieth century, a separate argument emerged that Australoids were linked to Proto-Caucasoids. 
In the Out of Africa theory, the ancestors of the Australoids, the Proto-Australoids, are thought to have been the first branch off from the Proto-Capoids to migrate from Africa about 60,000 BCE, migrating along the now submerged continental shelf of the northern shore of the Indian Ocean and reaching Australia about 50,000 BCE. This ostensible Proto-Australoid–Proto-Capoid link, however, has been contested.

==History==

In the late nineteenth century, anthropometric studies led to a proposition of racial groups, one of which was termed "Australioid" by Thomas Huxley in an essay 'On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind' (1870), in which he divided humanity into four principal groups (Xanthochroic, Mongoloid, Negroid, and Australioid).Huxley, Thomas On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006
Huxley also concluded that the Melanochroi (Peoples of the Mediterranean race) are of a mixture of the Xanthochroi (northern Europeans) and Australioids.Huxley, Thomas. On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006.  Later writers dropped the first "i" in Australioid, establishing Australoid as the standard spelling.
According to Peter Bellwood, "many of the present Southern Mongoloid populations of Indonesia and Malaysia also have a high degree of Australo-Melanesian genetic heritage."[tpl]cite book|last=Bellwood|first=Peter|title=Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago|publisher=Australian National University|year=1985|isbn=978-1-921313-11-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4obAfGBGKY0C&pg=RA1-PA346&lpg=RA1-PA346&dq=australomelanesoid|pages=92[/tpl]
One proponent, R. Ruggles Gates, argued in 1960 that "If the Ainu are partly of Australoid origin it is also clear that they are even more nearly derived from archaic Caucasian ancestry".Ruggles Gates, R. "The Australian Aboriginals in a New Setting", Man, April 1960, pp. 53-6, http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0025-1496(196004)1%3A60%3C53%3A7TAAIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X M.K. Bhasin (2006) suggests that the "Australoids" "differentiated... perhaps from a common type before the separation of the Mongoloids and Caucasoids"[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/IJHG/IJHG-06-0-000-000-2006-Web/IJHG-06-3-177-280-2006-Abst-PDF/IJHG-06-3-233-274-2006-000-Bhasin-M-K/IJHG-06-3-233-274-2006-000-Bhasin-M-K-Text.PDF|last=Bhasin|first=M.K.|title=Genetics of Caste and Tribes of India: Indian Population Milieu|journal=Int J Hum Genet|volume=6|issue=3|pages=233–274|year=2006|publisher=Kamla Raj|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl]

==India==

Huxley's original model included the population of India under the Australoid category. The American Journal of Physical Anthropology (1996, p. 382) by American Association of Physical Anthropologists. L. L. (Luigi Luca) Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza in their text, The History and Geography of Human Genes (1994, P. 241) both use the term.

A 2006 CFSL research article which assessed "3522 individuals belonging to 54 (23 belonging to the Austroasiatic, 18 to Dravidian, 7 to Tibeto-Burman and 24 to Indo-European linguistic groups) endogamous Indian populations, representing all major ethnic, linguistic and geographic groups" for genetic variations to support such classifications found no conclusive evidence. It further summed that "the absence of genetic markers to support the general clustering of population groups based on ethnic, linguistic, geographic or socio-cultural affiliations" undermines the broad groupings based on such affiliations that exist in population genetic studies and forensic databases.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2156-7-28|title=Genetic structure of Indian populations based on fifteen autosomal microsatellite loci|author=Kashyap, VK and Guha, S. and Sitalaximi, T. and Bindu, G.H. and Hasnain, S.E. and Trivedi, R.|journal=BMC Genetics|volume=7|pages=28|year=2006|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2156-7-28.pdf|pmid=16707019|pmc=1513393[/tpl]

==Physical features==

Forensic anthropologist Caroline Wilkenson wrote in 2004 that Australoids have the largest brow ridges "with moderate to large supraorbital arches". Caucasoids have the second largest brow ridges with "moderate supraorbital ridges". Negroids have the third largest brow ridges with an "undulating supraorbital ridge". Mongoloids are "absent browridges", so they have the smallest brow ridges.Wilkenson, Caroline. Forensic Facial Reconstruction. Cambridge University Press. 2004. ISBN 0-521-82003-0
Huxley wrote in 1870 that Australoids are usually dolichocephalic;Huxley, T. H. "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind" (1870) Journal of the Ethnological Society of London their hair is usually silky, black and wavy; they usually have large, heavy jaws and prognathism; their skin is the color of chocolate and the irises are dark brown or black.

==The first Americans?==

Skulls of individuals with Australoid morphologies have been found in the Americas, leading to speculation that peoples with phenotypical similarities to modern Australoids may have been the earliest occupants of the continent.Ancient voyage of discovery, Independent, The (London), Apr 8, 1996 by David KeysScientific American, Skulls Suggest Differing Stocks for First Americans, December 13, 2005[ref]National Geographic, Americas Settled by Two Groups of Early Humans, Study Says, Dec 12, 2005
[/ref]  If this hypothesis is correct, it would mean that some Proto-Australoids continued the Great Coastal Migration beyond Southeast Asia along the continental shelf north in East Asia and across the Bering land bridge, reaching the Americas about 52,000 BCE.
Christy Turner notes that "cranial analyses of some South American crania have suggested that there might have been some early migration of "Australoids."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RI32r548fUwC|last=Turner|first=Christy|chapter=Teeth, Needles, Dogs and Siberia: Bioarchaeological Evidence for the Colonization of the New World|title=The First Americans: The Pleistocene Colonization of the New World'|publisher=University of California Press|year=2002|page=138 | isbn=978-0-940228-50-4[/tpl] However, Turner argues that cranial morphology suggests "Sinodonty" in all the populations he has studied.
One of the earliest skulls recovered by archaeologists is a specimen named the Luzia Woman. According to archaeologist Walter Neves of the University of São Paulo, Luzia's Paleo-Indian predecessors lived in South East Asia for tens of thousands of years, after migrating from Africa, and began arriving in the New World, as early as 15,000 years ago. Some anthropologists have hypothesized that Paleo-Indians migrated along the coast of East Asia and Beringia in small watercraft, before or during the last Ice Age.
Neves' conclusions have been challenged by research done by anthropologists Rolando Gonzalez-Jose, Frank Williams and William Armelagos who have shown in their studies that the cranio-facial variability could just be due to genetic drift and other factors affecting cranio-facial plasticity in Native Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B1JyLBsGC0mKNWJjODY5OTktZjZmZi00MWNmLTgwZmEtMWUyNGE2OWRmOGZi&hl=en|title=Kennewick and Luzia: Lessons From the European Upper Paleolithic|author=Frank L'Engle Williams|publisher=AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AVJyLBsGC0mKZGZucHhrNTRfMTRjd20zbnBkOQ&hl=en|title=THE KENNEWICK FOLLIES: "New" Theories about the Peopling of the Americas|author=Stuart J.
