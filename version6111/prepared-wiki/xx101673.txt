The Southern Cross Cable, operated by Bermuda company Southern Cross Cables Limited, is a trans-Pacific network of telecommunications cables commissioned in 2000.
The network has 28,900 km of submarine and 1,600 km of terrestrial fiber optic cables, operated in a triple-ring configuration.  Initially, each cable had a bandwidth capacity of 120 gigabit/s,Southern Cross Cables Network but was doubled in an upgrade in April 2008,Big Southern Cross Cable Upgrade for High Speed Broadband with a further upgrade to 860 gigabit/s at the end of 2008.Southern Cross upgrades planned in 2008 Southern Cross upgraded the existing system to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010.Broadband in for another price fall and capacity boost After successful trials of 40G technology the first 400G of a planned 800G upgrade has been completed in February 2012, with the remaining 400G  completed in December 2012.Southern Cross committed to Ultra Fast Broadband and National Broadband Network An additional 400G was deployed utilising 100G coherent wavelength technology in July 2013, taking total system capacity to 2.6Tbit/s, with an additional 500Gbit/s to be deployed per segment by Q2 2014, increasing total system capacity to 3.6Tbit/s.
The latest augmentation will also deploy Ciena FlexiGrid technology, increase Southern Cross potential capacity to 12 Tbit/s. Southern Cross offers capacity services from STM-1 to 100Gbit/s OTU-4, including 1G, 10G and 40G Ethernet Private Line services.

==Topology==

The network topology is configured to have redundant paths and be self-healing in case of physical damage.

==Damage incidents==

There have been several incidents damaging sections of the Southern Cross Cable, in part due to it traversing the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire and its long length.
In late 2007, Southern Cross Cable's operations vice president, Dean Veverka, confirmed that hurricane strength storms and flooding had wiped out the carrier's Oregon cable route and halved its bandwidth between Australia/New Zealand/Fiji and USA. A Southern Cross customer (iiNet) said that emergency works have been organised to perform a more permanent fix for the damage to the cable. These works were performed on 3 February 2008 at 12 midnight AEST.iiNet status page: information regarding Southern Cross cable repairs
In March 2008, the then head of Telecom Wholesale, Matt Crockett, mentioned to the National Business Review that there had been a recent undersea earthquake that destroyed a shunt on the Southern Cross Cable. However due to the Cable's redundancy and spare capacity, users experienced no change in access or speed.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/chris-keall/earthquake-hits-southern-cross-cable |title=Earthquake hits Southern Cross Cable |author=Keall, Chris |date=6 March 2009 |work=National Business Review |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]

==Construction and ownership==

Construction of the cable began in July 1999, laid by the ship CS Vercors, and the system was in use by customers by November 2000.  Additional works and upgrades have since taken place to increase the network's capacity to 480 Gbit/s. In August 2007, SC Cables contracted with Alcatel-Lucent to upgrade the cable to 660 Gbit/s by the end of the first quarter 2008 and to 860 Gbit/s by the end of 2008, with future upgrade also by Alcatel-Lucent to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010.Contract awarded to upgrade Southern Cross cable network: New technology will facilitate future upgrades up to 2.4 Tbit/s., Computerworld, accessed 24 August 2007
The company is owned by Telecom New Zealand (50.01%), SingTel (39.99%) and Verizon Business (10.00%).
