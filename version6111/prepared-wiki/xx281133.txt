==Background of the massacre==

At the time of the uprising the town had 18,000 inhabitants and was mainly a town of sulphur miners. Working conditions in the mines were appalling, including child labour by so-called carusi.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Le sette vittime del Natale 1893, La Sicilia, December 7, 2008
The Fascio dei Lavoratori in Lercara Friddi had been founded between July and September 1893 among peasants and sulphur miners. On November 8, 1893, a committee was formed to negotiate with the landowners an mine-owners to improve working conditions. However, the political situation was also marked by a fierce battle between the Sartorio and the Nicolosi families about who would rule th town. Different "spurious" elements were present in the Fascio of Lercara Friddi that responded more to the logic of the struggle for the conquest of power between the powerful local town families, rather than the need for social emancipation of the workers.
Serious disagreements emerged within the Fascio, and Bernardino Verro, the charismatic leader of the Fascio in Corleone, was asked to intervene. He arrived on December 19, 1893, and found a chaotic situation and irresponsible spending of the organisationâ€™s funds. He dissolved the organisation and nominated a committee to reorganise it. The intervention of Verro caused discontent, in particular with the former secretary Francesco Piazza. The dissenters wanted to organise a demonstration the next dat, but were stopped by Verro, claiming that violence against the tax tollhouses and municipality would be counterproductive and that in the strctly organized movement in Corleone these kinds of disorders did not happen. However, after Verro left, the protests did erupt.

==The massacre==

Already on December 24, protesters against high excise duties had sacked and burned tollhouses.More Tax Riots in Sicily, The New York Times, December 25, 1893 Government troops and authorities were sent to the town. The next day, on Christmass, several thousand protestors gathered again at the central square before the municipality. Their shouts Down with taxes! Down with the mayor! were greeted with Death to the instigators! from the balconies of the houses of the affluent on the main square.
The sub-prefect of Palermo tried to calm down the rally, promising the abolition of the duties, while addressing them from the balcony of the town hall. He had to withdraw because the protesters started throwing rocks. With the public prosecutor and the examining magistrate, he was forced to flee by climbing down a window at the back. On the square, protesters with rocks and sticks confronted government troops that opened fire when the mob risked to break through, leaving several dead and many wounded.

==Aftermath==

The Lercara Friddi massacre was one was the first in a series of bloody incidents that would lead up to the proclamation of a state of siege by Prime minister Francesco Crispi on January 4, 1894, that would crack down heavily on the Fasci.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Assolti per insufficienza di prove, La Sicilia, December 11, 2011
