[[You Are the Woman]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 singles, Firefall songs

"You Are the Woman" is the title of a 1976 Top Ten hit by Firefall. Written by Rick Roberts, then the group's frontman, the track is distinguished by the performance on flute of Firefall member David Muse.
Roberts would recall writing "You Are the Woman": "When that chorus and tune jumped into my head I realized I was not creating...one of the great works of art in history...rather a bouncy little pop ditty...I was stumped for several months about where the verses should go develop lyrically. Then I realized I was over thinking it. I took a more simple approach, and the verses were finished in a day or two."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rarwriter.com/Feature_RickRoberts_22_16.htm |title=Singer Songwriter Rick Roberts |publisher=Rarwriter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl]
Introduced on Firefall, the band's debut album recorded at Miami's Criteria Studios and released in the spring of 1976, "You Are the Woman" was issued as the album's second single that summer after several other tracks had received airplay on FM radio including the lead single: "Livin' Aint Livin'", which had just missed the Top 40 of the Hot 100 in Billboard. After two months of support in smaller markets, "You Are the Woman" broke in such larger areas as Chicago and Houston in October 1976 effecting a Top 40 entry with a subsequent ascent to a #9 peak that November. 
Jock Bartley of Firefall would account for the popularity of "You Are the Woman" thus: "Every female between the ages of 18 and 24 wanted to be the woman portrayed in the song, and that caused their boyfriends and spouses to call radio stations and subsequently flood the airwaves with dedications of the song and the sentiment. The message was simple and sincere, and the song was easy to sing. It was like our fans let us be a singing version of the Hallmark card that said what they weren't quite sure what to express."Roger Blackwell & Tina Stephan Brands That Rock John Wiley & Sons Inc Hoboken NJ (2004) ISBN 0-471-45517-2p.8
Bartley, the sole founding member of Firefall to remain with the group to the present, also states: "Everybody knows 'You Are The Woman'. It ended up kind of being a hindrance because people would only hear 'You Are The Woman' and would think, oh, that light Rock band from Colorado. We're actually a pretty smokin' Rock band that really has fun onstage and cooks and jams and plays 'You Are The Woman' also."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/FirefallInterview.html |title=Firefall Interview |publisher=Classicbands.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl]
A hit for Firefall in Canada (#6) and New Zealand (#15), "You Are the Woman" was remade by Josh Kelley for the Herbie: Fully Loaded soundtrack (2005).
