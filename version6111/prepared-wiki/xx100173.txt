Mattias Öhlund (born September 9, 1976) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman and an alternate captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to joining the Lightning, he played eleven seasons with the Vancouver Canucks. Öhlund played two seasons in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the second highest tier of hockey in Sweden, with Piteå HC before being selected by the Canucks thirteenth overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft; he then joined Luleå HF of the Elitserien, the highest league in Sweden, winning the Le Mat Trophy as league champions in 1996. He began his NHL career with Vancouver in 1997–98, the start of an eleven-year tenure with the club. A serious eye injury before his third NHL season was the first of many injuries Öhlund has sustained over his career, and he has only played a full season twice in eleven years. A four-time winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team's best defenceman, Öhlund is the Canucks' all-time leading goal and point-scorer among defencemen.
Internationally, Öhlund has represented Sweden in numerous tournaments, beginning with three World Junior Championships that included Best Defenceman honours as part of a silver medal effort in 1996. He has since competed in three World Championships, earning gold in 1998, and three Winter Olympics, earning gold in 2006.

==Playing career==

===Sweden===

Öhlund began his playing career with Piteå HC in his hometown, playing two seasons with the team. As a large, mobile defenceman, he was heavily scouted by scouts from several NHL teams during his final season with Piteå.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=15149|title=Mattias Öhlund Page|accessdate=2009-09-30|publisher=Legends of Hockey|year=2009|author=Legends of Hockey[/tpl] He was the Vancouver Canucks' first pick, thirteenth overall, in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Rather than join the Canucks, Öhlund stayed in Sweden as a result of a dispute over his contract with the team. He joined a new team, Luleå HF of the top Swedish league, the Elitserien. In his first season in the premier league in Sweden, Öhlund scored 16 points in 34 games. The following season Öhlund had 14 points in 38 games as Luleå won the Le Mat Trophy as champions of the Elitserien, their first league championship.[tpl]cite book|last=Rud|first=Jeff|title=Canucks Legends: Vancouver's Hockey Heroes|year=2006|publisher=Raincoast Books|location=Vancouver|ISBN=978-1-55192-809-8|pages=236–37[/tpl] Appearing in 47 games with Luleå during the 1996–97 season, Öhlund scored seven goals and had an additional nine assists.[tpl]cite book|author=National Hockey League|title=National Hockey League Official Guide & Record Book 2010|year=2009|publisher=Dan Diamond & Associates, Inc.|location=Toronto|ISBN=978-1-894801-16-4|page=496[/tpl]

===Vancouver Canucks===

Four years after being drafted by the Canucks, Öhlund was set to be eligible to re-enter the NHL Entry Draft when he signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 1, 1997. Worth US$10 million over five years, including a signing bonus of $7.5 million, it was considerably more than the maximum rookie contract of $850,000 per year the Canucks, as the team that drafted Öhlund, were allowed to offer. Under league rules, the Canucks were given one week to either match the contract or trade Öhlund's NHL rights to the Maple Leafs. Rather than lose him, the Canucks agreed to the contract on August 7.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/1997/08/07/news.ohlund.html|title=Canucks match offer sheet for Swedish D Mattias Ohlund|accessdate=2009-10-01|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=1997-08-07|author=CNN/SI[/tpl]
As part of a promotion for the 1998 Winter Olympics, the first to allow NHL participation in the ice hockey tournament, the Canucks opened the 1997–98 NHL season with a pair of games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo.[tpl]cite book|last=Hughes|first=Morgan|last2=Fischler|first2=Stan and Shirley|last3=Romain|first3=Joseph|last4=Duplacey|first4=James|title=Hockey Chronicle: Year-by-Year History of the National Hockey League|year=2003|publisher=Publications International, Ltd.|location=Lincolnwood, Illinois|isbn=0-7853-9624-1|page=592[/tpl] Öhlund thus played his first NHL game in Japan on October 3, 1997.

His 30 points, the fifth best total among first year players and highest by a rookie defenceman, helped him earn a position on the NHL All-Rookie Team.[tpl]cite book|author=National Hockey League|title=1999 NHL Yearbook|year=1998|publisher=Worldsport Properties|location=Toronto|page=60[/tpl] 
In his second season in the NHL, Öhlund was selected to the annual NHL All-Star Game as a replacement for an injured player. Playing for the World team, composed of NHLers from outside North America, Öhlund scored one goal and had an assist as the North American team won, 8–6. With nine goals and 35 points in 74 games, Öhlund led the Canucks' defencemen in scoring and placed fifth overall on the team.[tpl]cite book|last=Podnieks|first=Andrew|title=The NHL All-Star Game: Fifty Years of the Great Tradition|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins|location=Toronto|ISBN=0-00-200058-X|page=259[/tpl]
Prior to the start of the 1999–2000 NHL season, in a pre-season game against the Ottawa Senators on September 21, 1999, a puck deflected off Öhlund's stick and struck him in the right eye. The injury forced Öhlund to miss the first 38 games of the season. He underwent surgery to correct his vision and returned to the Canucks the same season and scored 20 points in 42 games, again winning the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks' best defenceman. The following year, he missed an additional 17 games after undergoing surgery once more to relieve building internal pressure on his eye.[tpl]cite web|title=Ohlund's contract extended|url=http://origin.www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/10/05/ohlund011004.html|author=CBC Sports|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=2008-07-30|date=2001-10-05[/tpl] Playing in his first game back in the lineup on November 28, 2000, Öhlund scored the game-winning goal for the Canucks in a 4–1 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.[tpl]cite web|title=Ohlund returns to lead Canucks over Ducks|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/11/28/canucks-ducks001128.html|accessdate=2009-05-17|date=2000-11-28|author=CBC Sports|publisher=CBC.ca[/tpl] Öhlund played the final 65 games of the season, scoring eight goals and 28 points.

The 2001–02 season saw Öhlund play 81 games and record a career-high 36 points, with an additional two points in six playoff games. A knee injury during the 2002–03 season led Öhlund to miss several games;[tpl]Cite web|title=Canucks depth to receive first true test|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/12/17/canuckshawks021217.html|accessdate=2009-05-17|date=2002-12-17|author=CBC Sports|publisher=CBC.ca[/tpl] while he only scored 2 goals in the 59 games he played in, Öhlund set a career-high in assists with 27. That was followed by appearing in a career-high 13 playoff games, where he had three goals and four assists for seven points. In 2003–04, Öhlund tallied a career-high 14 goals and played in all 82 games with Vancouver for the first time in his career. For his efforts, Öhlund was named the winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy..
The 2004–05 season was cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Like many other NHL players, Öhlund played in Europe, joining his former team, Luleå HF, on December 21.

Including several NHL players, the game raised nearly $1 million for charity.[tpl]cite book|last=Podnieks|title=The Lost Season|page=23[/tpl] The NHL resumed play for the 2005–06 season; Öhlund recorded 33 points in 78 games, including leading Canucks defencemen with 13 goals, winning the Babe Pratt Trophy for the fourth time in his career.[tpl]cite book|author=National Hockey League|title=2007 NHL Yearbook|year=2006|publisher=CCMC|location=Toronto|page=199[/tpl]
Early in the 2007–08 season, Öhlund received a four-game suspension, the first of his career, for an incident near the end of a November 16, 2007, game against the Minnesota Wild. In the third period, Wild forward Mikko Koivu hit Öhlund in the head with his elbow, and Öhlund retaliated by slashing Koivu in the leg with his stick, breaking Koivu's fibula.[tpl]cite news|last=Jamieson|first=Jim|title=Ohlund gets 4 games for Wild slash|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=b00a7d11-a06b-4006-b4e4-a7b9355286ce|work=The Province|location=Vancouver|accessdate=2009-10-13|date=2007-11-19[/tpl] After returning from the suspension, Öhlund became the Canucks' all-time leader in goals among defencemen, scoring the game-tying goal against the Edmonton Oilers on December 15, 2007, to pass former teammate Jyrki Lumme with 84 goals.[tpl]cite web|title=Shootout Shoot-down|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=452422|last=Harland|first=Kyle|publisher=Canucks.com|date=2007-12-16|accessdate=2009-10-03[/tpl] After bone chips were detected in his knee in early March 2008, Öhlund underwent knee surgery on March 13 and missed the remainder of the season.

With the departure of Markus Näslund in the 2008 off-season, Öhlund became the longest serving player on the Canucks' roster.[tpl]cite news|last=Pap|first=Elliott|title=Ohlund wants Sundin to choose Vancouver|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=7e2e0a00-a534-4d2b-a516-f277398df290|work=Vancouver Sun|location=Vancouver|accessdate=2008-07-30|date=2008-07-07[/tpl] Before the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Öhlund was named, along with Ryan Kesler and Willie Mitchell as alternate captains to goaltender Roberto Luongo, who replaced Näslund as captain. Due to the limitations of having a goalie as captain, Öhlund was designated the captain's traditional duty of taking ceremonial faceoffs. Beginning the season 22 points behind Jyrki Lumme and Dennis Kearns for the franchise's all-time point-scoring record for a defenceman, Öhlund surpassed the mark on March 15, 2009, with an assist in a 4–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche for his 322nd point as a Canuck.[ref]

Early in his career, Öhlund was selected to play in three World Junior Championships for Sweden. Beginning in 1994, he contributed two assists in seven games as part of a silver medal effort. As the medals were determined by a round-robin format, Sweden fell one point short of Canada, losing 6–4 to them in their final and deciding game. After a bronze medal in 1995, Öhlund returned for a third straight World Junior tournament in 1996 to record five assists and was named the tournament's Best Defenceman. He was additionally named to the Tournament All-Star Team as he captured his second World Junior silver medal.
