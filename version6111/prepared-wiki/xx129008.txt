Epigram is produced fortnightly during term time, and as of May 2012 the newspaper has reached 250 editions.  It is available as a paper edition distributed freely around the university, with articles and discussion also appearing online.  The paper follows a traditional newspaper layout: the front of the newspaper is devoted to news issues, particularly those concerning students at the university. 
The paper has a 30-strong editorial team consisting of students from the second year and above (formal recruitment is carried out in the last term of an academic year). The current editor is Josephine Franks, and the deputy editor is Alex Bradbrook. 
All students at the University are encouraged to write for the paper and each section of the paper has a weekly publicised meeting to discuss and allocate stories for the next edition - there are opportunities to join each section team at the Freshers' Fair at the beginning of the year or by emailing the relevant section editor.Epigram Online - Bristol University's Independent Student Newspaper

==Political stance==

Epigram often attempts to be the voice of the students in a debate. In November 2006 Epigram published appeals from history students decrying the new teaching system that was to be implemented. This brought the issue to a much wider stage including several national broadsheet newspapers. The story first published in Epigram was picked up by The Times newspaper and the BBCNews and Views from The Times and Sunday Times | Times OnlineBristol students angry at tuition cuts | Special Reports | EducationGuardian.co.ukBBC NEWS | Education | Tutorials 'hit by staffing cuts' The Telegraph cites Epigram in stating the History students were made aware of the courses structure before starting the course.Students protest as Bristol cuts tuition to two hours a week - Telegraph
