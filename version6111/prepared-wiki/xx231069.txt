The .32 Long Colt (commonly called the .32 LC or simply  .32 Colt) is an American centerfire fire revolver cartridge.
Introduced by Colt's with the New Line revolver in 1873, the .32 Colt was inspired by the .320 Revolver.Barnes, p.155, ".320 Revolver". It originally used a .313 in (7.95 mm)-diameter 90 gr (5.8 g) outside-lubricated bullet, which was later changed to inside lubrication, leading to a diameter change to .299 in (7.59 mm), a slight reduction in bullet weight, and a shortening of overall length.Barnes, p.155, ".32 Long Colt—.32 Short Colt".
With a case lengthened by .31 in (7.87 mm) over the .32 Short Colt (which means the .32 SC will chamber and fire in any weapon designed for the LC), the .32LC is in the same class in power as the .32 Smith and Wesson Long,Barnes, p.155, ".32 Long Colt;—.32 Short Colt". without comparable accuracy.
More popular in Europe than North America, Colt was the most prominent American manufacturer which chambered any weapons in .32 Long Colt, most notably the Police Positive. Others included Marlin in their model 1892, Ballard in some single shot rifles, and other smaller manufacturers.[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl] The FAMAE revolver produced in Chile is currently offered in .32 Long Colt.[tpl]cite web |title=Famae 0.38 Special revolver (Chile), Pistols |url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Infantry-Weapons/Famae-0-38-Special-revolver-Chile.html |date=Jan 21, 2009 |work=Jane's Infantry Weapons |publisher= Jane's Information Group |accessdate=2009-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Jones| first = Richard| title = Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009-2010 | publisher = Jane's Information Group| year = 2009| isbn =0-7106-2869-2  | page =19[/tpl]
