CATEGORIES: Dairy products, Historical alcoholic beverages, Mixed drinks

A caudle is a British thickened and sweetened alcoholic hot drink, somewhat like eggnog. It was popular in the Middle Ages for its supposed medicinal properties.
The OED cites the use of the word to 1297.  The earliest surviving recipe, from 1300â€“1325, is simply a list of ingredients: wine, wheat starch, raisins, and sugar to "abate the strength of the wine".Item 5, Diuersa Cibaria, BL MS Add.  46919 ff, 19r-24v, reprinted in Hieatt & Butler, Curye on Inglysch, Early English Text Society 1985, ISBN 0-19-722409-1, p. 45
Another recipe from the late 14th century has more ingredients and more details on the cooking procedure: mix breadcrumbs, wine, sugar or honey, and saffron, bring to a boil, then thicken with egg yolks, and sprinkle with salt, sugar, and ginger.
