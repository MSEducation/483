==Early life and education==

Kuttler was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, to Carl Martin Kuttler and Rema Winona Ellis.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?ei=tdbwTdeMN461hAe0vqwf&ct=result&id=EpRRAAAAMAAJ&dq=carl+m.+kuttler%2C+jr&q=carl+kuttler%2C+jr |page=108 |title=The descendants of Simpson-Roach families of South Carolina, including allied families and genealogical briefs of Berry, Bratton, Pickens, Moffett, Drennan, Boyd, Wylie, Mecklin, Sadler, Farmer, Sanders, Nelson, Springs |last=Perry |first=Max |publisher=Max Perry|year=1974[/tpl] His family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida when he was four years old. At St. Petersburg High School, he was told by a guidance counselor that he was "not college material", so after graduation he planned to work in his uncle's meat supply business. But his father convinced him to enroll in college.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/10/24/Floridian/One_odd_duck.shtml |title=One Odd Duck: A mediocre student who became president of St. Petersburg College, Carl Kuttler does one heck of a Donald Duck.

==Career==

He began his career at St. Petersburg Junior College in 1966 as assistant to the vice president for administration. From 1967 to 1978 he served as dean of administrative affairs. Upon the retirement of college president Michael M. Bennett in 1978,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spjc.edu/central/ir/Factbook/FactBookHist1998.htm |title=History of St. Petersburg Junior College |publisher=St. Petersburg Junior College |accessdate=12 June 2011 |year=1998[/tpl] Kuttler assumed the presidency, becoming one of Florida's youngest-ever community college presidents. During his tenure, he oversaw the transition of the college to a four-year institution (now called St. Petersburg College) offering over 20 bachelor's degrees,[tpl]cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z_sDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA220&dq=carl+m.+kuttler,+jr&hl=en&ei=tsjwTeQSxpqFB6LB9EQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-preview-link&resnum=5&ved=0CD8QuwUwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A Look at Evelyn and Carl Kuttler, Jr. |journal=Tampa Bay Magazine |date=Jan–Feb 2008 |page=220[/tpl] the expansion of the campus from two campuses to 10 learning locations,[tpl]cite web |url=http://beta2.tbo.com/news/education-news/2009/jul/21/carl-kuttler-resigns-st-petersburg-college-preside-ar-94732/ |title=Carl Kuttler resigns as St. Petersburg College president |work=Tampa Bay Online |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] and an increase in enrollment from 13,300 to 36,133 students.
Kuttler was known as an "entrepreneurial" college president[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/crime-law-enforcement-corrections/law-narcotics/11574667-1.html |title=Florida's Most Influential |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |publisher=All Business.com|page=49[/tpl] for his efforts to form partnerships between St. Petersburg College and governments, businesses, cultural institutions, and other colleges and universities. These include the development of the $32 million EpiCenter corporate training center in Largo;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spcollege.edu/epicenter/index.htm |title=EpiCenter at St. Petersburg College |publisher=St. Petersburg College |accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] joint-use libraries for St. Petersburg College and Seminole State; the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art on the St. Petersburg College campus in Tarpon Springs; and the St. Petersburg College downtown center serving The Florida Orchestra, American Stage, and Palladium Theater. In 1988, Kuttler leveraged a gift of land and facilities worth $11.2 million from the Allstate Insurance Company with over $30 million in state and federal grants to create a home for the college's Open Campus program, Southeastern Public Safety Institute for law-enforcement programs, and central computer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&Submenu=1&FT=D&File=hb9155.html&Directory=session/1999/House/bills/billtext/html/|title=House Resolution – HR 9155 |year=1999 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |publisher=Florida House of Representatives[/tpl] He also raised money in the public arena. In his first year as president, he put a referendum on the Pinellas County ballot seeking a temporary hike in property taxes to raise $500,000 for college improvements, which passed voter approval. The college also petitioned for and received $6.5 million from the Florida state legislature to purchase and remodel three retail buildings for college use.
Kuttler was known for calling and sending a card to each of the college's 1,000 full-time employees on their birthdays. He also sent birthday gifts to Florida legislators – "ties for the men and scarves, pins, or Kmart crystal for the women" – and sent a potted plant to every new community college and university president in Florida. He instituted an employee recognition program and dispatched a congratulatory letter to every St. Petersburg College student who placed in the top 3% of academic achievement.

===International relationships===

Kuttler formed international relationships and joint educational ventures with Russia, China, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Italy, and other countries. Music, dance, and ballet performances have been part of the U.S.-Russian cultural exchange. St. Petersburg College's police training academy has trained 6,000 of Puerto Rico's 18,000 police officers.
Beginning in 1989, Kuttler established a 20-year relationship with the Russian government, supporting educational, political and business initiatives. In 1989 Kuttler hosted his first Russian delegation at St. Petersburg College and embarked on a 10-day exchange program in which Vladimir Putin, then an associate vice president at Saint Petersburg State University in St. Petersburg, Russia, was his daily host. Kuttler made another two visits to Russia over the years, giving interviews on Russian national television and receiving invitations and several awards from Russian universities and institutions.
For two weeks in the fall of 1990, Kuttler served as honorary rector of Leningrad State University (formerly Saint Petersburg State University) as part of an exchange that brought that university’s rector, Stanislav P. Merkuriev to St. Petersburg College, where Merkuriev was named honorary president. In May and June 1993, Kuttler was sent to Russia by the United States Information Agency to be the technical advisor for the creation of a national community college system. After that he was named "Father of the Russian Community College System".
Kuttler welcomed a total of 300 Russian leaders to the United States during his presidency, including heads of automobile manufacturing companies and airlines, journalists, state Duma officials, and judges. He met with President Putin and Russian ambassador Yuri Ushakov during Putin's visit to Washington, D.C. in October 2001; one result of that visit was Kuttler's establishment of a scholarship fund named after Putin and Ushakov to benefit Russian students in the United States. In April 2003 Kuttler was invited by Putin to attend an international law panel in St. Petersburg, Russia together with 25 world leaders, including French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. In June 2004, he was named Honorary Consul of the Russian Federation to the State of Florida upon the recommendation of Russia's Prime Minister and the Russian ambassador to the U.S.; the appointment was approved by the United States State Department.[tpl]cite web |url=http://it.spcollege.edu/news/show_news.cfm?ID=388 |title=President Kuttler gets Russian medals (news release)|publisher=St. Petersburg College |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl]
