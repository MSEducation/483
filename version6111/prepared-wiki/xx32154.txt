Glastonbury Festival (originally Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival; current formal title Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts) is a five day music festival that takes place near Pilton, Somerset, England. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts. It is organised by Michael Eavis on his own land, Worthy Farm in Pilton. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people http://www.cnbc.com/id/42150834/page/6 requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.
The first festival was in 1970; influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement the festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area which includes the Green Futures and Healing Field. After the 1970s the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gate-crashers. Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music; fourteen people invested everything they had to build the stage. 

==History==

A series of concerts, lectures and recitals called the Glastonbury Festivals were established with a summer school in the town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878–1960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience by the standards of the time. They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.[tpl]cite book|last=Rose|first=Martial|title=Forever Juliet: The Life and Letters of Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies 1891–1992|year=2003|publisher=Larks Press|location=Dereham, Morfolk|isbn=978-1-904006-12-1|pages=23–43[/tpl]

===1970s===

Glastonbury was heavily influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.[tpl]cite news | last=Smith | first=David |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1509746,00.html | title= A Far-out Man | date=19 June 2005 |work=The Observer |location=UK | accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field.
The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T.Rex. Tickets were £1. Other billed acts of note were Quintessence, Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, and Al Stewart.[tpl]cite news |title=Glastonbury 1970 Pilton pop, blues and folk festival |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/archive/1970/ |newspaper=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=14 January 2012[/tpl]
The Glastonbury Fayre of 1971 was instigated by Andrew Kerr after being found and introduced to Michael Eavis by David Trippas and organised with help from Arabella Churchill, Thomas Crimble,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nikturner.com/tirnanog/glastonbury2010.html | title=Glastonbury – 40 Years On | publisher=Nik Turner | accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] Bill Harkin,[tpl]cite web|title=Part 1|url=http://www.pyramidstage-glastonburyfestival.co.uk/index.html|publisher=Bill Harkin|accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] Gilberto Gil,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jul/15/gilberto-gil-caetano-veloso-london  | last=Lewis | first=John| title=Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso in London |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date= 15 July 2010 | accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] Mark Irons, and Jytte Klamer. The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the "Pyramid Stage". Conceived by Bill Harkin the stage was a one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a blind spring which was found by dowsing.[ref]

Performers included David Bowie, Traffic, Fairport Convention, Quintessence, Hawkwind, Skin Alley, The Worthy Farm Windfuckers and Melanie. It was paid for by its supporters and advocates of its ideal, and embraced a mediaeval tradition of music, dance, poetry, theatre, lights and spontaneous entertainment. The 1971 festival was filmed by Nicolas Roeg and David Puttnam and was released as a film called simply Glastonbury Fayre.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Fayre|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810001/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]
The Stonehenge Free Festivals at the summer solstice in June over subsequent years were attracting nationwide interest, and the event became an important precursor of the later Glastonbury Festivals. 
There was a small unplanned event in 1978, when the convoy of vehicles from the Stonehenge festival was directed by police to Worthy Farm; the festival was then revived the following year (1979) by Churchill, Crimble, Kerr and Eavis, in an event for the Year of the Child, which lost money.

===1980s===

The 1980s saw the festival become an annual fixture, barring periodic fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis took control of the festival for the first time, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a permanent structure which doubled as a hay-barn and cow-shed during the winter.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury CND Festival. 19–21 June 1981|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/glastonbury-festival-1981.html|publisher=eFestivals|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]
In the 1980s, the children's area of the festival (which had been organised by Arabella Churchill and others) became the starting point for a new children's charity called Children's World.[tpl]cite web|title=Arabella R.I.P.|url=http://www.childrensworldcharity.org/arabella_rip.php|publisher=Children's World|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] 1981 was the first year that the festival made profits, and Eavis donated £20,000 of them to CND.[tpl]cite web|last=Paterson|first=Thomas|title=Glastonbury Festival: Charting a history of inflation|url=http://www.goldmadesimplenews.com/gold/glastonbury-festival-charting-a-history-of-inflation-4379/|publisher=Gold News | date=24 June 2011|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Far-out man.

Since 1983, large festivals have required licences from local authorities. This led to certain restrictions being placed on the festival, including a crowd limit and specified times during which the stages could operate. The crowd limit was initially set at 30,000 but has grown every year to over 100,000.[tpl]cite web|title=1980–1989|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/glastonbury-festival/biography/1981-2013-1989|work=Glastonbury Festival|publisher=Icons of England|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]
1984 saw the stage invaded by children during The Smiths set.[tpl]cite web|title=Smiths Glasto controversy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20090622_marr.shtml|work=6 Music|publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury CND Festival 22–24 June 1984|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/glastonbury-festival-1984.html|publisher=eFestivals|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  Weather Report played the main stage, and Elvis Costello headlined the last night for almost three hours.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Festival Timeline|url=http://negativentropy.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/glastonbury-festival-timeline/|publisher=Negativenetropy|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]
In 1985, the festival grew too large for Worthy Farm, but neighbouring Cockmill Farm was purchased.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury 1985|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/archive/1985/?page=18|publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  That year saw a wet festival with considerable rain; Worthy Farm is a dairy farm and what washed down into the low areas was a mixture of mud and liquefied cow dung. This did not prevent festival-goers from enjoying the knee-deep slurry in front of the pyramid stage.
1989, the first year that impromptu unofficial sound systems sprung up around the festival site, a portend of things to come, these sound systems, with their electronic acid house music blasting out round the clock. With the largest, the Hypnosis sound system rivaling the volume of some of the official stages and ran non stop throughout the festival. These systems were seen by some as a refreshing wind of change that would rejuvenate a tired subculture and by others as a blessed nuisance.

===1990s===

The biggest festival yet was held in 1990; however, violence the day after the festival ended between the security guards and new age travellers – the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge — led to the organisers taking 1991 off to rethink the festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/HISTORY/overview.html|title=A brief history|publisher=Glastonbury festival|accessdate=8 August 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080630095849/http://archive.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/HISTORY/overview.html |archivedate = 30 June 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/glastonbury-festival-1990.html|title=Glastonbury Festival for Contemporary Performing Arts |publisher=UK Rock Festivals|accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was another hot, dry year. 
In 1994, the Pyramid Stage burned down just over a week before the festival; a temporary main stage was erected in time for the festival.[tpl]cite news|title=The Glastonbury years|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3808581.stm|publisher=BBC   | date=15 June 2004|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  The 1994 festival also introduced a 150 kW wind turbine which provided some of the festival power.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury 1994|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/archive/1994/|work=Glastonbury Archive|publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] This festival also included the setting of a new world record on 26 June when 826 people, juggling at least three objects each, kept 2,478 objects in the air.[tpl]cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Records 1997|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd|year=1996|page=82|isbn=0-85112-694-4[/tpl] This was also the year the festival was first televised by Channel 4; concentrating on the main two music stages, providing a glimpse of the festival for those who knew little of it. Channel 4 televised the festival the following year as well, which proved to be very successful. 
The enhanced TV coverage in 1994 was a crucial factor in ensuring that Orbital's performance at the festival achieved legendary status. As a result of Channel 4's coverage, living rooms across the country were able to experience what a rave might look like, and suddenly dance music - which had been attacked by the establishment and mainstream press for years - didn't seem so dangerous.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/16/chime-orbital-acid-house-dance-music |title=Mistletoe and Chime: the story of Orbital's acid house |date=16 December 2013|author=Stuart Aitken|work=guardian.co.uk [/tpl] Indeed 1994 was a crucial turning point for dance music's role at the festival. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the Orbital gig, Michael Eavis noted that it marked dance music's appearance on the mainstream agenda. "What was previously underground made it on to one of the big stages, and there was no going back from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers' fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal." [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/16/chime-orbital-acid-house-dance-music |title=Mistletoe and Chime: the story of Orbital's acid house |date=16 December 2013|author=Stuart Aitken|work=guardian.co.uk [/tpl] The gig opened the way for others such as the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack and Underworld, who all played high-profile stages in the following years – developments that led to the launch of the festival's Dance Village in 1997.
1995 saw the attendance rise drastically due to the security fence being breached on the Friday of the festival. Estimates suggest there may have been enough fence-jumpers to double the size of the festival.[tpl]cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Glastonbury 2010: disasters and mishaps at Worthy Farm|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/glastonbury/7822186/Glastonbury-2010-disasters-and-mishaps-at-Worthy-Farm.html|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 June 2010|location=London[/tpl] This aside, 1995 proved to be a highly successful year with memorable performances from Oasis, Elastica, Pulp, PJ Harvey, Jeff Buckley, Jamiroquai and The Cure. This was also the first year of the festival having a dance tent to cater for the rise in popularity of dance music, following the success of Orbital's headline appearance the previous year. The dance acts of 1995 were led by Massive Attack on the Friday and Carl Cox on the Saturday.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts '95|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/glastonbury/1995/|publisher=eFestivals|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] The festival took a year off in 1996 to allow the land to recover and give the organisers a break. This would be a pattern which would be followed every five years until 2011, with the gap year moving to 2012. 1996 also saw the release of Glastonbury the Movie which was filmed at the 1993 and 1994 festivals.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury The Movie|url=http://www.glastonburythemovie.com/|publisher=Glastonbury The Movie|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]
The festival returned in 1997 bigger than ever. This time there was major sponsorship from The Guardian and the BBC, who had taken over televising the event from Channel 4. This was also the year of the mud,[tpl]cite news |publisher=BBC  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3808581.stm | title= The Glastonbury Years| accessdate=27 June 2011 | date=15 June 2004[/tpl] with the site suffering severe rainfalls which turned the entire site into a muddy bog.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts '97|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/glastonbury/1997/|publisher=eFestivals|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] However those who stayed for the festival were treated to many memorable performances, including Radiohead's headlining Pyramid Stage set on the Saturday which is said to be one of the greatest ever Glastonbury performances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2007/06/radiohead-live-at-glastonbury-1997-download/|title=Radiohead live at Glastonbury 1997|publisher=The line of best fit|accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] The live recording of Paranoid Android from this performance, as well as others such as The Day Before Yesterday's Man by The Supernaturals, were released on a BBC CD entitled Mud For It.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Glastonbury-Live-97-Mud-Various/dp/B00000B6L2
In 1998 the festival was once again struck with severe floods and storms, again some festival goers departed early but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur.[tpl]cite web|title=1990–1999|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/glastonbury-festival/biography/1990-1999|work=Glastonbury Festival|publisher=Icons a portrait of England|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  Tony Bennett, however, overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white suit and tie.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/1998/ | title=History – 1998 | publisher=Glastonbury Festival | accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl] 1998 was also the first year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.
Another hot dry year was recorded in 1999, much to the relief of organisers and festival goers. The festival was again overcrowded due to fence-jumpers but this would not be a major problem until the following year; when additional 100,000 people gatecrashed the site increasing the attendance to an estimated 250,000 people. The 1999 festival is also remembered for the Manic Street Preachers requesting and being given their own backstage toilets, however it was revealed by the band that this was a joke; the "reserved" sign on the toilet was not at the authorisation of the management.[tpl]cite news|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|title=Red rockers wage battle of Portaloo|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/jul/24/fiachragibbons|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 July 1999|location=London[/tpl]

===2000s===

2000 saw a new Pyramid Stage introduced as well as new features such as The Glade and The Leftfield. The festival was headlined by Pet Shop Boys and David Bowie playing 30 years after his first appearance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/glastonbury/2000/ |title=Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts '00 |date=27 January 2003 |publisher=Efestivals |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] The Pyramid Stage also hosted an unusual event on the Saturday morning, with the wedding of two festival-goers, who had written to the organisers asking for permission to get married there, taking place and conducted by actor Keith Allen in front of a small group of friends and any other festival-goers who still happened to be awake.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~virtuous/planetgrrlmusic/wedding.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100410200122/http://www.btinternet.com/~virtuous/planetgrrlmusic/wedding.htm|archivedate=10 April 2010|title=A Glastonbury Wedding |date=14 September 2003 |publisher=Girls in Rock |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] This year also saw an estimated 250,000 people attend the festival (only 100,000 tickets were sold) due to gatecrashers. This led to public safety concerns and the local District Council refused any further licences until the problem was solved.[tpl]cite web|title=Do not under-estimate the council's work|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/NewsArticleM.asp?id=SX9452-A78328D1|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  The organisers took 2001 off to devise anti-gatecrashing measures and secure the future of the festival, after the Roskilde Festival 2000 accident (though this was also a scheduled break, one which took place every five years from 1991, the year after the battle of Yeoman's Bridge, until the 2012 Olympics extended the five-year sequence from the planned 2011 rest year). It was at this point that the Mean Fiddler Organisation was invited to help,[tpl]cite news|last=Barton|first=Laura|title=The Guardian profile: Vince Power|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/oct/08/popandrock|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 October 2004|location=London[/tpl] which was seen by some as a "sell-out" to corporate culture.[tpl]cite web|last=Michaels|first=Lucy|title=Has Glastonbury Sold Out?|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/uknow/features/?id=36|publisher=Head Heritage | date=18 June 2002|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury — Corporate takeover|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2002/06/33350.html|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl]
In 2002, the festival returned after a hiatus, with the controversial Mean Fiddler now handling the logistics and security — especially installing a substantial surrounding fence (dubbed the "superfence") that reduced numbers to the levels of a decade earlier. The lower attendance led to a much more relaxed atmosphere and massively reduced crime levels compared to previous years. There were some incidents outside the fence involving frustrated individuals who arrived at the festival assuming they would be able to simply jump the fence and not pay for the music and performances, but despite this the event was hailed as a great success by the media companies that had taken an interest in the festival.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/jul/01/glastonbury2002.glastonbury2003|title=Extravaganza is given a mellow makeover|last=Allison|first=Rebecca|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 August 2008  | date=22 May 2003[/tpl] 2002 also saw Coldplay headline the Pyramid Stage for the first time while the show was closed by a set from Rod Stewart on the Sunday night.[tpl]cite news|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|title=Glastonbury 2002|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2002/jul/01/glastonbury2002.glastonbury|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2002|location=London[/tpl]
There were some criticisms of the 2002 festival that it lacked atmosphere, because of the reduced number of people, which reflected the smaller numbers jumping the fence.[tpl]cite web|title=Radiohead – Talk Show Host Glastonbury 2003|url=http://www.fattune.com/festivals/glastonbury/radiohead-talk-show-host-glastonbury-2003/|publisher=Fattune|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl] The number of tickets was increased to 150,000 for 2003 which sold out within one day of going on sale, in marked contrast to the two months it took to sell 140,000 in 2002. It was also the first year that tickets sold out before the full line-up was announced.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury sold out! in just 24 hours!!! | date=1 April 2003|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/news/03/030401a.shtml|publisher=eFestivals|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl]  This was also the year Radiohead returned to headline the Pyramid Stage.

Franz Ferdinand and Sir Paul McCartney also performed. In the British press publications appeared about the use of psychedelic drugs by festival visitors. The magazine NME pronounced that 2004 would be "the third summer of love" due to the resurgence of the "shroom" that was praised as a natural alternative to ecstasy, which was said to be declining in popularity (LSD fuelled the first summer of love in 1967; ecstasy and LSD the second in 1988).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/glastonburys-third-summer-of-love-fuelled-by-magic-shrooms-733709.html |title=Glastonbury's 'third summer of love' fuelled by magic 'shrooms |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=27 June 2004 |accessdate=27 June 2011 [/tpl]
After the 2004 festival, Michael Eavis commented that 2006 would be a year off — in keeping with the previous history of taking one "fallow year" in every five to give the villagers and surrounding areas a rest from the yearly disruption. This was confirmed after the licence for 2005 was granted.[tpl]cite news|title=Glastonbury to take break in 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4182773.stm|publisher=BBC  | date=18 January 2005|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]

There was no festival in 2006. Instead, a documentary film directed by Julien Temple was released to make up for the lack of a festival. The film consists of specially shot footage by Temple at the festival, as well as footage sent in by fans and archive footage.

Glastonbury 2007 (20–24 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey was also featured.

Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new "Introducing" stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since the construction of the security fence, and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at £145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6511115.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2011 | title=Glastonbury tickets snapped up[/tpl]  As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket.[tpl]cite web |publisher=BBC  | year= 2007 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2007/01/09/glastonbury_festival_2007_licence_feature.shtml | title=Glasto Until 2010 | accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new £750,000 flood defences.[tpl]cite news | title=Rain fails to dampen Eavis spirit |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=24 June 2007 | url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/glastonbury2007/story/0,,2110365,00.html | accessdate=28 June 2011[/tpl] However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points, such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads on the periphery of the site led to delays for people leaving the site.[tpl]cite news |publisher=BBC  | accessdate=28 June 2011 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6238634.stm | title=Glasto revellers held up in rain | date=25 June 2007[/tpl] On 25 June, when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival, cars in the western car parks took over nine hours to exit the site. There was no stewarding provision in these areas, no information was disseminated regarding the delays, no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers, and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles. Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers.

On 20 December 2007, Arabella Churchill, an instrumental figure in the conception of the 1971 festival and since the 1980s area coordinator of the Theatre Field, died at St Edmund's Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury at the age of 58. She had suffered a short illness due to pancreatic cancer, for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was a convert to Buddhism, and arrangements following her death respected her belief. Michael Eavis, paying tribute to her after her death, said "Her vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a place in our festival history second to none".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3084227.ece |title=Arabella Churchill |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Times Online  | location=London | date=22 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Arabella Churchill |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/22/db2202.xml |publisher=The Telegraph |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/australia/story/0,,2230914,00.html | title=Granddaughter of Churchill dies as Australia jails her son |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=21 December 2007 | last=McMahon | first=Barbara | accessdate=28 June 2011[/tpl]

==Organisation==

Since 1981, the festival has been organised by local farmer and site owner Michael Eavis (through his company Glastonbury Festivals Ltd). Eavis ran the festival with his wife Jean until her death in 1999, and is now assisted by his daughter Emily Eavis. Since 2002, Festival Republic (a company consisting of both Live Nation and MCD) has taken on the job of managing the logistics and security of the festival through a 40% stake in the festival management company.[tpl]cite web|title=Festival Republic|url=http://nsa-ccskills.co.uk/node/610|publisher=National Skills Academy|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  Each year a company, joint owned by Glastonbury Festivals Ltd and Festival Republic, is created to run the festival, with profits going to the parent companies. Glastonbury Festivals Ltd donates most of their profits to charities, including donations to local charity and community groups and paying for the purchase and restoration of the Tithe Barn in Pilton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/glastonbury2003/04/tithe_barn.shtml|title=Michael Eavis talks|work=BBC Somerset|publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl]
Several stages and areas are managed independently, such as The Left Field which is managed by a cooperative owned by Battersea and Wandsworth TUC,[tpl]cite web|title=Politics Returns to Prime Spot|url=http://www.glastoearth.com/news/2011/politics-returns-to-prime-spot|publisher=Glastoearth|accessdate=29 June 2011 | date=22 February 2011[/tpl] Worthy FM and a field run by Greenpeace.[tpl]cite web|title=Greenpeace|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/worthy-causes/greenpeace/|publisher=Glastonbury Festival|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] The sound systems on site have a total power of 650,000 watts, with the main stage having 250 speakers. There are over 4,000 toilets, with water supplies including two reservoirs holding [tpl]convert|2000000|l|impgal[/tpl] of water.
With the exception of technical and security staff, the festival is mainly run by volunteers. Some 2000 stewards are organised by the aid charity Oxfam. In return for their work at the festival Oxfam receive a donation, which in 2005 was £200,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury stars go blue for Oxfam|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/2009/06/22/glastonbury-stars-go-blue-for-oxfam/|publisher=Oxfam|accessdate=29 June 2011 | date=22 June 2009[/tpl]  Medical facilities are provided by The Festival Medical Services who have done so since 1979. The bars are organised by the Workers Beer Company, sponsored by Carlsberg (previously Budweiser), who recruit teams of volunteer staff from small charities and campaign groups. In return for their help, typically around 18 hours over the festival, volunteers are paid in free entry, transport and food, while their charities receive the wages the volunteers earn over the event.
Catering, and some retail services, are provided by various small companies, typically mobile catering vans, with over 400 food stalls on site in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 10 facts about the Council's Work at Glastonbury|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Download.asp?path=%2FDocuments%2FGlastofacts%2Edoc|publisher=Mendip District Council | date=21 June 2010|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl]  The camping retail chain Millets, and independent shops, set up makeshift outlets at the festival. Additionally charities and organisations run promotional or educational stalls, such as the Hare Krishna tent which provide free vegetarian food. Network Recycling manage refuse on the site, and in 2004 recycled 300 tonnes and composted 110 tonnes of waste from the site.[tpl]cite web|title=Growing Heap Autumn 2004|url=http://www.communitycompost.org/growingheap/2004%20Autum.pdf | format=PDF|publisher=Community Compost|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] 
Significant logistical operations take place to bring people into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington.[tpl]cite web|title=Rail Travel to and from Glastonbury Festival|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/service_disruptions/seasonal/Glastonbury/Glasto_2011.html|publisher=National Rail Enquiries|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Festival|url=http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach_ims/NXC7958GlastonburyTimetableLeafletV4.pdf|publisher=National Express | format=PDF|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]

==Location==

The festival takes place in south west England at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle in Somerset, six miles east of Glastonbury, overlooked by the Glastonbury Tor in the "Vale of Avalon".[tpl]cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|title=Somerset: The complete guide  | year=1994|publisher=Dovecote Press |isbn=978-1-874336-26-6|pages=104–108[/tpl] The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions, and is a "New Age" site of interest: ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor.[tpl]cite web | last=Jenkins | first=Palden | year= 2005 | url=http://www.palden.co.uk/leymap/mapallmap.html | title=The Ancient Landscape around Glastonbury | accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl]  The nearest town to the festival site is Shepton Mallet, three miles (5 km) north east, but there continues to be interaction between the people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival. The farm is situated between the A361 and A37 roads.

Worthy Farm is situated at [tpl]gbmapping|ST 590 397[/tpl] in a valley at the head of the Whitelake River, between two low limestone ridges, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. On the site is a confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River. In the past the site has experienced problems with flooding, though after the floods that occurred during the 1997 and 1998 festival, drainage was improved. This did not prevent flooding during the 2005 festival, but allowed the flood water to dissipate within hours.[tpl]cite news|title=Glastonbury founder rues flooding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4624053.stm|publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 June 2011|date=26 June 2005[/tpl]  The Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran through the farm on an embankment, but was dismantled in 1966 and now forms a main thoroughfare across the site.[tpl]cite web|title=Photographic Route Map|url=http://www.somersetanddorsetrailway.co.uk/the-railway/|publisher=Somerset & Dorset Railway Trust|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]  Another prominent feature is the high-voltage electricity line which crosses the site east-west.
In recent years the site has been organised around a restricted backstage compound, with the Pyramid stage on the north, and Other stage on the south of the compound. Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent, comedy tent and circus. To the south are the green fields, which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King's Meadow, the hill at the far south of the site, is a small megalith circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated with the summer solstice, and since 1990 represents a Stone circle.[tpl]cite web|title=King's Meadow (Stone Circle)|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/Areas/the-green-fields/kings-meadow-stone-circle|publisher=Glastonbury Festival|accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]

==Lineups==

==Accommodation==

Most people who stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are many different camping areas, each with its own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are availabile for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/tipis|title=Tipis |publisher=Glastonbury Festival |accessdate=31 October 2012[/tpl]
Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are not allowed into the main festival site. However the purchase of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/campervans-and-caravans|title=Campervans and Caravans |publisher=Glastonbury Festival |accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6236306.stm |title= Doing the dirty work at Glastonbury Hire|publisher=BBC  |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |first=Ian |last=Youngs[/tpl] The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/glastonbury/info-campervans.shtml |title= Campervans and Caravans GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL INFORMATION|publisher=eFestivals  |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012 |first= |last=[/tpl]
Festival-goers can stay at local B&B accommodation but most are not within walking distance of the festival. There are several independent Glastonbury accommodation providers close to the main site, which include smaller campsites for tents, gypsy caravans, geo-domes, private cottages and more - some festival goers choose to be ferried between the festival and their accommodation by quad-bike or even private helicopter.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.flyglastonbury.com/festival-accommodation/ |title= Helicopter transport GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL INFORMATION|publisher=FlyGlastonbury  |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012 |first= |last=[/tpl]
