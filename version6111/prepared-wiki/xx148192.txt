CATEGORIES: Trilobozoa, Cambrian life

Trilobozoa ("three-lobed animals") is an extinct taxon of organisms which displayed tri-radial symmetry. Trilobozoans were most dominant during the Ediacaran period — prior to the Cambrian explosion of modern life forms.
The taxonomic affinities of this groups are open to debate. Ivantsov and Fedonkin (2002) place them among the cnidarians. They reasoned that since the conulate Vendoconularia exhibited six-fold symmetry, the conularids — then regarded as a sister group  to the scyphozoan cnidarians — must be nested within the trilobozoa, making the trilobozoan group part of the cnidarian phylum.
The most primitive trilobozoans were disk-shaped, typified by Tribrachidium.  Through comparisons with the other discoidal trilobozoans, it appears the different "arm" patterns on each genus/species occurred due to growth arresting or progressing at different stages of developmental growth.
The more advanced, and much longer-lasting, trilobozoans were cone-shaped, as typified by the long-lived genus Conularia, and had shell-like structures that resemble angular ice-cream cones, which tended to have four corners.  However, the lack of septa or other features diagnostic of anthozoans lead researchers to disregard the conularids as being anthozoans.  Ivantsov and Fedonkin posit that the conularids were ancestrally tri-radially symmetrical, as typified with Vendoconularia.  Conularids are not generally thought to be a part of the Ediacaran biota, if only because of their fossil record, which began a little before the Cambrian period, and ended during the Lower Triassic.  It is now also thought that the conulate trilobozoans derived their four-fold symmetry from a six-fold symmetry, as seen in Vendoconularia, which, in turn, was originally derived from the ancestral disk-like trilobozoans' three-fold symmetry.

==Taxonomy==

The various members of Trilobozoa are organized into (monotypic) genera, and some are grouped into families.

===Family Albumaresidae Fedonkin, 1985===

===Family Tribrachididae Runnegar, 1992===

===Trilobozoa incertae sedis===

The following genera are triradially symmetric edicarans that have not yet been classified into either Albumaresidae or Tribrachididae, nor a new family.
