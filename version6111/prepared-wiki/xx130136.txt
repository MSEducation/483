Donkey rides are a traditional feature of seaside resorts in England. Children are allowed to ride donkeys on a sandy beach for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically the donkeys used have their names on their harnesses so they could be identified by children and parents alike.
In Bridlington donkey rides have been available since 1895.
The tradition started in Victorian times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.
