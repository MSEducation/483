==Career==

In 1839 Clarke exhibited an antiquarian drawing with the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture.[tpl]cite journal |year=1839 |title= |journal=Proceedings |publisher=Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture |volume= |issue= |page=23 |url= |accessdate= [/tpl] He was made an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1841 and a Fellow of the RIBA in 1850. He became a member of the Ecclesiological Society in 1853.[tpl]cite journal |journal=The Ecclesiologist |year=1854 |page=44 |volume=15 |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mo4QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44&dq |title=Ecclesiological Late Cambridge Camden Society[/tpl] He served as Diocesan Surveyor to the sees of Canterbury and Rochester, and from 1871 to the see of St Albans. He was also Consultant Architect to the Charity Commissioners.
In 1852 Clarke published Schools and Schoolhouses: a series of Views, Plans, and Details, for Rural Parishes. In this he condemned the set of model plans issued by the  Committee of Council on Education as "unsuitable in every way" and stressed the advantages of employing an architect for any new school, rather than relying on a standardised design: The plan should always be formed to the site, and reference had to local materials; the design of the school, again, should conform to the materials. Brick and stone each require their separate uses, and so their several applications.[tpl]cite journal |date=June 1852 |title=School Architecture |journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal |volume=15 |issue= |page=161 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=YgoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA161&dq |accessdate=5 November 2009[/tpl]  The book included plans of twelve schools he had built in Kent, Essex and Oxfordshire, at Monks Horton, Lydd, Little Bentley, Coggeshall, Clifton Hampton, Coopershall, Wellesborough, Brabourne, Boreham, Foxearth, Hatfield and Leigh (Essex).[tpl]cite journal |journal=The Ecclesiologist |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d6VDAQAAIAAJ&pg |title=Reviews |page=199 |year=1852 |volume=13[/tpl]
He drew up ambitious plans for an extension to the House of Charity in Greek Street Soho, including a chapel, refectory, dormitories and cloisters. Only the chapel (begun 1862) was actually built.[tpl]harvnb|Sheppard|1966|p=[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
His association with commissions in Oxfordshire make it possible that he was the "Joseph Clarke, esq., architect" who presented plans for restoring the gatehouse at Rye, the intended scene of the Rye House Plot, to the Oxford Architectural Society in May 1842.Noted in [tpl]cite journal |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=July 1842 |title=Architecture |journal=The Gentleman's Magazine |volume= |issue= |pages=78 |url= |accessdate=5 November 2009[/tpl]
Clarke exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1845 and 1870. The exhibition catalogues give his address as 1, Lincoln's Inn Fields, from 1845 to 1850; and 13, Stratford Place, thereafter.[tpl]sfn|Graves|1905|p=70[/tpl]
