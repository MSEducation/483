Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani Park and Gardens is a [tpl]convert|30|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] park with Japanese gardens, located on Banyan Drive in Hilo on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.
The park's site was given by Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, and lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens, built in the early 1900s, and said to be the largest such gardens outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, koi ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.downtownhilo.com/Places/LiliuokalaniParkandGardens/tabid/419/Default.aspx |title=Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani Park and Gardens |publisher=downtown Hilo Association web site |accessdate=2013-03-02 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091217161744/http://www.downtownhilo.com/Places/LiliuokalaniParkandGardens/tabid/419/Default.aspx#dnn_ctr911_dnnTITLE_lblTitle |archivedate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Close to this park is the small island called Moku ola, (also known as Coconut Island), connected to the park by a footbridge. It is a good place for a picnic, and some limited swimming. The name Moku ola literally means "island of life" in the Hawaiian language, since it was site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ulukau.org/cgi-bin/hpn?e=q-0mahele--00-0-0--010---4----dtt--0-0l--1en-Zz-1---20-about-mokuola--00031-00010escapewin-00&a=d&c=mahele&cl=search&d=HASH01f6f34fd282d21d593797fb |title=lookup of mokuola |accessdate=2009-10-12 |work=Hawaiian Place Names web site |publisher=University of Hawaii |author=Lloyd J.

There is a stone tower on the east side of the island which is the remnant of the old footbridge which was destroyed by a tsunami.
From Coconut Island one has a great view of Hilo Bayfront, Downtown Hilo, and the rest of Hilo Bay.  To the east, you can see the massive breakwater protecting Hilo Bay.
