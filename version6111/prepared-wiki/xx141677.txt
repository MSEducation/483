CATEGORIES: Motorways in Bulgaria

The Lyulin motorway ([tpl]Lang-bg|Автомагистрала „Люлин“, Avtomagistrala "Lyulin"[/tpl]) is a motorway, which provides a link between the Sofia ringroad and the junction of Daskalovo near Pernik. Its construction began in 2007 and was scheduled to be finished in 38 months. Its length is around 19 km and it cost €185 000 000, because it runs through mountainous terrain and needed many tunnels and viaducts in order to avoid ecological, environmental and terrain issues.[tpl]cite web|title=Lyulin motorway from Pernik to Sofia to be launched on March 15|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n239930|publisher=Focus-fen.net|accessdate=21 January 2011[/tpl] The Lyulin motorway was launched on 15 May 2011 and became thus the first fully operating motorway in the country.[tpl]cite web|title=Lyulin motorway officially opened|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n249687|publisher=Focus-fen.net|accessdate=15 May 2011[/tpl]
