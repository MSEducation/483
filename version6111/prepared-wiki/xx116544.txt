CATEGORIES: History of Ukraine, Political organizations, Exile organizations

Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR) was a Ukrainian political organisation formed in July 1944.
UHVR united Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). After the end of the Second World War, the council co-ordinated resistance efforts in Soviet-occupied Ukraine. It also organised the boycott of the Soviet-sponsored elections in 1946. Members of UHVR in exile formed External Representation group of the council (ZP UHVR), which popularised the efforts of the Ukrainian dissident movement in the West.
