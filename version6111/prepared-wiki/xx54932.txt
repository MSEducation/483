The Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich ([tpl]lang-de|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München[/tpl]), commonly known as the University of Munich or LMU, is a university in Munich, Germany. It is publicly owned, also covers a research institute and is among Germany's oldest universities.
Originally established in Ingolstadt in 1472 by Duke Ludwig IX of Bavaria-Landshut, the university was moved in 1800 to Landshut by King Maximilian I of Bavaria when Ingolstadt was threatened by the French, before being relocated to its present-day location in Munich in 1826 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1802, the university was officially named Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität by King Maximilian I of Bavaria in his as well as the university's original founder's honour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_die_lmu/profil/geschichte/landshut/index.html |title=Landshut (1800 - 1826) - LMU München |publisher=Uni-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl]
The University of Munich has, particularly since the 19th century, been considered as one of Germany's as well as one of Europe's most prestigious universities; with 34 Nobel laureates associated with the university, it ranks 13th worldwide by number of Nobel laureates. Among these were Wilhelm Röntgen, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn and Thomas Mann. Pope Benedict XVI was also a student and professor at the university. The LMU has recently been conferred the title of "elite university" under the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
The LMU is currently the second-largest university in Germany in terms of student population; in the winter semester of 2009/2010, the university had a total of 45,539 matriculated students. Of these, 7,801 were freshmen while international students totalled 6,743 or almost 15% of the student population. As for operating budget, the university records in 2008 a total of 458.8 million Euros in funding without the university hospital; with the university hospital, the university has a total funding amounting to approximately 1 billion Euros.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_die_lmu/zahlen_fakten/index.html |title=Zahlen und Fakten - LMU München |publisher=Uni-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl]

==History==

The university was founded with papal approval in 1472 as the University of Ingolstadt (foundation right of Louis IX the Rich), with faculties of philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence and theology. Its first rector was Christopher Mendel of Steinfels, who later became bishop of Chiemsee.
In the period of German humanism, the university's academics included names such as Conrad Celtes and Petrus Apianus. The theologian Johann Eck also taught at the university. From 1549 to 1773, the university was influenced by the Jesuits and became one of the centres of the Counter-Reformation. The Jesuit Petrus Canisius served as rector of the university.
At the end of the 18th century, the university was influenced by the Enlightenment, which led to a stronger emphasis on natural science.
In 1800, the Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph (the later Maximilian I, King of Bavaria) moved the university to Landshut, due to French aggression that threatened Ingolstadt during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1802, the university was renamed the Ludwig Maximilian University in honour of its two founders, Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria and Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. The Minister of Education, Maximilian von Montgelas, initiated a number of reforms that sought to modernize the rather conservative and Jesuit-influenced university. In 1826, it was moved to Munich, the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The university was situated in the Old Academy until a new building in the Ludwigstraße was completed.
In the second half of the 19th century, the university rose to great prominence in the European scientific community, attracting many of the world's leading scientists. It was also a period of great expansion. From 1903, women were allowed to study at Bavarian universities, and by 1918, the female proportion of students at LMU had reached 18%. In 1918, Adele Hartmann became the first woman in Germany to earn the Habilitation (higher doctorate), at LMU.
During the Weimar Republic, the university continued to be one of the world's leading universities, with professors such as Wilhelm Röntgen, Wilhelm Wien, Richard Willstätter, Arnold Sommerfeld and Ferdinand Sauerbruch.

===Nazi period===

During the period of national socialist rule, academic freedom was severely curtailed. In 1943 the White Rose group of anti-Nazi students conducted their campaign of opposition to the national socialists at this university.

===1945 -===

The university has continued to be one the leading universities of West Germany during the Cold War and in the post-reunification era. In the late 1960s, the university was the scene of protests by radical students.
Today the University of Munich is part of 24 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 13 of them. It also hosts 12 DFG Research Training Groups and three international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria. It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives.
LMU Munich has a wide range of degree programs, with 150 subjects available in numerous combinations. 15% of the 45,000 students who attend the university come from abroad.
In 2005, Germany’s state and federal governments launched the Excellence Initiative, a contest among its universities. With a total of 1.9 billion euros, 75 percent of which comes from the federal state, its architects aim to strategically promote top-level research and scholarship. The money is given to more than 30 research universities in Germany.
The initiative will fund three project-oriented areas: graduate schools to promote the next generation of scholars, clusters of excellence to promote cutting-edge research and “future concepts” for the project-based expansion of academic excellence at universities as a whole. In order to qualify for this third area, a university had to have at least one internationally recognized academic center of excellence and a new graduate school.
After the first round of selections, LMU Munich was invited to submit applications for all three funding lines: It entered the competition with proposals for two graduate schools and four clusters of excellence.
On Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education. The panel, composed of the German Research Foundation and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one graduate school, three “excellence clusters” and general funding for the university’s “future concept”.

==University buildings==

LMU's institutes and research centers are spread throughout Munich, with several buildings located in the suburbs of Oberschleissheim and Garching as well as Maisach and Bad Tölz. The university's main buildings are grouped around Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and Professor-Huber-Platz on Ludwigstrasse, extending into side streets such as Akademiestraße, Schellingstraße, and Veterinärstraße.

===Fees===

====Tuition fees====

After the German Constitutional Court overturned a federal law prohibiting tuition fees and devolved the right to administrate tuition fees to the state level, the university's Senate decided upon the introduction of tuition fees in the Summer Semester of 2006. Tuition fees were initially capped at €300 in the Summer Semester of 2007 and Winter Semester of 2007/2008, but were reviewed in the Winter Semester of 2008/2009 to introduce a €42 Grundbeitrag or basic contribution fee to the state-run Studentenwerk as well as a €50 administrative fee (Verwaltungsgebühr); the Verwaltungsgebühr was however subsequently abolished by the Bavarian state government.
The total tuition fees administered by the university amounted to 542€. After a popular petition, however, tuition fees in the federal state of Bavaria have been abolished. Together with the new semester ticket basic fee (see following paragraph), every student pays 111€ a semester.

====Semesterticket====

Despite being home to a large student population as well as being one of the most expensive German cities to live in,[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_cities_for_expatriate_employees |title=List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl] Munich until 2013 stood out as being one of the few German cities which did not offer a semester transportation pass (generally known as a Semesterticket) to students. Because of this, students in Munich had to separately apply for the Munich Transport and Tariff Association's (MVV) monthly subscription which came at a significantly higher price as opposed to what a Semesterticket would have costed in other German cities.
In 2009, the MVV offered a package which would introduce a Semesterticket at a basic fee of €78.50 with a premium surchage of €143.50, totalling €222; this proposition narrowly fell through after voting was conducted across all the Munich universities as it was still deemed to be too pricey in comparison to the Semesterickets offered by other German cities, with students of the LMU Munich voting 52.1% against and 47.9% in favour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.semesterticket-muenchen.de/ |title=Semesterticket München |publisher=Semesterticket-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl] In 2012, a reconditioned package with a basic fee of €59 and a total price of €200 was finally accepted by an overwhelming majority of 86,3% of students across all universities. The ticket was introduced in the 2013 winter term.
