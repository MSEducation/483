Rajid Baransi ([tpl]lang-he|רג'יד בראנסי[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ar|راجد برانسي[/tpl]) is an Israeli of Palestinian heritage, or Arab Israeli footballer. A product of the youth system of Maccabi Ahi Nazareth, he was sought after by Hapoel and Maccabi Haifa but his motherclub preferred to sell him to Maccabi. Having trouble finding the net, during a match against Bnei Yehuda, Alon Mizrahi let him take a penalty kick so he could finally score his first goal in a professional match. With the arrival of Dušan Uhrin to the club, Baransi was released as Uhrin signed Maccabi Netanya's Liron Vilner and he promoted Yaniv Katan from the youth team.
