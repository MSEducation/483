The Canadian Poetry Association began as a grass-roots organization dedicated to promoting the reading, writing, publishing and preservation of poetry in Canada through the individual efforts of members; promoting communication among poets, publishers and the general public; encouraging leadership and participation from members and to encourage the formation and development of local chapters. It began in Toronto, Ontario, as a collective on 16 January 1985 with its first Board of Directors: Shaunt Basmajian, James Deahl, Wayne Ray, Beverley Daurio, Chris Faiers, & Ted Plantos http://www.danforthreview.com/features/essays/barker_on_plantos.htm, and after 20 years has reformed its aims and objectives and is headquartered in Moncton, New Brunswick.
The CPA published POEMATA, a quarterly journal for its members and the general public, filled with poetry, articles news and literary contests. The CPA sponsored the Shaunt Basmajian Chapbook Award and several other poetry and chapbook contests open to both members and the general public.
