Bristol Parkway railway station, on the South Wales Main Line, is in the Stoke Gifford area of the Bristol conurbation. It is [tpl]convert|112|miles|km[/tpl] from London Paddington. Its three-letter station code is BPW. The station, opened in 1971, was the first in a new generation of park and ride stations. It is the third-most heavily used station in the West of England, after [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Bath Spa[/tpl]. There are three platforms, and a well-equipped waiting area. The station is managed by First Great Western, who provide most of the trains at the station, with CrossCountry providing the rest.
The line is not electrified, but will be by 2016 as part of the planned modernisation of the Great Western Main Line. A new platform will also be built, allowing increased services from London.

==Description==

Bristol Parkway is located in the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire, in the Stoke Gifford area of the Bristol conurbation. The immediate surrounding area is mostly residential, with farmland to the south east.[tpl]cite book |title=OS Landranger Map 172 – Bristol & Bath |year=2008 |publisher=Ordnance Survey |location=Southampton |isbn=978-0-319-22914-9[/tpl] The main road access is from the west, with the station situated close to the M4, M5 and M32 motorways, the latter being the Bristol "Parkway" from which the station takes its name,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7767000/7767453.stm|title=M32 'like dagger thrust' into city|accessdate=22 September 2013|date=9 December 2008|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl] as well as the A4174 Avon Ring Road. The station is on the South Wales Main Line from London to Swansea, [tpl]convert|111|mi|68|chain|km|2[/tpl] from the eastern terminus at London Paddington.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/stations/stationb.shtm|title=Railway station data, location B|accessdate=22 September 2013|author=Deaves, Phil[/tpl] It is also on the Cross Country Route from [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl] to [tpl]rws|York[/tpl]. Just to the west of the station is Stoke Gifford Junction, where the Henbury Loop Line to Avonmouth Docks and Cross Country Route to Bristol Temple Meads diverge from the line to South Wales.[tpl]cite book|first=S.K.|last=Baker|title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland|edition=12th|year=2010|isbn=978-0-86093-632-9|publisher=Ian Allan[/tpl] To the east is a Network Rail maintenance training centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.curtins.com/projects/transport/bristol-parkway-maintenance-centre.html|title=Bristol Parkway Maintenance Centre|publisher=Curtins|accessdate=24 September 2013[/tpl] The next station north along the Cross Country Route is [tpl]rws|Yate[/tpl], the next station south is [tpl]rws|Filton Abbey Wood[/tpl]. The next station east along the South Wales Main Line is [tpl]rws|Swindon[/tpl], the next station west is [tpl]rws|Patchway[/tpl], however there is only train per day calling at both Bristol Parkway and Patchway.
The station is on an east/west alignment, with the main station building and car park to the north of the line. There is a goods yard adjacent to the station to the south, with two loops for trains to pass. The station has three platforms, numbered 2, 3 and 4. Platform 2 is to the south of the two main running lines, and serves westbound trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. Platforms 3 and 4 share an island to the north of the two main running lines, with a further two running lines between platform 4 and the car park. Platform 3 serves mainly inter-city trains towards London and [tpl]rws|Birmingham New Street[/tpl], while platform 4 is usually reserved for local services. There is a metal wall on platform 2, fencing off the goods yard. An enclosed footbridge provides access to the platforms, approximately a third of the way along platforms 2 and 3 (from west to east), and at the west end of platform 4. Platforms 2 and 3 are opposite each other, while platform 4 is offset from platform 3, starting at the footbridge and extending further to the east. Platform 2 is [tpl]convert|257|m|yd[/tpl] long, platform 3 is [tpl]convert|255|m|yd[/tpl] and platform 4 is [tpl]convert|278|m|yd[/tpl]. Platforms 3 and 4 are signalled for bidirectional running, while platform 2 is unidirectional. The footbridge can be accessed by both stairs and lifts.
The station building, a sweeping metal construction opened in 2001,[tpl]cite book|title=Gloucestershire Railway Stations|author=Oakley, Mike|year=2003|publisher=The Dovecote Press|location=Wimbourne, Dorset|isbn=1-904349-24-2|pages=29–30[/tpl] contains a booking office, waiting rooms, payphones, cash machines, shops, toilets and a café overlooking the tracks.  There are waiting rooms on each platform, as well as vending machines and LED displays giving next train information. Ticket barriers are in use at the station. The pay-and-display car park, run by APCOA, has 1140 spaces, and is currently being expanded as it is at capacity on weekdays.
Bristol Parkway was the first of a new generation of park and ride railway stations, and a large number of passengers use it for that purpose. Over the decade 2002–2012, the number of passengers starting or ending a journey at Bristol Parkway grew by 1 million passengers per year to 2.25 million, with a further 740,000 passengers changing trains there, giving an annual footfall of just under 3 million passengers and making it the 216th busiest station in the country and the third busiest in the West of England (after Bristol Temple Meads and [tpl]rws|Bath Spa[/tpl]) [tpl]as of|2012|alt=as of the 2011/12 financial year[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stationtravelplans.com/view-the-pilots?pilot_id=21|title=Station Travel Plans: National Pilot Programme – Bristol Parkway|publisher=Association of Train Operating Companies|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xlsx/station_usage_estimates_1112.xlsx|title=Station Usage Estimates 2011/12|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/stat_usage.xls|title=Station Usage Estimates 2002/03|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl] In the 2006/07 financial year, over 100,000 passengers used Parkway to travel to or from Bristol Temple Meads,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/great%20western/great%20western%20rus%20baseline%20information/09.%20passenger%20demand/gw%20rus%20flows%20to%20from%20bristol%20.pdf|title=Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy – Key Flows to/from Bristol|publisher=Network Rail|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=2006/07[/tpl] and a further 500,000 used it to travel to or from London Paddington.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/great%20western/great%20western%20rus%20baseline%20information/09.%20passenger%20demand/gw%20rus%20flows%20to%20from%20paddington.pdf|title=Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy – Key Flows to/from London Paddington|publisher=Network Rail|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=2006/07[/tpl]

First Great Western services between London and Wales are formed of High Speed Train (HST) sets, while other FGW services use a mix of [tpl]brc|150[/tpl], [tpl]brc|153|n[/tpl] and [tpl]brc|158|n[/tpl] diesel multiple-unit trains. Until 2012, [tpl]brc|143[/tpl] Pacer units were a regular sight, but these have mostly been moved south to work in Devon and Cornwall following a cascade of Class 150/1 units from London Midland and London Overground.[tpl]cite news |title=LOROL Class 150s all with FGW |author=Miles, Tony |work=Modern Railways |location =London |date= December 2010 |page=90[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Salveson, Paul | date = June 2012 | title = Severn Beach: Not your typical branch line! | journal = Today's Railways | issue =126 | pages =pp. 42–47 | location =Sheffield | publisher =Platform 5 [/tpl] CrossCountry services are usually formed of [tpl]brc|220[/tpl] and [tpl]brc|221|n[/tpl] Voyager diesel-electric multiple units, with some services between Scotland and the South West employing HST sets.
The standard journey time to London Paddington is 90 minutes, to Cardiff Central 40 minutes, to Birmingham New Street 75 minutes, and to Bristol Temple Meads 12 minutes.

These routes are operated by First Bristol, First Avon and Somerset, Wessex Bus and Severnside Transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/posters/BPW.pdf|title=Bristol Parkway Station – Onward Travel Information|date=2012/13|accessdate=23 September 2013|publisher=National Rail[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelwest.info/sites/default/files/maps/bus/Bristol%20north%20and%20west%20bus%20route%20map%20%28pdf%29.pdf|title=Bristol Bus Network – North & West|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013|publisher=Travel West[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelwest.info/sites/default/files/maps/bus/Greater%20Bristol%20bus%20route%20map%20%28pdf%29.pdf|title=Bristol Bus Network Map|date=June 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013|publisher=Travel West[/tpl]

==Irish Connections==

From Bristol Parkway connections can be made via Cardiff Central to Fishguard Harbour for the Stena Line ferry to Rosslare Europort for onward Irish Rail trains to Wexford and Dublin Connolly.  There are also connecting trains from Cardiff Central and Swansea to Pembroke Dock for the Irish Ferries to Rosslare Europort onward Irish Rail services to Wexford and Dublin Connolly.

==History==

The line through Bristol Parkway was originally opened in 1903 as part of the Great Western Railway's "Badminton Line" from Wootton Bassett to [tpl]rws|Patchway[/tpl], a short-cut for trains from London to South Wales, avoiding Bath and [tpl]rws|Chippenham[/tpl]. It was built on the site of the Stoke Gifford marshalling yard, which closed on 4 October 1971, having become surplus to requirements with the cessation of wagonload freight trains.[tpl]cite book|title=GWR: The Badminton Line – Portrait of a Railway|author=Robertson, Kevin; Abbot, David|isbn=0-86299-459-4|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing|year=1988|pages=202–206[/tpl] The station's development was seen as a response to the potential growth of housing and commercial developments in north Bristol, with proximity to the M4 and M5 motorway interchange at Almondsbury also important. The name "Parkway" came from proximity to the M32 motorway, known as the Bristol Parkway, although the term Parkway has since been applied to park and ride stations throughout the United Kingdom. When the station was built it was outside the developed urban area, but the growth of housing and commercial development in adjoining areas of the North Fringe has brought it within the conurbation, with many large office complexes being opened nearby.[tpl]cite book |title=OS 1" 7th Series No. 156 – Bristol & Stroud |year=1946 |publisher=Ordnance Survey |location=Southampton[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbarch.org.uk/History_SG_V3.40/Aerial_Photographs/Aerial_Photos.shtml|title=History of Stoke Gifford – Aerial Photographs of the Parish|editor=Kerton, Adrian|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]
The station, owned by British Rail, opened on 1 May 1972.[tpl]Butt-Stations| page=44[/tpl] Services were operated by the Western Region until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the InterCity and Regional Railways divisions. The original structures, built by Stone & Co. of Bristol, were basic – two island platforms connected by an open metal footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the modern platform 3), on the north side of the tracks, was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. The station opened with a 600-space car park and a fastest journey to London of 95 minutes,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/irs/irshome/papers/ephemera.htm|title= Is collecting railway ephemera an archaeological task? |work=Institute of Railway Studies Research Workshop on 'railway ephemera'|author=Forsythe, Robert|date=13 December 2000|accessdate=4 October 2013|publisher=University of York[/tpl] which was subsequently reduced to 75 minutes with the introduction of the new High Speed Trains in the mid-70s.[tpl]cite book|title=Rail Centres: Bristol (#21)|author=Maggs, Colin G|year=2008|origyear=First published 1981|publisher=Booklaw Publications|location=Nottingham|edition=3rd|pages=26–27|isbn=1-901945-30-8[/tpl] Platform canopies were added in 1973, along with a cover for the footbridge. Further minor improvements were implemented over the next thirty years, including a new booking office and small extensions to the car park.
Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1997, services at Bristol Parkway were franchised to several different train operating companies. South Wales Main Line services were provided by Great Western Trains, which was later taken over and rebranded as First Great Western;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rail-bosses-cash-in-on-privatised-gravy-train-1148696.html|title=Rail bosses cash in on privatised gravy train|date=7 March 1998|accessdate=29 September 2013|work=The Independent[/tpl] services from Bristol to Birmingham and the north were operated by Virgin CrossCountry;[tpl]cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/tna/20100927131008/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2006/nccfc/rosscountryfranchisecons1747.pdf|title= New Cross Country Franchise Consultation Document|date=June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=Department for Transport[/tpl] and local services were franchised to Wales and West,[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/11/99/track_record/regions/west_southwest.stm |title=Track record: West and South-West |publisher=BBC |date=November 1999 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |author=Frith, Malcolm[/tpl] which was in turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, a subsidiary of National Express.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.walesandwest.co.uk/ |title=Wales and West|publisher=Wales and West|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl] The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theironroad.net/Operator/Train-Operating-Companies/Wessex-Trains/|title=Wessex Trains |work=The Iron Road: Railway Photography by Scott Borthwick|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4523592.stm |title= FirstGroup wins rail franchises |date=13 December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13351368 |title= First Great Western bids for longer rail franchise deal |work=BBC News|publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl] Virgin CrossCountry services were taken over by Arriva CrossCountry in 2007.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812032658/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/passenger/franchises/winnernewcrosscounty|title=New rail franchise to increase capacity between major cities|publisher=Department for Transport|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl]
In the early 2000s, the Royal Mail began construction of the West of England Post Office Rail Depot just to the east of the station, taking over some of the station car park to provide a platform and warehouse for postal trains. The [tpl]convert|12000|ft2|m2[/tpl] building opened in 2002, with the Royal Mail stating it would save [tpl]convert|250000|miles|km[/tpl] of lorry journeys per year on local roads. However, the depot closed only two years later in 2004, when the Post Office ceased to use the rail network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN02251.pdf|title=Railways: Royal Mail services, 2003–|date=13 April 2010|author=Butcher, Louise|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=House of Commons Library[/tpl] Royal Mail offered the terminal for use by freight companies, but there were no takers.[tpl]cite news|title=Ex-mail Depot Set For New Use|publisher=Northcliffe Media|work=Bristol Evening Post|date=3 July 2006|url=[/tpl] In 2008 it was reopened as a Network Rail maintenance training centre in a £2,500,000 project which saw the construction of a mezzanine floor, a welding workshop and a [tpl]convert|4000|ft2|m2[/tpl] extension.[tpl]cite news|title=The Bristol training centre putting engineers on track|work=This is Bristol|publisher=Northcliffe Media|date=8 August 2008|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Bristol-training-centre-putting-engineers-track/story-11312755-detail/story.html|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl]
In 2000, work began on a complete redevelopment of the station building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys to and from the station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face on the north side of platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/content/detail.aspx?releaseid=3005&newsareaid=2&searchcategoryid=7|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=9 May 2007|publisher=Network Rail|title=New platform for Bristol Parkway[/tpl]
Despite the large car park, the increase in passenger numbers at Parkway in recent years has led to problems with on-street parking, leading to the commissioning of a new 200-space car park [tpl]convert|500|m|yd[/tpl] east of the station.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Park-ride-cars-road/story-11233281-detail/story.html|title=New Bristol park and ride to keep cars off road|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=6 July 2009|work=This is Bristol|publisher=Northcliffe Media[/tpl] It opened in Spring 2011, but was used by only 139 motorists in its first three months, and as of August 2012 was averaging only 10 motorists per day. It is expected that traffic will increase when a new bus link is opened to transfer drivers from the car park to the station.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Spaces-1-2m-car-park-Stoke-Gifford-used/story-16776191-detail/story.html|title=Spaces at £1.2m car park at Stoke Gifford still not being used|author=Koch, Emily|work=This is Bristol|publisher=Northcliffe Media|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl]
Improved cycle facilities, including a bike hire scheme, were provided in the late 2000s.

==Future==
