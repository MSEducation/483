==Playing career==

Jaffray appeared in five seasons of major junior in the Western Hockey League.  He played six games for the Edmonton Ice in 1997–98 before they relocated to Cranbrook, British Columbia the following season, becoming the Kootenay Ice.  In 1999–2000, Jaffray appeared in the 2000 Memorial Cup as Kootenay won the WHL Championship.  He recorded 19 points in 21 WHL playoff games before Kootenay was eliminated in the round robin of the Memorial Cup tournament.
Midway through Jaffray's final WHL season, 2000–01, he was traded to the Swift Current Broncos and accumulated a junior career-high 83 points in 73 games.
Undrafted, Jaffray turned professional in the ECHL with the Roanoke Express.  Named Rookie of the Month twice (November and December),[tpl]cite web|title=Jason Jaffray - AHL Profile|url=http://www.moosehockey.com/roster/jaffray_jason/|publisher=Manitoba Moose|accessdate=2007-07-18[/tpl] he tallied 85 points in 64 games and earned the 2003 CCM Tacks Rookie of the Year Award.[tpl]cite web|title=CCM Tacks Rookie of the Year|url=http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/mpublic.cgi?action=all_time_winners&award=5|publisher=East Coast Hockey League|accessdate=2008-07-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  He was also named to the ECHL First All-Star Team and All-Rookie Team.
The next season, Jaffray played for the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL and was named to the Second All-Star Team after finishing third in goal-scoring with 37.  In his first two seasons in the ECHL, he appeared in several American Hockey League games as well with the Norfolk Admirals and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.  Jaffray began in the ECHL for a third season in 2004–05 before signing a tryout contract with the Cleveland Barons on December 14, 2004.  He played on a line with San Jose Sharks prospects Ryane Clowe and Marcel Goc, posting 16 points in 30 games.  His tenure with the club was cut short, however, as the Barons inadvertently forgot to renew his working visa, making him ineligible to play in the United States.  On his way back to his hometown of Olds, Alberta, Jaffray got a phone call from Manitoba Moose general manager Craig Heisinger.  Two Moose players had come down with sickness and Hisinger asked Jaffray if he could play in Hamilton, Ontario, that night for a game against the Hamilton Bulldogs.  Jaffray changed direction on the highway and made it to Hamilton in time to score the lone goal for Manitoba in a 3–1 loss.  He signed a tryout contract with the Moose on February 26, 2005.
In 2006–07, Jaffray recorded an AHL career-high 81 points in 77 games, leading the Moose in team scoring.  Early in the season, on October 24, 2006, Jaffray tied a Moose franchise record for most goals in one game with four against the Chicago Wolves.  He went on set further Moose records with all-time franchise highs of nine game-winning goals and 16 powerplay goals (tied with Lee Goren and Scott Thomas,  1998–99). As Manitoba advanced the second round of the Calder Cup playoffs, he added a team-high 13 points in 13 games.  Jaffray's successful year culminated in an AHL Second Team All-Star selection and his first NHL contract, signed with the Moose's NHL affiliate, the Vancouver Canucks.[tpl]cite web|title=Jaffray deserves a two-way deal|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Wiebe/2007/04/08/pf-3953151.html|publisher=CANOE|accessdate=2008-07-18|date=2007-04-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tuesday's sports transactions|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/transactions/20070703.htm|publisher=USA Today|date=2007-07-04|accessdate=2008-07-18[/tpl] 
Jaffray was called up for his first NHL game on December 12, 2007, against the Anaheim Ducks, due to an injury to Brendan Morrison.  Jaffray picked up his first NHL point on a 2-on-1 with Moose teammate Mason Raymond, who was also called up.  Incidentally, the assist was on Raymond's first NHL goal.  Later in the game, Jaffray scored his own first goal, the eventual game winner, against J. S. Giguere as the Canucks beat Anaheim 3–2.[tpl]cite web|title=Raymond and Jaffray score 1st NHL goals|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/sports/HKN-Canucks-Ducks.php|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-18|date=2007-12-13[/tpl]  Jaffray completed 2007–08 appearing in 19 games with the Canucks.
The following season, Jaffray appeared in 14 more games for the Canucks, while recording 49 points in 56 games for the Moose.  He helped Manitoba to the AHL's top regular season record en route to a 2009 playoff run to the Calder Cup Finals against the Hershey Bears.  Jaffray notched a hat trick in game two of the Finals, scoring all 3 goals for his club to defeat the Bears 3–1.  He scored the game-winning goal to break the 1–1 tie in the final minute of regulation before adding an empty netter to secure the win.[tpl]Cite web|title=Manitoba Moose get much-needed win in AHL final|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/06/02/sp-ahl-final.html|accessdate=2009-06-03|date=2009-06-02|publisher=CBC[/tpl]  The Moose, however, were defeated in six games.
