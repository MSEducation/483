==Novels on-line project==

The Novels On Line project Chawton House Website Novels Section makes freely accessible the  full-text transcripts of some of the rarest works in the Chawton House Library collection. 
These texts explore broad-ranging themes as satire, slavery, marriage, witchcraft and piracy.
In bringing these little-known novels to a wider audience, it is hoped to stimulate interest in these works amongst a new generation of readers. 
The texts are completely unedited, and have been copied from the originals as accurately as possible. Even  printer errors have been retained.
This is an ongoing project with more novels and texts being made available on line.
