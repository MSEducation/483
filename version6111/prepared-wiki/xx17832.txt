[[Emperor Go-Fushimi]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese emperors, 1288 births, 1336 deaths

Emperor Go-Fushimi (後伏見天皇 Go-Fushimi-tennō) (April 5, 1288 – May 17, 1336) was the 93rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.  His reign spanned the years from 1298 to 1301.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, pp. 274–275; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki. pp. 238–239.
This 13th-century sovereign was named after his father, Emperor Fushimi and go- (後), translates literally as "later"; and thus, he is sometimes called the "Later Emperor Fushimi". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the "second one;" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Fushimi, the second," or as "Fushimi II."

==Genealogy==

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was [tpl]Nihongo| Tanehito-shinnō |胤仁親王[/tpl].Titsingh, p. 274; Varley, p. 238.
He was the eldest son of the 92nd Emperor Emperor Fushimi.  They belonged to the Jimyōin-tō branch of the Imperial Family.

==Events of Go-Fushimi's life==

Tanehito-shinnō was named Crown Prince or heir in 1289.
Fushimi acted as cloistered emperor for a period, but after a while, from 1313 to 1318, Go-Fushimi acted in that function.
During Hanazono's reign, negotiations between the Bakufu and the two lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the Bumpō Agreement).  This agreement did not last long, as it was broken by Emperor Go-Daigo.
Go-Fushimi was the author of a famous plea to the god of the Kamo Shrine for help in gaining the throne for his son.  This plea was ultimately successful, but it was not until thirty-three years after his abdication that Go-Fushimi's son, Emperor Kōgon became emperor.  Kōgon was the first of the northern court emperors backed by the Muromachi Bakufu.
Emperor Go-Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 422.

===Kugyō===

[tpl]Nihongo|Kugyō|公卿[/tpl] is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Fo-Fushimi's reign, this apex of the ''Daijō-kan included:
