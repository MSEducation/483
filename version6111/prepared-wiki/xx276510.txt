The Blueshirts (Spanish: Camisas Azules) is the name of the paramilitary militia of the Falange political party in Spain. The name refers to the blue uniform worn by members of the militia. The colour blue was chosen for the uniforms because it is the same colour as that of workers' overalls, as the Falange sought to gain support among the Spanish working class.C. J. Sansom.
