Saturday Night was a Canadian general interest magazine. It was founded in Toronto, Ontario in 1887.
The publication was first established as a weekly broadsheet newspaper about public affairs and the arts, which was later expanded into a general interest magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/10/20/saturday_night_suspend_051020.html|title=Publisher shelves Saturday Night|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=CBC | date=October 20, 2005[/tpl] The editor, Edmund E. Sheppard, was prevented from editing a daily newspaper due to an earlier libel action. Additionally, Blue laws in Toronto prevented publication on Sunday. So, in its first years, the paper was restricted to being a weekly publication, published on Saturdays.
Saturday Night has been through a number of owners, formats, and frequencies of publication. The last standalone monthly issue, published by then-owner Conrad Black, was March 2000 (Vol 115 No 2, Issue #3819). After a hiatus of two months it was relaunched as a weekend supplement in Black's National Post, continuing as Vol 115 No 3, Issue #3819. It was issued weekly in this format until September 22, 2001 (Vol 116 No 35 Issue #3885) when it was cancelled as part of CanWest's cutbacks at the National Post.
The title was purchased by MultiVision Publishing and re-emerged under editor Matthew Church as a bimonthly (and later 10 times-a-year) newsstand magazine (with some copies inserted in subscription National Posts) beginning in April 2002 as Vol 117, No 1, Issue #3886. Later purchased by St Joseph Media, publication was ended in November 2005 with Issue #3916, which is at present the last printed issue of Saturday Night.
On October 20, 2005, the company announced that publication would be "suspended" due to insufficient advertiser support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051020/sat_night_051020?s_name=&no_ads=|title=Saturday Night magazine suspended again|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=Canadian Press[/tpl] The editor at the time of suspension was Gary Ross, who had been editor since 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/08/19/satnight040819.html|title=West Coast author-editor takes editorship of Saturday Night|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=CBC | date=August 19, 2004[/tpl]
On December 18, 2008, the Saturday Night website was relaunched as a blog, with the initial post indicating that the site would "canvas the country and present you with a unique and intriguing perspective on our national life in politics and power, sex and crime, entertainment and culture, arts and literature, style and design." However, after five posts made that day, the blog was abandoned and has not been updated since.
