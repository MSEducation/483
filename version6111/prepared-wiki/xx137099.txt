==Synopsis==

This story follows the journey of naive Lino (Piolo Pascual) as he searches for his missing wife Mary Grace in Italy. He comes across Jenny (Claudine Barretto), an imposing figure in the Filipino community of migrant workers, whose dreams of grandeur have clouded her need for personal relationships. In a desperate quest for game and survival, the two find refuge and affirmation in each other. What started as a mentor – protégé relationship, Lino and Jenny’s partnership evolves beautifully into a self-consuming love affair. Until these are put to a test. Reality bites as the land changes everything.
In the end, it matters not that Lino finds his wife for he has found himself. And alas, it matters not for Jenny that she sacrifices for love, for she has learned to give, in order to live again.
