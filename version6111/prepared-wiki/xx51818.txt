The Boston Blazers were a member of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League from 1989 to 1997. They were called the New England Blazers from 1989 to 1991 while based in Worcester, Massachusetts, and were renamed the Boston Blazers in 1992 when they moved to Boston. While in Worcester, the Blazers played at the Worcester Centrum. In Boston, they played at the Boston Garden from 1992-1995 and then moved to the FleetCenter in 1996 and played there until 1997.
The current NLL Boston Blazers franchise is not related to this one. The name of the new team was chosen "in part due to the popularity and nostalgia associated with the former Boston Blazers franchise".[tpl]cite web|url=http://nll.com/article.php?id=3111|work=NLL.com|title=Boston team name: Blazers|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-04[/tpl]
