Cape Coast, or Cabo Corso, is a city and fishing port, and the capital of Cape Coast Metropolitan District and Central Region of south Ghana. Cape Coast is situated on its south to the Gulf of Guinea. Cape Coast had a settlement population of 169,894 people (2010 census). From the 16th century the city and fishing port has changed hands between the British, the Portuguese, the Swedish, the Danish and the Dutch.

==History==

Cape Coast was founded by the people of Oguaa. The Swedish later came to build the Cape Coast castle and so, Cape Coast grew around Cape Coast Castle, now a World Heritage Site. It was converted to a castle by the Dutch in 1650, then expanded by the Swedes in 1652 and captured by the British in 1664. 
Trade was an important motivator in the creation of fortresses and settlements on Cape Coast. The various European countries that came to what is now the coast of Ghana created interpersonal, lasting relationships with the indigenous peoples as a method of ensuring long-term economic gain. Unfortunately, the acquisition of gold, slaves, honey, and the many other African goods that consisted the African leg of the Triangular Trade was increasingly detrimental to the inhabitants of Cape Coast.[tpl]cite book|last1=Rømer|first1=Ludvig Ferdinand|last2=Winsnes|first2=Selena Axelrod |title=A Reliable Account of the Coast of Guinea (1760)|year=2000|publisher=British Academy|isbn=978-0-19-726218-4[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The British based their Gold Coast operations in the town until they were expelled because of severe opposition to the "window tax" in 1877. Accra became their state. Cape Coast was also where most of the slaves were held before their journey on the Middle Passage.
