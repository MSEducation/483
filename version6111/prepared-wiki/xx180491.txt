St. Mary's School, locally known as SMK St. Mary in Malay, is a public all-girls secondary school located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Each student in St. Mary's is also known as St. Marian.
It was previously situated in the Golden Triangle of Kuala Lumpur, before being reshifted into the borders of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, beside the MRR2 highway. According to Google Maps, the school is in the Selangor territory, however the official address of the school determined that it belongs to the Kuala Lumpur territory.
St. Mary's School used to be a school comprising kindergarten, primary and secondary education. Kindergarten was split in 1946, whereas the primary and secondary education section were separated in 1958.

==History==

===In the Golden Triangle premise===

In 1911, the idea of establishing an English High School exclusively for girls was proposed by the first Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, Bishop Ferguson-Davie. The first principal position was appointed to Miss Eveleigh. On 4 November 1912, the school officially opened in a house located at 18 Weld Road (now known as Jalan Raja Chulan) with the principal, Miss Chitty who took charge of women's work and 3 enrolments.
The school was relocated to Ampang Road off Lake View Road in 1913. It was only in January 1917 that the school was recognized as St. Mary's School for girls and the responsibility was taken by St. Mary's Church. Miss F.C. Pope, who was previously in charge of music, took over the principal position when Miss Playne resigned. As of 1917, the school comprised two semi-detached houses with an enrolment of 30, 8 of which were boarders. In the same year, the [tpl]convert|9|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] site of Weld Hill Road was bought under the name of the Bishop of Singapore and Malaya, using a sum of Â£36000. In September of the same year, the school moved again to a bungalow in 7 Treacher Road (now known as Jalan Sultan Ismail), with a total of 54 morning session students and 4 boarders. The faculty comprised Miss Pope, Miss Kay, Mrs. King and Miss Alice Chen. Miss Pope resigned as principal towards the end of 1917 and she was replaced by Miss Mc Neil in June 1918. At the end of 1918, Miss Pope finally gave up her work in the school and returned to England.
In the following year, The Reverend A.B. Champion, the Chaplain of Selangor at that time and also a friend of the founder,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pkbf.org.my/trails.htm |title=The Bishop Trail (1500M) - The Fig Trail |date= |month= |year= |publisher=Fraser's Hill Development Corporation |location=Malaysia |accessdate=8 December 2009 |quote=... The Bishop and a friend, Reverend A.B Champion, the Chaplain of Selangor, went on a holiday ramble ...[/tpl] opened the Boys' Department and Boarding House, making the school coeducational for the first time. 2 expansions were made: one in November 1922 which completed in 1923, another in 1930. Between this period, the St. Mary's Association was formed in 1925. In 1931, Miss Mc Neil retired after her 13 years of service and she was replaced by Miss Pring.
When Miss Pring went on furlough in 1934, Miss Sprenger became the acting principal. In the same year, school uniform was adopted and the school badge was introduced with these symbols:
The first issue of the school magazine entitled Fleur De Lys, which was named after the lily on the school badge, was published in 1937.
In March 1938, the school returned to being an all-girls school after 19 years as the Boys' Department was terminated due to insufficient boys to form a class. There was a total of 318 enrolment in primary and secondary section and 62 students in two kindergarten classes.
As of 1939, the first Sports House system was introduced and the original names were those of the Federated Malay States, each represented by a colour:
Miss Pring left for England on furlough once again in June 1939, thus Miss Florence Carpenter became the acting principal.
Following World War II when the Japanese Army invades Malaya, all schools were closed by 1942. Before being evacuated to India later, Miss Carpenter went to Singapore. The school building was used as a military hospital by the Japanese Army. Miss Pring who was on her leave, died due to tragic fall in Kashmir.
The school reopened with Miss Edna Yzelman as the acting principal in 18 October 1945 after the Japanese Army retreated from Malaya towards the end of World War II. The kindergarten section was split from the school in 1946 under Miss Frank. Miss Carpenter, who was evacuated prior to the war, returned to the school and became the new principal. The school later received a visit from the Governor of Malaya, Sir Edward Gent in 6 April 1946. Due to staff shortage, the school Certificate class had to be combined with that in Pudu English School.
As school reopened on 20 January 1947, full classes resumed with Miss Agnes Pinnick as the acting principal. There was much progress in the school that temporary classrooms were established near the road for the accommodation of increasing enrolment. The school Sports Houses were also renamed to the names of past principals, using the same colours from before except purple, which was replaced by yellow:
By 1949, there were as many as 500 students in the school, and the school Certificate class obtained full pass with 10 distinctions out of 23. School was expanded in 1955 with the construction of Domestic Science room. The students in Form 1 and 2 were also taught with a new subject, Home Science. First celebration of the school birthday was officially held after 43 years of establishment at 14 October.
Parent-Teacher Association of the school was formed in 10 July 1956. Later in 1 November 1957, the Right Reverend Tan Sri Roland Koh (the first Bishop after Diocese of West Malaysia was formed) opened more new classrooms for the primary education students.
1 January 1958 saw the separation of St. Mary's into primary and secondary schools, with Mrs. Louise LaBrooy assuming the principal seat for the primary school.
In 15 October 1959, Bishop Roland Koh, once again, opened a new block in the school, which consisted of Science labs and canteen. In conjunction with the incorporation of Rahman Talib Report into Education Act 1961,

As the school reached its 50th year anniversary, the Golden Jubilee Year was celebrated on 18 October 1962, and the school magazine publishing a special Jubilee edition as well. Miss Carpenter also retired as school principal, replaced by Miss Diana Sellors in 1963.
In 4 February 1969, the Minister of Education at that time, Tan Sri Mohd Khir Johari, opened another extension which comprised the Art room, Domestic Science rooms and more classrooms. Mrs. Maureen Morel replaced retiring Miss Sellors as the principal on 14 August 1970, thus becoming the first Asian principal ever appointed.
The principal seat was taken over by Mrs. Rajendran in 1975. She introduced several programmes for the school which are still practised to date, namely the Leadership Training Course, Prefects' Installation, Religious Emphasis Week and Library Week. School band was formed in the next year.
As Miss E. N. Richards replaced Mrs. Rajendran in 1980, the school was renovated extensively and it was repainted in 1986. The school celebrated its 75th and 80th anniversary in 1987 and 1991 respectively. Dato' Stanley Isaacs was also appointed the Chairman of the Board of Governors seat. The school was renovated again for the last time in the Jalan Tengah premise - two classrooms and two specialist rooms were established.
The relocation plan began in 1995, when the Lion Group bought the school land and negotiations were made with the Ministry of Education. The new school model was displayed to the public on 10 May 1997, with Tun Dr. Siti Hasmah as the guest of honour. December of the same year marked the beginning of the large scale shift to the new [tpl]convert|9|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] site at Taman Intan Baiduri, Selayang. The new building was estimated to cost RM33million.
In 21 February 1998, more than 800 ex-students attended the Reunion Dinner organised by the St. Mary's School Association to bid the old school farewell. Finally in 31 March, the Anglican Diocese of West Malaysia handed the keys of the old school to the Lion Group.

====Demolition of the old school building====

In May 2006, Eastern & Oriental Group (E&O Group) joined the Jalan Tengah Development project and an agreement was signed between the Diocese of West Malaysia, Lion Group and E&O Group. With approvals obtained by October 2007, the old school building was demolished on 28 November 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anglicanwestmalaysia.org.my/resource_centre/msg1q08.pdf |title=Redevelopment of Jalan Tengah Land |date=January 2008 |work=Anglican messenger |publisher=Anglican Diocese of West Malaysia |page=4 |format=PDF |accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl] The site was used for the construction of St. Mary's Residence, a service apartment which consists of three 28-storey blocks, by the Lion Group and E&O Group.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=60153 |title=E&O Group aims to boost earnings from hospital division |date=1 October 2008 |work=Daily Express |publisher=Sabah Publishing House Sdn.

==Curriculum==

Like most other public schools, the school follows syllabus set by the Malaysia Ministry of Education. Students are to take the public examinations, namely PMR and SPM, in Form 3 and Form 5 respectively. The optional pre-university level, Form 6, is not taught in the school, therefore Form 5 students who wish to further their studies in Form 6 would have to transfer to another school which provides Form 6 education to sit for STPM.
