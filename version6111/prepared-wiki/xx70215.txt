Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer and Secretary of War, and the first son of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. Born in Springfield, Illinois, United States, he was one of two of Lincoln's four sons to live to adulthood, and the only one to survive into the 1900s.

==Family and early life==

Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on August 1, 1843, to Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) and Mary Todd Lincoln (1818–1882).
He had three younger brothers, Edward Baker Lincoln (1846–1850), William Wallace Lincoln (1850–1862) and Tad Lincoln (1853–1871). By the time Lincoln was born, his father had become a well-known member of the Whig political party and had previously served as a member of the state legislature for four terms. Lincoln was named after his maternal grandfather.[tpl]sfn|Emerson|pp=6–7[/tpl]
By the time his father became President of the United States, Lincoln was the only one of the President's three children to be largely on his own.[tpl]sfn|Roberts|p=63[/tpl]
Lincoln graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1860, then studied at Harvard University from 1861 to 1865, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter). He enrolled at Harvard Law School but did not graduate.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] When Lincoln initially expressed interest in attending Harvard Law School to his father, the latter made reference to his pleasant informal legal training by stating "If you do, you should learn more than I ever did, but you will never have so good a time."[tpl]sfn|Burlingame|p=91[/tpl] Robert failed fifteen out of the sixteen subjects in the Harvard entrance examination, but managed to get in. Morris states after getting in the college, Robert Lincoln emerged an "unsympathetic bore."[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=128[/tpl]
Much to the embarrassment of the President, Mary Todd Lincoln prevented Robert Lincoln from joining the Union Army until shortly before the war's conclusion. "We have lost one son, and his loss is as much as I can bear, without being called upon to make another sacrifice," Mary Todd Lincoln insisted to President Lincoln. President Lincoln argued "our son is not more dear to us than the sons of other people are to their mothers." However, Mary Todd Lincoln persisted by stating that she could not "bear to have Robert exposed to danger." In January 1865, the First Lady yielded and President Lincoln wrote Ulysses S. Grant, asking if Robert could be placed on his staff.[tpl]sfn|Burlingame|pp=738–739[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Charnwood|p=444[/tpl]
On February 11, 1865 he was commissioned as an assistant adjutant with the rank of captain and served in the last weeks of the American Civil War as part of General Ulysses S. Grant's immediate staff, a position which sharply minimized the likelihood that he would be involved in actual combat. He was present at Appomattox when Lee surrendered.[tpl]cite book|last=Goff|first=John S.|title=Robert Todd Lincoln: A Man in His Own Right|publisher= University of Oklahoma Press|year=1968|pages=68|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IWchAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Robert+Todd+Lincoln%22+Appomattox&q=Appomattox#search_anchor [/tpl]  He resigned his commission on June 12, 1865 and returned to civilian life.
Lincoln had a distant relationship with his father, in part because during his formative years, Abraham Lincoln spent months on the judicial circuit. Their relationship was similar to the one Abraham Lincoln had with his own father.[tpl]sfn|Roberts|pp=87–88[/tpl]
Lincoln stated, "During my childhood and early youth he was almost constantly away from home, attending court or making political speeches."[tpl]sfn|Emerson|p=10[/tpl] Robert would later say his most vivid image of his father was of his packing his saddlebags to prepare for his travels through Illinois.Donald, p. 159  Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert and thought him bright, but also saw him as something of a competitor. An acquaintance purportedly said, "he guessed Bob would not do better than he had."quoted in Donald, p. 428  The two lacked the strong bond Lincoln had with his sons Willie and Tad, but Robert deeply admired his father and wept openly at his deathbed.Donald, p. 599
The night of his father's death, Robert had turned down an invitation to accompany his parents to Ford's Theatre, citing fatigue after spending much of his recent time in a covered wagon at the battlefront.Ralph Gary, The Presidents Were Here: A State-by-State Historical Guide, 2008, page 43Deanna Spingola, The Ruling Elite: A Study in Imperialism, Genocide and Emancipation, 2011, page 556Jason Emerson, Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln, 2011, page 100
On April 25, 1865, Robert Lincoln wrote President Andrew Johnson a letter requesting that he and his family be allowed to stay for two and a half weeks because his mother had told him that "she can not possibly be ready to leave here". Lincoln also acknowledged that he was aware of the "great inconvenience" that Johnson had since becoming President of the United States only a short time ago.[tpl]sfn|Graf|p=639[/tpl]
Following his father's assassination, in April 1865 Robert moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago, where Robert completed his law studies at the Old University of Chicago law school (later absorbed by the Northwestern University School of Law). He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867.[tpl]cite web|title=Lincoln Chronology|url=http://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/lincolnchronology.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=[/tpl]
On January 1, 1866, Lincoln moved out of the apartment he shared with his mother and brother. He rented his own rooms in downtown Chicago to "begin to live with some degree of comfort" which he had not known when living with his family.[tpl]sfn|Emerson|p=121[/tpl] Lincoln was licensed as an attorney in Chicago on February 22, 1867. He was certified to practice law four days later on February 26, 1867.[tpl]sfn|Emerson|p=124[/tpl]
On September 24, 1868, Lincoln married the former Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 – March 31, 1937), the daughter of Senator James Harlan and Ann Eliza Peck of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. They had two daughters and one son.[tpl]cite web|title=Robert Todd Lincoln entry|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/130/000057956/|publisher=Notable Names Database (NNDB)|accessdate=[/tpl]
In an era before air conditioning, Robert, Mary and the children would often leave hot city life behind for the cooler climate of Mt. Pleasant. During the 1880s the family would "summer" at the Harlan home. The Harlan-Lincoln home, built in 1876, still stands today. Donated by Mary Harlan Lincoln to Iowa Wesleyan College in 1907, it now serves as a museum with many artifacts from the Lincoln family and from Abraham Lincoln's presidency.[tpl]cite web|last=Allt|first=Kate|url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/news/story.aspx?id=859675|title=Mt.

===Relationship with Mary Todd Lincoln===

In 1871, tragedy beset the family again when Lincoln's only surviving brother, Tad died at the age of 18; leaving his mother devastated with grief.  Lincoln, who was already concerned about what he thought were his mother's "spend-thrift" ways and eccentric behavior, and fearing that she was a danger to herself, arranged to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital in Batavia, Illinois in 1875. With his mother in the hospital, he was left with control of her finances. On May 20, 1875, she arrived at Bellevue Place, a private, upscale sanitarium in the Fox River Valley.Mary Todd Lincoln's Stay at Bellevue Place. Showcase.netins.net. Retrieved on 2011-08-06.
Three months after being installed in Bellevue Place, Mary Lincoln engineered her escape. She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife, Myra Bradwell, who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer and fellow spiritualist. She also wrote to the editor of the Chicago Times, known for its sensational journalism. Soon, the public embarrassments Robert had hoped to avoid were looming, and his character and motives were in question. The director of Bellevue, who at Mary’s commitment trial had assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility, now in the face of potentially damaging publicity declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister as she desired.[tpl]Wayback |date=20080923153646 |url=http://www.wcwonline.org/content/view/1719/38/ |title="The insanity life" [/tpl], Wellesley Centers for Women 2008 The committal proceedings and following events led to a profound estrangement between Lincoln and his mother, and they never fully reconciled.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=CqjBCWV6Eu4C&pg=PA754&dq=%22permanently+estranged+Mary%22#v=onepage&q=%22permanently%20estranged%20Mary%22&f=false | title = Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln | isbn = 1416549838 | author1 = Goodwin | first1 = Doris Kearns | date = 2005-10-25[/tpl]

==Politics==

===Secretary of War (1881–1885)===

In 1877 he turned down President Rutherford B. Hayes' offer to appoint him Assistant Secretary of State, but later accepted an appointment as President James Garfield's Secretary of War, serving from 1881 to 1885 under Presidents Garfield and Chester A. Arthur.
During his term in office, the Cincinnati Riots of 1884 broke out over a case in which a jury gave a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder in a case that many suspected was rigged. Forty-five people died during three days of rioting before U.S. troops dispatched by Lincoln reestablished calm.[ref]

Following his service as Secretary of War, Lincoln helped Oscar Dudley in establishing the Illinois Industrial Training School for Boys in Norwood Park in 1887, after Dudley (a Humane Society employee) "discovered more homeless, neglected and abused boys than dogs on the city streets."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.glenwoodacademy.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Glenwood Academy |accessdate=April 12, 2014 [/tpl] The school relocated to Glenwood, Illinois in 1890 and most recently changed its name to Glenwood Academy; it first enrolled girls in 2001.

===Minister to the Court of St. James's===

Lincoln served as the U.S. minister to the United Kingdom from 1889 to 1893 under President Benjamin Harrison. Lincoln's young son, Abraham II "Jack", died during this time in Europe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abrahamlincolnassociation.org/Newsletters/9-3.pdf |title=A Death in the Family : Abraham Lincoln II "Jack" (1873–1890) |accessdate=2008-09-21 |last=Schwartz |first=Thomas F. |date=Autumn 2007 |format=PDF |work=For the People |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association [/tpl] After serving as minister, Lincoln returned to private business as a lawyer.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

===Later life===

Lincoln was general counsel of the Pullman Palace Car Company under George Pullman, and was named president after Pullman's death in 1897.  According to Almont Lindsey's 1942 book, The Pullman Strike, Lincoln arranged to have Pullman quietly excused from the subpoena issued for Pullman to testify in the 1895 trials of the leaders of the American Railway Union for conspiracy during the 1894 Pullman strike. Pullman hid from the deputy marshal sent to his office with the subpoena and then appeared with Lincoln to meet privately with Judge Grosscup after the jury had been dismissed.Lindsey, The Pullman Strike, p. 301. In 1911, Lincoln became chairman of the board, a position he held until 1922.[tpl]cite web|title=Prominent Alumni ROBERT TODD LINCOLN '64|url=http://www.godeke.org/Deke_Alumni/Alpha_Robert_Todd_Lincoln.htm|publisher=Alpha / Harvard|accessdate=[/tpl]
A serious amateur astronomer, Lincoln constructed an observatory at his home in Manchester, Vermont, and equipped it with a refracting telescope made in 1909 by Warner & Swasey with a six-inch objective lens by John A. Brashear Co., Ltd.  Lincoln's telescope and observatory still exist; it has been restored and is used by a local astronomy club.Revised List of Telescopes by Warner & Swasey Company as augmented by E. N.

Robert Lincoln made his last public appearance at the dedication ceremony in Washington, D.C. for his father's memorial on May 30, 1922.[tpl]cite web|title=Robert Todd Lincoln Attends Dedication of His Father’s Memorial (1922)|url=http://ghostsofdc.org/2012/01/19/robert-todd-lincoln-attends-dedication-of-his-fathers-memorial-1922/|publisher=Ghosts of DC|accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl]

==Presence at assassinations==

Robert Lincoln was coincidentally either present or nearby when three presidential assassinations occurred.[tpl]Wayback |date=20101202044428 |url=http://www.lincolnbicentennial.gov/lincolns-life/lincolns-family/robert-todd-lincoln/default.aspx |title=Lincoln Bicentennial – Biography of Robert Todd Lincoln [/tpl]
Lincoln himself recognized the frequency of these coincidences.  He is said to have refused a later presidential invitation with the comment "No, I'm not going, and they'd better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present."

==Robert Lincoln and Edwin Booth==

Robert Lincoln was once saved from possible serious injury or death by Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of his father. The incident took place on a train platform in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1863 or early 1864, before John Wilkes Booth's assassination of President Lincoln (April 15, 1865).
Robert Lincoln recalled the incident in a 1909 letter to Richard Watson Gilder, editor of The Century Magazine:
Months later, while serving as an officer on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant, Robert Lincoln recalled the incident to his fellow officer, Colonel Adam Badeau, who happened to be a friend of Edwin Booth. Badeau sent a letter to Booth, complimenting the actor for his heroism. Before receiving the letter, Booth had been unaware that the man whose life he had saved on the train platform had been the President's son. The incident was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother's assassination of the President.Robert Todd Lincoln: A Man In His Own Right by John S. Goff, p. 70-71.Edwin Booth Saved Robert Todd Lincoln’s Life. History Net. Retrieved on 2011-08-06.   President Ulysses Grant also sent Booth a letter of gratitude for his action.

==Republican politics==

From 1884 to 1912, Lincoln's name was mentioned in varying degrees of seriousness as a candidate for the Republican presidential or vice-presidential nomination.  At every turn, he adamantly disavowed any interest in running and stated he would not accept either position if nominated.Robert Todd Lincoln: The Perpetual Non-Candidate. Retrieved on 2011-08-06.

==Death==

Robert Todd Lincoln died in his sleep at Hildene, his Vermont home, on July 26, 1926.  He was 82. The cause of death was given by his physician as a "cerebral hemorrhage induced by arteriosclerosis".[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerjnorton.com/Lincoln66.html|title=Robert Lincoln|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Research Site|accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]
He was later interred in Arlington National CemeteryRobert Todd Lincoln Tomb in Arlington Cemetery. Showcase.netins.net. Retrieved on 2011-08-06. in a sarcophagus designed by the sculptor James Earle Fraser.  He is buried with his wife Mary and their son Jack, who died in London, England of blood poisoning at the age of 16.
Lincoln was the last surviving member of both the Garfield and Arthur Cabinets.
Of Robert's children, Jessie Harlan Lincoln Beckwith (1875–1948) had two children, Mary Lincoln Beckwith ("Peggy" 1898–1975) and Robert ("Bud") Todd Lincoln Beckwith (1904–1985), neither of whom had children of their own. Robert's other daughter, Mary Todd Lincoln ("Mamie") (1869–1938) married Charles Bradley Isham in 1891. They had one son, Lincoln Isham (1892–1971). Lincoln Isham married Leahalma Correa in 1919, but died without children.
The last person known to be of direct Lincoln lineage, Robert's grandson "Bud" Beckwith, died in 1985.Mark E. Neely, Jr., The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia, McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1982 (ISBN 0-07-046145-7).
