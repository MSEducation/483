==History==

Michael Berlin and Steven Scalfati set up IQ Beats in the summer of 2002 and their first custom package was made for Fox FM in Oxfordshire in the UK. This package went on to be the most syndicated IQ Beats package ever. The success of this package lead to commissions for The Century Network, WKTU and Heart 106.2 in London as well as a number of syndicated resings.
Audio engineer and record producer Kip Beelman (Sleater-Kinney, Maktub, Brandi Carlile, Juno, Kinski, The Posies, Ken Stringfellow, The Long Winters) was added to the staff a year later. Shortly thereafter local singer/songwriter Patrick Napper was brought on board with the TFM Radio package being his first effort.
Bringing on a second composer allowed chief creative director Steven Scalfati to produce IQ Production’s first library music release, RnB/DnB and a Few Breaks. As producing more titles in the series became a priority, local composer/producer and ace guitarist Dudley Taft was added to the fold to create Adrenaline Rock, the second disc in the ongoing series.
IQ Beats thrives to this day with packages in the Country, Hot AC, Rhythmic AC, Urban AC, CHR, Smooth Jazz, Rhythmic CHR, Hip Hop/R & B, Adult Hits, Sports Talk and News Talk formats airing in the United States and Canada as well as throughout the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, Russia and Asia throughout partnerships with European representative Music & Images and Australian representative Big Bang & Fuzz. The company’s success has allowed itself to keep innovating with their extremely popular and unique imaging tool called "Country X Factor" and the custom-produced Kickers airing on KAWO and KKWF.
In addition to producing world-class radio imaging products and commercial library music, members of IQ Beats have continued to perform into other areas of music and audio production: Kip Beelman continues to produce and engineer local bands; Steven Scalfati has recently tasted success doing remixes for Ashley Tisdale, Lady Sovereign, Jessi Melay and Stevie Nicks while continuing to perform live with Synth Club and Jackie Papers; Dudley Taft is a performing member of Spike and the Impalers, songwriter and guitarist for the hard rock band Omnivoid, and band leader for the Dudley Taft Blues Overkill; Patrick Napper has recently completed  a variety of remixes (Nine Inch Nails, Angélique Kidjo featuring Peter Gabriel, Los de Abajo and Joi), continues to travel around the country doing his one-man live DJ performance billed as pnapper, writes, plays guitar and sings lead as a member of Omnivoid, co-writes, produces and performs as a member of Wordblender while also contributing production and horns to Lee Oskar of War, Charlie Loesel, and Lynval Golding of The Specials, among others.
