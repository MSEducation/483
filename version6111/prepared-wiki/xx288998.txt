[[Random leg course]]

CATEGORIES: Nautical terms

A random leg course race, also known as a 'fixed course race' or a 'point-to-point race' is a type of sailing race where the race course may require both beating, reaching, and running, and where the rounding marks may be chosen by the race committee without considering the actual wind direction or weather conditions.PHRF ratings and race courses Class rules and bylaws, Performance handicap racing fleet of Southern California , November 2009 This contrasts with the more common windward-leeward courses, also known as 'buoy races' or, more colloquially, 'sausage races' that are set dead upwind or dead downwind with no reaching legs.
