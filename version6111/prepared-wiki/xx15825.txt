CATEGORIES: Footwear

Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, for fashion, protection against the environment, and adornment. Some cultures chose not to wear footwear, at least in some situations.
Socks and other hosiery are typically worn between the feet and other footwear, less often with sandals or flip flops (thongs). Footwear is sometimes the subject of sexual fetishism, such as shoe fetishism or boot fetishism.
Durable shoes are a relatively recent invention, though many ancient civilizations wore ornamental footwear. Many ancient civilizations saw no need for footwear. The Romans saw clothing and footwear as signs of power and status in society, and most Romans wore footwear, while slaves and peasants remained barefoot.[tpl]cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and footwear: a cultural encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&pg=PA65|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=65–[/tpl] The Middle Ages saw the rise of high-heeled shoes, also associated with power, and the desire to look larger than life, and artwork from that period often depicts bare feet as a symbol of poverty. Bare feet are also seen as a sign of humility and respect, and adherents of many religions worship or mourn while barefoot, or remove their shoes as a sign of respect towards someone of higher standing.
In some cultures, people remove their shoes before entering a home. Some religious communities require people to remove shoes before they enter holy  buildings, such as temples.
Practitioners of the craft of shoemaking are called shoemakers, cobblers, or cordwainers.

==History==

During the Middle Ages, men and women wore pattens, commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe,[tpl]cite web|title=Dangerous Elegance: A History of High-Heeled Shoes|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/036heels.html|publisher=Random History|accessdate=July 1, 2010[/tpl] while the poor and lower classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, were barefoot.[tpl]cite book|last=Frazine|first=Richard Keith|title=The Barefoot Hiker|year=1993|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-525-8|pages=98|url=http://books.google.com/?id=edsITVCd2G0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=barefoot+hiker&q[/tpl] In the 15th century, chopines were created in Turkey, and were usually 7-8 inches (17.7-20.3 cm) high. These shoes became popular in Venice and throughout Europe, as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing.
During the 16th century, royalty such as Catherine de Medici and Mary I of England began wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, men also wore them, and a person with authority or wealth might be described as, well-heeled. In modern society, high-heeled shoes are a part of women's fashion, perhaps more as a sexual prop[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl].

==Footwear industry==

In Europe, the footwear industry has declined in the last years. While in 2005, there were about 27.000 firms, in 2008 there were only 24.000. As well as the number of firms, the direct employment has decreased. The only factors that remained almost steady was the value added at factor cost and production value.Footwear industry statistics Europe
