[[Y-wing]]

CATEGORIES: Star Wars starfighters

Y-wings are fictional Rebel Alliance and New Republic starfighters in the Star Wars universe. They appear in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, as well as the Clone Wars TV series and the Expanded Universe's books, comics, and games.

==Origin and design==

Industrial Light & Magic's Colin Cantwell, who also designed the saga's TIE fighters, initially designed the Y-wing with a large bubble turret for a gunner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/ywingstarfighter/?id=bts|title=Y-wing starfighter (Behind the Scenes)|work=Star Wars Databank|accessdate=2007-08-29|publisher=Lucasfilm[/tpl] However, the dome did not appear properly when filmed against bluescreen, and subsequent designs excised the turret.

==Depiction==

Y-wings are described in the Expanded Universe as durable but slow tactical strike spacecraft, although notes and diagrams by the special effects crew for Return of the Jedi (shown in The Art of Return of the Jedi) show the Y-wing as possessing the same speed and maneuverability as the X-wing and standard TIE fighter. The destruction of Y-wings tasked with destroying the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin in A New Hope leads to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) firing the proton torpedoes that destroy the Empire's battle station. Only one Y-wing survives the battle.
Y-wings also participate at the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. The Expanded Universe describes several Y-wing varieties, such as a one-seater version, a two-seater (one pilot, one gunner) variety, and the "Longprobe" reconnaissance ship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/ywingstarfighter/?id=eu|title=Y-wing starfighter (Expanded Universe)|work=Star Wars Databank|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Rebel Alliance Sourcebook|publisher=West End Games|date=April 1994|isbn=0-87431-209-4|last=Murphy|first=Paul|coauthors=Peter Schweighofer[/tpl]
