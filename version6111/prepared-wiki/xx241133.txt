==Song history==

"The Sound" is a song that references John M. Perkins, an American civil rights activist, in the lyrics "John Perkins said it right / Love is the final fight." The lyrical bent of the song speaks of the country's past racism that still "runs through our veins" and cries out from the ground.Switchfoot “Hello Hurricane” Song Stories, Part II - Published September 9, 2009 (retrieved April 8, 2010) Jon Foreman intended for the song to be part of the answer to that, saying that it is like "rising above the constant gnawing of past wrongs" and declaring Love as "the reconciliation. The deliberate act of forgiveness." 
Inspired by his reading of Perkins' book, Let Justice Roll Down, Foreman set out to bring more awareness to the activist's story, adamant that "John Perkins is a hero whose name needs to be known." Seattle Pacific University Magazine - Published April 2010 (retrieved May 12, 2010) So he wrote the song intentionally avoiding historical plotlines, while instead attempting to "make an impressionistic sketch" of the story.
[tpl]quote|text="The Sound (John Perkins Blues) is a very important song for us as a band. I see so much hatred and fear around me, I see so many people living out their pain. I hear it on the radio. I see it in the headlines. John Perkins story needs to be heard. This song was inspired by a man who sang a louder song than hatred. In a world where we are defined by our differences, Mr. Perkins's life of service and compassion is a tangible demonstration of what it means to live a life of love. Love is the loudest song we could sing. Louder than racism. Louder than fear. Louder than hatred. John Perkins said it right, love is the final fight. We're excited to hear this song on the radio, louder than pain."|sign=Jon Foreman|[/tpl]New Email: Lollapalooza 2010, 'Sabotage' Switchfoot Style, and more! - Published April 7, 2010 (retrieved May 12, 2010)
