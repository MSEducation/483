Article Two of the Constitution of Puerto Rico —titled as the Bill of Rights ([tpl]lang-es|Carta de Derecho[/tpl])— lists the most important rights held by the citizens of Puerto Rico. The Bill of Rights was mandated by [tpl]USPL|81|600[/tpl] which provided for the people of Puerto Rico to adopt a constitution of their own which had to include a bill of rights.[tpl]USPL|81|600[/tpl]
The bill enumerates several freedoms, namely freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and freedom from warrants issued without probable cause. It also establishes two fundamental declarations, that "the dignity of the human being is inviolable" and that all men are equal before the law. It also prohibits several discriminations, namely discrimination made on account of race, color, sex, birth, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas. The bill even took a step further by declaring such principles as essential to human equality.
The Bill of Rights also establishes explicitly that there shall be complete separation of church and state, and that Puerto Rico must have a system of free and secular public education. It also establishes the right to vote, the right to life, and the right to liberty.
