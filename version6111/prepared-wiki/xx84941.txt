==History==

Kohler was founded in 1873 by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler with the purchase of the Sheboygan Union Iron and Steel Foundry. Early products included cast iron and steel farm implements, castings for furniture factories, and ornamental iron pieces including cemetery crosses and settees. A breakthrough came in 1883 when John Michael applied enamel to a cast iron horse trough to create the company's first bathtub. The company has been primarily in the plumbing business ever since, known for plumbing fixtures. In 1888, the then Kohler Water Works developed the original trademarked Bubbler. They became popular, and other companies developed similar products under the generic term "drinking fountain." The colloquial word "bubbler" is still used in several regions of the United States.
In 1934 and 1954, the Kohler Strikes took place.
The Kohler group acquired 2005 Sdmo Industries, a manufacturer of power generators, along with SOREEL (electrical engineering) and BES (maintenance of engine-generators) from the French Meunier Holding.

==Corporate management==

Former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Sr. was President of Kohler Company and his son former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. served for many years in senior management. Today, the president of Kohler is Herbert V. Kohler, Jr. (born February 20, 1939), grandson of the founder.
In 1998, Kohler made a plan to buy back any outstanding shares not owned by the family. All family members had to exchange their common shares for share with limited rights, those that could not be sold. Since Kohler is not a publicly traded company, the number of shares floating were minimal. Kohler offered $55,400 per share, but some shareholders challenged this valuation and sued.
The IRS also challenged this valuation by prosecuting the estate of Frederick Kohler, who had recently died holding 975 shares. Kohler won the lawsuit against the IRS.https://www.judicialview.com/Court-Cases/Business-Valuation/IRS-Over-Values-Interest-in-Kohler-Company-by-$100-Million-Dollars/Tax-Court-Rejects-IRS-Claim-for-$64.4-Million/53/256

==Products==

Kohler's bath and kitchen fixtures are available in American hardware and home improvement stores and from kitchen and bath distributors. Kohler still makes traditional cast iron bathtubs, one of the few United States manufacturers to do so. Besides residential products, Kohler manufactures a commercial line of bathroom fixtures. The company also does artistic custom work, such as hand-painted sinks and toilets.
Kohler also makes a wide range of small industrial engines. Traditionally, the company manufactured gasoline engines, however after purchasing Lombardini company (Italy), it extended its range and now offers diesel engines up to 65HP. In 2007, Kohler created a joint venture in China called Kohler-YinXiang Ltd., based in Chongqing, China, to manufacture small gasoline engines, and intends to begin importing more of their engines, rather than building them in the USA.http://rermag.com/generators_pumps/kohler-jv-chinese-engine-maker/http://www.kohlerengines.com/about/landing.htm
Kohler engines power a range of devices from water pumps to off-road vehicles. The Global Power group manufactures generators ranging in size from 8,500 watts to 2.8 megawatts. Kohler was the first company to offer residential back-up generators to consumers, starting in 1920.[tpl]cite book| last=Blodgett |first=Richard |title=A Sense of Higher Design-The Kohlers of Kohler |year=2003[/tpl]

==Discriminatory Hiring Practices==

In 1999, a court case was brought by the U.S. Labor Department against the Kohler Company due to hiring practices that were found to be discriminatory to women.http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/esa/archive/esa99268.htm The company had an informal height requirement of 5'4" for women, which is the average adult female height in the United States.Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults 2003â€“2006 Because of its contracts with the federal government, the Kohler Company was prohibited from such discriminatory hiring practices.http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/qanda.html The company agreed as part of the settlement to hire 111 of the 2,000 women who had applied to work at Kohler from 1994 to 1995, and to undertake a study "to eliminate unnecessary barriers to women."
