==Political philosophy==

Cowen has written papers in political philosophy and ethics: for example, he co-wrote a paper with the philosopher Derek Parfit, arguing against the social discount rate.'Against the social discount rate', Derek Parfit and Tyler Cowen, in Peter Laslett & James S. Fishkin (eds.) Justice between age groups and generations, Yale University Press: New Haven, 1992, pp. 144–161. A recent paper has argued that the epistemic problem fails to refute consequentialist forms of argument.The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute Consequentialism, Tyler Cowen, Utilitas (2006), 18: 383–399 Cowen has been described as a "libertarian bargainer", someone of moderate libertarian ideals who can influence practical policy making.Klein, Daniel B. "Mere Libertarianism: Blending Hayek and Rothbard". Reason Papers. Vol. 27: Fall 2004. In a 2007 article entitled "The Paradox of Libertarianism," Cowen argued that libertarians "should embrace a world with growing wealth, growing positive liberty, and yes, growing government. We don’t have to favor the growth in government per se, but we do need to recognize that sometimes it is a package deal". His argument was subsequently criticized by Bryan Caplan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/03/worst_advice_to.html |title=EconLog, Worst Advice to Libertarians Ever?, Bryan Caplan: Library of Economics and Liberty |publisher=Econlog.econlib.org |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl] Justin Raimondo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=10682 |title=Libertarianism and the Great Divide- by Justin Raimondo |publisher=Antiwar.com |accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl] Christopher Westley,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/westley/westley22.html |title=The Real Libertarian Paradox by Christopher Westley |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl] and Doug MacKenzie.[tpl]cite web|author=D.
