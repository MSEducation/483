==Background and composition==

After the success of her debut single "Locomotion" in Australia, Minogue traveled to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote "I Should Be So Lucky" in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio.[tpl]Cite episode |title=I Should Be So Lucky |series=Love is in the Air |station=ABC Television |airdate=2003-11-02 |language=English[/tpl] Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response to what he had learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, there must be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours.

So the song became a beloved secret, and I never bothered to try to tune my friends in on “I Could Be So Lucky”, or, crazier yet, proclaim that this “has-been” would be a critical and commercial darling in a few years time." However, he did say the song was cliché. However, Mark Edwards from Stylus Magazine gave it a scathing remark by saying "Listening to the first tracks on Ultimate Kylie, you want to skip straight through, because early songs like “I Should Be So Lucky” and “Locomotion” are unlistenable—horribly naff, squeaky songs" and criticized Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs they produced in the 80's by stating "songs transport the listener back to a time when every single in the UK charts was either written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman or sung by an Aussie soap star, or both."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=2567 |title=Kylie Minogue - Ultimate Kylie - Review |publisher=Stylus Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl] OK! called the song a "classic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/music/view/50274/Kylie-The-Best-Of-Kylie-Minogue/ |title=Kylie: The Best Of Kylie Minogue | OK!
