It is native to Asia, where it is distributed from Turkey to Pakistan. It is one of several genera in "the Filago group," and some authors include it within the genus Filago.Galbany-Casals, M., et al. (2010). How many of Cassini anagrams should there be?

This is an annual herb coated with appressed gray hairs. The stem is very short and the branches extend outward, making the plant squat in stature, sometimes forming a patch on the ground. The alternately arranged leaves are linear. The disc-shaped flower heads are clustered in glomerules 1 or 2 centimeters wide. There are layers of tiny woolly phyllaries around the flower head. It contains usually 4 tubular florets each no more than 1.5 millimeters long.Cymbolaena griffithii. Flora of Pakistan. Cypselas from bisexual florets have deciduous white pappi, and those from female florets lack pappi.Abid, R. and M. Qaiser. (2008).

The genus name Cymbolaena is a partial anagram of Bombycilaena.
