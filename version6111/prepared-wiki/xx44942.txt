==Name==

The name Phar Lap derives from the common Zhuang and Thai word for lightning: ฟ้าแลบ [tpl]IPA-th|fáː lɛ̂p|[/tpl], lit. 'sky flash'.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp|title=Lightning |work=Phar Lap: Australia's wonder horse |publisher=Museum Victoria accessdate=2009-04-24[/tpl]
Phar Lap was called the "Wonder Horse", "Red Terror", "Bobby" and "Big Red" (the latter nickname was also given to two of the greatest US racehorses, Man o' War and Secretariat).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mountainhomeplace.com/bobby.htm |title=Phar Lap called Bobby round the stables |publisher=Mountainhomeplace.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] He was sometimes referred as "Australia's wonder horse".[tpl]cite web | title = Phar Lap | publisher = Museum Victoria | url = http://museumvictoria.com.au/PharLap/ | accessdate = 2009-04-24[/tpl]
According to the Museum Victoria, Aubrey Ping, a medical student at the University of Sydney, suggested "farlap" as the horse's name. Ping knew the word from his father, a Zhuang-speaking Chinese immigrant. Telford liked the name, but changed the F to PH to create a seven letter word, which was split in two in keeping with the dominant naming pattern of Melbourne Cup winners.[tpl]cite web|author=Museum Victoria |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp |title=Background to the naming of Phar Lap – Museum of Victoria |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl]

==Early life==

A chestnut gelding, Phar Lap was foaled on 4 October 1926 in Seadown near Timaru in the South Island of New Zealand. He was sired by Night Raid from Entreaty by Winkie. He was by the same sire as the Melbourne Cup winner Nightmarch. Phar Lap was a brother to seven other horses, Fortune's Wheel, Nea Lap (won 5 races), Nightguard, All Clear, Friday Night, Te Uira and Raphis, none of which won a principal (stakes) race. He was a half-brother to another four horses, only two of which were able to win any races at all.Pring, Peter; Analysis of Champion Racehorses, The Thoroughbred Press, Sydney, 1977, ISBN 0-908133-00-6
Sydney trainer Harry Telford persuaded American businessman David J. Davis to buy the colt at auction, based on his pedigree. Telford's brother Hugh, who lived in New Zealand, was asked to bid up to 190 guineas at the 1928 Trentham Yearling Sales. When the horse was obtained for a mere 160 guineas, he thought it was a great bargain until the colt arrived in Australia. The horse was gangly, his face was covered with warts, and he had an awkward gait. Davis was furious when he saw the colt as well, and refused to pay to train the horse. Telford had not been particularly successful as a trainer, and Davis was one of his few remaining owners. To placate Davis, he agreed to train the horse for nothing, in exchange for a two-thirds share of any winnings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?ExhibitID=0x000a3af4&ExhibitionID=0x000a39ba&Language=English&dumbyparam=search|title=Phar Lap (1926–1932)|publisher=Te Papa|page=2|accessdate=2009-04-24[/tpl] Telford leased the horse for three years and was eventually sold joint ownership by Davis.
Although standing a winning racehorse at stud could be quite lucrative, Telford gelded Phar Lap anyway, hoping the colt would concentrate on racing.

==Racing career==

Phar Lap finished last in the first race and did not place in his next three races. He won his first race on 27 April 1929, the Maiden Juvenile Handicap at Rosehill, ridden by Jack Baker of Armidale, a 17-year-old apprentice.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sydneyracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=408 |title=Jack Baker rode himself into Australian racing history |author=Phil Purser | accessdate = 2007-07-30 [/tpl] He didn't race for several months but was then entered in a series of races, in which he moved up in class. Phar Lap took second in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick on 14 September 1929 and the racing community started treating him with respect.
As his achievements grew, there were some who tried to halt his progress. Criminals tried to shoot Phar Lap[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pharlap.com.au/thestory |title= The Phar Lap Story |author= | accessdate = 2009-04-20 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4215656?searchTerm= |title=Shot fired at Phar Lap |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=3 November 1930 |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] on the morning of Saturday 1 November 1930 after he had finished track work. They missed, and later that day he won the Melbourne Stakes, and three days later the Melbourne Cup as odds-on favourite at 8 to 11.[tpl]cite web |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=70426&term=Phar+Lap|title= Collections:Phar Lap|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewar | accessdate = 2009-04-20 [/tpl]
In the four years of his racing career, Phar Lap won 37 of 51 races he entered, including the Melbourne Cup, being ridden by Jim Pike, in 1930 with 9 st 12 lb (61.5 kg, or 138 lbs).[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16728295?searchTerm= |title=Phar Lap wins the cup |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=5 November 1930 |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] In that year and 1931, he won 14 races in a row. From his win as a three-year-old in the VRC St. Leger Stakes until his final race in Mexico, Phar Lap won 32 of 35 races. In the three races that he did not win, he ran second on two occasions, beaten by a short head and a neck, and in the 1931 Melbourne Cup he finished eighth when carrying 10 st 10 lb (68 kg).
Phar Lap at the time was owned by American businessman David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest purse ever raced for in North America. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5 kg) and was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides.[tpl]cite news|last=Moriarty |first=Richard |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20655125-662,00.html |title=Blame 'The Brazilian' |publisher=News.com.au |date=28 October 2006 |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.

==Death==

Early on 5 April 1932, the horse's strapper for the North American visit, Tommy Woodcock, found him in severe pain and having a high temperature. Within a few hours, Phar Lap haemorrhaged to death. Much speculation ensued, and when a necropsy revealed that the horse's stomach and intestines were inflamed, many believed the horse had been deliberately poisoned. There have been alternative theories, including accidental poisoning from lead insecticide and a stomach condition. It was not until the 1980s that the infection could be formally identified.
In 2000, equine specialists studying the two necropsies concluded that Phar Lap probably died of duodenitis-proximal jejunitis, an acute bacterial gastroenteritis.[tpl]cite book |title=Melbourne Cup 1930 |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Geoff Armstrong and Peter Thompson |year=2000 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location= |isbn=978-1-74114-750-6 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
However, in 2006 Australian Synchrotron Research scientists said it was almost certain Phar Lap was poisoned with a large single dose of arsenic in the hours before he died, perhaps supporting the theory that Phar Lap was killed on the orders of U.S. gangsters, who feared the Melbourne-Cup-winning champion would inflict big losses on their illegal bookmakers.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1770876.htm |title=Phar Lap poisoned, scientists say |publisher=ABC News Online |date=23 October 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37027569 |title=PHAR LAP WAS POISONED. |newspaper=The Courier-Mail (Brisbane, Qld. : 1933–1954) |location=Brisbane, Qld. |date=19 September 1936 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] No real evidence of involvement by a criminal element exists, however.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/2278343.htm |title=Catalyst (2008 report on arsenic death of Phar Lap) |publisher=ABC News Online |date=19 June 2008 [/tpl]
Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes believes poisoning did not cause the death. He said "In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution (Fowler's Solution)," and suggests this was the cause of the high levels. "It was so common that I'd reckon 90 per cent of the horses had arsenic in their system."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1771619.htm |title=Phar Lap arsenic claims premature: expert |publisher=ABC News Online |date=23 October 2006 [/tpl] In December 2007 Phar Lap's mane was tested to find if he was given repeated doses of arsenic which, if found, would point to accidental poisoning.
On 19 June 2008, the Melbourne Museum released the findings of the forensic investigation conducted by Dr. Ivan Kempson, University of South Australia, and Dermot Henry, Natural Science Collections at Museum Victoria. Dr. Kempson took six hairs from Phar Lap’s mane and analyzed them at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. These high resolution x-rays detect arsenic in hair samples, showing the specific difference "between arsenic, which had entered the hair cells via the blood and arsenic, which had infused the hair cells by the taxidermy process when he was stuffed and mounted at the museum".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/its-official-phar-lap-was-poisoned/2008/06/19/1213770778284.html |title=Sydney Morning Herald: It's official, Phar Lap was poisoned |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Kempson I, Henry D |title=Synchrotron Radiation Reveals Arsenic Poisoning and Metabolism in Hair: The Case of Phar Lap |journal=Angew. Chemie – Int. Ed. |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/anie.200906594[/tpl]
Kempson and Henry discovered that in the 30 to 40 hours before Phar Lap’s death, the horse ingested a massive dose of arsenic. "We can't speculate where the arsenic came from, but it was easily accessible at the time," Henry said.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/rah/news?slug=ap-australia-pharlap&prov=ap&type=lgns |title=Yahoo! Sports: Phar Lap died of arsenic poisoning |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl]
However, in October 2011 the Sydney Morning Herald published an article in which a New Zealand physicist and information from Phar Lap's strapper state that the great horse was never given any tonic with arsenic and that he died of an infection.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/horseracing/phar-lap-poisoning-theory-down-the-drain-20111030-1mqh4.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Phar Lap poisoning theory down the drain[/tpl] Said Dr. Putt, "Unless we are prepared to say that Tommy Woodcock was a downright liar, which even today, decades after the loveable and respected horseman's death, would ostracise us with the Australian racing public, we must accept him on his word. The ineluctable conclusion we are left with, whether we like it or not, is that Phar Lap's impeccable achievements here and overseas were utterly tonic, stimulant and drug free." Contradictory to this though is the tonic book of Harry Telford, Phar Lap’s owner and trainer, and is on display in Museum Victoria, Melbourne. One recipe for a “general tonic” has a main ingredient of arsenic and has written below it: “A great tonic for all horses”.http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/1373916/tonic-book-harry-telford-phar-lap-1930s Several theories have been proposed as to how Phar Lap came to consume such a large amount of arsenic. The source is unlikely to ever be determined.

==Cultural impact==

Following his death, Phar Lap's heart was donated to the Institute of Anatomy in Canberra and his skeleton to the New Zealand's National Museum in Wellington. After preparations of the hide by a New York City taxidermist, his stuffed body was placed in the Australia Gallery at Melbourne Museum. The hide and the skeleton were put on exhibition together when Wellington's Te Papa Museum lent the skeleton to the Melbourne Museum in September 2010 as part of celebrations for the 150th running of the 2010 Melbourne Cup.
Phar Lap's heart was remarkable for its size, weighing 6.2 kg (13.6 lbs), compared with a normal horse's heart at 3.2 kg. Now held at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, it is the object visitors most often request to see.
Several books and films have featured Phar Lap, including the 1983 film Phar Lap, and the song "Phar Lap—Farewell To You".
Phar Lap was one of five inaugural inductees into both the Australian Racing Hall of Fame and New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Phar Lap was ranked No. 22.
The horse is considered to be a national icon in both Australia and New Zealand.[tpl]cite web | title = Sportsmen and women ( ... and a horse and a boat). | work = Australian Government | publisher = Australian High Commission – New Zealand | url = http://www.australia.org.nz/wltn/OzK_Sports.html | accessdate = 2009-04-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pharlap.org.nz/index.html |title=Phar Lap's return to Timaru |work=The Phar Lap Trust |accessdate=25 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/955cbeae7df9460dca256c8c00152d2b/071f621f40e42175ca25708f000b46da!OpenDocument |title=Minister promotes Spring Racing Carnival in New Zealand |work=From the Minister for Racing, Minister for tourism|accessdate=27 April 2009[/tpl] In 1978 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Posthttp://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0012460.jpg and features in the Australian citizenship test.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org.au/articles/index.htm?article_id=159 |title=Just how Australian are you? |publisher=Democrats.org.au |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] A $500,000 life-sized bronze memorial to Phar Lap was unveiled on 25 November 2009 near his birthplace at Timaru.
