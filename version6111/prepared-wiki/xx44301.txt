==Overview==

Set in suburban Columbus, Ohio during the early years of the Reagan administration, Steven and Elyse Keaton (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter-Birney) are baby boomers, liberals and former Hippies, raising their three children: Alex (Michael J. Fox), Mallory (Justine Bateman) and Jennifer (Tina Yothers). Married in 1964, Elyse is an independent architect and Steven, a native of Buffalo, New York, is the station manager of WKS, a local public television station. The couple later have a fourth child, Andrew (Brian Bonsall).
According to the season one episode, "A Christmas Story", Steven and Elyse were influenced by John F. Kennedy and became members of the Peace Corps following their marriage in 1964. Alex was born in 1965 in Africa. Mallory was born while Elyse and Steven were students at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967, and Jennifer was born the night Richard Nixon won his second term in 1972.
Much of the humor of the series focuses on the cultural divide during the 1980s when younger generations rejected the counterculture of the 1960s and embraced the conservative politics which came to define the 1980s.What he left behind: From Tom Clancy to Alex P.

Jennifer, an athletic tomboy and the youngest child, shares the values of her parents and just wants to be a normal kid. Steven and Elyse have a fourth child, Andrew, born in 1984 whom Alex doted on and quickly molded in his conservative image.

Media critic Ben Shapiro has stated that, based on his interview with Gary David Goldberg, the show was an unintentional comic reversal of All in the Family (which had conservative parents and liberal kids). Goldberg didn't plan it that way, but discovered that later as a happy accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mattlewis.org/?p=5934 |title=Matt Lewis Show: Ben Shapiro « Matt Lewis |publisher=Mattlewis.org |date=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
