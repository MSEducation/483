CATEGORIES: Polyforms

In recreational mathematics, a polystick (or polyedge) is a polyform with a line segment (a 'stick') as the basic shape. Polysticks result when identical line segments are joined together end-to-end at 0° or 90° angles.
The possible different polysticks, not including rotations and reflections, include:
The following diagram shows the (free) polysticks of sizes 1 through 4, including the 1 monostick (red), 2 disticks (green), 5 tristicks (blue), and 16 tetrasticks (black).
