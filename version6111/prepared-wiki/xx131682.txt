[[Banana bag]]

CATEGORIES: Intravenous fluids

A banana bag (or rally pack) is a bag of IV fluids containing vitamins and minerals. The bags typically contain thiamine, folic acid, and 3 grams of magnesium sulfate, and are usually used to replenish nutritional deficiencies or correct a chemical imbalance in the human body. The multi-vitamin solution has a yellow color, hence the term "banana bag".

==Composition==

The typical composition of a banana bag is 1 liter of normal saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) with:
The solution is typically infused over four to eight hours or as per physician's orders.

==Uses==

Banana bags are used in the Intensive Care Unit to correct acute magnesium deficiencies. They are stated to be beneficial for patients with terminal illness because magnesium can mitigate nerve pain and relieve muscle pain and cramps.
They are most often used for alcoholics who need thiamine to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Chronic alcoholics can suffer significant whole-body magnesium deficiencies.[tpl]cite book|title=Principles of Psychopharmacology for Mental Health Professionals|author=Jeffrey E Kelsey, D Jeffrey Newport, and Charles B Nemeroff|chapter=Alcohol Use Disorders|pages=196â€“197|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2006|isbn=0-471-79462-7|isbn=978-0-471-79462-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Introduction to Emergency Medicine|editor=Elizabeth Mitchell and Ron Medzon|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2005|isbn=0-7817-3200-X|isbn=978-0-7817-3200-0|chapter=Acute and Chronic Alcohol Intoxication|author=Merle A.
