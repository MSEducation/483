The McGregor Memorial Conference Center is an office building located at 495 Ferry Mall, on the campus of Wayne State University in Midtown Detroit, Michigan. The building was Minoru Yamasaki's first commission following his trip to Japan and re-envisionment of architectural design.

==History==

The McGregor Memorial Conference Center was funded by the McGregor Fund, as a memorial to Tracy W. and Katherine McGregor who initiated the fund in 1925. The McGregor Fund specified that the building be used as "a community conference center for groups of citizens interested in exploring ways and means of being helpful to others." To that end, Wayne State University hired architect Minoru Yamasaki in August 1955 to design the building.[tpl]cite journal| title = Art: The Road to Xanadu| periodical=Time| date=Jan 18, 1963| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874696-7,00.html[/tpl] The commission came after Yamasaki's long convalescence and subsequent trip to Japan, and was his first opportunity to put into practice his re-envisionment of architecture. The Center was completed in 1958, and opened to immediate accolades from architectural magazines who called it "delightful" and "refreshing," and from the American Institute of Architects who awarded Yamasaki a First Honor Award for the design.[tpl]cite web| title=McGregor Memorial Conference Center| publisher=Wayne State University| url= http://busop.wayne.edu/mcgregor.php| accessdate=December 30, 2010[/tpl] Over the next seven years, Yamasaki designed three more buildings for Wayne's campus: the Education Building, Prentis Hall, and DeRoy Auditorium.[tpl]cite press release| title=Inaugural Minoru Yamasaki lecture will highlight legendary history and design of several Wayne State University buildings| publisher=Wayne State University| date=November 1, 2010| url= http://www.media.wayne.edu/2010/11/01/inaugural-minoru-yamasaki-lecture-will-highlight-legendary| accessdate=December 30, 2010[/tpl]
