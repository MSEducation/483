The Wolfe Tone Societies ([tpl]lang-ga|Muintir Wolfe Tone[/tpl]National Archives Ireland – Tuairisc: The news-letter of the Wolfe Tone Society, Number One) evolved from the commemorative Directories which the IRA helped set up in 1963 to mark the bicentenary of the 1763 birth of Wolfe Tone.English p85 In 1964 the Directories were dissolved and replaced with the Wolfe Tone Society.

==History==

In 1963 to celebrate the bi-centenary of Wolfe Tone's birth, Irish republicans formed the Wolfe Tone Bi-centenary Directories. Due to the support shown at the commemoration, it was decided at a meeting of the Directories in Dublin, July 1964, to disband the Directories and replace it with the "Muintir Wolfe Tone", or Wolfe Tone Society.CAIN – Century of Endeavour
One of the key intellectuals who joined the societies was Roy Johnston, of Protestant background. He sought to encourage Protestants in Northern Ireland to support the nationalist cause.English pp85-86
This organisation decided that it should focus on trying to "influence cultural and political trends in the country" and using democratic means to weaken the Unionist government of Northern Ireland.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Its main bases of strength were in Belfast and Dublin.CAIN – "We Shall Overcome" ....

==Objectives==

Upon its creation, the Wolfe Tone Society declared that its aim was to further the creation of a united, independent, democratic Irish
Republic as declared in the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic. To achieve this it would focus on trying to convince the people of Ireland to support its creation, via meetings, publications and other means. To help promote its message, the organisation published a newsletter called Tuairisc.
