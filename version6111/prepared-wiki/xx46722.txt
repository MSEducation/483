==History and names==

The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century; the recipe mentions soaking in milk, but not egg, and gives it no special name, just aliter dulcia "another sweet dish".Joseph Dommers Vehling, trans., Apicius: Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome, Book VII, chapter 13, recipe 296 full text at Gutenberg There is a 14th-century German recipe under the name "Arme Ritter" "poor knights",Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch, quoting from the Buch von guter Spyse a name also used in the Scandinavian languages.
In the 14th century, Taillevent presents a recipe for "tostées dorées".Jérôme Pichon, Georges Vicaire, Le Viandier de Guillaume Tirel dit Taillevent, 1892 p. 262
There are 15th-century English recipes for "pain perdu"T. Austin, Two 15th-century Cookery-books, 1888, quoting a 1450 recipe, quoted in the Oxford English Dictionary (French for "lost wasted bread", suggesting that the dish is a use for bread which has gone stale).
Various versions of French toast under a variety of names—"suppe dorate", "soupys yn dorye", etc.—were prepared throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. They were sometimes served with game birds.Odile Redon, et al., The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy, 2000, p. 207f An Austrian and Bavarian term is "Pavese", perhaps related to a kind of wooden shield or to zuppa pavese, both referring to Pavia, Italy.

==Preparation and serving==

Slices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often with milk or cream. The slices of egg-coated bread are then fried on both sides until they are browned and cooked through.  Day-old bread is often recommended by chefs because the stale bread will soak up more egg mixture without falling apart.[tpl]cite web|last=Alton|first=Brown|title=French Toast-Food Network|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4frrEw_AL8[/tpl]
The cooked slices are often topped with jam, marmalade, butter, nut butter, honey, Marmite, Vegemite, maple syrup, golden syrup, fruit flavored syrup, molasses, apple sauce, baked beans, whipped cream, fruit, chocolate, Nutella, sugar, yogurt, powdered sugar, bacon, treacle, tomato ketchup, cheese, cold cooked meats, ice cream, gravy, various nuts, or other similar toppings.

==Pain perdu==

In France, Belgium, New Orleans, Acadiana and the Congo, French toast is called pain perdu, which means "lost bread" in French. It is called "lost bread" because it is a way to reclaim stale or "lost" bread. The hard bread is softened by dipping in a mixture of milk and eggs, and then fried.[tpl]cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan |last2=Jaine |first2=Tom |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |page=102 |isbn=0-19-280681-5[/tpl] The bread is sliced on a bias and dipped into a mixture of egg, milk, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. The slices are pan-fried in butter and traditionally dusted with powdered sugar and served with jam or syrup on the side.
In New Orleans, pain perdu is a local variation of French toast and often shows up on menus as "Lost Bread". It is made from leftover New Orleans–style French bread. The bread resembles a French baguette, but has a crunchier exterior and a lighter interior and is usually fried in oil. It is eaten for breakfast in New Orleans.
In France, pain perdu is considered to be a dessert, a breakfast as well as an afternoon tea snack ("goûter").[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Wikipedia article about the pain perdu
