Estadio Agustín "Coruco" Díaz is a football (soccer) stadium named in honour of a local player named Agustín "Coruco" Díaz. It has a capacity of 16,000 seatswww.fussballtempel.net and is home to the team Cañeros de Zacatepec.
This stadium is one of the oldest in Mexico and its origins can be traced back to 1948. It is located in Zacatepec, Morelos. The official opening of this stadium was in November 1954. This stadium is nicknamed the Selva Cañera ("Sugar Cane Jungle") because of the tropical weather that distinguish the municipality of Zacatepec. There was a very famous player and later coach named Ignacio Trelles, who ordered to irrigate the field one hour before the soccer match, leading to a very strong vaporization and an increase of the  temperature to near 40 Celsius (more or less 100 Fahrenheit), that was very hard for the visitor squads. Another oddity of this building is that is it located very central in the town of Zacatepec and beside the sugar cane refineries.
