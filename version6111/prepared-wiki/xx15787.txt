The Governor General of Canada (French masculine: Gouverneur général du Canada, or feminine: Gouverneure générale du Canada) is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. Because the person of the sovereign is shared equally both with the 15 other Commonwealth realms and the 10 provinces of Canada and resides predominantly in her oldest realm, the United Kingdom, she, on the advice of the Canadian prime minister,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and Canada > The Queen's role in Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=2 June 2009[/tpl] appoints the governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties. The commission is for an unfixed period of time—known as serving at Her Majesty's pleasure—though five years is the normal convention. Beginning in 1959, it is also traditional to rotate between anglophone and francophone incumbents. Once in office, the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen, wherever she may be at the time.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/GovGenCan.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=Queen and Canada: The role of the Governor-General| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=28 May 2009[/tpl]

==Spelling of title==

The Government of Canada spells the title governor general without a hyphen. The Canadian media still often use the governor-general spelling. 
As governor is the main noun in the title, it is the term that is pluralized; thus, it is governors general, rather than governor generals. Moreover, both terms are  capitalized when used in the formal title preceding an incumbent's name.

==Appointment==

The position of governor general is mandated by both the Constitution Act (previously the British North America Act), 1867, and the letters patent issued in 1947 by King George VI.[tpl]Citation| last=George VI| author-link=George VI of the United Kingdom| publication-date=1 October 1947| title=Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General of Canada| series=I| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=King's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/LettersPatent.html| accessdate=29 May 2009| year=1947| ref=harv[/tpl] As such, on the recommendation of his or her Canadian prime minister, the Canadian monarch appoints the governor general by commission issued under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada.

Besides the administration of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a governor general-designate. Though there may therefore be variations to the following, the appointee will generally travel to Ottawa, there receiving an official welcome and taking up residence at 7 Rideau Gate,[tpl]cite journal| last=Fidelis| title=The Installation of the Governor General in 2005: Innovation and Evolution?| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Fall-Winter 2005| issue=24| page=4| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2005| url= http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/AutumnWinter_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and will begin preparations for their upcoming role, meeting with various high level officials to ensure a smooth transition between governors general. The sovereign will also hold an audience with the appointee and will at that time induct both the governor general-designate and his or her spouse into the Order of Canada as Companions, as well as appointing the former as a Commander of both the Order of Military Merit and the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (should either person not have already received either of those honours).
The swearing-in ceremony begins with the arrival at 7 Rideau Gate of one of the ministers of the Crown, who then accompanies the governor general-designate to Parliament Hill, where a Canadian Forces Guard of Honour (consisting of the Army Guard, Royal Canadian Air Force Guard, and Flag Party of the Royal Canadian Navy) awaits to give a general salute. From there, the party is led by the Queen's parliamentary messenger—the Usher of the Black Rod—to the Senate chamber, wherein all justices of the Supreme Court, senators, members of parliament, and other guests are assembled. The Queen's commission for the governor general-designate is then read aloud by the Secretary to the Governor General and the required oaths are administered to the appointee by either the chief justice or one of the puisne justices of the Supreme Court; the three oaths are: the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Office as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief, and the Oath as Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada. With the affixing of their signature to these three solemn promises, the individual is officially the governor general, and at that moment the Flag of the Governor General of Canada is raised on the Peace Tower, the Viceregal Salute is played by the Central Band of the Canadian Forces, and a 21-gun salute is conducted by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. The governor general is seated on the throne while a prayer is read, and then receives the Great Seal of Canada (which is passed to the registrar general for protection),[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=8&lan=eng| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Media > Fact Sheets > The Great Seal of Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=30 May 2009[/tpl] as well as the chains of both the Chancellor of the Order of Canada and of the Order of Military Merit.[tpl]cite journal| title=Adrienne Clarkson Installed as Governor General| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Autumn 1999| issue=3| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1999| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/1999/installed.htm| accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The governor general will then give a speech, outlining whichever cause or causes he or she will champion during his or her time as viceroy.
The incumbent will generally serve for at least five years, though this is only a developed convention, and the governor general still technically acts at Her Majesty's pleasure (or the Royal Pleasure).[tpl]Cite news| date=27 September 2005| periodical=Canada Gazette| volume=Extra 139| issue=8| contribution=Part I| page=1| contribution-url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/SP2-3-139-8.pdf| accessdate=2 June 2009[/tpl] The prime minister may therefore recommend to the Queen that the viceroy remain in her service for a longer period of time, sometimes upwards of more than seven years.[tpl]#tag:ref|Georges Vanier acted as governor general between 15 September 1959 and 5 March 1967, and Roland Michener served for just under seven years, from 17 April 1967 to 14 January 1974.|group=n|name=Term1[/tpl] A governor general may also resign,[tpl]#tag:ref|Roméo LeBlanc resigned the viceregal post in 1999 due to health concerns.|group=n|name=Term2[/tpl] and two have died in office.[tpl]#tag:ref|The Lord Tweedsmuir died at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital on 11 February 1940, and Georges Vanier died at Rideau Hall on 5 March 1967.|group=n|name=Term3[/tpl] In such a circumstance, or if the governor general leaves the country for longer than one month, the Chief Justice of Canada (or, if that position is vacant or unavailable, the senior puisne justice of the Supreme Court) serves as Administrator of the Government and exercises all powers of the governor general.[tpl]#tag:ref|The only individuals to serve as administrators due to the deaths of governors general were Chief Justice Sir Lyman Poore Duff in 1940 and Chief Justice Robert Taschereau in 1967.|group=n|name=Admin[/tpl]

===Selection===

In a speech on the subject of confederation, made in 1866 to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, John A. Macdonald said of the planned governor: "We place no restriction on Her Majesty's prerogative in the selection of her representative... The sovereign has unrestricted freedom of choice... We leave that to Her Majesty in all confidence."[tpl]Cite book| last=Copeland| first=Lewis| coauthors=Lamm, Lawrence W.; McKenna, Stephen J.| title=The World's Great Speeches| publisher=Courier Dover Publications| year=1999| location=Mineola| page=381| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bmOi8a9V14sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=978-0-486-40903-0[/tpl] However, between 1867 and 1931, governors general were appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British Cabinet. Thereafter, in accordance with the Statute of Westminster 1931, the appointment was made by the sovereign with the direction of his or her Canadian ministers only. Until 1952, all were also either members of the Peerage or sons of peers and were born beyond Canada's borders. These viceroys spent a relatively limited time in Canada, but their travel schedules were so extensive that they could "learn more about Canada in five years than many Canadians in a lifetime."[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| p=145[/tpl] Still, though all Canadian nationals were as equally British subjects as their British counterparts prior to the implementation of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947, the idea of Canadian-born persons being appointed governor general was raised as early as 1919, when, at the Paris Peace Conference, Canadian prime minister Robert Borden consulted with Prime Minister of South Africa Louis Botha and the two agreed that the viceregal appointees should be long-term residents of their respective Dominions.[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| p=147[/tpl] Calls for just such an individual to be made viceroy came again in the late 1930s,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=55| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Governor General > Former Governors General > Major General The Earl of Athlone| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl] but it was not until Vincent Massey's appointment by King George VI in 1952 that the position was filled by a Canadian-born individual. Massey stated of this that "a Canadian governor general makes it far easier to look on the Crown as our own and on the Sovereign as Queen of Canada."[tpl]Citation| last=Trepanier| first=Peter| editor-last=Coates| editor-first=Colin M.| publication-date=2006| title=Majesty in Canada| contribution=A Not Unwilling Subject: Canada and Her Queen| publisher=Dundurn Press| publication-place=Hamilton| page=143| isbn=9781550025866| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FhFyvhpPx8MC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl] This practice continued until 1999, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative Adrienne Clarkson, a Hong Kong-born refugee to Canada. Moreover, the practice of alternating between anglophone and francophone Canadians was instituted with the appointment of Georges Vanier, a francophone who succeeded the anglophone Massey. All persons whose names are put forward to the Queen for approval must first undergo background checks by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.[tpl]Cite news| last=LeBlanc| first=Daniel| title=Martin defends viceregal couple's loyalty| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=13 August 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050812.wxlafond13/BNStory/National/| accessdate=22 February 2009| location=Toronto[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=New governor general must clarify sovereignty position, premiers say| publisher=CBC| date=12 August 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/12/jean-sovereignty050812.html| accessdate=12 August 2005| deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
Although required by the tenets of constitutional monarchy to be nonpartisan while in office, governors general were frequently former politicians; a number held seats in the House of Lords by virtue of their inclusion in the peerage. Appointments of former ministers of the Crown in the 1980s and 1990s were criticized by Peter H. Russell, who stated in 2009: "much of the advantage of the monarchical system is lost in Canada when prime ministers recommend partisan colleagues to be appointed governor general and represent Queen."[tpl]Citation| last=Russell| first=Peter H.| author-link=Peter H.

As Canada shares its monarch equally with 15 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, the sovereign has 10 other legal personas within the Canadian federation, and the sovereign lives predominantly outside Canada's borders, the governor general's primary task is to perform the monarch's federal constitutional duties on his or her behalf.

It is also stipulated that the governor general may appoint deputies—usually Supreme Court justices and the Secretary to the Governor General—who can perform some of the viceroy's constitutional duties in her stead,[tpl]Harvnb| George VI| 1947| loc=VII[/tpl] and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (or a puisne justice in the chief justice's absence) will act as the Administrator of the Government upon the death, removal, incapacitation, or absence of the governor general for more than one month.[tpl]Harvnb| George VI| 1947| loc=VIII[/tpl]
It is the governor general who is required by the Constitution Act, 1867, to appoint for life persons to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada,[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=III.11[/tpl] who are all theoretically tasked with tendering to the monarch and viceroy guidance on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. Convention dictates, though, that the governor general must draw from the privy council an individual to act as prime minister—in almost all cases the Member of Parliament who commands the confidence of the House of Commons. The prime minister then directs the governor general to appoint other members of parliament to a committee of the privy council known as the Cabinet, and it is in practice only from this group of ministers of the Crown that the Queen and governor general will take direction on the use of executive power;[tpl]Harvnb| MacLeod| 2008| pp=24, 27[/tpl] an arrangement called the Queen-in-Council or, more specifically, the Governor-in-Council. In this capacity, the governor general will issue royal proclamations and sign orders in council. The Governor-in-Council is also specifically tasked by the Constitution Act, 1867, to appoint in the Queen's name the lieutenant governors of the provinces (with the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments and the premiers of the provinces concerned playing an advisory role),[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=V.58[/tpl] senators,[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.24[/tpl] the Speaker of the Senate,[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.34[/tpl] supreme court justices,[tpl]Cite book| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1985| title=Supreme Court Act| series=4.2| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/S-26/bo-ga:s_4//en#anchorbo-ga:s_4| accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl] and superior and county court judges in each province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VII.96[/tpl] The advice given by the Cabinet is, in order to ensure the stability of government, typically binding; both the Queen and her viceroy, however, may in exceptional circumstances invoke the reserve powers, which remain the Crown's final check against a ministry's abuse of power.[tpl]#tag:ref|See Note 1 at Queen's Privy Council for Canada.|group=n|name=RP[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=1276961&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=37&Ses=3| last=House of Commons| title=The Governor General of Canada: Role, Duties and Funding for Activities| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl]
The governor general alone is also constitutionally mandated to summon parliament. Beyond that, the viceroy carries out the other conventional parliamentary duties in the sovereign's absence, including reading the Speech From the Throne and proroguing and dissolving parliament. The governor general also grants Royal Assent in the Queen's name; legally, he or she has three options: grant Royal Assent (making the bill law), withhold Royal Assent (vetoing the bill), or reserve the bill for the signification of the Queen's pleasure (allowing the sovereign to personally grant or withhold assent).[tpl]Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.55[/tpl] If the governor general withholds the Queen's assent, the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill, thereby annulling the law in question. No modern Canadian viceroy has denied Royal Assent to a bill. Provincial viceroys, however, are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for the governor general; this clause was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.[tpl]Harvnb| MacLeod| 2008| p=25[/tpl]

===Ceremonial role===

With most constitutional functions lent to Cabinet, the governor general acts in a primarily ceremonial fashion. He or she will host members of Canada's royal family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state, and will represent the Queen and country abroad on state visits to other nations,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13288| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Governor General > Role and Responsibilities| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2 June 2009[/tpl] though the monarch's permission is necessary, via the prime minister, for the viceroy to leave Canada.[tpl]Harvnb| George VI| 1947| loc=XIV[/tpl] Also as part of international relations, the governor general issues letters of credence and of recall for Canadian ambassadors and receives the same from foreign ambassadors appointed to Canada.
The governor general is also tasked with fostering national unity and pride.[tpl]Cite news| last=Boyce| first=Peter| year=2008| publication-date=October 2009| contribution=The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand (ISBN 9-781-86287-700-9)| editor-last=Jackson| editor-first=Michael D.| title=The Senior Realms of the Queen| periodical=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Autumn 2009| issue=30| page=10| place=Sydney| publication-place =Toronto| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2009/Autumn_2009_CMN.pdf| accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] One way in which this is carried out is travelling the country and meeting with Canadians from all regions and ethnic groups in Canada, continuing the tradition begun in 1869 by Governor General the Lord Lisgar.[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| p=16[/tpl] He or she will also induct individuals into the various national orders and present national medals and decorations. Similarly, the viceroy administers and distributes the Governor General's Awards, and will also give out awards associated with private organizations, some of which are named for past governors general. During a federal election, the governor general will curtail these public duties, so as not to appear as though they are involving themselves in political affairs.
Although the constitution of Canada states that the "Command-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada, is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen," the governor general acts in her place as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces and is permitted through the 1947 Letters Patent to use the title Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada. The position technically involves issuing commands for Canadian troops, airmen, and sailors, but is predominantly a ceremonial role in which the viceroy will visit Canadian Forces bases across Canada and abroad to take part in military ceremonies, see troops off to and return from active duty, and encourage excellence and morale amongst the forces. The governor general also serves as honorary Colonel of three household regiments: the Governor General's Horse Guards, Governor General's Foot Guards and Canadian Grenadier Guards. This ceremonial position is directly under that of Colonel-in-Chief, which is held by the Queen. Since 1910, the governor general was also always made the Chief Scout for Canada, which was renamed Chief Scout of Canada after 1946 and again in 2011 as Patron Scout.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scouts.ca/ca/management-team/board-governors| title=About > Management Team > Board of Governors| publisher=Scouts Canada| accessdate=2 March 2011[/tpl]

==Symbols and protocol==

As the personal representative of the monarch, the governor general follows only the sovereign in the Canadian order of precedence, preceding even other members of the Royal Family. Though the federal viceroy is considered primus inter pares amongst his or her provincial counterparts, the governor general also outranks the lieutenant governors in the federal sphere; at provincial functions, however, the relevant lieutenant governor, as the Queen's representative in the province, precedes the governor general.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/atc-ac/partic-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > Across Canada > Standards| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=19 June 2009[/tpl] The incumbent governor general and his or her spouse are also the only people in Canada, other than serving Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners, entitled to the use the style His or Her Excellency and the governor general is granted the additional honorific of The Right Honourable for their time in office and for life afterwards.[tpl]Harvnb| Department of National Defence| 1999| pp=11–2[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb| MacLeod| 2008| p=37[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/prtcl/titre-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Table of titles to be used in Canada (as revised on June 18, 1993)| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=21 August 2009[/tpl]
Prior to 1952, all Governors General of Canada were members of the peerage. Typically, individuals appointed as federal viceroy were already a peer, either by inheriting the title, such as the Duke of Devonshire, or by prior elevation by the sovereign in their own right, as was the case with the Viscount Alexander of Tunis. None were life peers, the Life Peerages Act 1958 postdating the beginning of the tradition of appointing Canadian citizens as governor general. John Buchan was, in preparation for his appointment as governor general, made the Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield in the County of Oxford by King George V, six months before Buchan was sworn in as viceroy. The Leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, felt Buchan should serve as governor general as a commoner;[tpl]Cite book| last=Reynolds| first=Louise| title=Mackenzie King: Friends & Lovers| publisher=Trafford Publishing| year=2005| location=Victoria| page=124| url=http://books.google.com/?id=8eZJQJOcTJkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=978-1-4120-5985-5[/tpl] however, George V insisted he be represented by a peer. With the appointment of Vincent Massey as governor general in 1952, governors general ceased to be members of the peerage; successive governments since that date have held to the non-binding and defeated (in 1934) principles of the 1919 Nickle Resolution.

It was not until the splitting in 1791 of the Province of Quebec, to accommodate the influx of United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American revolutionary war, that the king's representative, with a change in title to Governor General, directly governed Lower Canada, while the other three colonies were each administered by a lieutenant governor in his stead.

===Responsible government===

The Rebellions of 1837 brought about great changes to the role of the governor general, prompting, as they did, the British government to grant responsible government to the Canadian provinces.[tpl]Harvnb| MacLeod| 2008| p=7[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/executive-decree/023004-2010-e.html| last=Library and Archives Canada| authorlink=Library and Archives Canada| title=Politics and Government > By Executive Decree > The Executive Branch in Canadian History| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=4 June 2009[/tpl] As a result, the viceroys became largely nominal heads, while the democratically elected legislatures and the premiers they supported exercised the authority belonging to the Crown; a concept first put to the test when in 1849 Governor-General of the Province of Canada and Lieutenant-Governor of Canada East the Earl of Elgin granted Royal Assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, despite his personal misgivings towards the legislation.[tpl]Cite book| last=Mills| first=David| contribution=The Canadian Encyclopedia| title=Law > Acts & Statutes > Rebellion Losses Bill| editor-last=Marsh| editor-first=James Harley| place=Toronto| publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006707| accessdate=4 June 2009[/tpl]
This arrangement continued after the reunification in 1840 of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, and the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. The governor general carried out in Canada all the parliamentary and ceremonial functions of a constitutional monarch—amongst other things, granting Royal Assent, issuing Orders-in-Council, and taking advice from the Canadian privy council.

Macdonald, over the dismissal of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Luc Letellier de St-Just. On the advice of the Colonial Secretary, and to avoid conflict with the cabinet of Canada, the Marquess did eventually concede, and released St-Just from duty.[tpl]Harvnb| MacNutt| 1955| p=47[/tpl] The Governor General of Canada was then in May 1891 called upon to resolve the Dominion's first cabinet crisis, wherein Prime Minister Macdonald died, leaving the Lord Stanley of Preston to select a new prime minister.
As early as 1880, the viceregal family and court attracted minor ridicule from the Queen's subjects: in July of that year, someone under the pseudonym Captain Mac included in a pamphlet called Canada: from the Lakes to the Gulf, a coarse satire of an investiture ceremony at Rideau Hall, in which a retired inn-keeper and his wife undergo the rigorous protocol of the royal household and sprawl on the floor before the Duke of Argyll so as to be granted the knighthood for which they had "paid in cold, hard cash."[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| pp=55–56[/tpl] Later, prior to the arrival of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (the uncle of King George V), to take up the post of governor general, there was a "feeble undercurrent of criticism" centring on worries about a rigid court at Rideau Hall; worries that turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple was actually more relaxed than their predecessors.[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| p=125[/tpl]

===Emerging nationality to an independent kingdom===

During the First World War, into which Canada was drawn due to its association with the United Kingdom, the governor general's role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, Governor General Prince Arthur donned his Field Marshal's uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the Prince's prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on the Military Secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke "laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General."[tpl]Cite book| last=Borden| first=Robert| author-link=Robert Borden| publication-date=1938| editor-last=Borden| editor-first=Henry| title=Memoirs| volume=1| pages=601–602| publication-place=New York| publisher=Macmillan Publishers[/tpl] Prince Arthur's successor, the Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as His Majesty's Loyal Opposition members, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting on the pulse of the nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruchési, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| pp=141–142[/tpl]

In 1926, Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, facing a non-confidence vote in the House of Commons over a scandal in his party, requested that Governor General the Lord Byng of Vimy dissolve parliament and call an election. Byng, however, refused his Canadian prime minister's advice, citing both the facts that King held the minority of seats in the house and that a general election had been held only months earlier; he thus called on Arthur Meighen to form a government. Within a week however, Meighen's Conservative government lost its own non-confidence vote, forcing the Governor General to dissolve parliament and call elections that saw Mackenzie King returned to power.[tpl]cite book| title=Byng of Vimy: General and Governor General| last=Williams| first=Jeffery| year=1983| publisher=Leo Cooper in association with Secker & Warburg| location=Barnsley, S.

===Quebec nationalism and constitutional patriation===

It was in 1952, a mere five days before King George VI's death, that Vincent Massey became the first Canadian-born person to be appointed as a governor general in Canada since the Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal was made Governor General of New France on 1 January 1755, as well as the first not to be elevated to the peerage since Sir Edmund Walker Head in 1854. There was some trepidation about this departure from tradition and Massey was intended to be a compromise: he was known to embody loyalty, dignity, and formality, as expected from a viceroy.[tpl]Cite news| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=The Canadian and the Crown| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| date=February 2002| url=http://www.johnbuchansociety.co.uk/samples/crown.htm| accessdate=19 March 2009[/tpl] As his viceregal tenure neared an end, it was thought that Massey, an anglophone, should be followed by a francophone Canadian; and so, in spite of his Liberal Party attachments, Georges Vanier was chosen by Conservative prime minister John Diefenbaker as the next governor general. Vanier was subsequently appointed by Queen Elizabeth II in person at a meeting of her Canadian Cabinet,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=55| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Governor General > Former Governors General > General The Right Honourable Georges Philias Vanier| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=5 June 2009[/tpl] thus initiating the convention of alternating between individuals from Canada's two main linguistic groups. This move did not, however, placate those who were fostering the new Quebec nationalist movement, for whom the monarchy and other federal institutions were a target for attack. Though Vanier was a native of Quebec and fostered biculturalism, he was not immune to the barbs of the province's sovereigntists and, when he attended la Fête St-Jean-Baptiste in Montreal in 1964, a group of separatists held placards reading "Vanier vendu" ("Vanier sold out") and "Vanier fou de la Reine" ("Vanier Queen's jester").[tpl]Harvnb| Hubbard| 1977| p=233[/tpl]
In light of this regional nationalism and a resultant change in attitudes towards Canadian identity, images and the role of the monarchy were cautiously downplayed, and Vanier's successor, Roland Michener, was the last viceroy to practice many of the office's ancient traditions, such as the wearing of the Windsor uniform, the requirement of court dress for state occasions, and expecting women to curtsey before the governor general.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=55| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Governor General > Former Governors General > The Right Honourable Daniel Roland Michener| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=5 June 2009[/tpl] At the same time, he initiated new practices for the viceroy, including regular conferences with the lieutenant governors and the undertaking of state visits. He presided over Canada's centennial celebrations and the coincidental Expo 67, to which French president Charles de Gaulle was invited.

Clarkson managed to bring the viceregal office back into the collective consciousness of Canadians, winning praise for touring the country more than any of her predecessors, her inspiring speeches, and her dedication to the military in her role as the Commander-in-Chief's representative.[tpl]Cite news| last=Fraser| first=John| author-link=John Fraser (journalist)| title=Excellency| newspaper=National Post| date=1 February 2003| url=http://www.ccmms.ca/clarkson.asp| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| last=Editorial| title=Our Governor General| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2005| issue=23| page=6| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2005| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=28 February 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=Clarkson out of hospital after pacemaker surgery| publisher=CTV| date=11 July 2005| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050711/clarkson_recovering_050710?s_name=tiff2006&no_ads=| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| last=Black| first=Dan| title=The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier| journal=Legion Magazine| volume=September 2000| publisher=Canvet Publications Ltd.| location=Kanata| date=1 September 2000| url=http://www.legionmagazine.com/en/index.php/2000/09/the-tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier/| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Graham| first=Bill| author-link=Bill Graham (Canadian politician)| date=9 December 2004| contribution=Hansard| title=Debate Extracts: Commons Cuts the GG's Budget| periodical=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2005| issue=23| page=9| publication-place=Toronto| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last=Greenway| first=Norma| title=Jean puts imprint on swearing-in| publisher=CanWest News Service| date=27 September 2005| url=http://www2.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=6ec41c75-a3c3-43be-a182-6b8cccd4e8ed| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] This did not come without a cost, however, as the attention also drew widespread criticism of the Governor General's increased spending on state affairs, for which the office was symbolically rebuked by parliament when it voted in favour of cutting by 10% the viceregal budget it had earlier supported,[tpl]cite book| last=McWhinney| first=Edward| authorlink=Ted McWhinney| title=The Governor General and the Prime Ministers| publisher=Ronsdale Press| year=2005| location=Vancouver| page=46| isbn=1-55380-031-1[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=MacKay| first=Peter| author-link=Peter MacKay| date=9 December 2004| contribution=Hansard| title=Debate Extracts: Commons Cuts the GG's Budget| periodical=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2005| issue=23| page=9| publication-place=Toronto| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] as well as for fostering the notion, through various demonstrations, that the governor general was ultimately the Canadian head of state above the Queen herself,[tpl]cite journal| last=Fidelis| title=A Very Alarming Situation: the New Threat to the Canadian Monarchy – What Next?| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2005| issue=23| page=2| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2005| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=28 February 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| last=Editorial| title=Hope for the Monarchy in Canada: The Provincial Crown| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2005| issue=23| page=12| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2005| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf| accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]citation| url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/04/28/john-fraser-when-quebecers-loved-the-crown-and-why-they-stopped/ | last=Fraser| first=John| title=John Fraser: When Quebecers loved the Crown (and why they stopped)| date=28 April 2012| newspaper=National Post| accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl] an approach that was said by Jack Granatstein to have caused "a fury" with the Queen on one occasion in 2004.[tpl]Citation| last=Galloway| first=Gloria| title=Jean to squeeze in trip to China between royal tour hello and goodbye| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=7 June 2010| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jean-to-squeeze-in-trip-to-china-between-royal-tour-hello-and-goodbye/article1595538/| accessdate=7 June 2010| location=Toronto[/tpl] This attitude was not unique to Clarkson, though;

Indeed, international observers opined that the viceroys had been, over the years, making deliberate attempts to distance themselves from the sovereign, for fear of being too closely associated with any "Britishness" the monarch embodied.
Prime Minister Paul Martin followed Chrétien's example and, for Clarkson's successor, put forward to the Queen the name of Michaëlle Jean, who was, like Clarkson, a woman, a refugee, a member of a visible minority, a CBC career journalist, and married to an intellectual husband who worked in the arts.[tpl]Cite news| last=Ibbitson| first=John| author-link=John Ibbitson| title=The remarkable new Governor-General| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=28 September 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050928.wxibbitson28/BNStory/International/| accessdate=7 June 2009| location=Toronto[/tpl] Her appointment initially sparked accusations that she was a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, and it was observed that she had on a few occasions trodden into political matters,[tpl]cite press release| title=Governor General proposes two new options to recognize Constable Garrett| publisher=Office of the Governor General of Canada| date=27 November 2007| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=8| accessdate=12 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Hébert| first=Chantal| author-link=Chantal Hébert| title=Will Jean thwart election call?; | newspaper=Toronto Star| date=27 September 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1159307412136&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795| accessdate=28 September 2006[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Valpy| first=Michael| author-link=Michael Valpy| title='Your biggest problem is Rideau Hall,' top bureaucrat warned Harper| newspaper=Globe and Mail| date=24 April 2007| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070424.JEAN24/TPStory/National| accessdate=1 May 2007| location=Toronto[/tpl] as well as continuing to foster the notion that the governor general had replaced the Queen as head of state, thereby "unbalancing... the federalist symmetry."[tpl]Cite news| last=Gardner| first=Dan| title=Governor General to Dan Gardner: you're right| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| date=13 February 2009| url=http://communities.canada.com/ottawacitizen/blogs/katzenjammer/archive/2009/02/14/governor-general-to-dan-gardner-you-re-right.aspx| accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl] But Jean ultimately won plaudits, particularly for her solidarity with the Canadian Forces and Canada's Aboriginal peoples, as well as her role in the parliamentary dispute that took place between December 2008 and January 2009.[tpl]Cite news| last=Taylor| first=Nathan| title=Stanton defends Harper| newspaper=Packet & Times| date=6 December 2008| url=http://www.orilliapacket.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1333605| accessdate=8 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Dreschel| first=Andrew| title=Jean was right to stave off Bloc coalition| newspaper=Hamilton Spectator| date=5 December 2008| url=http://thespec.com/Opinions/article/477213| accessdate=8 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Wente| first=Margaret| author-link=Margaret Wente| title=That was the weird week that was| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=5 December 2008| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081205.wcowent06/BNStory/politics/home| accessdate=8 December 2008| location=Toronto[/tpl]
With the appointment of David Johnston, a lifelong academic and former University of Waterloo president and vice-chancellor, there was a signalled emphasis for the Governor General to vigorously promote learning and innovation.

Retired governors general usually withdraw from public life or accept diplomatic postings. Edward Schreyer, for instance, was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Australia upon his departure from the viceregal role in 1984, and Michaëlle Jean is currently the UNESCO special envoy to Haiti.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/11/07/un-jean.html |title=Michaëlle Jean begins UN job for Haiti| date=8 November 2010| publisher=CBC| accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl] Schreyer did also, however, become the first former governor general to run for elected office in Canada when he vied for a seat in the House of Commons as a member of parliament for the New Democratic Party. He did not win the riding. Prior to 1952, several former viceroys returned to political careers in the United Kingdom, sitting with party affiliations in the House of Lords and, in some cases, taking a position in the British Cabinet.[tpl]#tag:ref|In 1952, the Earl Alexander of Tunis resigned as Governor General of Canada to accept an appointment as Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Winston Churchill. The Marquess of Lansdowne and the Duke of Devonshire both also served in the British Cabinet following their viceregal careers, and Lansdowne went on to serve as leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Lords for over a decade.|group=n|name=Post[/tpl]
Generally an outgoing governor general will leave an eponymous award as a legacy, such as the Stanley Cup and Grey Cup. Others may also or instead found an institution, as Georges Vanier did with the Vanier Institute of the Family and Adrienne Clarkson's Institute for Canadian Citizenship. Three former governors general have released biographies: the Lord Tweedsmuir (Memory Hold-the-Door), Vincent Massey (On Being Canadian and What's Past is Prologue), and Clarkson (Heart Matters).
