==Description==

Phillips Academy Andover is one of the oldest incorporated high schools in the United States,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/456592/Phillips-Academy |title=Phillips Academy (school, Andover, Massachusetts, United States) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28[/tpl] established in 1778 by Samuel Phillips, Jr. Phillips's uncle founded Phillips Exeter Academy three years later, starting a rivalry that has continued through the centuries.The Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer Academy), alma mater of Samuel Phillips, Jr., was founded in 1763, but was not given a state charter until after 1778. Phillips Academy's endowment stood around $800 million in June 2011, the fourth-highest of any American secondary school. Andover is subject to the control of a board of trustees, headed by Peter Currie '74, business executive and former Netscape Chief Financial Officer, who took over as president of the Phillips Academy Board of Trustees on July 1, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Currie '74 Elected to Succeed Tang as Board President July 2012|url=http://www.andover.edu/About/Newsroom/Pages/CurrieToSucceedTang2011.aspx|publisher=Phillips Academy|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=15 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=New members join Andover Board of Trustees|url=http://www.andover.edu/About/Newsroom/Pages/NewTrustees2012.aspx|publisher=Phillips Academy|accessdate=29 July 2012|date=19 July 2012[/tpl] On November 14, 2012, John G. Palfrey, Jr., Henry N. Ess III Professor of Law and Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources at Harvard Law School, was named the 15th Head of School.
Phillips Academy admitted only boys until the school became coeducational in 1973, the year of Phillips Academy's merger with Abbot Academy, a boarding school for girls in downtown Andover. Abbot Academy, founded in 1828,[tpl]cite news |title=Abbot Academy |url=http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n39/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=July 28, 2012[/tpl] was the first incorporated school for girls in New England. Then-headmaster Theodore Sizer oversaw the merger, and Phillips Academy's move to coeducation is seen as his most important accomplishment.
Andover traditionally educated its students for Yale, just as Phillips Exeter Academy educated its students for Harvard,The pattern of strongly favoring Yale began in the 1840s and continued through the 1940s. During those years, when the senior class numbered around forty, Andover graduates matriculated as follows: 1858 – 20 to Yale, 10 to Williams; 1863 – 21 to Yale, eight to Brown, five to Harvard; 1868 – 25 to Yale, 12 to Amherst, 12 to Harvard. The height of matriculation to Yale was 1937, when one freshman in ten at Yale was an Andover alumnus. That year, 74 percent of the class matriculated at Yale, Harvard, or Princeton. By 1957 only 47% matriculated at those institutions. Amherst consistently ranked third after Yale and Harvard for many years in this period, but declined after the 1940s when the school sought to admit more public school graduates. In 1950 for the first time in over a century, more graduates were admitted to Harvard than Yale (64 and 46, respectively) (See Youth From Every Quarter: A Bicentennial History of Phillips Academy, Andover, by Frederick S. Allis, Jr. (University Press of New England, 1978)). but students now matriculate to a wide range of colleges and universities.
In recent years, Andover has sent a large portion of its students to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Penn, Columbia, Princeton, and other top-tier colleges and universities in the United States and abroad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/Academics/CollegeCounseling/Pages/SchoolProfileCollegeMatriculations.aspx |title=Phillips Academy - School Profile & College Matriculations |work=Andover.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl]
Among other notable alumni, Andover has educated the American presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, NFL head coach Bill Belichick, Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, Lyman Spitzer, namesake of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, six Medal of Honor recipients,The six alumni who have received the Medal of Honor are Thomas J.

The school's student-run newspaper, The Phillipian,The Phillipian is the second oldest secondary school newspaper in the United States, the oldest secondary school newspaper being The Exonian, Phillips Exeter Academy's weekly.http://pdf.phillipian.net/1954/03111954.pdf The Phillipian was first published on July 28, 1857 has been published regularly since 1878.  The Philomathean Society is the oldest high school debate society in the nation, established in 1825.
The school's grading system, a scale of zero to six, is rather unusual. Andover does not rank students, and rather than a four-point GPA scale, Phillips Academy calculates GPA using a six-point system. The Office of the Dean of Studies claims that there is no formal equivalent between the zero-to-six system and a conventional letter-grade system. However, a six is considered outstanding and is (theoretically) rarely awarded, a five is the lowest honors grade, and a two is the lowest passing grade. Grades earned in classes are sometimes weighted at the discretion of the instructor, and the school provides no uniform scale for converting percent scores into grades on the six-point scale. 
Andover runs a five-week summer session for approximately 600 students entering grades 8 through 12.

==History==

Phillips Academy was founded during the American Revolution as an all-boys school in 1778 by Samuel Phillips, Jr., a member of the revolutionary war family, the Phillipses. The great seal of the school was designed by Paul Revere. George Washington[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] spoke at the school in its first year and was so impressed that he recommended that his nephews go there, which they did. John Hancock, the famous signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, signed the school's articles of incorporation. Phillips Academy's traditional opponent is Phillips Exeter Academy, which was established three years later in Exeter, New Hampshire by Samuel Phillips' uncle, Dr. John Phillips. There has been a long and intense relationship between the two schools. The football teams have met nearly every year since 1878, making it the oldest high school rivalry in the country. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] In 1882, the first high school lacrosse teams were formed at Phillips Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy and the Lawrenceville School, solidifying the role of Andover and Exeter as pioneers in secondary school athletics.
For 100 years of its history, Phillips Academy shared its campus with the Andover Theological Seminary, which was founded on Phillips Hill in 1807 by orthodox Calvinists who had fled Harvard College after it appointed a liberal Unitarian theologian to a professorship of divinity.Andover Theological Seminary The Andover Theological Seminary was independent from Phillips Academy but shared the same board of directors. In 1908, the seminary departed Phillips Academy, leaving behind its key buildings: academic building Pearson Hall (formerly a chapel), and dormitories Foxcroft Hall and Bartlet Hall.Andover Historic Preservation: National Register Properties  These buildings later became the heart of the Andover campus, which was expanded in the 1920s and 30s around this historic core with new buildings of similar Georgian style: Samuel Phillips Hall, George Washington Hall, Samuel Morse Hall, Paul Revere Hall, Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, Commons, the Addison Gallery of American Art and Cochran Chapel.Andover Campus Evolves Over the Centuries, 1778 to Present Along with this new construction, at least nine existing buildings were moved to make way for the Vista and the Great Lawn and the creation of a formal West Quad.
Small portions of Andover's campus were laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Central Park and himself a graduate of the school. Other campus structures include the Memorial Bell Tower, which recently underwent a $5 million renovation,Phillips Academy, Memorial Bell Tower Dismantled Samuel Phillips Hall, Bulfinch Hall, and Pearson Hall.
Paul Revere incorporated bees, a beehive, and the sun into his design of the school's seal, which is masonic in nature. The school's primary motto, Non Sibi, located in the sun, means "not for oneself". This has led to the development of Non Sibi Day, a day when many of Andover alumni and all of its students participate in community service across the world. The school's second motto, Finis Origine Pendet, meaning "the end depends upon the beginning", is scrolled across the bottom of the seal. Phillips Academy aims to attract and educate "qualified youth from every quarter", a phrase often used by the admissions department.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Phillips Academy offers a broad curriculum and extracurricular activities that include music ensembles, 30 competitive sports, a campus newspaper, a radio station, and a debate club. The academy raised $208 million through "Campaign Andover", which brought its endowment to around $550 million in 2004.Phillips Academy raises $208.9 Million In 1973 Phillips Academy merged with neighboring Abbot Academy, which was founded in 1829 as the first school for girls in New England and named for Sarah Abbot.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Phillips Academy is one of only a few private high schools (others include Roxbury Latin and St. Andrews School) in the United States that attained need-blind admissions in 2007 and 2008, and it has continued this policy through the present.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] In 2007, Phillips Academy matriculated 81% of its admitted students, the highest rate among any ESA school[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]. In 2009 it received 2,711 applications and accepted 16.7%, with 77% of those going on to matriculate at the Academy. In 2010, Phillips Academy received a record 2,844 completed applications and accepted 405 students, for a 14.2% admission rate. For the 2012-2013 school year, Phillips Academy admitted 14% of 3,130 completed applications, and had a record high yield of 84%, unparalleled by any similar boarding schools of its caliber.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/Admission/WelcomeAdmittedStudents/233Class/Pages/FunFacts.aspx |title=Fun Facts for the 233rd Admitted Class |work=Andover.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl] For the 2013-2014 school year, it had a record low acceptance rate of 13%.

In addition to the above mentioned facilities, the school also includes a number of dormitories to serve the roughly 800 students that board. These buildings range in size from housing as few as four to as many as 40 students. Two notable dorms are America House, where the patriotic hymn America was penned,[tpl]cite web|url=http://icma.org/pm/info/bulletinboard.cfm |title=Information about America and Stowe House |work=Icma.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl] and Stowe House, where American writer Harriet Beecher Stowe (author of Uncle Tom's Cabin) lived while her husband taught at the Andover Theological Seminary. Stowe is also buried on campus in a cemetery behind Samuel Phillips Hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=992 |title=Find-A-Grave Entry on Harriet Beecher Stowe, buried on Phillips Academy Campus |work=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl] None of the original buildings remain; the oldest dorm is Blanchard House, built in 1789. Several dorms are named after prominent alumni, such as Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War during World War II, and men instrumental in the founding of the Academy, such as Nathan Hale and Paul Revere. Shortly before his death in 1799, President George Washington delivered a speech from a second-floor window in Carriage House, now a dorm, to the citizens of Andover. Also located on campus is The Andover Inn. Built in 1930, The Andover Inn is a New England country inn with 30 rooms and meeting space.

==Museums==

The Addison Gallery of American Art is an art museum given to the school by alumnus Thomas Cochran. Its permanent collection includes Winslow Homer's Eight Bells, along with work by John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, Thomas Eakins, James McNeill Whistler, Frederic Remington, George Bellows, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Frank Stella, and Andrew Wyeth. The museum also features collections in American photography and decorative arts, with silver and furniture dating back to precolonial America, and a collection of colonial model ships. A rotating schedule of exhibitions is open to students and the public alike. In the spring of 2006, the Phillips Academy Board of Trustees approved a $30 million campaign to renovate and expand the Addison Gallery.Addison Campaign News Construction on the Addison began in the middle of 2008 and, as of September 7, 2010, is complete, and the museum is once again open to the Phillips Academy community and the broader community of the town of Andover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.addisongallery.org/ |title=Addison Gallery Homepage |work=Addisongallery.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl]

Since the early 1990s, the museum has been at the forefront of compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] It currently serves as an educational museum for the students of Phillips Academy, but is also accessible to researchers, public schools, and visitors by appointment.

==Athletics==

===History===

Athletic competition has long been a part of the Phillips Academy tradition. As early as 1805, football was being played on school grounds, according to a letter that Henry Pearson wrote his father, Eliphalet Pearson in 1805, saying, "I cannot write a long letter as I am very tired after having played at football all this afternoon."Henry Pearson to Eliphalet Pearson, Andover, 26 October 1805, in the Pearson Papers, Phillips Academy Archives. The first ever interscholastic football game between high schools was in 1875, when Phillips Academy played against Adams Academy.Quinby, Phillips Academy, Andover on Diamond, Track, and Field (Andover, Mass.: The Andover Press, 1920), 10.
One of the oldest schoolboy rivalries in American football is the Andover/Exeter competition, started in 1878. That year, the first Andover/Exeter baseball game took place, and The Phillipian returned from hiatus, named its first Board and began publishing regularly.Harrison, Fred H., Athletics for All: Physical Education and Athletics at Phillips Academy, Andover, 1778–1978 (Andover, Ma.: 1983)
Today, Phillips Academy is an athletic powerhouse among New England private schools. Since the Constitution of the Phillips Academy Athletic Association was drawn up in 1903 with the objective of "Athletics for All", Andover has established 29 different interscholastic programs, and 44 intramural or instructional programs, including fencing, tai chi, figure skating, and yoga.http://www.andover.edu/athletics/GoBigBlue/OtherOfferings.asp[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] Andover Athletes have been successful in winning over 110 New England Championships in these different sports over the last three decades alone,http://www.andover.edu/athletics/GoBigBlue/default.asp [tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]  and have even had the chance to compete abroad, in such competitions as the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley, England for crew.[tpl]cite web|last=Forsberg |first=Chris |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2006/07/20/pulling_together/ |title=Andover crew reaches semifinals in Henley regatta - The Boston Globe |work=Boston.com |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl]

As a way to encourage all students to try new things and stay healthy, all students are required to have an athletic commitment each term. A range of instructional sports are available for those who wish to try new things, and for those already established in a sport, most teams have at least a varsity and junior varsity squad.

Many sports are offered:

==Affiliations==

Andover is a member of the Eight Schools Association, begun informally in 1973–74 and formalized in 2006. Andover was host to the annual meeting of ESA in April 2008. It is also a member of the Ten Schools Admissions Organization, founded in 1966. There is a seven-school overlap of membership between the two groups.Taylor Smith, "History of the Association," The Phillipian, February 14, 2008; Tim Ghosh and Charles Shoener, "Eight Schools Association Convenes At PA," The Phillipian, April 24, 2008  In addition, Andover is a member of the G20 Schools group, an international organization of highly selective independent secondary schools.

==Secret societies==

Phillips Academy has had a long tradition of secret societies. Almost from the inception of the school, societies existed publicly, with buildings that the students could use as clubhouses. While the societies held secret initiation rituals, their presence was recognized as part of academy life. In the 1940s their existence was widely criticized, even drawing the attention of then Secretary of War Henry Stimson, an Andover and society alum. Objections included racist exclusion, vicious hazing, and the poor academic performance of society members. Bending to public pressure, societies were disbanded in 1949 by Headmaster Kemper.
Although all secret societies were officially terminated in the 1940s, some societies still exist. During the academic year's extended period weeks (weeks during which term examinations take place), a bath tub filled with canned drinks appears on the terrace of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. An all-boys society called TUB (Truth, Unity, Brotherhood) is responsible for this action.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phillipian.net/article/6656 |title=Secret Societies once Clubs, Now Underground.

==In popular culture==

Andover, often linked with Exeter,Christopher Jencks, PBS Frontline, Views of Authorities on Intelligence & Testing, "...privilege of the guys who went at that time to Exeter and Andover...", Accessed June 24, 2013 is often understood symbolically as an "elite New England prep school," connoting privilege. Writer William S. Dietrich II described Andover and other elite prep schools as being part of a "WASP ascendancy" during the first half of the twentieth century. Elite universities such as Yale and Princeton tended to accept disproportionate percentages of prep school students while using quotas to deny admission to minority applicants.William S. Dietrich II, Winter 2010, Pittsburgh Quarterly, The WASP ascendancy, "...In 1930, eight private schools accounted for nearly one-third of Yale freshman: Andover (74), Exeter (54), Hotchkiss (42), St. Paul’s (24), Choate (19), Lawrenceville (19), Hill (17) and Kent (14)...", Accessed June 26, 2013 An account in Time in 1931 described the two schools as having "flourished", and that both schools were "twin giants of prep schools in size and in prestige",June 15, 1931, Time Magazine, Education: Exeter's 150th, "...twin giants of prep schools in size and in prestige...", Accessed June 24, 2013 essentially feeder schools for Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Yale, according to Joseph Lieberman.Joseph I. Lieberman and Michael D'Orso, Simon & Schuster, 2000, ISBN 0-743201440-4, In Praise of Public Life, "I arrived at Yale as an outsider, a public school kid among the preppies from Andover and Exeter...", Accessed June 24, 2013 A cultural image from the 1960s was young men who had "perfect white teeth" and wore Lacoste shirts,Adam Gussow, 1998 Pantheon Books, Mister Satan's Apprentice: A Blues Memoir, "...Preppies were the Andover/Exeter/Miss Porter's crowd..." Accessed June 24, 2013 with a look easy to identify by young women at the time:
The WASP ascendancy began to break down around the 1960s and onwards when the admissions policies of elite prep schools and universities began to emphasize merit rather than affluence. Still, images of exclusivity based on unfairness tended to remain. Gore Vidal suggested that Andover and Exeter had a "style that was quite witty."Gore Vidal, Esquire Magazine, August 1, 2012, Mailer and Vidal: The Big Schmooze , "... there was an Exeter/Andover style that was quite witty....", Accessed June 24, 2013 If the WASP ascendancy has waned, the image of unaffordability continues to persist, with one writer deploring how the schools cost $30,000 and more annually.Jonathan Kozol, The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America, "...Exeter or Andover ... were able to absorb some $30,000 yearly for each pupil...", Accessed June 24, 2013 Recent reports from graduates, however, paint a picture of educational excellence and diversification. For example, Christina Hartmann, who attended Andover from 2001-2003, described the school as having a need blind admissions policy. She suggested the student body was mostly diversified, and that the school had dedicated buildings for specific subject areas, was challenging academically, and had flexible teachers and peers who were "smart and driven".Cristina Hartmann, June 19, 2013, Slate Magazine What Is It Like To Attend a Top Boarding School? , Accessed June 24, 2013 She elaborated that Andover provided two sign language interpreters, free of charge, to help her academically to cope with her deafness. While the overall image may be changing to one which emphasizes greater diversity and respect for individual talent, the image of the school in the media continues to connote privilege, money, exclusivity, prestige, academic quality, and sometimes negatively connotes chumminess or clubbiness or arrogance. The school is often mentioned in books and movies and television shows such as the following:
