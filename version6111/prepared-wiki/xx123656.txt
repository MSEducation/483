[[Kontor]]

CATEGORIES: Trading posts of the Hanseatic League

A kontor was a foreign trading post of the Hanseatic League.The word kontor means office in Norwegian and other Scandinavian languages, while the word kantoor is in use in the Dutch language for office.
In addition to the major kontore in London (Steelyard), Ipswich, Bruges, Bergen (Bryggen), and Novgorod (Peterhof), some ports had a representative merchant and a warehouse.
Of all the kontor buildings, only Bergen's kontor, known as Bryggen in Norway, has survived until the present day. The Hanseatic kontor at Bryggen was closed in 1754 and replaced by a "Norwegian kontor", run by Norwegian citizens, but still with a large element of German immigrants. Bergen's kontor is on the UNESCO list of the World Cultural Heritage sites.
The Hanseatic Warehouse in King's Lynn, England, survives - but it was converted into offices in 1971.
