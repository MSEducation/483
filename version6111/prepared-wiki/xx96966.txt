Müllheim is a town in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It belongs to the district Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. Müllheim is generally considered to be the center of the region known as Markgräflerland.

==History==

On October 27, 758 Strachfried gave as a gift to the monastery of St. Gallen his properties in Müllheim, including the vineyards. This deed is in the archives of St. Gallen and it is where we today can find the first written reference to the "villa Mulinhaimo", which is the current city of Müllheim.
Archeology shows however that Müllheim was inhabited even earlier than this. During the renovation of the Martin's church in 1980 and 1981 the workers came upon a portion of a Roman villa. It is assumed that it is the center of large Roman possessions in the region.
