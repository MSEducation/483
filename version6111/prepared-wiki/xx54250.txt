[[Private sector]]

CATEGORIES: Industry, Economic sectors

The private sector is that part of the economy, sometimes referred to as the citizen sector, which is run by private individuals or groups, usually as a means of enterprise for profit, and is not controlled by the state (areas of the economy controlled by the state being referred to as the public sector).

==Employment==

The private sector employs most of the workforce in some countries.

==Regulation==

The private sector is legally regulated by the state.  Businesses within one country are required to comply with the laws in that country.
In some cases, usually involving multinational businesses that can pick and choose their suppliers and locations based on their perception of the regulatory environment, these regulations have resulted in uneven practices within one company.  For example, workers in one country may benefit from strong labor unions, while workers in another country, even though they work for the same employer, have very weak laws supporting labor unions.  In some cases, industries and individual businesses have chosen to self-regulate by applying higher standards for dealing with their workers, customers, or the environment than the minimum that is legally required of them.[tpl]cite book|last=Haufler|first=Virginia|title=A Public Role for the Private Sector: Industry Self-Regulation in a Global Economy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TxKNYxTRA-cC |date=2013-01-25|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|isbn=9780870033377[/tpl]
