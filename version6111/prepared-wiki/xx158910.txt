The Barr Smith Library is the main library of the University of Adelaide, situated in the centre of the North Terrace campus. The library was named in honour of Robert Barr Smith who donated £9000 to buy books. In 1920 his family gave an extra £11,000 in the form of an endowment and in 1928 his son, Tom Elder Barr Smith, gave £30,000 for the Barr Smith library building.
