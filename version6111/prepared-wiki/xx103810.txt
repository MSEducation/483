The Kharga Oasis ([tpl]lang-arz|الخارجة[/tpl] [tpl]transl|arz|el-Ḵarga [/tpl] [tpl]IPA-arz|elˈxæɾɡæ|pron[/tpl]), also romanized as Al-Kharijah, (meaning "the outer") is the southernmost of Egypt's five western oases. It is located in the Libyan Desert, about 200 km to the west of the Nile valley. "Kharga" or "El-Kharga" is also the name of a major town located in the oasis, the capital of New Valley Governorate.Ball, J. 1900. Kharga Oasis: its topography and geology. Survey Department, Public Works Ministry, Geological Survey Report 1899, Part II. Cairo: National Printing Department, 116 pp. The oasis, which was known as the 'Southern Oasis' to the Ancient Egyptians, is the largest of the oases in the Libyan desert of Egypt. It is in a depression about 160km long and from 20km to 80km wide.Introduction to Kharga Oasis Its population is 67,700 (2012).

==Overview==

Kharga is the most modernized of Egypt's western oases. The main town is highly functional with all modern facilities, and virtually nothing left of old architecture. Although framed by the oasis, there is no oasis feeling[tpl]specify|date=December 2013[/tpl] to it; unlike all other oases in this part of Egypt. There is extensive thorn palm, acacia, buffalo thorn and jujube growth in the oasis surrounding the modern town of Kharga. Many remnant wildlife species inhabit this region.

==Climate==

Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).
 
 

==Darb el-Arba`īn caravan route==

A trade route called Darb el-Arba`īn (w:ar:درب الأربعين, "the Way of Forty") passed through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north It was a long caravan route running north-south between Middle Egypt and the Sudan.  It was used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.Jobbins, Jenny.  "The 40 days' nightmare," in Al-Ahram, 13–19 November 2003, Issue No. 664.  Published in Cairo, Egypt.  The maximum extent of Darb el-Arba`īn was northward from Kobbei in Darfur, 25 miles north of al-Fashir, passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending in Egypt.Burr, J. Millard and Robert O. Collins, Darfur: The Long Road to Disaster, Markus Wiener Publishers: Princeton, 2006, ISBN 1-55876-405-4, pp. 6-7.
All the oases have always been crossroads of caravan routes converging from the barren desert. In the case of Kharga, this is made particularly evident by the presence of a chain of fortresses that the Romans built to protect the Darb el-Arba`īn route.  The forts vary in size and function, some being just small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.  Some were installed where earlier settlements already existed, while others were probably started from scratch. All of them are made of mud bricks, but some also contain small stone temples with inscriptions on the walls.
Described by Herodotus as a road "traversed ... in forty days," by his time the route had already become an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt.Smith, Dr. Stuart Tyson.  Nubia: History, University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Anthropology, . Retrieved January 21, 2009. The length of the journey is the reason for it being called Darb el-Arba`īn, the implication being "the forty-day road".Richardson, Dan; (1991). EGYPT: the Rough Guide. Harrap Colombus Ltd, Kent. Page ii.  
As part of a caravan proceeding to Dafur, the English explorer W.G. Browne paused for several days at Kharga, leaving with the rest of the group 7 June 1793. At the time a gindi[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013|post-text=(A soldier?)[/tpl] was stationed at Kharga, "belonging to Ibrahim-bey-el-kebir, to whom those villages appertain; and to official is entrusted the management of what relates to the caravan during the time of its stay there."Browne, Travels in Africa, Egypt and Syria, from the years 1792 to 1798 (London, 1799), pp. 185
In 1930 the archaeologist, Gertrude Caton–Thompson, uncovered the palaeolithic history of Kharga.L. P. Kirwan, ‘Thompson, Gertrude Caton-(1888–1985)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004

==Demographics==

Native Khargans belong to the related Beja ethnic group. They speak Beja, their own Afro-Asiatic language, though Arabic is the dominant tongue.

==Transportation==

A regular bus service connects the oasis to the other Western oases and to the rest of Egypt. A railway line Kharga - Qena (Nile Valley) - Port Safaga (Red Sea) has been in service since 1996.

==Archaeological sites==

The Temple of Hibis is a Saite-era temple founded by Psamtik II, which was erected largely ca. 500 BC. It is located about 2 kilometres north of modern Kharga, in a palm-grove."Egyptian Monuments: Hibis", accessed 28 November 2008 There is a second 1st millennium BC temple in the southernmost part of the oasis at Dush."New Persian temple found at Kharga" Egyptology News 22 February 2007, accessed 28 November 2008 An ancient Christian cemetery at Al-Bagawat also functioned at the Kharga Oasis from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. It is one of the earliest and best preserved Christian cemeteries in the ancient world.
The first list of sites is due to Ahmad Fakhri but serious archaeological work began in 1976 with Serge Sauneron, director of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale.
