Haluatko miljonääriksi? (English translation: Do you want to be a millionaire?) is a Finnish game show based on the original British format of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show is hosted by Ville Klinga (earlier by Lasse Lehtinen). The main goal of the game is to win €1 million (from 2002 to 2005 - €200,000, and from 1999 to 2001 - mk1,000,000 ) by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. There are three lifelines - Fifty Fifty (50:50), Phone A Friend (Kilauta kaverille) and Ask The Audience (Kysy katsomolta). Haluatko miljonääriksi? was broadcast from 1999 to 2005 (on Nelonen), and from 2005 to 2007 (on MTV3). When a contestant gets the fifth question correct, he will leave with at least €2,000 (from 1999 to 2001 - mk10,000). When a contestant gets the tenth question correct, he will leave with at least €15,000 (2002 to 2005 - 20,000, from 1999 to 2001 - mk100,000). The biggest win was, when a contestant won €70,000 while the biggest prize was €200,000 (resigned of answering on 14 question).
