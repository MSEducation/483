Adiponectin (also referred to as GBP-28, apM1, AdipoQ and Acrp30) is a protein which in humans is encoded by the ADIPOQ gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Maeda K, Okubo K, Shimomura I, Funahashi T, Matsuzawa Y, Matsubara K | title = cDNA cloning and expression of a novel adipose specific collagen-like factor, apM1 (AdiPose Most abundant Gene transcript 1) | journal = Biochem.

==Structure==

Adiponectin is a 244-amino-acid-long polypeptide. There are four distinct regions of adiponectin. The first is a short signal sequence that targets the hormone for secretion outside the cell; next is a short region that varies between species; the third is a 65-amino acid region with similarity to collagenous proteins; the last is a globular domain. Overall this gene shows similarity to the complement 1Q factors (C1Q). However, when the 3-dimensional structure of the globular region was determined, a striking similarity to TNFα was observed, despite unrelated protein sequences.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shapiro L, Scherer PE | title = The crystal structure of a complement-1q family protein suggests an evolutionary link to tumor necrosis factor | journal = Curr.

==Function==

Adiponectin is a protein hormone that modulates a number of metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Díez JJ, Iglesias P | title = The role of the novel adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin in human disease | journal = Eur. J. Endocrinol. | volume = 148 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–300 |date=March 2003| pmid = 12611609 | doi = 10.1530/eje.0.1480293 [/tpl] Adiponectin is exclusively secreted from adipose tissue (and also from the placenta in pregnancy[tpl]cite journal | author = Chen J, et al. | title = Secretion of adiponectin by human placenta: differential modulation of adiponectin and its receptors by cytokines. | journal = Diabetalogica | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 1292–302 |date=June 2006| pmid = 16570162 | doi=10.1007/s00125-006-0194-7[/tpl]) into the bloodstream and is very abundant in plasma relative to many hormones. Levels of the hormone are inversely correlated with body fat percentage in adults,[tpl]cite journal | author = Ukkola O, Santaniemi M | title = Adiponectin: a link between excess adiposity and associated comorbidities? | journal = J.

Transgenic mice with increased adiponectin show impaired adipocyte differentiation and increased energy expenditure associated with protein uncoupling.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bauche IB, El Mkadem SA, Pottier AM, Senou M, Many MC, Rezsohazy R, Penicaud L, Maeda N, Funahashi T, Brichard SM | title = Overexpression of adiponectin targeted to adipose tissue in transgenic mice: impaired adipocyte differentiation | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 148 | issue = 4 | pages = 1539–49 |date=April 2007| pmid = 17204560 | doi = 10.1210/en.2006-0838 [/tpl] The hormone plays a role in the suppression of the metabolic derangements that may result in type 2 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Renaldi O, Pramono B, Sinorita H, Purnomo LB, Asdie RH, Asdie AH | title = Hypoadiponectinemia: a risk factor for metabolic syndrome | journal = Acta Med Indones | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–4 |date=January 2009| pmid = 19258676  [/tpl] Adiponectin in combination with leptin has been shown to completely reverse insulin resistance in mice.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yamauchi T, Kamon J, Waki H, Terauchi Y, Kubota N, Hara K, Mori Y, Ide T, Murakami K, Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N, Ezaki O, Akanuma Y, Gavrilova O, Vinson C, Reitman ML, Kagechika H, Shudo K, Yoda M, Nakano Y, Tobe K, Nagai R, Kimura S, Tomita M, Froguel P, Kadowaki T | title = The fat-derived hormone adiponectin reverses insulin resistance associated with both lipoatrophy and obesity | journal = Nat.

Adiponectin is secreted into the bloodstream where it accounts for approximately 0.01% of all plasma protein at around 5-10 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations reveal a sexual dimorphism, with females having higher levels than males. Levels of adiponectin are reduced in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. Weight reduction significantly increases circulating levels.[tpl]cite journal | author = Coppola A, Marfella R, Coppola L, Tagliamonte E, Fontana D, Liguori E, Cirillo T, Cafiero M, Natale S, Astarita C | title = Effect of weight loss on coronary circulation and adiponectin levels in obese women | journal = Int.

Adiponectin automatically self-associates into larger structures. Initially, three adiponectin molecules bind together to form a homotrimer. The trimers continue to self-associate and form hexamers or dodecamers. Like the plasma concentration, the relative levels of the higher-order structures are sexually dimorphic, where females have increased proportions of the high-molecular weight forms. Recent studies showed that the high-molecular weight form may be the most biologically active form regarding glucose homeostasis.Oh DK, Ciaraldi T, Henry RR Adiponectin in health and disease. Diabetes Obes Metab 2007:9:282–289 High-molecular-weight adiponectin was further found to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes with similar magnitude of association as total adiponectin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zhu N, Pankow JS, Ballantyne CM, Couper D, Hoogeveen RC, Pereira M, Duncan BB, Schmidt MI | title = High-molecular-weight adiponectin and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the ARIC study | journal = J.

Adiponectin exerts some of its weight reduction effects via the brain. This is similar to the action of leptin,[tpl]cite journal | author = Nedvídková J, Smitka K, Kopský V, Hainer V | title = Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived protein | journal = Physiol Res | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15544426 | doi = | url = http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/54/54_133.pdf [/tpl] but the two hormones perform complementary actions, and can have synergistic effects.

==Receptors==

Adiponectin binds to a number of receptors. So far, two receptors have been identified, with homology to G protein-coupled receptors and one receptor similar to the cadherin family:[tpl]cite journal | author = Yamauchi T, Kamon J, Ito Y, Tsuchida A, Yokomizo T, Kita S, Sugiyama T, Miyagishi M, Hara K, Tsunoda M, Murakami K, Ohteki T, Uchida S, Takekawa S, Waki H, Tsuno NH, Shibata Y, Terauchi Y, Froguel P, Tobe K, Koyasu S, Taira K, Kitamura T, Shimizu T, Nagai R, Kadowaki T | title = Cloning of adiponectin receptors that mediate antidiabetic metabolic effects | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6941 | pages = 762–9 |date=June 2003| pmid = 12802337 | doi = 10.1038/nature01705  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hug C, Wang J, Ahmad NS, Bogan JS, TSao TS, Lodish HF | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 101 | issue = 28 | pages = 10308–13 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15210937 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403382101 | title = T-cadherin is a receptor for hexameric and high-molecular-weight forms of Acrp30/adiponectin  | pmc = 478568 [/tpl]
These have distinct tissue specificities within the body and have different affinities to the various forms of adiponectin. The receptors affect the downstream target AMP kinase, an important cellular metabolic rate control point. Expression of the receptors is correlated with insulin levels, as well as reduced in mouse models of diabetes, particularly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fang X, Sweeney G | title = Mechanisms regulating energy metabolism by adiponectin in obesity and diabetes | journal = Biochem.

==Discovery==

Adiponectin was first characterised in 1996 in mice as the mRNA transcript most highly expressed in adipocytes.(Maeda, 1996 ((citation #1, below)))  In 2007, adiponectin was identified as an transcript highly expressed in preadipocytes[tpl]cite journal | author = Lara-Castro C, Fu Y, Chung BH, Garvey WT | title = Adiponectin and the metabolic syndrome: mechanisms mediating risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease | journal = Curr.

The human homologue was identified as the most abundant transcript in adipose tissue. Contrary to expectations, despite being produced in adipose tissue, adiponectin was found to be decreased in obesity. This downregulation has not been fully explained. The gene was localised to chromosome 3q27, a region highlighted as affecting genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Supplementation by differing forms of adiponectin were able to improve insulin control, blood glucose and triglyceride levels in mouse models.
The gene was investigated for variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hara K, Yamauchi T, Kadowaki T | title = Adiponectin: an adipokine linking adipocytes and type 2 diabetes in humans | journal = Curr.

===Administration===

Because this substance is a protein, oral administration of adiponectin is not effective, as enzymes in the digestive system break it down into its constituent amino-acid parts. The only way to introduce the hormone into the blood stream is intravenous administration, which itself poses significant logistical challenges.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
