Dennis Nicolaas Bergkamp ([tpl]IPA-nl|ˈdɛnɪs ˈbɛrxkɑmp|-|Nl-Dennis Bergkamp.ogg[/tpl]; born 10 May 1969) is a former Dutch professional footballer, who is the assistant manager to Frank de Boer at Ajax. Originally a wide midfielder, he was moved to main striker and then to second striker, where he remained throughout his playing career. Bergkamp has been described by Jan Mulder as having "the finest technique" of any Dutch international[tpl]cite news |title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp |newspaper=Financial Times |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |first=Simon |last=Kuper[/tpl] and a "dream for a striker" by teammate Thierry Henry.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html |title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |first=Nick |last=Coleman |newspaper=The Independent |location=London [/tpl]
The son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in Amsterdam and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at the age of 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Good form led to an international call-up a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club Internazionale in 1993, where he had two disappointing seasons. He then joined Arsenal in 1995. It was at Arsenal where Bergkamp rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three Premier League titles, four FA Cup trophies and reach the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, which marked his last appearance as a player. With the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp surpassed Faas Wilkes's record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by Patrick Kluivert and since 2013 by Robin van Persie.
Bergkamp was selected by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 greatest living players and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in his generation. In 2007, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, the first and so far only Dutch player ever to receive such honour. Bergkamp has also finished third in the FIFA World Player of the Year award twice. Due to his fear of flying, Bergkamp has been affectionately nicknamed the "Non-Flying Dutchman" by Arsenal supporters.

==Early life==

Born in Amsterdam, Bergkamp was the last of Wim and Tonnie Bergkamp's four sons.[tpl]cite news |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:QhutVgHm4SoJ:www.geumid.nl/thuis/nieuws/item/browse/2/titel/op-een-mooie-zondagmorgen/terug/2234|title=Op een mooie zondagmorgen |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |work=Geuzenmiddenmeer |last=Maas |first=J.G. |language=Dutch [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/football/article92057.ece |title=The Big Interview: Dennis Bergkamp |date=14 November 2004 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lovejoy |first=Joe [/tpl][tpl]subscription needed[/tpl] He was brought up in a working-class suburb, in a family aspiring to reach middle-class status.

==Club career==

===Ajax: 1986–1993===

Bergkamp was brought up through Ajax's youth system, joining the club at age 11. Manager Johan Cruyff gave him his professional debut on 14 December 1986 against Roda JC; the game ended in a 2–0 victory for Ajax.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vi.nl/Wedstrijden/Wedstrijd.htm?dbid=59196&typeofpage=84140 |title=Ajax 2–0 Roda JC |accessdate=28 April 2012 |work=Voetbal International |language=Dutch [/tpl] Bergkamp scored his first senior goal for the club against HFC Haarlem on 22 February 1987 in a match Ajax won 6–0.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vi.nl/Wedstrijden/Wedstrijd.htm?dbid=59197&typeofpage=84140 |title=Ajax 6–0 Haarlem |accessdate=3 May 2012 |work=Voetbal International |language=Dutch [/tpl] He went on to make 23 appearances in the 1986–87 season, including a European debut against Malmö FF in the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup, earning him praise. Ajax won the competition, beating Lokomotive Leipzig 1–0 as Bergkamp made an appearance as a substitute.[tpl]cite news |title=1986/87: Ajax revive their traditions |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1986/intro.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 June 1987 |accessdate=14 March 2012[/tpl]
In later seasons, Bergkamp established himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a period of success for the club, which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989–90 season for the first time in five years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 games the following season and became the joint top goalscorer in the league, sharing the accolade with PSV Eindhoven striker Romário. Ajax won the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, beating Torino through the away goals ruling. They then defeated SC Heerenveen 6–2 in the final of the KNVB Cup on 20 May 1993.[tpl]cite news |title=1991/92: Ajax complete clean sweep |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/season=1991/index.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=11 May 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Ajax – sc Heerenveen |url=http://www.sc-heerenveen.nl/voetbal/wedstrijd/ajax-sc-heerenveen/?match=15523 |work=sc-heerenveen.nl |publisher=SC Heerenveen |accessdate=11 May 2012 [/tpl] Bergkamp was the top scorer in the Eredivisie from 1991 to 1993, and was voted Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1992 and 1993.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ajax.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuws-artikel/Deze-week-17-jaar-geleden.htm | title=Deze week ... 17 jaar geleden | work=Ajax.nl | date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 |language=Dutch[/tpl] In total, he scored 122 goals in 239 games for his hometown club.

===Internazionale: 1993–1995===

Bergkamp attracted the attention of several European clubs as a result of his performances for Ajax. Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/CRUYFF/_JOHAN_/FUTBOL/HOLANDA/BERGKAMP/_DENNIS_/FUTBOLISTA/HOLANDA/FUTBOL_CLUB_BARCELONA_/CLUB_DE_FUTBOL/elpepidep/19930102elpepidep_2/Tes|title=Cruyff: "¿Qué va a hacer Bergkamp en el Real Madrid?" |date=2 January 1993 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |newspaper=El País |last=Carbonell |first=Rafael |language=Spanish |location=Barcelona[/tpl] But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/371/article.aspx |title=Dennis Bergkamp – One-on-One – Interviews |accessdate=12 December 2011 |work=FourFourTwo[/tpl] He considered Serie A "the biggest league at the time" and preferred a move to either Juventus or Internazionale. On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1 million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-joins-inter-for-71m-pounds-1473409.html|title=Football: Bergkamp joins Inter for 7.1m pounds|date=16 February 1993 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |last=Haylett |first=Trever [/tpl] Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter "met all my demands. The most important thing for me was the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play."
Bergkamp made his debut against Reggiana on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2–1 victory.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/agosto/30/Jonk_Toto_fanno_ridere_Inter_co_0_93083010915.shtml|title=Jonk e Toto' fanno ridere l' Inter |date=30 August 1993 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |publisher=Corriere della Sera |last=Giancarlo|first=Padovan |language=Italian |location=Milan [/tpl] He scored his first goal for the club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a difficult time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league. This was partly due to manager Osvaldo Bagnoli's inability to find a stable forward partnership, preferring Bergkamp in a three with Uruguayan Rubén Sosa and Italian Salvatore Schillaci.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-wright-faces-charge-fa-awaits-linesmans-decision-1506224.html|title=Football: Wright faces charge: FA awaits linesman's decision|date=23 November 1993 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Winter |first=Henry |location=London[/tpl] Inter's poor league form cultimated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by Giampiero Marini, a member of Italy's World Cup winning squad of 1982.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19940209&id=Fd9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5hMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3282,3220664|title=Inter sack coach Bagnoli|date=9 February 1994 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |work=New Straits Times| location=Milan[/tpl] The club finished 13th in Serie A, one point away from relegation, but enjoyed success in the UEFA Cup, beating FC Salzburg in the final over two legs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1993/overview/index.html |title=1993/94: Inter reclaim UEFA Cup |work=UEFA.com |date=1 June 1994 |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl] Bergkamp was the competition's joint top goalscorer with eight goals and scored a hat-trick against Rapid Bucureşti in the first round.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/settembre/17/Bergkamp_Baggio_magie_10_co_0_93091713338.shtml|title=Bergkamp Baggio, magie da 10 |date=17 September 1993 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |last=Gherarducci |first=Mario |language=Italian |location=Milan[/tpl]
In Bergkamp's second season at Inter, the club changed managers again, appointing Ottavio Bianchi. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score five goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp's relationship with the Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/unravelling-the-enigma-that-is-dennis-bergkamp-1587595.html|title=Unravelling the enigma that is Dennis Bergkamp|date=21 June 1995 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Winner |first=David |location=London [/tpl] Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, L'asino della settimana (Donkey of the Week) to Bergkamp della settimana.[tpl]cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/06/27/che-incubi-milano-il-riscatto-dei-ripudiati.html|title=Che incubi a Milano Il riscatto dei ripudiati |date=27 June 2000 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=la Repubblica |last=Marrese |first=Emilio |language=Italian [/tpl] Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup, with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti, who promised to invest heavily in the squad.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/accaddeoggi/2011/02/18-156431/1995,+Moratti+compra+l%27Inter|title=1995, Moratti compra l'Inter |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |publisher=Corriere dello Sport |last=Marrese |first=Emilio |language=Italian [/tpl] Bergkamp's future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz a month after the takeover.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/marzo/29/Ganz_primo_colpo_Moratti_co_0_95032914360.shtml|title=Ganz, il primo colpo di Moratti |date=29 March 1995 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |agency=BBC |language=Italian [/tpl]

===Arsenal: 1995–2006===

As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5 million.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rioch-signs-bergkamp-to-signal-new-era-1587607.html|title=Rioch signs Bergkamp to signal new era |date=21 June 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Shaw |first=Phil | location=London[/tpl] He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5 million. Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not only because he was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/dennis-finds-his-menace-1602734.html|title=Dennis finds his menace |date=24 September 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |work=The Independent |last=Houston |first=Bob |location=London[/tpl] Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and a goal tally of 11, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/bergkamp-sends-arsenal-into-europe-1345860.html|title=Bergkamp sends Arsenal into Europe |date=6 May 1996 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Chesshyre |first=Tom |location=London[/tpl]
The appointment of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked a turning point in Bergkamp's career.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/apr/25/arsenal|title=On a higher plane |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Lawrence |first=Amy| location=London[/tpl] Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team's forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regime pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-and-adams-break-spirited-spurs-1354105.html|title=Football: Bergkamp and Adams break spirited Spurs |date=25 November 1996 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Haylett |first=Trever | location=London[/tpl] Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/grim-for-grizzly-adams-1282883.html|title=Grim for grizzly Adams|date=12 January 1997 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |work=The Independent |last=Turnbull |first=Simon | location=London[/tpl] Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of eight wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the Champions League via goal difference.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-three-gunner-salute-for-baseball-ground-1261073.html|title=Football: Three Gunner salute for Baseball Ground |date=12 May 1997 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Shaw |first=Phil | location=London[/tpl]
Bergkamp was instrumental the following season in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup double. He became the club's top scorer with 22 goals and recorded a strike rate of 0.57. Arsenal's achievement was all the more astonishing given that the team, written off by many in December 1997, had made ground on reigning Premier League champions Manchester United.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/77544.stm |title=Title run-in: United steel or Arsenal grit? |date=30 April 1998 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-1013159-wengers-sandcastle-under-siege.do|title=Wenger's sandcastle under siege |date=5 November 2001 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |work=Evening Standard|last=Stammers |first=Steve | location=London[/tpl] Early in the season away to Leicester City at Filbert Street on 23 August 1997, Bergkamp scored his first hat-trick for the club.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-wright-faces-more-fa-action-1247722.html|title=Football: Wright faces more FA action |date=28 August 1997 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |last=Shaw |first=Phil | location=London[/tpl] The third goal, which he regarded as his favourite for Arsenal,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/ggg4-bergkamp-v-leicester-city-1997 |title=GGG4: Bergkamp v Leicester City, 1997 |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |work=Arsenal.com [/tpl] required just one touch to control the ball in the penalty box, another to flick it past his marker Matt Elliott before juggling it with his feet and shooting past goalkeeper Kasey Keller.

After an effective 1998 World Cup campaign with the national team, Bergkamp had another productive season in 1998–99. Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League after losing the title on the final day of the season to Manchester United, Bergkamp was the club's second-top scorer with 16 goals. The team were also defeated in a FA Cup semi-final replay against Manchester United in April 1999. With the score 1–1 heading into injury time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after midfielder Ray Parlour was brought down by Phil Neville inside the 18-yard box. Bergkamp took the penalty shot, but it was saved by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. In the second half of extra time, Ryan Giggs scored the winner, a goal regarded by many as the greatest in the competition's history.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1999/apr/15/match.sport3?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Schmeichel takes flight as Giggs strips Arsenal bare |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Thorpe |first=Martin |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story/_/id/891126/the-fa-cup%27s-greatest-goals?cc=5739|title=The FA Cup's Greatest Goals |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |last=Carter |first=Jon [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/58/58639_giggs_goal_is_greatest_fa_cup_moment.html |title=Giggs' goal is greatest FA Cup moment |date=15 May 2003 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News[/tpl] After this miss, Bergkamp did not take another penalty for the remainder of his career.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mesut-ozil-could-be-like-dennis-bergkamp-and-never-take-a-penalty-again-says-arsene-wenger-9144082.html|title='Mesut Ozil could be like Dennis Bergkamp and never take a penalty again,' says Arsene Wenger|date=21 February 2014|work=The Independent[/tpl]

===Aerophobia===

Bergkamp's nickname is the Non-Flying Dutchman due to his fear of flying. This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2280779.stm|title=Bergkamp's fear revealed|date=25 September 2002|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC [/tpl] prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bergkamp-admits-to-flying-phobia-1355776.html |title=Bergkamp admits to flying phobia |date=5 October 1996 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |newspaper=The Independent[/tpl] Following this incident, Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help: I've got this problem and I have to live with it. I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can't sleep. 
The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such that he would not travel at all. In the build-up to Arsenal's Champions League match against Olympique Lyonnais in February 2001, Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/2998733/Wenger-might-quit-Arsenal-over-EU.html|title=Wenger might quit Arsenal over EU|first=Christopher|last=Davies|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 February 2001 |accessdate=12 December 2011 [/tpl]

==Style of play==

Bergkamp was schooled in Total Football, a playing style and philosophy which relied on versatility. This was primarily to maximise the footballer's potential; players tried out every outfield position before finding one that suit them best. Every age group at Ajax played in the same style and formation on the first team – 3–4–3 – to allow individuals to slot in without effort when moving up the pyramid. Bergkamp "played in every position apart from goalie" and believed he benefited from the experience of playing as a defender, as it helped him "know how they think and how to beat them". When he made his debut as a substitute against Roda JC, Bergkamp was positioned on the right wing, where he remained for three years. During his time at Inter Milan, he was switched to a main striker, but failed to cooperate with partner Ruben Sosa, whom he later called "selfish". When Bergkamp joined Arsenal in 1995, he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with Wright, and in later seasons Anelka and Henry, playing in his preferred position as a second striker. The arrival of Overmars in the 1997–98 season enhanced Bergkamp's play, as he was getting more of the ball. Between August and October 1997, he scored seven goals in seven league matches.[tpl]sfn|Palmer|p=81[/tpl] A similar rapport developed between him and Ljungberg during the 2001–02 season.
Throughout his playing career Bergkamp was referred to as a "cheat" and "dirty player", something his former manager Wenger refuted.[tpl]cite news|title=Bergkamp cleared in dive cheat row |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60706357.html |newspaper=The Mirror |location=London |date=20 January 1998 |accessdate=30 April 2012[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Bergkamp treats the Newcastle fans to wrong kind of trickery |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-97384039.html |newspaper=The Mirror |location=London |date=10 February 2003 |accessdate=30 April 2012|last=Holt|first=Oliver[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Bergkamp is not dirty, says Wenger |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3036972/Bergkamp-is-not-dirty-says-Wenger.html |work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=29 October 2002 |accessdate=30 April 2012 [/tpl] In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter Milan, he realized the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: "A lot of people there try to hurt you, not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, it was a case of two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing." Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.
