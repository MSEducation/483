[[Vocative case]]

CATEGORIES: Grammatical cases

The vocative case (abbreviated [tpl]sc|voc[/tpl]) is the case used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object, etc.) being addressed or, occasionally, the determiners of that noun. A vocative expression is an expression of direct address where the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. For example, in the sentence, "I don't know, John," John is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed—as opposed to the sentence, "I don't know John," where John is the direct object of the verb "know."
Historically, the vocative case was an element of the Indo-European system of cases, and existed in Latin, Sanskrit, and Classical Greek. Many modern Indo-European languages have lost the vocative case. Many, however, retain it, first and foremost the Baltic languages and most Slavic languages.
Some linguists[tpl]who|date=November 2013[/tpl] argue that the vocative form is not a case but a special form of nouns not belonging to any case, since vocative expressions are not related syntactically to other words in sentences.[tpl]lang-ru|[/tpl]Реформатский А.

==The vocative case in Indo-European languages==

===Comparison of Indo-European languages===

Distinct vocative forms are assumed to have existed in all early Indo-European languages, and they have survived in some. Take, for example, the Indo-European word for "wolf" in various languages:

===Slavic languages===

====Bulgarian====

Unlike other Slavic languages, Bulgarian has entirely lost its noun declension. However, Bulgarian preserves its vocative case. Traditional male names usually have a vocative case.
More recent names and foreign names may have a vocative form but it is not used (Ричарде, instead of simply Ричард (Richard) sounds strange and funny).
Vocative phrases like господин министре (Mr. Minister) have almost completely been replaced by corresponding common case forms, especially in official writing. Proper nouns usually also have vocative forms, even though they are used less frequently. The following are examples of proper nouns that are frequently used in vocative:
Vocative case forms also normally exist for female given names:
Except for forms that end in -е, these are considered rude, and are normally avoided. Exception are female kinship terms, whose vocative is always used: баба/бабо (Granny), мама/мамо (Mom), леля/лельо (aunt), сестра/сестро (sister).

====Czech====

In Czech, the vocative (5. pád) differs from the nominative in masculine and feminine nouns in singular. Two exceptions, where Vocative and Nominative case are undistinguishable, are mentioned in the following table.
And in predicative constructions:

===Arabic===

Properly speaking, Arabic only has three cases, the nominative, accusative and genitive. However, a meaning similar to that conveyed by the vocative case in other languages is indicated by the use of the particle yā ([tpl]lang-ar|يا[/tpl]) placed before a noun. In English translations, this is often translated literally as O instead of being omitted.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mjiyad/Arabic%20Grammar%20Book.doc |title=A Hundred and One Rules!

===Beijing Mandarin===

In the Beijing accent of Mandarin Chinese, when expressing strong feeling (especially negative feelings) to some one, "ei" is added to the word you address the one you are calling, and the "ei" is stressed. The most common one is adding "ei" to "孙子" (sunzi, lit. "grandson"), to form a sunzei, which means approximately "Hey you nasty one!"

===Georgian===

In Georgian, the vocative case is used for addressing the second singular and plural persons. For the word roots that end with a consonant, the vocative case suffix is -o, and for the words that end with a vowel the suffix for the vocative case is  -v as it was in old Georgian, but for some words it is considered archaic. For example, kats- is the root for the word "man." If one addresses someone with this word, it becomes, kats'o'!
Adjectives are also declined in the vocative case. Just like nouns, consonant final stem adjectives take the suffix -o in the vocative case, and the vowel final stems are not changed. Compare:
In the second phrase, both the adjective and the noun are declined. The second singular and plural personal pronouns are also declined in the vocative case. Shen you(singular) and tkven you (plural) in the vocative case become, she! and tkve!, with the drop of the final -n. Therefore one could, for instance, say,
She lamazo kalo! "you beautiful woman!"
with the declination of all the elements.

===Korean===

The vocative case in Korean is commonly used with first names in casual situations. This is done by suffixing 아 (a) if the name ends in a consonant and 야 (ya) if in a vowel:
미진은 집에 가겠어? (Mijin-eun chibe kagesseo?) 
"Is Mijin going home?"
미진아, 집에 가겠어? (Mijin-a, chibe kagesseo?) 
"Mijin, are you going home?
동배 뭐 해? (Dongbae meo hae?) 
What is Dongbae doing?
동배야, 뭐 해? (Dongbae-ya, meo hae?) 
"Dongbae, what are you doing?
In formal and somewhat archaic Korean, words are suffixed with 여 (yeo) if they end in a vowel and 이여 (iyeo) if they end in a consonant. The use of these suffixes is similar to that of the Japanese よ. Thus, 少年よ、大志を抱け (a quote by William S. Clark) would be translated as
청년들이여 대망을 가져라. (Cheongnyeondeul-iyeo, taemangeul kajyeora.) 
Boys, be ambitious.
