==Jurisdiction==

The jurisdiction for legislation of protected areas within South Australia and the immediate onshore waters known officially as ‘the coastal waters and waters within the limits of South Australia' belongs to the South Australian government.[tpl]cite web|title=Australia’s offshore jurisdiction: explanation of terminology in relation to petroleum exploration and development|url=http://www.ret.gov.au/resources/Documents/upstream-petroleum/Australia%C3%86s_Offshore_Jurisdiction.pdf|publisher=The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism|accessdate=17 March 2013|pages=11[/tpl]  The major piece of legislation concerned with the creation and the subsequent management of protected areas is the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.  Protected areas created by this Act form the majority of South Australia’s contribution to the National Reserve System.[tpl]cite web|title=New parks and park additions (including National Reserve System (NRS) Program)|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/Park_management/New_parks_park_additions|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]  
Other state legislation that may create protected areas include the following: Forestry Act 1950, Wilderness Protection Act 1992, Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981, River Murray Act 2003, Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act 2005, Fisheries Management Act 2007, Marine Parks Act 2007, Crown Land Management Act 2009 and Arkaroola Protection Act 2012.
While the Australian Government does not have the power under the Australian constitution to legislate for protected areas within South Australia, its treaty obligations and its constitutional responsibilities do permit it to develop policy for protected areas and to enter into agreements concerning protected areas.  Examples include nomination of sites under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) and establishment of agreements for Indigenous Protected Areas.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
