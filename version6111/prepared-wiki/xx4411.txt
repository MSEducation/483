Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist, and lecturer. She was the first deafblind person to earn a bachelor of arts degree.[tpl]cite web|title=Helen Keller FAQ|publisher=Perkins School for the Blind|url=http://www.perkins.org/vision-loss/helen-keller|accessdate=December 25, 2010[/tpl] The story of how Keller's teacher, Anne Sullivan, broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become widely known through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.  Her birthday on June 27 is commemorated as Helen Keller Day in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and was authorized at the federal level by presidential proclamation by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, the 100th anniversary of her birth.
A prolific author, Keller was well-travelled and outspoken in her convictions. A member of the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned for women's suffrage, labor rights, socialism, and other radical left causes. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.awhf.org/inductee.html|title=Inductees|work=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|publisher=State of Alabama|accessdate=February 20, 2012[/tpl]

==Early childhood and illness==

Helen Adams Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Her family lived on a homestead, Ivy Green,[tpl]cite web|title=Helen Keller Birthplace|url=http://www.helenkellerbirthplace.org|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl] that Helen's grandfather had built decades earlier.[tpl]Citation|title=The Southern Ties of Helen Keller|year=2007|author=Nielsen, Kim E.|journal=Journal of Southern History|volume=73|issue=4[/tpl]

Keller|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] spent many years as an editor for the Tuscumbia North Alabamian, and had served as a captain for the Confederate Army. Her paternal grandmother was the second cousin of Robert E. Lee.[tpl]Citation|title=The Story of my Life: The Restored Classic|last1=Herrmann|first1=Dorothy|last2=Keller|first2=Helen|last3=Shattuck|first3=Roger |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qc0CBfqMffUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2003|pages=12–14|isbn=978-0-393-32568-3|accessdate=May 14, 2010[/tpl] Her mother, Kate Adams,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/braillebug/hkgallery.asp?frameid=4|title=Kate Adams Keller|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] was the daughter of Charles W.

Her paternal lineage was traced to Casper Keller, a native of Switzerland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/braillebug/askkeller.asp?issueid=200511|title=American Foundation for the Blind|publisher=Afb.org|date=June 1, 1968|accessdate=August 24, 2010[/tpl] One of Helen's Swiss ancestors was the first teacher for the deaf in Zurich. Keller reflected on this coincidence in her first autobiography, stating "that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his."
Helen Keller was born with the ability to see and hear.  At 19 months old, she contracted an illness described by doctors as "an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain", which might have been scarlet fever or meningitis. The illness left her both deaf and blind. At that time, she was able to communicate somewhat with Martha Washington,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=729&pageno=11|title=The Story of My Life|author=Helen Keller|page=11|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] the six-year-old daughter of the family cook, who understood her signs; by the age of seven, Keller had more than 60 home signs to communicate with her family.
In 1886, Keller's mother, inspired by an account in Charles Dickens' American Notes of the successful education of another deaf and blind woman, Laura Bridgman, dispatched young Helen, accompanied by her father, to seek out physician J. Julian Chisolm, an eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist in Baltimore, for advice.[tpl]Cite book|last=Worthington|first=W. Curtis|title=A Family Album: Men Who Made the Medical Center|url=http://www.muschealth.com/about_us/history/chislom.htm|edition=Medical University of South Carolina|isbn=978-0-87152-444-7[/tpl] Chisholm referred the Kellers to Alexander Graham Bell, who was working with deaf children at the time. Bell advised them to contact the Perkins Institute for the Blind, the school where Bridgman had been educated, which was then located in South Boston. Michael Anagnos, the school's director, asked 20-year-old former student Anne Sullivan, herself visually impaired, to become Keller's instructor. It was the beginning of a 49-year-long relationship during which Sullivan evolved into Keller's governess and eventually her companion.
Anne Sullivan arrived at Keller's house in March 1887, and immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with "d-o-l-l" for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller was frustrated, at first, because she did not understand that every object had a word uniquely identifying it. In fact, when Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for "mug", Keller became so frustrated she broke the doll.[tpl]Cite book|last=Wilkie|first=Katherine E.|title=Helen Keller: Handicapped Girl|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis, IN[/tpl] Keller's big breakthrough in communication came the next month, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of "water"; she then nearly exhausted Sullivan demanding the names of all the other familiar objects in her world.

==Formal education==

Starting in May 1888, Keller attended the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1894, Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, and to learn from Sarah Fuller at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts and Keller entered The Cambridge School for Young Ladies before gaining admittance, in 1900, to Radcliffe College, where she lived in Briggs Hall, South House. Her admirer, Mark Twain, had introduced her to Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers, who, with his wife Abbie, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated from Radcliffe, becoming the first deaf blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a correspondence with the Austrian philosopher and pedagogue Wilhelm Jerusalem, who was one of the first to discover her literary talent.Herbert Gantschacher "Back from History! – The correspondence of letters between the Austrian-Jewish philosopher Wilhelm Jerusalem and the American deafblind writer Helen Keller", Gebärdensache, Vienna 2009, p. 35ff.
Determined to communicate with others as conventionally as possible, Keller learned to speak, and spent much of her life giving speeches and lectures. She learned to "hear" people's speech by reading their lips with her hands—her sense of touch had become extremely subtle. She became proficient at using brailleSpecifically, the reordered alphabet known as American Braille and reading sign language with her hands as well.[tpl]Issue|date=September 2011[/tpl] Shortly before World War I, with the assistance of the Zoellner Quartet she determined that by placing her fingertips on a resonant tabletop she could experience music played close by."First Number Citizens Lecture Course Monday, November Fifth", The Weekly Spectrum, North Dakota Agricultural College, Volume XXXVI no. 3, November 7, 1917.

==Companions==

Anne Sullivan stayed as a companion to Helen Keller long after she taught her. Anne married John Macy in 1905, and her health started failing around 1914. Polly Thomson was hired to keep house. She was a young woman from Scotland who had no experience with deaf or blind people. She progressed to working as a secretary as well, and eventually became a constant companion to Keller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.graceproducts.com/keller/life.html|title=The Life of Helen Keller|publisher=Graceproducts.com|accessdate=August 24, 2010[/tpl]
Keller moved to Forest Hills, Queens, together with Anne and John, and used the house as a base for her efforts on behalf of the American Foundation for the Blind.The life of Helen Keller, Royal National Institute of Blind People, last updated November 20, 2008. Retrieved June 17, 2009.
Anne Sullivan died in 1936 after a coma, with Keller holding her hand.Herrmann, p. 255. Keller and Thomson moved to Connecticut. They traveled worldwide and raised funds for the blind. Thomson had a stroke in 1957 from which she never fully recovered, and died in 1960.[tpl]cite web|title=The life of Helen Keller|publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People|date=November 20, 2008|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_keller.hcsp|accessdate=January 22, 2009[/tpl]
Winnie Corbally, a nurse who was originally brought in to care for Thompson in 1957, stayed on after her death and was Keller's companion for the rest of her life.

==Political activities==

Keller went on to become a world-famous speaker and author. She is remembered as an advocate for people with disabilities, amid numerous other causes. She was a suffragist, a pacifist, an opponent of Woodrow Wilson, a radical socialist and a birth control supporter. In 1915 she and George Kessler founded the Helen Keller International (HKI) organization. This organization is devoted to research in vision, health and nutrition. In 1920 she helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Keller traveled to 40-some-odd countries with Sullivan, making several trips to Japan and becoming a favorite of the Japanese people. Keller met every U.S. President from Grover Cleveland to Lyndon B. Johnson and was friends with many famous figures, including Alexander Graham Bell, Charlie Chaplin and Mark Twain. Keller and Twain were both considered radicals at the beginning of the 20th century, and as a consequence, their political views have been forgotten or glossed over in popular perception.
Keller was a member of the Socialist Party and actively campaigned and wrote in support of the working class from 1909 to 1921. She supported Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs in each of his campaigns for the presidency.
Newspaper columnists who had praised her courage and intelligence before she expressed her socialist views now called attention to her disabilities. The editor of the Brooklyn Eagle wrote that her "mistakes sprung out of the manifest limitations of her development." Keller responded to that editor, referring to having met him before he knew of her political views: [tpl]quote|At that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that I blush to remember them. But now that I have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that I am blind and deaf and especially liable to error. I must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since I met him. ... Oh, ridiculous Brooklyn Eagle! Socially blind and deaf, it defends an intolerable system, a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent.[tpl]cite web|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=How I Became a Socialist|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/keller-helen/works/1910s/12_11_03.htm|accessdate=August 27, 2007[/tpl][/tpl]
Keller joined the Industrial Workers of the World (the IWW, known as the Wobblies) in 1912,[tpl]Cite book|last=Loewen|first=James W. | authorlink = James W. Loewen|title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong|edition=Touchstone Edition|origyear=1995|year=1996|publisher=Touchstone Books|location=New York, NY|pages=20–22|isbn=978-0-684-81886-3[/tpl] saying that parliamentary socialism was "sinking in the political bog". She wrote for the IWW between 1916 and 1918. In Why I Became an IWW,"Why I Became an IWW" in Helen Keller Reference Archive from An interview written by Barbara Bindley [tpl]Who|date=January 2013[/tpl], published in the New York Tribune, January 16, 1916 Keller explained that her motivation for activism came in part from her concern about blindness and other disabilities:[tpl]quote|I was appointed on a commission to investigate the conditions of the blind. For the first time I, who had thought blindness a misfortune beyond human control, found that too much of it was traceable to wrong industrial conditions, often caused by the selfishness and greed of employers. And the social evil contributed its share. I found that poverty drove women to a life of shame that ended in blindness.[/tpl]
The last sentence refers to prostitution and syphilis, the former a frequent cause of the latter, and the latter a leading cause of blindness. In the same interview, Keller also cited the 1912 strike of textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts for instigating her support of socialism.

==Writings==

Keller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles.
One of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was The Frost King (1891). There were allegations that this story had been plagiarized from The Frost Fairies by Margaret Canby. An investigation into the matter revealed that Keller may have experienced a case of cryptomnesia, which was that she had Canby's story read to her but forgot about it, while the memory remained in her subconscious.
At age 22, Keller published her autobiography, The Story of My Life (1903), with help from Sullivan and Sullivan's husband, John Macy. It recounts the story of her life up to age 21 and was written during her time in college.
Keller wrote The World I Live In in 1908, giving readers an insight into how she felt about the world.[tpl]Cite book| last = Keller | first = Helen | title = The World I Live In | url = | edition = NYRB Classics 2004 | origyear = 1908 | year = 2004 | publisher = NYRB Classics | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-59017-067-0[/tpl] Out of the Dark, a series of essays on socialism, was published in 1913.
When Keller was young, Anne Sullivan introduced her to Phillips Brooks, who introduced her to Christianity, Keller famously saying: "I always knew He was there, but I didn't know His name!"[tpl]cite book|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&pg=PA591&dq=Helen+Keller+didn't+know+His+name#v=onepage&q=Helen%20Keller%20didn't%20know%20His%20name&f=false|title =Willmington's Guide to the Bible|author=H.

Anne called for Phillips Brooks, the most famous preacher in Boston. With Sullivan interpreting for him, he talked to Helen Keller about Christ. It wasn't long until a smile lighted up her face.

Her spiritual autobiography, My Religion, was published in 1927 and then in 1994 extensively revised and re-issued under the title Light in My Darkness. It advocates the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, the Christian revelator and theologian who gives a spiritual interpretation of the teachings of the Bible and who claims that the second coming of Jesus Christ has already taken place.  Adherents use several names to describe themselves, including Second Advent Christian, Swedenborgian, and New Church.
Keller described the progressive views of her belief in these words:
 
 But in Swedenborg's teaching it Providence is shown to be the government of God's Love and Wisdom and the creation of uses. Since His Life cannot be less in one being than another, or His Love manifested less fully in one thing than another, His Providence must needs be universal . . . He has provided religion of some kind everywhere, and it does not matter to what race or creed anyone belongs if he is faithful to his ideals of right living.[tpl]cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=My Religion|year=1927|publisher=Doubleday, Page and Company|location=Garden City, NY|pages=177–178[/tpl] 

==Akita dog==

When Keller visited Akita Prefecture in Japan in July 1937, she inquired about Hachikō, the famed Akita dog that had died in 1935. She told a Japanese person that she would like to have an Akita dog; one was given to her within a month, with the name of Kamikaze-go. When he died of canine distemper, his older brother, Kenzan-go, was presented to her as an official gift from the Japanese government in July 1938. Keller is credited with having introduced the Akita to the United States through these two dogs.
By 1939 a breed standard had been established, and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after World War II began. Keller wrote in the Akita Journal:
[tpl]quote|If ever there was an angel in fur, it was Kamikaze. I know I shall never feel quite the same tenderness for any other pet. The Akita dog has all the qualities that appeal to me – he is gentle, companionable and trusty.The Akita Inu: The Voice of Japan by Rick Beauchamp in Dog & Kennel[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.natural-akita.com/JPTeez/html/helen_keller.html |title=Helen Keller: First Akitas in the USA |publisher=Natural-akita.com |date=June 14, 1937 |accessdate=August 24, 2010[/tpl][/tpl]

==Later life==

Keller suffered a series of strokes in 1961 and spent the last years of her life at her home.
On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the United States' two highest civilian honors.  In 1965 she was elected to the National Women's Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair.
Keller devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the American Foundation for the Blind. She died in her sleep on June 1, 1968, at her home, Arcan Ridge, located in Easton, Connecticut, a few weeks short of her eighty-eighth birthday. A service was held in her honor at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and her ashes were placed there next to her constant companions, Anne Sullivan and Polly Thomson.

==Portrayals==

Keller's life has been interpreted many times. She appeared in a silent film, Deliverance (1919), which told her story in a melodramatic, allegorical style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010061/|accessdate=June 15, 2006|title=Deliverance (1919)[/tpl]
She was also the subject of the documentaries Helen Keller in Her Story, narrated by Katharine Cornell, and The Story of Helen Keller, part of the Famous Americans series produced by Hearst Entertainment.
The Miracle Worker is a cycle of dramatic works ultimately derived from her autobiography, The Story of My Life. The various dramas each describe the relationship between Keller and Sullivan, depicting how the teacher led her from a state of almost feral wildness into education, activism, and intellectual celebrity. The common title of the cycle echoes Mark Twain's description of Sullivan as a "miracle worker." Its first realization was the 1957 Playhouse 90 teleplay of that title by William Gibson. He adapted it for a Broadway production in 1959 and an Oscar-winning feature film in 1962, starring Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. It was remade for television in 1979 and 2000.
In 1984, Keller's life story was made into a TV movie called The Miracle Continues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087401/|accessdate=June 15, 2006|title=Helen Keller: The Miracle Continues (1984) (TV)[/tpl] This film that entailed the semi-sequel to The Miracle Worker recounts her college years and her early adult life. None of the early movies hint at the social activism that would become the hallmark of Keller's later life, although a Disney version produced in 2000 states in the credits that she became an activist for social equality.
The Bollywood movie Black (2005) was largely based on Keller's story, from her childhood to her graduation. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
A documentary called Shining Soul: Helen Keller's Spiritual Life and Legacy was produced by the Swedenborg Foundation in the same year. The film focuses on the role played by Emanuel Swedenborg's spiritual theology in her life and how it inspired Keller's triumph over her triple disabilities of blindness, deafness and a severe speech impediment.
