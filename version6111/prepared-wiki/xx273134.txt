==Branding and marketing==

The slogan for PBS America is "Where television matters".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-sales-to-represent-pbs-uk|title=Channel 4 Sales to represent PBS UK|publisher=Channel 4|date=17 October 2011[/tpl] Channel 4's Channel 4 Sales division is the exclusive advertising sales representative for the network. The general manager of PBS UK said of the pick, "In the States, PBS is well-loved and trusted for its award-winning programming, so it was essential for us to select a company capable of delivering a high quality viewing experience throughout the ad-breaks as well. There's an obvious fit between our two brands and we're delighted to be represented by Channel 4."
Branding and design agency Dunning Penney Jones was appointed to create the channel's on-air look and feel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1097998/pbs-uk-appoints-dunning-penney-jones-on-air-branding/|title=PBS UK appoints Dunning Penney Jones for on-air branding|publisher=Campaign|date=11 October 2011[/tpl] As well as repurposing the PBS branding used in the US, they created new idents specifically for the UK channel. The agency also designed four colour themes for each of PBS America's four key programming strands for use on the channel, website and any off-air marketing.
On 4 July 2012, PBS UK was rebranded as PBS America.
