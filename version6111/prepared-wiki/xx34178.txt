The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales[tpl]EW charity|207076[/tpl] and in Scotland.[tpl]Scottish charity|SC037654[/tpl] It was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson. It works to promote conservation and protection of birds and the wider environment through public awareness campaigns, petitions and through the operation of nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/fdIII/what_does_the_rspb_do_.asp |title=What does the RSPB do? |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070102193600/http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/fdIII/what_does_the_rspb_do_.asp  |archivedate=2 January 2007[/tpl]
The RSPB has 2,000 employees, 17,600 volunteers and more than 1 million members (including 150,000 youth members), making it the largest wildlife conservation charity in Europe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/ |title=About the RSPB |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007[/tpl] The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 200 nature reserves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/ |title=Reserves |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl]

==History==

The Plumage League[tpl]sfnp|Penna|1999|p=99[/tpl] was founded in 1889 by Emily Williamson at her house in Didsbury, Manchester, (now in Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp |title=Milestones  |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007[/tpl] as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007[/tpl]
The original members of the RSPB were all women who campaigned against the fashion of the time for women to wear exotic feathers in hats, and to this end the Society had two simple rules:
{{quote|
At the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 0.4 million birds from West India and Brazil, and 0.36 million birds from East India.[tpl]sfnp|Adams|2004|p=189[/tpl]
The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. As the organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton, it gained in popularity and attracted many new members. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII, and was instrumental in petitioning the Parliament of the United Kingdom to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.
At the time that the Society was founded in Britain, similar societies were also founded in other European countries.[tpl]sfnp|Boardman|2006|p=36[/tpl][tpl]which|date=October 2013[/tpl] In 1961, the society acquired The Lodge in Sandy, Bedfordshire as its new headquarters.

==Activities==

Today, the RSPB works with both the civil service and the Government to advise Government policies on conservation and environmentalism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/policy/waterwetlands/workingtogether/government.asp|title=Working Together: Government|publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070103074629/http://www.rspb.org.uk/policy/waterwetlands/workingtogether/government.asp  |archivedate=3 January 2007[/tpl] It is one of several organisations that determine the official conservation status list for all birds found in the UK.

===Reserves===

The RSPB maintains over 200 reserves throughout the United Kingdom, covering a wide range of habitats, from estuaries and mudflats to urban habitats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/habitat/index.asp |title=Reserves by habitat |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=20 February 2007[/tpl] The reserves often have bird hides provided for birdwatchers and many provide visitor centres, which include information about the wildlife that can be seen there.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/faq.asp |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=20 February 2007[/tpl]

===Awards===

The RSPB confers awards, including the President's Award, for volunteers who make a notable contribution to the work of the society.

====RSPB Medal====

The RSPB say:
 The RSPB Medal is the Society's most prestigious award. It is presented to an individual in recognition of wild bird protection and countryside conservation. It is usually awarded annually to one or occasionally two people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/media/releases/175798-gifted-naturalist-is-awarded-prestigious-rspb-medal|title=Gifted naturalist is awarded prestigious RSPB medal|last=Reynolds|first=James|date=2007-08-23|publisher=RSPB|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl]

===Magazines===

The RSPB has published a members-only magazine for over a century.

====Bird Notes====

Bird Notes and News ([tpl]ISSN|0406-3392[/tpl]) was first published in April 1903.
The title changed to Bird Notes in 1947. In the 1950s, there were four copies per year (one for each season, published on the 1st of each third month, March, June, September and December). Each volume covered two years, spread over three calendar years. For example, volume XXV (25), number one was dated Winter 1951, and number eight in the same volume was dated Autumn 1953.
From the mid-1950s, many of the covers were by Charles Tunnicliffe. Two of the originals are on long-term loan to the Tunnicliffe gallery at Oriel Ynys Môn, but in 1995 the RSPB sold 114 at a Sotheby's auction, raising £210,000, the most expensive being a picture of a partridge which sold for £6,440.RSPB Birds magazine, Vol 16 No 01, February–April 1996, page 10
From January 1964 (vol. 31, no. 1), publication increased to six per year, (issued in the odd-numbered months, January, March and so on, but dated "January–February", "March–April", etc.). Volumes again covered two years, so vol. 30, covering 1962–63, therefore included nine issues, ending with the "Winter 1963–64" edition instead of eight. The final edition, vol. 31 no. 12, was published in late 1965.

=====Editors=====

====Birds====

Bird Notes' successor Birds ([tpl]ISSN|1367-983X[/tpl]) replaced it immediately, with volume 1, number 1 being the January–February 1966 edition. Issues were published quarterly, numbered so that a new volume started every other year.
The Autumn 2013 edition, dated August–October 2013, being vol. 25 no. 7, was the last.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ward|first=Mark|date=Autumn 2013|title=Introducing your new magazine, Nature's Voice|journal=Birds|volume=25|issue=7|issn=1367-983X[/tpl]

=====Editors=====

Birds had eleven credited editors during its 47-year, 199 edition run. There were some dual editorships at times of change-over.

====Nature's Home====

In Winter 2013 Birds was replaced by a new magazine, Nature's Home.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/natureshomemagazine/archive/2013/09/30/nature-39-s-home-is-coming.aspx |title=Nature's Home is coming... |date=30 September 2013 |publisher=RSPB |first=Mark |last=Ward |accessdate=15 October 2013[/tpl] The editor was Mark Ward.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nature's Home|issue=Winter 2013[/tpl] The magazine had an ABC-certified circulation of 600,885.

===Junior divisions===

The RSPB has two separate groups for children and teenagers: Wildlife Explorers (founded in 1943 as the Junior Bird Recorders' Club; from 1965–2000 the Young Ornithologists Club or YOC) and RSPB Phoenix. Wildlife Explorers is targeted at children aged between 8 and 12, although it also has some younger members,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/volunteering/type/communitygroups/youthgroups.asp|title=About youth groups |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=20 February 2007[/tpl] and has two different magazines: Wild Times for the under 8s and Bird Life for those over 8. RSPB Phoenix is aimed at teenagers, and produces Wingbeat magazine, although members also receive Bird Life magazine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/join/gift.asp|title=Gift Membership |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=20 February 2007[/tpl] The RSPB is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncvys.org.uk/index.php?page=392 |title=Full list of NCVYS members |publisher=Ncvys.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]

===Big Garden Birdwatch===

RSPB organises bird record data collection in annual collective birdwatching days in Britain. RSPB claims this is the "world's biggest wildlife survey" and helps that society to get a better knowledge on bird population trends in Britain.Birds. Spring 2013 vol. 25, nº5. February – April 2013. page 18. That activity was launched in 1979 as an activity for kids, although from 2001 is a survey open to adults too. In 2011 over 600,000 people took part, being only 37% RSPB's members. The usual date for this birdwatching collective activity is the January's last weekend. From the start of this annual survey records for sparrows show a decline of 60%, while starling population's decline is about 80% from 1979 to 2012.

==State of Nature Report==

In 2013 the RSBP and a collaborative partnership of 25 UK conservation and research organisations published the first United Kingdom State of Nature Report, and which generally found a profound decline in native wildlife species in recent years: "The report reveals that 60 per cent of the species studied have declined over recent decades. More than one in ten of all the species assessed are under threat of disappearing from our shores altogether."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/science/stateofnature/index.aspx |title=RSBP State of Nature Report| accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
The report encompasses the islands of the UK and overseas territories, and provides a number of possible reasons for the cited declines, including for climate change, intensive farming methods, and habitat degradation. It is hoped that the report will increase public awareness and promote conservation measures and government policy locally and nationally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/22609000 |title=BBC Nature Article: How to help wildlife |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]

==Finances==

The RSPB is funded primarily by its members; in 2006, over 50% of the society's £88 million income came from subscriptions, donations and legacies, worth a total of £ 53.669 million. As a registered charity, the organisation is entitled to gift aid worth an extra £0.28 on every £1.00 donated by income tax payers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/giftaid/index.asp |title=Gift Aid |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007[/tpl] It also receives contractual payments from clean energy utilities and financiers of renewable energy solutions, when its members sign up as clients.[tpl]cite news |last=Dellingpole |first=James |title=RSPB makes a killing... from windfarm giants behind turbines accused of destroying rare birds |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2305197/RSPB-makes-killing--windfarm-giants-turbines-accused-destroying-rare-birds.html|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=7 April 2013[/tpl] The bulk of the income (£63.757 million in 2006) is spent on conservation projects, maintenance of the reserves and on education projects, with the rest going on fundraising efforts and reducing the pension deficit, worth £19.8 million in 2006.
