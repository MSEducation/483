ChemCentre (formerly Chemistry Centre W.A.) is an analytical chemistry facility in Perth, Western Australia.  It has an extensive history and delivers analytical, consultative and investigative chemical services to a range of government agency, industry and research clients.
Its role includes the provision of forensic scientific services to the Police Service and the State Coroner, scientific information and advice relating to agriculture, the environment, natural resources and health to government agencies, industry and research groups, and an emergency response facility for incidents such as chemical spills, terrorism, food safety or export incidents and health or environment concerns.
The Centre is the oldest NATA accredited facility in Australia and were established in the 1890s, originally formed to enforce the then recently declared Explosives Act.
The centre was situated for many years in the inner city suburb of East Perth, but in 2009 it moved into a new building in the Resources and Chemistry Precinct at Curtin University.
