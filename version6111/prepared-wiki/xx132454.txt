==Box Office & Trivia==

This film is based on the celebrated novel by Yandamuri Veerendranath Marana Mrudangam. Being a long novel, it had to be trimmed, without losing the essence. Veerendranath himself did it in the screenplay, by establishing relataionships between the characters. However, many details to boost the heroism were added to the screenplay, to ensure the commercial success of the movie.
