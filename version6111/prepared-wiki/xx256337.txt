==The 26th Congress==

In his speech to the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), Leonid Brezhnev told the delegates that the main goal of the Eleventh Five–Year Plan was to transition the Soviet economy from extensive to intensive growth, and to further improve the standard of living by 18–20 percent by 1985.Dellenbråt 1986, p. 109. He also told the Congress that the 1979 economic reform, initiated by Alexei Kosygin, would be of major importance to the five-year plan's success.Dellenbråt 1986, pp. 109–110. Other goals were halting migration from East to West and South to North as well as ensuring economic growth. By 1981 the majority of Soviet economic centers were located in underdeveloped areas, such as Siberia and Central Asia. According to the Soviet government, the solution was to reduce social differences in the republics, oblasts and sub-regional units—in Brezhnev's words to establish an "effective demographic policy".Dellenbråt 1986, p. 110. However, according to the Soviet government, the socioeconomic development of the Soviet Republics had been evened out due to the altruism of the Russian people, such that developmental differences between republics were no longer a problem.Dellenbråt 1986, pp. 110–111.
Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, told the Congress that industrial output would grow by an estimated 26-28 percent during the five-year plan and capital investment by between 12–15 percent over the preceding plan. Tikhonov criticised what he saw as inefficiencies within the planned economy, placing most of the blame on low labour productivity, which as a result was targeted to grow by 23–25 percent, an increase of 6–8 percent over the preceding plan.Dellenbråt 1986, p. 111. "The basic guidelines for the USSR's economic and social development in 1981–85 and the period up to 1990", an economic plan proposed by Tikhonov, was adopted by the Congress. The five key points of Tikhonov's economic plan were:Dellenbråt 1986, pp. 111–112.
In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that Soviet agriculture had failed to produce enough grain. He called for improvements in Soviet–US relations, but dismissed all speculation that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis.[tpl]cite web | author = | title = Tikhonov Bids for U.S. Trade | location = | work = Reading Eagle | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=090hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=66AFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2515,4061259&dq=nikolai-tikhonov&hl=en | date = 27 February 1981 [/tpl] However, he went on to admit that there were  economic "shortcomings" and acknowledged the ongoing "food problem". Other topics for discussion were the need to save energy resources and to improve the quality of Soviet produced goods.[tpl]cite web | author = | title = Soviets put squeeze on U.S. for summit | location = | work = Tri-City Herald | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sm4hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yocFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3468,8470106&dq=nikolai-tikhonov&hl=en | date = 27 February 1981 [/tpl]
