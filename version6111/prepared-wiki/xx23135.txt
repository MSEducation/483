Bridalveil Fall is one of the most prominent waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley in California, seen yearly by millions of visitors to Yosemite National Park.The official name is singular, see [tpl]Gnis|257449|Bridalveil Fall[/tpl]. 
The waterfall is [tpl]convert|188|m|ft[/tpl] in height and flows year round.[tpl]cite web | title=Things to see  | work=Yosemite National Park | url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/trip/inyose.htm  | accessdate=2005-09-20 [/tpl] 
The Ahwahneechee tribe believed that Bridalveil Fall was home to a vengeful spirit named Pohono which guarded the entrance to the valley, and that those leaving the valley must not look directly into the waterfall lest they be cursed. They also believed that inhaling the mist of Bridalveil Fall would improve one's chances of marriage.

==Geology==

The glaciers that carved Yosemite Valley left many hanging valleys which spawned the waterfalls that pour into the valley. All of the waterways that fed these falls carved the hanging valleys into steep cascades with the exception of Bridalveil Fall. Bridalveil Creek still leaps into the valley from the edge of the precipice, although that edge has moved back into an alcove from the original edge of the valley. While Yosemite Falls seem to also fall into this category, the original course took the Yosemite Creek down a gorge to the west of its current location. The primary source of Bridalveil Falls is Ostrander Lake, some [tpl]convert|16|km|mi[/tpl] to the south.
When the wind blows briskly, the waterfall will appear to be falling sideways. During lesser water flow, the falls often don't reach the ground. Because of this, the Ahwahneechee Native Americans called this waterfall Pohono, which means Spirit of the Puffing Wind.[tpl]cite book | last=Kroeber | first=A.L. | coauthors= | title=Indians of Yosemite | location=Berkeley | publisher=California Indian Library Collections  distributor| year=1993 | oclc=58867540 | url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/handbook_of_yosemite_national_park/indians.html| accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]
