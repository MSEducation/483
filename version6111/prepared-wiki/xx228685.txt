The Open Bay Islands skink (or Open Bay Island skink), Oligosoma taumakae, is a species of skink.  It was described from the Open Bay Islands, off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. This species is diagnosed on the basis of several morphological characteristics, and its specific status is supported by mitochondrial sequence data (ND2, ND4). The new species appears to be most closely related to Oligosoma acrinasum, Oligosoma infrapunctatum, Oligosoma otagense and Oligosoma waimatense. Predation by a flightless rail, the weka, which is native to New Zealand, but was introduced to the Open Bay Islands, is a major conservation concern.Chapple, D.G.; Patterson, G.B. 2007: A new skink species (Oligosoma taumakae sp. nov.; Reptilia: Scincidae) from the Open Bay Islands, New Zealand.
