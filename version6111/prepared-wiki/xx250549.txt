==Biography==

Carmen Elias Lebbos was born in Beirut; to a working-class modest living family,she had early ambitions to be in show business. At the age of 12, she had the opportunity to become a dancer in a troupe (in view of her height 1m. 73 cm), but this move was forbidden by her strict father. At the age of 14, she ran away from home to get married, but later returned to Beirut with her one-year-old baby after she realized it was a mistake and felt trapped in the marriage.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Aged sixteen, she wanted to join the Academy of Arts to study acting, and hoped to meet Ziad Rahbani, from whom she would learn many of her acting techniques. Lebbos would be involved in a 15-year romantic relationship with Ziad Rahbani (after his separation and divorce from his estranged ex-wife Dalal Karam) but Lebbos broke it off after realizing Rahabani couldn't provide her with the stability she wanted. In one of her rare interviews, in which she accepted to talk about her relationship with Rahbani, Carmen maintained that he was simply the man she once loved, adding that "never, during all the 15 years of being together 24 hours a day, did I regard Ziad in the light other people saw him in. To me he was the man I loved and lived with and drank coffee with every morning... And that is that.”http://www.wafamusic.com/Liban/ziad-rahbani/ziad-rahbani-308.htm
Her first actual mentor was Yaacoub Chedrawi, who taught her the basics of Theatre. At the end of the 1980s, she travelled to Paris to deepen her knowledge but found it impossible to live there with her son. So she attended intensive courses at the Academie des Beaux Arts in 1989, followed by cinematography courses at Oxford in 1990 and the School of Theater and Cinema (Paris) in 2003.
She is now a Board Member of Actors Syndicate since 2005.http://www.carmenleboss.com/biography.html
