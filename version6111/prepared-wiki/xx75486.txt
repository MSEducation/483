==History==

There are two theories where the initial ancient provincial capital was; one is the remains of Hazaka in the former Izushi District (currently Toyooka), the other is somewhere in the formar Keta District (currently Toyooka). In 804, the capital was moved to Takada in the former Keta District.[tpl]cite news|title=但馬国府はどこに? 日高町でシンポ|trans_title=Where was the Provincial Capital?|url=http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/rensai/cul/030.html|language=Japanese|newspaper=Kobe Shimbun|date=August 13, 2002|accessdate=April 10, 2012[/tpl]
