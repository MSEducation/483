===Corking===

Because Critical Mass takes place without an official route or sanction, participants in some cities have sometimes practiced a tactic known as "corking" in order to maintain the cohesion of the group. This tactic consists of a few riders blocking traffic from side roads so that the mass can freely proceed through red lights without interruption. Corking allows the mass to engage in a variety of activities, such as forming a cyclone, lifting their bikes in a tradition known as a "Bike Lift" (in Chicago this is referred to as a Chicago hold-up), or to perform a "die-in" where riders lie on the ground with their bikes to symbolise cyclist deaths and injuries caused by automobiles, very popular in Montreal. The "Corks" sometimes take advantage of their time corking to distribute fliers.
The practice of corking roads in order to pass through red lights as a group is in contravention of traffic laws in some jurisdictions and is sometimes criticized to be contrary to Critical Mass' claim that "we are traffic", since ordinary traffic does not have the right to go through intersections once the traffic signal has changed to red.[tpl]cite web|title=Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996 c.318 ss.119, 183 – Definitions, Cycle; Rights and Duties of Operator of Cycle |url=http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=%22rights+and+duties+of%22&language=en&searchTitle=British+Columbia&path=/en/bc/laws/stat/rsbc-1996-c-318/89130/part-6/rsbc-1996-c-318-part-6.html|work=Revised Statutes of British Columbia|publisher=CanLii|accessdate=August 3, 2011[/tpl] However, groups of cyclists are allowed to pass signals as a group at least in Germany and Austria.[tpl]cite web|title=§ 27 Straßenverkehrsordnung (Germany) |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo_2013/__27.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=§ 29 Straßenverkehrsordnung (Austria) |url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Dokumentnummer=NOR40065101[/tpl] Corking has sometimes led to hostility between motorists and riders, even erupting into violence and arrests of motorists and cyclists alike during Critical Mass rides.[tpl]cite news | title=2 bicyclists arrested at Critical Mass get out of jail | last=Gutierrez | first=Scott | publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date=July 3, 2006 | url=http://seattlepi.com/local/276237_sheriff03.html[/tpl]

San Jose is the home to the San Jose Bike Party.  Bike Party rides on the third Friday of the month with a different starting point and route each time. During the Winter and Fall months, rides are typically done through downtown and the southside of San Jose, while the summer months typically consist of rides in north San Jose and the surrounding pennisula communities. Rides are typically 20 – 25 miles in length and usually have 2,500 – 3,500 riders, with a peak of 4,300 in October 2009.  The ride aims to build a community of cyclists and prove that bikes can co-exist with cars.  It is different than Critical Mass in that it rides after rush hour and obeys all traffic laws and has a pre-determined route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sjbikeparty.org/how-we-ride|title=San Jose Bike Party – How We Ride!|accessdate=November 16, 2009[/tpl]

Some bicycling advocacy groups have expressed concern that the nature of Critical Mass and altercations with motorists could weaken public support for bicyclists. Though it does not condone incidents of violence and rudeness, the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition credits Critical Mass with spotlighting bicycle issues and aiding their efforts in advocating for cyclists.
