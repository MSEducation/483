Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ubiquitous family of large biological molecules that perform multiple vital roles in the coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. Together with DNA, RNA comprises the nucleic acids, which, along with proteins, constitute the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but is usually single-stranded. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (often notated using the letters G, A, U, and C for the nucleotides guanine, adenine, uracil and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins, while many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.
Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a  universal function whereby mRNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) links amino acids together to form proteins.

==Comparison with DNA==

The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three main ways:
Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold[ref]
Papercore summary http://papercore.org/Tinoco1999[/ref] and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.
In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis, like enzymes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Higgs PG|title=RNA secondary structure: physical and computational aspects|journal=Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics|year=2000|volume=33|pages=199–253|doi=10.1017/S0033583500003620|pmid = 11191843|issue=3 [/tpl] For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nissen P, Hansen J, Ban N, Moore PB, Steitz TA|title=The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis|journal=Science|year=2000|volume=289|issue=5481|pages=920–30|doi=10.1126/science.289.5481.920|pmid = 10937990|bibcode = 2000Sci...289..920N |last2=Hansen|last3=Ban|last4=Moore|last5=Steitz[/tpl]

==Structure==

Each nucleotide in RNA contains a ribose sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U). Adenine and guanine are purines, cytosine and uracil are pyrimidines. A phosphate group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each at physiological pH, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases form hydrogen bonds between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil. However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge,[tpl]cite book|title=RNA biochemistry and biotechnology|author=Barciszewski J, Frederic B, Clark C|year=1999|pages=73–87|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5862-7|oclc=52403776[/tpl]
or the GNRA tetraloop that has a guanine–adenine base-pair.[tpl]cite journal|author = Lee JC, Gutell RR|title = Diversity of base-pair conformations and their occurrence in rRNA structure and RNA structural motifs|journal = J.

An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA.[tpl]cite journal|author=Salazar M, Fedoroff OY, Miller JM, Ribeiro NS, Reid BR|title=The DNA strand in DNAoRNA hybrid duplexes is neither B-form nor A-form in solution|journal=Biochemistry|year=1992|volume=32|issue=16|pages=4207–15|pmid=7682844|doi=10.1021/bi00067a007[/tpl] This results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hermann T, Patel DJ|title=RNA bulges as architectural and recognition motifs|journal=Structure|year=2000|volume=8|issue=3|pages=R47–R54|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00110-6|pmid = 10745015 [/tpl] A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mikkola S, Nurmi K, Yousefi-Salakdeh E, Strömberg R, Lönnberg H|title=The mechanism of the metal ion promoted cleavage of RNA phosphodiester bonds involves a general acid catalysis by the metal aquo ion on the departure of the leaving group|journal=Perkin transactions 2|year=1999|pages=1619–26|doi=10.1039/a903691a|issue=8[/tpl]
RNA is transcribed with only four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil),[tpl]cite book|title=Clinical gene analysis and manipulation: Tools, techniques and troubleshooting|author=Jankowski JAZ, Polak JM|year=1996|page=14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-47896-0|oclc=33838261[/tpl] but these bases and attached sugars can be modified in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA).[tpl]cite journal|author=Yu Q, Morrow CD|title=Identification of critical elements in the tRNA acceptor stem and TΨC loop necessary for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity|journal=J Virol.|year=2001|volume=75|issue=10|pages=4902–6|doi=10.1128/JVI.75.10.4902-4906.2001|pmid = 11312362|pmc=114245 [/tpl] Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I).

There are more than 100 other naturally occurring modified nucleosides,[tpl]cite journal|last=Cantara|first=WA|coauthors=Crain, PF; Rozenski, J; McCloskey, JA; Harris, KA; Zhang, X; Vendeix, FA; Fabris, D; Agris, PF|title=The RNA Modification Database, RNAMDB: 2011 update|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=January 2011|volume=39|issue=Database issue|pages=D195–201|pmid=21071406|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1028|pmc=3013656[/tpl] The greatest structural diversity of modifications can be found in tRNA,[tpl]cite book|title=TRNA: Structure, biosynthesis, and function|author=Söll D, RajBhandary U|year=1995|page=165|publisher=ASM Press|isbn=1-55581-073-X|oclc=183036381 30663724[/tpl] while pseudouridine and nucleosides with 2'-O-methylribose often present in rRNA are the most common.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kiss T|title=Small nucleolar RNA-guided post-transcriptional modification of cellular RNAs|journal=The EMBO Journal|year=2001|volume=20|pages=3617–22|doi=10.1093/emboj/20.14.3617|pmid = 11447102|pmc=125535|issue=14[/tpl] The specific roles of many of these modifications in RNA are not fully understood. However, it is notable that, in ribosomal RNA, many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl transferase center and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.[tpl]cite journal|author=King TH, Liu B, McCully RR, Fournier MJ|title=Ribosome structure and activity are altered in cells lacking snoRNPs that form pseudouridines in the peptidyl transferase center|journal=Molecular Cell|year=2002|volume=11|issue=2|pages=425–35|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00040-6|pmid = 12620230[/tpl]
The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific tertiary structure. The scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary structural elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable "domains" of secondary structure like hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mathews DH, Disney MD, Childs JL, Schroeder SJ, Zuker M, Turner DH|title=Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure|journal=Proc.

==Synthesis==

Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme—RNA polymerase—using DNA as a template, a process known as transcription. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a promoter sequence in the DNA (usually found "upstream" of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the helicase activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nudler E, Gottesman ME|title=Transcription termination and anti-termination in E. coli|journal=Genes to Cells|year=2002|volume=7|pages=755–68|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00563.x|pmid = 12167155|issue=8 [/tpl]
Primary transcript RNAs are often modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap are added to eukaryotic pre-mRNA and introns are removed by the spliceosome.
There are also a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their template for synthesis of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material.[tpl]cite journal|author=Jeffrey L Hansen, Alexander M Long, Steve C Schultz|title=Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus|journal=Structure|year=1997|volume=5|issue=8|pages=1109–22|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(97)00261-X|pmid = 9309225 [/tpl] Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is part of the RNA interference pathway in many organisms.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ahlquist P|title=RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases, Viruses, and RNA Silencing|journal=Science|year=2002|volume=296|issue=5571|pages=1270–73|doi=10.1126/science.1069132|pmid = 12016304 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1270A [/tpl]

==Types of RNA==

===Overview===

Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome, the sites of protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. Many RNAs do not code for protein however (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes [tpl]cite journal|author=Mattick JS, Gagen MJ|title=The evolution of controlled multitasked gene networks: the role of introns and other noncoding RNAs in the development of complex organisms|journal=Mol.

These so-called non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded by their own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of translation.[tpl]cite book|author=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L|title= Biochemistry|edition=5th|pages =118–19, 781–808|publisher= WH Freeman and Company|year=2002|isbn= 0-7167-4684-0|oclc=179705944 48055706 59502128[/tpl] There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules,[tpl]cite journal|author=Rossi JJ|title=Ribozyme diagnostics comes of age|journal=Chemistry & Biology|year=2004|volume=11|issue=7|pages=894–95|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.07.002|pmid=15271347[/tpl] and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.

===In translation===

Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) correspond to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|edition=3rd|author=Cooper GC, Hausman RE|year=2004|pages=261–76, 297, 339–44|publisher=Sinauer|isbn=0-87893-214-3|oclc=174924833 52121379 52359301 56050609[/tpl] Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.
Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is found in many bacteria and plastids. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gueneau de Novoa P, Williams KP|title=The tmRNA website: reductive evolution of tmRNA in plastids and other endosymbionts|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=32|issue=Database issue|pages=D104–8|year=2004|pmid=14681369|doi=10.1093/nar/gkh102|pmc=308836[/tpl]

===Regulatory RNAs===

Several types of RNA can downregulate gene expression by being complementary to a part of an mRNA or a gene's DNA. MicroRNAs (miRNA; 21-22 nt) are found in eukaryotes and act through RNA interference (RNAi), where an effector complex of miRNA and enzymes can cleave complementary mRNA, block the mRNA from being translated, or accelerate its degradation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Wu L, Belasco JG|title=Let me count the ways: mechanisms of gene regulation by miRNAs and siRNAs|journal=Mol.

===In RNA processing===

Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.
Introns are spliced out of pre-mRNA by spliceosomes, which contain several small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.[tpl]cite journal|author=Steitz TA, Steitz JA|title=A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA|journal=Proc.

RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to other nucleotides than A, C, G and U.
In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60-300 nt),[tpl]cite book|title=Mining the transcriptome – methods and applications|url=http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:10803/FULLTEXT01|author=Wirta W|year=2006|isbn=91-7178-436-5|publisher=School of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology|location=Stockholm|oclc=185406288[/tpl] found in the nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification.[tpl]cite journal|author=Xie J, Zhang M, Zhou T, Hua X, Tang L, Wu W|title=Sno/scaRNAbase: a curated database for small nucleolar RNAs and cajal body-specific RNAs|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=35|pages=D183–7|year=2007|pmid=17099227|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl873|issue=Database issue|pmc=1669756[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Omer AD, Ziesche S, Decatur WA, Fournier MJ, Dennis PP|title=RNA-modifying machines in archaea|journal=Molecular Microbiology|year=2003|volume=48|issue=3|pages=617–29|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03483.x|pmid = 12694609[/tpl] RNA can also be methylated.[tpl]cite journal|author = Cavaillé J, Nicoloso M, Bachellerie JP|title = Targeted ribose methylation of RNA in vivo directed by tailored antisense RNA guides|journal = Nature|volume = 383|issue = 6602|pages = 732–5|year = 1996|pmid = 8878486|doi = 10.1038/383732a0 |bibcode = 1996Natur.383..732C |last2 = Nicoloso|last3 = Bachellerie[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author = Kiss-László Z, Henry Y, Bachellerie JP, Caizergues-Ferrer M, Kiss T|title = Site-specific ribose methylation of preribosomal RNA: a novel function for small nucleolar RNAs|journal = Cell|volume = 85|issue = 7|pages = 1077–88|year = 1996|pmid = 8674114|doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81308-2 [/tpl]

===RNA genomes===

Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.[tpl]cite journal|author=Daròs JA, Elena SF, Flores R|title=Viroids: an Ariadne's thread into the RNA labyrinth|journal=EMBO Rep.|volume=7|issue=6|pages=593–8|year=2006|pmid=16741503|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400706|pmc=1479586[/tpl]

===In reverse transcription===

Reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies from their RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another,[tpl]cite journal|author=Kalendar R, Vicient CM, Peleg O, Anamthawat-Jonsson K, Bolshoy A, Schulman AH|title=Large retrotransposon derivatives: abundant, conserved but nonautonomous retroelements of barley and related genomes|journal=Genetics|volume=166|issue=3|pages = 1437–50|year=2004|pmid=15082561|doi = 10.1534/genetics.166.3.1437|pmc=1470764[/tpl] and telomerase contains an RNA that is used as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Podlevsky JD, Bley CJ, Omana RV, Qi X, Chen JJ|title=The telomerase database|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=36|issue=Database issue|pages=D339–43|year=2008|pmid=18073191|doi=10.1093/nar/gkm700|pmc=2238860[/tpl]

===Double-stranded RNA===

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses). Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or siRNA can trigger RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.[tpl]cite journal|title=Four plant Dicers mediate viral small RNA biogenesis and DNA virus induced silencing|author=Blevins T|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|year=2006|volume=34|issue=21|pages=6233–46|pmid=17090584|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl886|pmc=1669714|last2=Rajeswaran|first2=R.|last3=Shivaprasad|first3=P.

==Key discoveries in RNA biology==

Research on RNA has led to many important biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. Nucleic acids were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the nucleus.[tpl]cite journal|author=Dahm R|title=Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA|journal=Developmental Biology|year=2005|volume=278|issue=2|pages=274–88|pmid=15680349|doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028[/tpl] It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nature|author=Caspersson T, Schultz J|title=Pentose nucleotides in the cytoplasm of growing tissues|year=1939|volume=143|doi=10.1038/143602c0|pages=602–3|issue=3623|bibcode=1939Natur.143..602C|last2=Schultz[/tpl] Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory.[tpl]cite web|author=Ochoa S|title=Enzymatic synthesis of ribonucleic acid|work=Nobel Lecture|year=1959|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ochoa-lecture.pdf[/tpl] However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.[tpl]cite journal | author=Rich A, Davies, D|title=A New Two-Stranded Helical Structure: Polyadenylic Acid and Polyuridylic Acid|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|year=1956|volume=78|doi=10.1021/ja01595a086|pages=3548[/tpl]
The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by Robert W. Holley in 1965,[tpl]cite journal|author=Holley RW|title=Structure of a ribonucleic acid|journal=Science|year=1965|volume=147|issue=3664|pages=1462–65|doi=10.1126/science.147.3664.1462|pmid = 14263761 |bibcode = 1965Sci...147.1462H|last2=Apgar|first2=J.|last3=Everett|first3=G.

R.|last8=Zamir|first8=A. |author-separator=,|displayauthors=1[/tpl] winning Holley the 1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall Nirenberg).
In 1967, Carl Woese hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an RNA world.[tpl]cite web|title=Common sequence structure properties and stable regions in RNA secondary structures|author=Siebert S|year=2006|page=1|url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&dok_var=d1&dok_ext=pdf&filename=982323891.pdf|work=Dissertation, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg im Breisgau[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA world|author=Szathmáry E|journal=Trends Genet.|year=1999|volume=15|issue=6|pages=223–9|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01730-8|pmid = 10354582 [/tpl]
During the early 1970s retroviruses and reverse transcriptase were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, Walter Fiers and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of bacteriophage MS2.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fiers W|title=Complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA: primary and secondary structure of replicase gene|journal=Nature|year=1976|volume=260|pages=500–7|pmid=1264203|doi = 10.1038/260500a0|first12=M|issue=5551|bibcode=1976Natur.260..500F|last2=Ysebaert|first2=R.|last3=Duerinck|first3=F.|last4=Haegeman|first4=G.|last5=Iserentant|first5=D.|last6=Merregaert|first6=J.|last7=Min Jou|first7=W.|last8=Molemans|first8=F.|last9=Raeymaekers|first9=A.|last10=Van Den Berghe|first10=A.|last11=Volckaert|first11=G.|last12=Ysebaert|author-separator=,|displayauthors=1[/tpl]
In 1977, introns and RNA splicing were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to Philip Sharp and Richard Roberts.
Catalytic RNA molecules (ribozymes) were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990 it was found in Petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to be a result of RNA interference.[tpl]cite journal|author=Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R|title=Introduction of a chimeric chalcone synthase gene into petunia results in reversible co-suppression of homologous genes in trans|journal=Plant Cell|year=1990|volume=2|issue=4|pages=279–89|pmid=12354959|doi = 10.1105/tpc.2.4.279|pmc=159885[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Dafny-Yelin M, Chung SM, Frankman EL, Tzfira T|title=pSAT RNA interference vectors: a modular series for multiple gene down-regulation in plants|journal=Plant Physiol.|volume=145|issue=4|pages=1272–81|date=December 2007|pmid=17766396|pmc=2151715|doi=10.1104/pp.107.106062[/tpl]
At about the same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called microRNAs, were found to have a role in the development of C. elegans.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ruvkun G|title=Glimpses of a tiny RNA world|journal=Science|year=2001|volume=294|issue=5543|pages=797–99|doi=10.1126/science.1066315|pmid = 11679654[/tpl]
Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on transcription of RNA to Roger Kornberg in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as siRNA, to silence genes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fichou Y, Férec C|title=The potential of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|year=2006|volume=24|issue=12|pages=563–70|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.003|pmid = 17045686[/tpl]
