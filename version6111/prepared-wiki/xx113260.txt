Boca Grande Taqueria is a chain of Mexican restaurants in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

==Overview==

Boca Grande has locations in Boston's Kenmore Square, Brookline's Coolidge Corner neighborhood, in Cambridge on Massachusetts Ave between Porter Square and Harvard Square, on First Street just outside of Kendall Square, and on Washington Street (near the corner of Market Street) in Boston's Brighton neighborhood.  Boca Grande's offerings include inexpensive burritos, quesadilla, tacos, enchiladas served up in a relaxed environment.  They also offer catering services for corporate, academic, or private events.
The name "Boca Grande" in Spanish literally means "Big Mouth". This name was most likely chosen because the restaurant offers large portions of food, implying that the diner will need a big mouth to handle the portions.

==History==

Boca Grande was founded in 1986 by Mariko Kamio.  The restaurant was modeled on Gordo's Taqueria, a successful San Francisco restaurant owned by Kamio's cousin.  Mariko's brother, Michael Kamio, briefly joined the restaurant before founding his own chain of restaurants, Anna's Taqueria.  http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_burrito_war
