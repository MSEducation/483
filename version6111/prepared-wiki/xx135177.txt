Waterfoot ([tpl]lang-sco|Watterfit[/tpl])[tpl]cite web|author=Andy Eagle |url=http://www.scots-online.org/dictionary/read.asp?letter=W&CurPage=10 |title=The Online Scots Dictionary |publisher=Scots-online.org |date=2003-02-27 |accessdate=2013-09-26[/tpl] is a small village in East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is on the B767 road between Clarkston and Eaglesham, which are one mile north and south respectively, while Newton Mearns is about two miles to the west and East Kilbride about three miles to the east.
The Glasgow Southern Orbital road (part of the A726) passes just to the south of Waterfoot.
The village lies on the west bank of the White Cart Water, and the original settlement grew up around a farm, mill and smithy. One early record of the village is in Timothy Pont's maps of Scotland (1583 - 1596). 
Waterfoot today is, however, purely residential in character, having expanded in the latter half of the 20th century as a commuter dormitory village. Although Waterfoot is relatively affluent, there are no shops or other services, with residents having to travel to other areas to access amenities. The 2001 census reported that Waterfoot had a population of 1,279.
A small part of Waterfoot on the east side of the White Cart lies in the South Lanarkshire council area.
