Beckenham Road tram stop is a light rail stop in the London Borough of Bromley in the southern suburbs of London. The stop is located on an embankment above Beckenham Road (A234) which connects Beckenham with Crystal Palace and Penge on the site of the short-lived (1858â€“1860) West End of London & Crystal Palace Railway Penge station."Railways of Beckenham", Andrew Hajducki, 2011[tpl]page needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

The tram stop is close to Clock House railway station on the National Rail Hayes Line, which lies on the other side of Beckenham Road and at a considerably lower level. Bus stops on roads adjacent to the stop provide interchange with the following bus services (as of January 2008):
The tram stop has a single platform which is accessed by steps and a ramp from Beckenham Road. The single track National Rail line between Crystal Palace and Beckenham Junction stations runs alongside the Tramlink line, with the two tracks occupying the site of what was previously a double track railway. However there is no station on this line. Immediately to the east of the tram stop is a passing loop for Tramlink vehicles, and westbound trams often have to wait for an eastbound tram to clear the stop.
