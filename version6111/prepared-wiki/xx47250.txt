Note: A press release issued by AMPAS in 2005 states that "Documentary Short Subject winners Benjy (1951) and Neighbours (1952) are among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories.  Benjy, directed by Fred Zinnemann and narrated by Henry Fonda, is the fictional tale of a crippled boy.  The film was used as a fundraiser for the Los Angeles Orthopedic Hospital.  ... Norman McLaren's Neighbours, which today would compete in the Animated Short category, used "pixilation" â€“ animation using living people - to create an allegory of war."
