Tsereteli did not disclose the cost of the sculpture except to say that he paid for labor and materials. A lawyer for the sculptor released the cost at about $12 million.Morley, Mike. "White Elephants", Irish American News, October 2011. Tsereteli said metals for the sculpture were obtained "From a military factory that did airplanes. In Dzerzhinsk.

It was initially given to the local government of Jersey City, but was rejected. It was then relocated to its present placement in Bayonne.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0DA173BF933A05752C0A9639C8B63 |title=Monument In Search Of a Home |accessdate=April 18, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first=Jonathan | last=Miller | date=January 30, 2005[/tpl] In August 2010 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced it had plans to build a container facility on the location and the monument would most likely have to be moved. However these plans have not been confirmed by the Port Authority. Robert "Captain Bob" Terzi, a Bayonne taxi driver started an online petition to prevent the relocation.
Reaction to the monument has been mixed. It was listed as one of the The World’s Ugliest Statues by Foreign Policy magazine,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/04/05/the_world_s_ugliest_statues?page=0,4  |title=The World’s Ugliest Statues |accessdate=April 18, 2010[/tpl] while The New Yorker said from far away it looked like "a giant tea biscuit."  However reactions from the general public include "Pretty impressive," said one person and another called it a "breathtakingly beautiful creation".
In September 2011, a four-foot section of steel from the World Trade Center was placed adjacent to the sculpture.Hack, Charles. "Motorcyclists to escort piece of World Trade Center steel to Bayonne memorial site on Sept. 7 ". NJ.com. August 31, 2011
