==History==

Part of a land grant to Dutch settlers from New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1655, the area, like much of Queens, remained farmland and forest for most of the next two centuries.
By the 1800s, the plantations of four families — the Remsens, Everitts, Ludlums and Hendricksons — formed the nucleus of this sprawling farm community in the eastern portion of Jamaica Township. In 1814, when the Village of Jamaica (the first village on Long Island) was incorporated, its (the village's) boundaries extended eastward to Freeman's Path (now Farmers Boulevard), and south to Lazy Lane (called Central Avenue in 1900, then Foch Boulevard in the 1920s,[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Newspaper/BSU/1929.News.July.html |title=1929... News |quote=LOWERRE Secured Light Charles LOWERRE, treasurer of the St. Albans Lions Club, has succeeded in having the Police Department promise to put a traffic control light at the Foch and Farmers boulevard intersection at St. Albans.[/tpl] The 1930 census has marginal notations for Foch Blvd from 189th St to 196th St - and no notations for Linden Blvd.

Presumably the name Foch was chosen to honor Marshal Ferdinand Foch, following World War I.

In 1852, the old mill pond that is now at the center of Baisley Pond Park was acquired by the Brooklyn waterworks for use as a reservoir.[tpl]cite web|title=Baisley Pond Park|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/baisleypondpark/history|publisher=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl] 
In 1872, the Long Island Rail Road Cedarhurst Cut-off was built through the area, but no stop appears on the first timetables. In 1892, an area called Francis Farm was surveyed and developed for housing. There were numerous Francis families farming in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica in the 1880s.[ref][tpl]cite web | url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MZFW-ST6# |title=1880 Census: sample Francis family in Queens |accessdate=2013-01-29[/tpl]
Other records indicate at least some of these lived in an area then called Jamaica South and/or Springfield.
Maps from 1873 and from 1891 show a W. Francis owning land just west of the LIRR tracks and north of present-day Linden Boulevard.
This 1909 map shows subdivision in the same area as the Francis farm shown on earlier maps

Francis Lewis Boulevard (named for a signer of the Declaration of Independence, from Queens), which does not yet appear on maps from 1909, nor in 1910,
is now the eastern boundary of St. Albans.
Soon, the first street lights illuminated the crossroads that is now Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. New shops clustered around August Everitt's lone store.
By July 1, 1898, a railroad station opened where the tracks crossed Locust Avenue (now Baisley Boulevard).[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lirrhistory.com/oct2001/1898map.jpg |title=1898 map showing Locust Ave station in St. Albans on the Rockaway Branch of the LIRR |format=JPG[/tpl]

The station was razed and replaced with grade elimination October 15, 1935. Today, the St. Albans station provides Long Island Rail Road service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan or Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, with transfers available at Jamaica station.
In 1899, a year after Queens became part of New York City (and with the Town of Jamaica and the Village of Jamaica thereby dissolved), the new post office for the 600 residents
was named St. Albans, after St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, which itself was named after a Saint Alban, thought to be the first Christian martyred in England. The name had been in use for the area since at least 1894 for the name of the school district,[ref]

The St. Albans Golf Course, built in 1915, brought rich and famous golfers, including baseball star Babe Ruth.
