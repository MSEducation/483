The [tpl]Nihongo|ORIX Buffaloes|オリックス・バファローズ|Orikkusu Bafarōzu[/tpl] are a Nippon Professional Baseball team that was formed following the 2004 NPB season by the merger of the Orix BlueWave of Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan and the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The team plays in the Pacific League and is owned by the Orix Group, a leading diversified financial services company based in Tokyo.
The combined team began play in 2005 and splits their home games between Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium, the former home of the BlueWave, and the Osaka Dome, which was the home of the original Buffaloes franchise.

==Franchise history==

===Hankyu/Orix (1936-2004)===

====The Hankyu Braves====

The Orix BlueWave was founded in 1936 under the ownership of a Japanese railway company [tpl]Nihongo|Hanshin Kyuko Railway Company|阪神急行電鉄|Hanshin Kyuko Dentetsu|extra=present: Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc.[/tpl], as [tpl]Nihongo|Osaka Hankyu Baseball Club|大阪阪急野球協会|Ōsaka hankyū yakyū kyōkai[/tpl].  Later nicknamed Hankyu Braves, it was one of the first Japanese professional baseball teams.
The Hankyu Braves were one of the strongest teams not only in the Pacific League but in all of Japan.  Between 1967 and 1972, the Hankyu Braves won the Pacific League pennant five times, but lost the Japan Series each time against the Tokyo Giants.  Manager Yukio Nishimoto was known as "the great manager in tragedy" because of those losses.  But the Hankyu Braves won Japan Series three times in a row from 1975, against the Tokyo Giants in 1976 and 1977, led by manager Toshiharu Ueda.   At that time many good players in Japanese Baseball history played for the Hankyu Braves.
In the 1980s, the team was still strong but lost the pennant to the Seibu Lions every year except 1984.
On October 19, 1988, Hankyu Railway sold the franchise to the lease company Orient Lease (since 1989 known as Orix Group).  That was known as "the longest day of the Pacific League" because it was also the day when Kintetsu Buffaloes played the legendary double-header for the Pacific League pennant (but they could not have got the pennant because of a draw game).  The deal had been done with two assurances: the team name would remain "Braves", and the franchise would stay in Nishinomiya.  The sale was a surprise, because it was much rarer in those days in Japan for the ownership of a professional baseball team to change, not to mention for a large company to sell one of its parts; Hankyu Railway was thought of as one of the big companies that would never need to do such a thing.

====The BlueWave====

During the first two years of new ownership, the team was known as the Orix Braves and played in Nishinomiya.  In 1991, the team became the Orix BlueWave, and moved to Kobe.  Longtime fans were shocked by these changes.  However, since Nishinomiya and Kobe are close to one another, and the new home field of the team was better than the old one, most fans accepted the move, although with some nostalgia for the historic "Braves" name.  The team was sometimes called [tpl]Nihongo|Aonami or Seiha|青波[/tpl] by fans and the baseball media, which means "blue wave" in Japanese.
Led by Ichiro Suzuki, in 1995 and 1996 the Orix BlueWave won the Pacific League pennant. In 1996, they also won the Japan Series.

===Kintetsu Buffaloes (1950-2004)===

The Kintetsu Buffalo were the first Japanese team to sign an American player. They signed former major league pitcher Glenn Mickens and catcher Ron Bottler for the 1959 season. Mickens had played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1953 and Bottler had been a career minor league catcher in the United States.

===Orix Buffaloes (2005 to present)===

The team has struggled since its merger, and has finished in the top half (or A Class) of the Pacific league only once from 2005 to 2013. 
In 2008, The Buffaloes finished 2nd in the Pacific League, going 75-68-1 and finishing 2 1/2 games behind the Saitama Seibu Lions, but were swept by the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters at home in the 1st stage of the Climax Series.
In 2013 the Buffaloes finished in 5th place with a 66-73-5. http://bis.npb.or.jp/yearly/pacificleague_2013.html
