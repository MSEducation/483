The Treaty of the Cedars was concluded on the Fox River, west of what is today the village of Little Chute, Wisconsin, on September 3, 1836. Under the treaty, the Menominee Indian nation ceded to the United States about [tpl]convert|4000000|acre|km2[/tpl] of land for $700,000. The Wisconsin cities of Marinette, Oconto, Appleton, Neenah, Menasha, Oshkosh, Wausau, Wisconsin Rapids, and Stevens Point are today within this area.
The treaty was concluded after six days of meetings.  Governor Henry Dodge and Menominee Chief Oshkosh later represented the two sides. The treaty was proclaimed February 15, 1837, and the Indians began moving to their new homes west of the Wolf River. Today there is a Wisconsin historical marker at the site where the treaty was signed.Fox Valley Turning Points - Home
