Many teachers from the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] were sent to Bulgaria to teach the Macedonian language. According to many scholars this was done despite the unwillingness of the local population to co-operate.<ref>Ангелов, Веселин. Хроника на едно национално предателство, София 1999, p. 298-302</ref> After 1958 when the  pressure from [[Moscow]] decreased, the campaign was abandoned and Sofia turned back to the view that the Macedonian language did not exist and that the Slavic population in [[Blagoevgrad province]] (Pirin Macedonia) was Bulgarian. All Macedonian language printing stopped and the language was no longer taught in Bulgaria.
The existence of a Macedonian language and Macedonian ethos is highly disputed in Bulgaria. Most Bulgarians do not recognize the Macedonian language as a separate language and assert that it is a dialect of Bulgarian. There are two dialects in Bulgaria which are considered Macedonian in Macedonia: the Maleševo-Pirin (widely spoken in most of Blagoevgrad Province in Bulgaria and Delčevo region in the Republic of Macedonia) and the Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop ones. Some linguists consider these dialects to be transitional between modern Bulgarian and Macedonian.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
According to the 2011 Bulgarian census, 1404 persons in Bulgaria and 561 in Blagoevgrad Province declared Macedonian as their native language.2011 population census in the Republic of Bulgaria; Population by location, age and mother tongue (in Bulgarian) 

==Greece==

The Macedonian language is spoken in the Greek region of Macedonia. In Greece the language is often called "Slav-Macedonian", "Macedonian Slavic" or "Slavic". An estimated 180,000ethnologue  - 250,000 people speak the Macedonian language in Greece.
The Macedonian language is most widespread in the Florina, Kastoria, Edessa, Serres and Kilkis regions.http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/macedoni/fr/i1/i1.html Approximately 77 villages speak the Maceodnian language in the Kastoria area, and 70-72 in the Florina prefecture. however, these villages are of medium to small sizes, and some of them are deserted due to immigration or the civil war. The actual speakers of all these villages in Kastoria and Florina is unknown. The same can be said for the other regions in Greece, so the estimation today is that the actual speakers are over 180 thousand people, compared to the up to 250 thousand before the war. The stunning differences are partly the result of immigration to USA or Australia and other countries, but also of the outcome of the last war, were the majority of the Slav-Macedonians were members of the side, that eventually lost the civil war.
