==History==

The software was distributed as freeware, though for a fee the author supplies extra features, such as support for WAV output and co-editing songs over IPX networks. After the stereo WAV writer plugin was publicly pirated,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.users.on.net/~jtlim/ImpulseTracker/update.txt|title=Impulse Tracker Changelog|author=Lim, Jeffrey|accessdate=2010-07-17[/tpl] the original author announced that he would discontinue development after version 2.14.

==Usage==

Like in most module editors, music is arranged on a grid of channels. Each supports note on and note off instructions similar to MIDI. Impulse Tracker modules use the .IT file extension.
New Note Actions (NNAs) is a feature that handles commands received on the same channel as another instrument which is still playing. NNAs allow the user to customize the subsequent action:
Impulse Tracker supports hardware MIDI channels on the Gravis Ultrasound, InterWave and Sound Blaster 32 card families (provided enough RAM is available).

==Compatible software==

Other music-playing software that supports the IT file format include Media Player Classic, Winamp (Win32), VLC, Cowon jetAudio, XMMS (X11 Linux/Unix), TiMidity, MikMod, ModPlug Tracker, Renoise (Win32, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X), XMPlay, and Schism Tracker (Win32, Linux, Wii and Mac OS X) which is an Impulse Tracker reimplementation.[tpl]cite web| url=http://helllabs.org/tracker-history/|publisher=helllabs.org |first=Claudio |last=Matsuoka |date=2007-11-04|accessdate=2011-01-29 |title=Tracker History Graphing Project |quote=Tracker History Graph[/tpl]

==IT file format==

The .IT file format is the format native to Impulse Tracker. It is similar to older formats such as .MOD, but features new additions such as new note actions which allow the user to customize subsequent actions on receiving commands from the same channel as the one playing.
Some player software supports the .ITZ format, which is a renamed zip file that contains a .IT file.
