==History==

Shinnittetu-mae Station was opened on February 18, 1912 as [tpl]nihongo|Kaya Station|加家駅|Kaya-eki[/tpl] on the Aichi Electric Railway Company. The Aichi Electric Railway became part of the Meitetsu group on August 1, 1935; however, the station was closed in 1944. On August 17, 1964, the station was reopened as [tpl]nihongo|Tōkaiseitetsu-mae Station|東海製鉄前駅|Tōkaiseitetsu-mae eki[/tpl] after the nearby Tōkai Steel plant. The station named changed to [tpl]nihongo|Fujiseitetsu-mae Station|富士製鉄前駅|Fujiseitetsu-mae eki[/tpl] when Tōkai was absorbed into Fuji Steel on August 1, 1967, and then to its present name on March 31, 1970 when Fuji co-founded Nippon Steel. The station has been unattended since March 2002. In January 2005, the Tranpass system of magnetic fare cards with automatic turnstiles was implemented.
