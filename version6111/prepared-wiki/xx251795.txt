[[Soetardjo Petition]]

CATEGORIES: Dutch East Indies, Indonesian National Awakening, 1936 in Indonesia

The Soetardjo Petition was a petition from some progressive Indonesians, which in 1936 was submitted to the Indonesian People's Council (Volksraad) of the Dutch East Indies. The name comes from the name of the petitioner, Soetardjo Kartohadikusumo.
The document expressed the desire of Indonesians to, within a period of ten years, be independent under Article 1 of the Dutch Constitution.
On November 16, 1938, the petition was rejected because it was considered that the Indonesians were not yet ready for independence, even within the Dutch commonwealth. This rejection encouraged the nationalist movement in Indonesia to be more radical. It led to the formation of the GAPI in 1939.
