==History==

The first evidence for the hamlet of Bramshott is the record of Matthew as its first Rector in 1225 and the early 13th century church. The parish evolved from the medieval manors of Brembreste (Bramshott today), Lidessete (Ludshott), Ciltelelei (Chiltlee), the royal forest of Woolmer and fragments of two other manors.
Bramshott Manor is described in the Domesday Book as held by Edward of Salisbury from the king with two freemen, thirteen tenants (of restricted freedom) and two mills. Ludshott Manor, lying to the north of Bramshott Manor, is recorded with four tenants and a mill. Chiltlee Manor lay to the south of Bramshott Manor and was recorded as being held by the king, William the Conqueror, with four tenants and land for two ploughs, worth fifty three shillings (£2.65). These four manors lay on the edge of the royal forest of Woolmer, with the origins of Liphook perhaps built as smallholdings to serve huntsmen.
The village grew until the 14th century but was checked by the Black Death. It seems some people escaped from the manors to Liphook to evade taxes of the Lord. Since the 16th century development of Bramshott has been intertwined with that of Liphook.
St. Mary's Church holds the graves of 318 Canadian soldiers stationed at nearby Bramshott Camp during the First World War, including many victims of the influenza outbreak of 1918-20.
