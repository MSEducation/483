Chesterfield is a market town and a borough of Derbyshire, United Kingdom. It lies [tpl]convert|24 |mi|km[/tpl] north of Derby, on a confluence of the rivers Rother and Hipper. It has a population of 103,800 (2011), making it the largest town in Derbyshire, and the second largest settlement in the county after the unitary authority of the city of Derby.
Archaeology of the town traces its beginnings to the 1st century and the construction of a Roman fort,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=314408|title=Chesterfield Roman Fort|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl] which became redundant and was abandoned once peace was achieved. Later an Anglian village grew up on the site; the name Chesterfield stems from the Anglo-Saxon words 'caester' (a Roman fort) and 'feld' (grazing land).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/chesterfield.html|title=Chesterfield History|publisher=Tim Lambert|accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl]
Chesterfield received its market charter in 1204 and has a moderate sized market on three days a week .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitchesterfield.info/dms-derbyshire.asp?dms=13&venue=6050253|title=Visit Chesterfield|publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council|accessdate=1 June 2013[/tpl] The town sits on a large coalfield which formed a major part of the area's economy until the 1980s. Little evidence of the mining industry remains today.
The town's most famous landmark is the distinctive 'crooked' spire of its predominantly 14th-century church.

==History==

Chesterfield was in the Hundred of Scarsdale. The town received its market charter in 1204 from King John and around 250 stalls can be found in the town every Monday, Friday and Saturday. The charter constituted the town as a free borough, granting the burgesses of Chesterfield the same privileges as those of Nottingham.
Elizabeth I granted a charter of incorporation in 1594, creating a corporation consisting of a mayor, six aldermen, six brethren, and twelve capital burgesses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50724 |title=Parishes: Calke – Chesterfield |accessdate=3 February 2009 |work=Magna Britannia: volume 5: Derbyshire |publisher=British History Online |year=1817 [/tpl] This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50871#s8 |title=Chesterfield (All Saints) |accessdate=3 February 2009 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England  |publisher=British History Online |year=1848 [/tpl] The borough originally consisted only of the township of Chesterfield, but was extended in 1892 to include parts of surrounding townships. In 1920 there was a major extension to the borough when it absorbed New Whittington and Newbold urban district.[tpl]cite book |title=Local Administrative Units of England |last=Young |first=Frederic A Jr. |volume=II: Northern England |year=1991 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0-86193-127-0  |pages=70, 660 [/tpl] Chesterfield's current boundaries date from 1 April 1974, when under the Local Government Act 1972, the Borough of Chesterfield was formed by the amalgamation of the municipal borough with the urban district of Staveley and the parish of Brimington from Chesterfield Rural District.[tpl]cite book |title=Local government in England and Wales: A Guide to the New System |year=1974 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=0-11-750847-0 |page=40 [/tpl]
Chesterfield benefited greatly from the building of the Chesterfield Line – part of the Derby to Leeds railway (North Midland Line), which was begun in 1837 by George Stephenson. During its construction, a sizeable seam of coal was discovered during the construction of the Clay Cross Tunnel. This and the local ironstone were promptly exploited by Stephenson who set up a company in Clay Cross to trade in the minerals.
During his time in Chesterfield, Stephenson lived at Tapton House, and remained there until his death in 1848. He is interred in Trinity Church. In 2006, a statue of Stephenson was erected outside Chesterfield railway station.

==Governance==

Local government in Chesterfield is organised in a two-tier structure. At the upper tier, services such as consumer protection, education, main roads and social services are provided by Derbyshire County Council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/council_works/departments/default.asp |title=Council Departments |accessdate=9 February 2009 |work= |publisher=Derbyshire County Council |date= [/tpl] At the lower tier, services such as housing, planning, refuse collection and burial grounds are provided by Chesterfield Borough Council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chesterfield.gov.uk/default.aspx?CATID=168 |title=Council Structures |accessdate=9 February 2009 |work= |publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council |year=2009 [/tpl] The borough is unparished with the exception of Brimington and Staveley: Brimington Parish Council and Staveley Town Council exercise limited functions in those areas.

===County council===

Derbyshire County Council has sixty-four elected county councillors, each representing a single-member electoral division. The entire council is elected every four years. At the last elections in June 2009, the Conservative Party took control from the Labour Party after 28 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/County-council-election-results/article-1053166-detail/article.html|title=Derbyshire County Council elections – derbyshire – thisisderbyshirepo|publisher=thisisderbyshire.co.uk|accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl]
Derbyshire County Council returned to Labour control at the 2013 local elections.

===Borough council===

Chesterfield Borough Council consists of 48 councillors. Elections of the whole council take place every four years, the last elections having occurred in 2011. The borough is divided into 19 wards, with between one and three councillors elected for each ward.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chesterfield.gov.uk/communities/councillors/ |title=Borough Councillors |accessdate=9 February 2009 |work= |publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council |date= [/tpl]  The wards are named Barrow Hill and New Whittington; Brimington North; Brimington South; Brockwell; Dunston; Hasland; Hollingwood and Inkersall; Holmebrook; Linacre; Loundsley Green; Lowgates and Woodthorpe; Middlecroft and Poolsbrook; Moor; Old Whittington; Rother; St. Helen's; St. Leonard's; Walton; and, West. As of 2011 the Labour Party control the borough council with 34 councillors, while the Liberal Democrats have 14 councillors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/council/html/17ud.stm|title=England council elections|work=BBC|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]
The council choose one of their members annually to be mayor of Chesterfield, with the 371st mayor elected in May 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfieldpost.co.uk/public_services/mayor/mayor_00000016.html|title=The Chesterfield Post – Mayor's Column|work=chesterfieldpost.co.uk|accessdate=18 May 2011[/tpl]

====Coat of arms====

The borough council uses armorial bearings originally granted (to the previous borough corporation) by letters patent dated 10 November 1955.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/derbys.html |title=Derbyshire |accessdate=9 February 2009 |work=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales |publisher= |date= [/tpl] The blazon of the arms is as follows:
 Gules a Device representing a Pomegranate Tree as depicted on the ancient Common Seal of the Borough the tree leaved and eradicated proper flowered and fructed Or and for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours Issuant from a Mural Crown Gules Masoned Or a Mount Vert thereon a Derby Ram passant guardant proper.
 Supporters: On the dexter side a Cock and on the sinister side a Pynot or Magpie proper each Ducally gorged Or[tpl]cite web|url=http://youandyesterday.com/articles/Chesterfield_Borough_Council_-_Its_Coat_of_Arms_Explained|title=Chesterfield Borough Council – Its Coat of Arms Explained – Bygone Derbyshire | publisher=Bygone Derbyshire|last=Seddon|first=Peter|date=November 2010|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
The shield is based on the borough's ancient common seal, which is believed to date from the first half of the 16th century. The seal depicts a stylised pomegranate tree. When the arms were formally granted, the College of Arms expressed the opinion that the plant had been adopted by the town as a symbol of loyalty to the crown, as it was a royal badge used by Katherine of Aragon, Henry VIII and Mary Tudor.
The crest depicts a Derby Ram, representing the county of Derbyshire, and a mural crown, suggestive of a town wall and thus borough status.
The supporters on either side of the arms represent the Cock and Pynot Inn, Old Whittington. The inn, now Revolution House, was the site of a meeting between conspirators against James II in 1688. Among those meeting there were the Earls of Danby and Devonshire, commemorated by the ducal crowns around the supporters' necks. The two birds stand on a compartment of rocks and moorland. The motto is "aspire", a punning reference to the crooked spire of the parish church.

==Economy==

In the last 30 years, the economy in and around Chesterfield has experienced major change, moving the employment base away from the primary and secondary sectors, and towards the tertiary area. The area sits on a large coalfield and the area played host to many coal mines,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ichesterfield.co.uk/chesterfield-photographs-old/old-collieries.html|title=iChesterfield – A Website for Chesterfield, Derbyshire|publisher=ichesterfield.co.uk|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] including: Clay Cross, Arkwright Town, Bolsover, Grassmoor, North Wingfield and Holmewood.
From 1981 to 2002, 15,000 jobs in the coal industry disappeared[tpl]cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/proposals/Chesterfield.pdf#search=%22chesterfield%20industrial%20decline%22|title=CASINO ADVISORY PANEL Formal Proposal Cover Sheet|last=Wrightson|first=John|publisher=culture.gov.uk|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] and not a single colliery remains open, although open cast mining continued at Arkwright Town until a few years ago. Many of the sites were restored by contractor Killingleys for Derbyshire County Council. Very little evidence of the mining industry remains today; a cyclist and walkers route, the "Five Pits Trail" now links some of the former collieries and most of the sites are now indistinguishable from the surrounding countryside.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/leisure/countryside/access/walking/walks_and_trails/five_pits_trail/default.asp|title=Derbyshire County Council – Five Pits Trail|publisher=Derbyshire County Council|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
Within the town itself, large factories and major employers have disappeared or relocated in the last ten years. Markham & Co. manufactured tunnel boring machines such as the one used for the Channel Tunnel between England and France. The company was bought out by Norway's Kvaerner and subsequently merged with Sheffield based Davy. Their factory on Hollis Lane is now a housing estate and the former offices were converted into flats and serviced office suites.[tpl]cite book|last1=Wort|first1=Ken G.|last2=Bennett|first2=Mike G.|title=Markham and Company of Chesterfield, 1889–1998: An Illustrated History|publisher=Merton Priory Press Ltd|isbn=1-898937-64-8[/tpl] Dema Glass's factory near Lockoford Lane shut as is now host to a Tesco Extra and the Proact Stadium, Chesterfield F.C.'s new home ground.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfield.gov.uk/default.aspx?CATID=660&CID=5013|title=Dema Glass Site |publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] GKN closed its factory and the site is now being turned into a business park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/meltdown_in_manufacturing_1_463835|title=Meltdown in manufacturing – News – Derbyshire Times|last=Cooper|first=Jon|date=5 February 2007|publisher=Derbyshire Times|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
Others companies have downsized significantly. Robinson's, who manufacture paper-based packaging in the town,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.robinsonpackaging.com/Group/history.html|title=Robinson – History of Robinson|publisher=Robinson|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] divested their healthcare interests which led to significant downsizing in both the workforce and facilities in Chesterfield. Trebor, once based on Brimington Road near Chesterfield railway station, merged with Bassetts sweets of Sheffield, were taken over by Cadbury and have relocated a modern unit at Holmewood Business park. The former factory has been demolished and the site is awaiting further development.
Chesterfield Cylinders relocated to a much smaller site in Sheffield. Chesterfield Cylinder's Derby Road site, is now Alma Leisure Park, which includes a Nuffield Health Club, Cineworld, Frankie & Benny's, McDonald's, Hobby Horse pub, and a Blockbuster. Their main cylinder factory opposite is now The Spires housing estate.
Bryan Donkin Valves relocated to Staveley, a few miles away. Their former factory on Derby Road is under development as Spire Walk Business Park, a B&Q Mini-warehouse and Chesterfield's new fire station.
Manufacturing employment has fallen by a third since 1991, though the percentage of the population employed in manufacturing is still above the national average, underlining how critical it has been to Chesterfield in the past. Today, smaller scale firms are to be found on several industrial estates, the largest of which is located at Sheepbridge. Business located on the estate include SIG plc subsidiary Warren Insulations, Franke Sisons Ltd (founded in 1784 in Sheffield, and one of the first to manufacture stainless steel kitchen sinks in the 1930s), Rhodes Group, Chesterfield Felt, and others.
Between the A61 and Brimington Road there is a [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] development site resulting from Arnold Laver relocating to a modern sawmill at Halfway, on the Sheffield border. The former sawmill has been demolished, with outline planning permission given for a mixed residential and commercial development, called Chesterfield Waterside,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfield.gov.uk/Chesterfield-Waterside-446.html|accessdate=|title=Chesterfield Waterside|publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council[/tpl] to be built around a new marina at the end of the Chesterfield Canal, which currently terminates at a weir adjacent to the site.
There is a Morrisons on the junction of Chatsworth Road (A619) and Walton Road (A632), a Sainsburys on Rother Way (A619 for Staveley), and a Tesco Extra on the junction of the A619 and A61 (known locally as the Tesco Roundabout). The Institute of Business Advisers[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotfrog.co.uk/Companies/The-Institute-Of-Business-Advisers|title=The Institute of Business Advisers|publisher=Hot Frog|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] is based on Queen Street North. Chesterfield Royal Hospital[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfieldroyal.nhs.uk/|title=Chesterfield Royal Hospital|publisher=Chesterfield Royal Hospital|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] is on the A632 out towards Calow and Bolsover and the only A&E Department in Derbyshire outside of Derby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/ServiceResults.aspx?Place=derbyshire&Coords=3605,4258&ServiceType=AandE&JScript=1|title=Service results|work=NHS Choices|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
Peak FM broadcasts from Sheepbridge on 107.4 MHz FM and 102 MHz FM via the nearby Chesterfield Transmitter, which also hosts BBC Radio Sheffield on 94.7 MHz FM. DAB transmissions for Chesterfield come from the Chesterfield Transmitter, however only Digital One is currently broadcast. The local television stations are ITV Yorkshire and BBC Yorkshire, both transmitted from Leeds. The digital switchover date for the area was August 2011. Also in the town are the headquarters of the Derbyshire Times, the local newspaper, which does not cover all of the county.
The Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Branch of the RSPCA is located in the town,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfield-rspca.org.uk|title=RSPCA Chesterfield & North Derbyshire – Home page|publisher=RSPCA|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] and serves the North East Derbyshire area. The centre, which is not government funded, holds events to raise money, one being an annual Dog Show held in the summer.
The town's biggest employer is now the "Royal Mail/Post Office" administration department[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] located in a newly constructed building located on the edge of the town centre. The Royal Mail's Pensions Service Centre is near the town on Boythorpe Road, in Rowland Hill House, which also houses other administrative functions. There is a Post Office Ltd building in the town on West Bars called Future Walk. Formerly this was Chetwynd House, now demolished and replaced by the new Post Office building.

===Shopping, entertainment and leisure===

The Town centre of Chesterfield has retained much of its pre-war layout. Chesterfield is home to one of the largest open air markets in Britain, the stalls sitting either side of the Market Hall. In the middle of town, a collection of narrow medieval streets make up "The Shambles", which house The Royal Oak, one of Britain's oldest pubs.
Near Holywell Cross is what was (until 2013) Chesterfield's largest department store, the Co-operative or Co-op. The main building opened in 1938,"Elder Way - Knifesmith Gate", Picture the Past and now occupies the majority of Elder Way,Chesterfield Town Centre Masterplan, October 2009, Chesterfield Borough Council website, p.13 including an enclosed bridge, and part of Knifesmithgate; here the façade is in the mock-Tudor style fashionable in the 1930s which still dominates the north-side of Knifesmithgate in particular. In 2001, The Chesterfield and District Co-operative Society was incorporated into a larger regional entity, the Midlands Co-operative Society Limited, now the biggest independent retail Society in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.midlands.coop/index.php?/about/|title=About Midlands Co-op|publisher=Midlands Co-operative Society|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] Owing to a decline in retail sales, the large home and fashion Co-op department store closed at the end of July 2013,"Chesterfield: Co-op hopes doomed store will attract developers", Derbyshire Times, 4 February 2013 although the food business will continue. The future of the Elder Way building is unknown.

====The Pavements====

In the late 1970s a large area between Low Pavement (in the Market Square) and New Beetwell Street was completely demolished (except the original shop fronts) to build "The Pavements" shopping centre, known by some local residents as "The Precinct", which was opened in November 1981 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. It has entrances located opposite Chesterfield Market and escalators leading down to New Beetwell Street and the Bus station. An enclosed bridge links the site to a multi-storey car park built at the same time adjacent to the town's coach station.
Chesterfield's library is located just outside The Pavements on New Beetwell Street. The library spans several floors and was planned as part of the development. The building was erected later and opened in 1985. In annual figures compiled by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy the Library ranked fifth in the UK for the number of issues in 2008, a rise of one place on the previous year.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cipfa.org.uk/Press/press_show.cfm?news_id=32026| publisher=Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy| title=Norfolk Boasts Busiest Library in England, survey shows| accessdate=30 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cipfa.org.uk/Press/press_show.cfm?news_id=59847| publisher=Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy| title=Norfolk library is most popular in UK| accessdate=30 December 2009[/tpl] The area to the side of the library was redeveloped retaining the old narrow passage ways but creating various small shop units & offices in the style of "The Shambles".
On 27 June 2007, the Somerfield store in the Precinct was completely gutted in a fire during which the roof collapsed.  Only a few shoppers suffered minor injuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/town_centre_store_fire_1_466856|title=Town centre store fire – Local – Derbyshire Times|publisher=Derbyshire Times|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] The fire was reportedly the result of an accidental ignition, after a welding torch being used to repair flood damage had been left ignited. The fire started at 13:10 on 27 June and was not extinguished until 23:30 the same day. All the shops in The Pavements were closed and evacuated. Other areas including the Market Hall were later evacuated as cordons were placed as a result of the smoke becoming worse.
Following the fire, Somerfield announced their intention to cease trading in Chesterfield. The unit re-opened in September 2008 as a Tesco Metro store.

====Vicar Lane====

Vicar Lane was redeveloped in 2000 to become a pedestrianised, open-air shopping centre, that involved almost all of the existing buildings being demolished including the now closed Woolworths and an old bus station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vicarlaneshoppingcentre.co.uk/index.htm|title=Vicar Lane Shopping Centre|publisher=vicarlaneshoppingcentre.co.uk|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] The project was so large that two new shopping streets were created as part of the development. It now hosts major chains such as H&M, BHS and Argos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vicarlaneshoppingcentre.co.uk/storeguide.htm|title=Vicar Lane Shopping Centre – Store Guide|publisher=vicarlaneshoppingcentre.co.uk|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] The development was originally planned in the 1980s but was delayed due to the economics at the time. A new multistorey car park on Beetwell Street was added as part of the revised plan. The area is located between the "Pavements Centre" and Markets and the "Crooked Spire".

====Food and drink====

Cuisine available in the area includes Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Indian and Thai restaurants and takeaways. Several night clubs are located around the town, predominantly towards "The Doughnut", more correctly called "Holywell Cross Car Park". Scattered around the town are many bars and pubs and west of the town centre the "Brampton Mile" provides 13 pubs on a [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] section of Chatsworth Road. Chesterfield's night-life is well regarded by many within the area for both its variety and number of venues located within a relatively compact area, although there are now very little if any that cater for alternative tastes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
In February 2006,  the first ever international gluten free beer festival was held in Chesterfield. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) hosted the event as part of their regular beer festival in the town.

====The arts====

The Winding Wheel, previously an Odeon Cinema, is a multi-purpose venue, hosting concerts, exhibitions, conferences, dinners, family parties, dances, banquets, wedding receptions, meetings, product launches and lectures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfield.gov.uk/default.aspx?CATID=328&TType=Summary&CID=1723|title=Winding Wheel – Chesterfield Borough Council|publisher=Chesterfield Borough Council|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] Past notable appearances include Bob Geldof, The Proclaimers and Paddy McGuinness. Chesterfield Symphony Orchestra give three concerts a year at the Winding Wheel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfieldsymphonyorchestra.co.uk/|title=Chesterfield Symphony Orchestra|publisher=Chesterfield Symphony Orchestra|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
The "Pomegranate Theatre" (formerly known for many years as 'Chesterfield Civic Theatre', and prior to that the "Stephenson Memorial Theatre') is a listed Victorian building (in what is now known as the Stephenson Memorial Hall[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/346754 |title=SK3871: Stephenson Memorial Hall |publisher=Geograph |accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl]), with a small auditorium, seating around 500 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pomegranatetheatre.co.uk/|title=Pomegranate Theatre|publisher=Pomegranate Theatre|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] A variety of shows are performed throughout the year. Also in the Stephenson Memorial Hall is the Chesterfield Museum, opened in 1994. Until 1984 it was used for the town's lending library. The museum is owned by Chesterfield Borough Council, as are the Winding Wheel and the Pomegranate Theatre. The box office for both entertainment venues is located in the entrance area of the theatre.
The Royal Mail building Future Walk, on West Bars, was the former site of Chetwynd House (referred to locally as "the AGD"). Here a work by sculptor Barbara Hepworth Carved Reclining Form or Rosewall was prominently displayed for many years and nicknamed Isaiah by local critics, due to it resembling a crude human face with one eye higher than the other ("eye's higher"). The work was under the threat of being sold in 2005, but the plan was eventually scrapped, recognising the piece's national significance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/4363152.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Sculpture sell-off plans scrapped|date=21 October 2005|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] Other artworks of note include 'A System of Support and Balance' by Paul Lewthwaite located outside Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.

==Transport==

===Roads===

The town is located on the A61, [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] from the M1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=53.249296,-1.329346&daddr=Unknown+road+to:Chesterfield,+Derbyshire,+UK&hl=en&geocode=%3BFfJRLAMdyMTr_w%3BFZ5OLAMd7kTq_w&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=13&via=1&sll=53.241078,-1.348743&sspn=0.053625,0.154324&ie=UTF8&ll=53.262133,-1.356125&spn=0.107198,0.308647&z=12|title=Exit 29a to Chesterfield, Derbyshire, UK – Google Maps|publisher=Google Search|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
Junction 29 of the M1 motorway at Heath links Chesterfield to the motorway network to the south, via the A617 dual-carriageway. Junction 29a at Markham Vale, Duckmanton opened at the end of June 2008, but the signs do not signpost Chesterfield. The town has links to the M1 at Junction 30 and to the north via the A619. Other major roads include the A61 Sheffield Road (north)/Derby Road (south) (with a dual carriageway beginning in the town centre and continuing onto Sheffield) and the A619 (a major inroad to the Peak District, eventually joining the A6 near Bakewell) and the A632 to Matlock.

===Buses, taxis and coaches===

Stagecoach plc are the predominant operator of buses in Chesterfield; other operators include Henry Hulleys, Trent Barton and TM Travel. Buses stop in several areas around the town centre rather than at a central bus station. The Stagecoach depot at Stonegravels is notable for its size and many vehicles stored there are not in regular use. Formerly it was the Chesterfield Corporation bus depot.
A new Chesterfield Coach Station opened in 2005, with scheduled services provided by National Express. A number of tour companies also operate there. The main taxi ranks are located on Elder Way and Knifesmithgate as well as outside the railway station. Chesterfield's taxis can be easily recognised to hail as they are black in colour with distinctive white bonnets and tailgates.

===Railways===

Chesterfield railway station is located on the Midland Main Line. Three train companies provide local and national services:
Chesterfield previously had two other rail stations
These railways all crossed each other at Horns Bridge, the Midland Mainline passed over the GCR loop into Chesterfield, and the LD&ECR passed over both on a [tpl]convert|700|ft|m[/tpl] long viaduct. Horns Bridge has been substantially redeveloped since the latter two railways closed and Horns Bridge Roundabout, where the A61 Derby Road and A617 Lordsmill Street meet, now occupies the site. The viaduct was demolished in the 1970s.
In addition to railways, Chesterfield had a tramway system, which was built in 1882 and closed in 1927.

===Air===

The nearest airfield is Netherthorpe Aerodrome near Worksop  in Nottinghamshire, but it is less than 600m of grass.. When travelling by air, passengers usually do so via East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield Robin Hood and Manchester airports. These are all within two hours travel time by road.

===Canal===

The Chesterfield Canal linked the town to the national network of waterways, and was the most important trade route through the 19th century. Overtaken by rail and then road for freight transport it fell into disuse, but has been partially restored since the mid-20th century for leisure use. However, the section through Chesterfield remains isolated from the rest of the waterway network.

==Education==

The borough of Chesterfield has many schools within and around it. There are several secondary schools in the area including Hasland Hall Community School, Brookfield Community School, Tupton Hall School, Parkside Community School, The Meadows Community School, Netherthorpe School, Newbold Community School, The Bolsover School, Springwell Community College,Walton Holymoorside Primary School and Heritage High School. Almost half have a sixth form. There is also a Roman Catholic school, St Mary's Roman Catholic High School, in Newbold.
A Further Education college, Chesterfield College, is located within a five-minute walk of Chesterfield railway station and offers many courses. It has over 15,000 students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesterfield.ac.uk/chesterfield-college/index.html|title=Chesterfield College Homepage|publisher=Chesterfield College|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]

==Religious sites==

Chesterfield is perhaps best known for the "Crooked Spire" of its Church of Saint Mary and All Saints and is why the local football team is known as The Spireites.
The spire is both twisted and leaning, twisting 45 degrees and leaning [tpl]convert|9|ft|6|in|m[/tpl] from its true centre. Folklore recounts that a Bolsover blacksmith mis-shod the Devil, who leapt over the spire in pain, knocking it out of shape. In reality the leaning characteristic has been attributed to various causes, including the absence of skilled craftsmen (the Black Death having been gone only twelve years prior to the spire's completion), the use of unseasoned timber, and insufficient cross-bracing. According to the curators of Chesterfield Museum,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] it is now believed that the bend began when the original wooden roof tiles were replaced by heavier slate and lead. The bend in the spire (the twist being deliberate[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]) follows the direction of the sun and has been caused by heat expansion and a weight it was never designed for. There is also no record of a bend until after the slate change.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] An interesting point is that the spire is not attached to the church building but is kept on by its own weight. The tower which the spire sits upon contains 10 bells. These bells were cast in 1947 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London, replacing a previous ring. The heaviest weighs [tpl]CwtQtrLb to kg|25|0|0[/tpl].
Also within Chesterfield is the Annunciation Church. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1854 and was designed by Joseph Hansom.

==Sports and leisure==

Chesterfield is home to the Football League One club Chesterfield F.C. who formerly played at the Recreation Ground (usually referred to as Saltergate). Chesterfield FC are known as the Spireites, after the Crooked Spire in the town.  In 2005 plans were announced to build a new stadium on the old Dema Glass site north of the town in Whittington Moor. Construction of the new stadium, named the 'B2net Stadium' began in summer 2009 and was completed for the start of the 2010/2011 season. The B2net stadium became the Proact stadium for the 2012–13 season due to the restructuring of the sponsoring company. The team's most notable achievement of recent years occurred in April 1997, when they reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, losing to Middlesbrough in a replay following a 3–3 draw at Old Trafford. It turned out to be one of the most controversial  in recent history with Chesterfield having a goal not given when referee David Elleray decided the ball had not crossed the goal line from a Jonathan Howard shot, a decision which was later proved incorrect by video replays. Had the goal stood the club would have progressed to the final of the FA Cup for the first time in its history—a feat which no club in the third tier of the league has achieved. The team has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring town Mansfield.
In 2006 Chesterfield FC beat Premiership heavyweights Manchester City and West Ham to move into the last 16 of the League Cup where they were narrowly beaten on penalties by Charlton Athletic. Despite their League Cup exploits, Chesterfield were relegated on the penultimate game of the season
Chesterfield Ladies FC have women's and girls' teams and are based at Queens Park Annexe; they play in the Sheffield & Hallamshire Girls County League.
