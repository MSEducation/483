The Christian Democratic Union of Germany ([tpl]lang-de|Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands[/tpl], CDU) was an East German political party founded in 1945.  It was part of the National Front with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) until 1989.
It contested the free elections in 1990 as an arm of the West German Christian Democratic Union, into which it merged after German reunification later that same year.

==Party politics==

The CDU was primarily made up of devout middle class Christians, and was originally very similar to its West German counterpart.  Its first chairman was Andreas Hermes, who had been a prominent member of the Centre Party during the Weimar Republic and a three-time minister.  He fled to the West in 1946 and was replaced by Jakob Kaiser, another former Centre Party member.  Kaiser in turn was pushed out in 1947 in favour of the more pliant Otto Nuschke, a former member of the German Democratic Party during the Weimar Republic.  Nuschke gradually pushed out those CDU members who weren't willing to do the Communists' bidding.  This culminated at the Sixth Party Congress in 1952, at which it formally transformed itself into a loyal partner of the Communists.  At this gathering, it officially embraced socialism which affirmed the line of "Christian realism" and declared itself "a Socialist party without any limitations."
In the 22 "Theses on Christian Realism", the CDU committed itself to the "Socialist reorganisation of Society" (1. edition, 1951). Emphasising the "exemplary realisation" of Karl Marx's "teaching on building a new, better social order" in the USSR, it was declared that Socialism offered at the time "the best opportunity for the realisation of Christ's demands and for exercising the practical Christianity." The programme also asserted the CDU's support for the working class' leading role in establishing socialism, a development which the party regarded from its 6th Congress on as "historically necessary and consistent."Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands (CDU) Ost by Ralf G.

Its deputies, like all other parties, consistently voted for the government proposals in the Volkskammer,  The only exception was the March 9, 1972 vote on the abortion law, when there were 14 'nays' and 8 absentees among the CDU deputies.
After Nuschke's death, the party was led by August Bach for a shorter period and in 1966 Gerald Götting was elected as the Chairman. Before that he had been the party's General Secretary.  Götting, himself a Volkskammer chairman in the 1970s, carried on and elaborated the pro-government line.
Götting remained Chairman and an SED ally until Erich Honecker was deposed in favour of Egon Krenz in October 1989.  On 2 November 1989, Götting was deposed as CDU chairman by inner party reformers.  In December 1989 Lothar de Maizière, a lawyer and deputy chairman of the Evangelical Church Synod of East Germany, was elected chairman.  From that point on the party deposed (and later expelled) its former top figures, and became the strongest proponent of speedy reunification with West Germany.
In March 1990, the CDU became the main element of the Alliance for Germany, a centre-right coalition.  It won the first (and as it turned out, only) free general elections and became the biggest party in the People's Chamber. In April de Maizìere became Prime Minister of the GDR, heading a grand coalition that immediately set about reuniting the country with the West.
In August 1990, the Democratic Awakening, a minor member of the governing coalition, merged into the East German CDU.  The merger brought Democratic Awakening spokeswoman and future Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel into the party.
In October 1990, the East German CDU merged into the West German CDU.
