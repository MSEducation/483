St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is located in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt. It is the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope. It was built during the time when Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church and was inaugurated by him in 1968.
The cathedral is named after St. Mark the Evangelist, an apostle of Jesus and founder of the Coptic Church. Relics of his life are kept inside. It is by far the largest Cathedral in Africa[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.egyptvoyager.com/features_christianmonuments_churches.htm |title=Churches in Egypt |publisher=Egyptvoyager.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06[/tpl] and the Middle East.This claim can still be valid as contrary to popular belief of the largest "cathedral" being the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in Yamoussoukro, the administrative capital of Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), which is considered the largest church in the world but not a cathedral. The nearby Cathedral of Saint Augustine is the principal place of worship and seat of the bishop of the Diocese of Yamoussoukro.

==History of the land==

Historically the land where the Cathedral stands has been used for centuries as a cemetery for the Copts; this land had the historic Anba Rouis' Church.
The land had been given to the Coptic Orthodox Church in 969 by Gawhar. This land was given as a replacement for the land that was taken from the church to be included in building the Palace of Ma'ad al-Muizz Li-Deenillah as part of the planning of the new capital of Egypt, Cairo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coptichistory.org/new_page_782.htm |title=دير الأنبا رويس |publisher=Coptichistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28[/tpl]
During the twelfth century the area contained ten Coptic churches, but during the rule of Qalawun on 18 February 1280 the churches were destroyed by the persecutors of the Copts. Two churches were subsequently built in the area under the rule of his son.
In 1943 the governorate of Cairo attempted to expropriate the area for public use. This was opposed by the General Congregation Council led by its secretary at the time Mr. Habib Elmasry; their campaign proved successful as the Coptic Church maintained control of the land under the condition that a non-profit building be built on it in the following fifteen years. This condition spurred the building of the cathedral.St Abraam[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
