The Letter to Senora Christina was an essay written in 1615 by Galileo Galilei.

==Background Information==

Christina, daughter of Charles III of Lorraine and granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. .
In 1611 Galileo was informed by a friend, Cigoli, “ill-disposed men envious of your virtue and merits met discuss... any means by which they could damage you.”  The number of scholars who disapproved with his Discourse on Floating Bodies, or were simply ill-spirited toward Galileo grew, but other than one letter from Niccolo Lorini there was not much discussion about the issue for the remainder of the year.  
Late in 1613, Galileo's former student Benedetto Castelli, a Benedictine monk, wrote to Galileo about the events at a recent dinner with the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici. In the course of conversation at the dinner Cosimo Boscaglia, a professor of philosophy, argued that the motion of the Earth could not be true, being contrary to the Bible.  After dinner ended, Castelli was called back to answer scriptural arguments against the motion of the Earth from Christina.  The monk took on the role of theologian in response, and convinced everyone there except the Duchess (who he thought was arguing mainly to hear his answers) and Boscaglia (who said nothing during this dialogue).  http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4740/29590_151541.pdf

==Contents of Letter==

Galileo replied with a long letter giving his position on the relation between science and Scripture.  By 1615, with the controversy over the Earth's motion  widespread and increasingly dangerous, Galileo revised this letter and greatly expanded it; this became the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina.  The letter circulated in manuscript but was not printed until much later, when the Inquisition had condemned Galileo.  It appeared in Strasbourg in 1636 with both Italian and Latin text, as seen in the top right image.  It was suppressed in Catholic jurisdictions, as were all works of Galileo at that period which dealt with that subject.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
In this letter was a very direct paragraph in which Galileo wrote "I hold the sun to be situated motionless in the center of the revolution of the celestial orbs while the earth rotates on its axis and revolves about the sun. They know also that I support this position not only by refuting the arguments of Ptolemy and Aristotle ... especially some pertaining to physical effects whose causes perhaps cannot be determined in any other way, and other astronomical discoveries; these discoveries clearly confute the Ptolemaic system, and they agree admirably with this other position and confirm it." http://www.inters.org/galilei-madame-christina-Lorraine Galileo's Letter to the Grand Duchess in 1615 Galileo stated that the Copernican theory was not just a mathematical calculating tool, but a physical reality. This caused some, including Dominican friar Niccolo Lorini, to complain to the Inquisition, which tried and eventually accused Galileo of suspicion of heresy.
