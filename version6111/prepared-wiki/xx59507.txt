==Logan Campus==

thumb|The Old Main from outside the Taggart Student CenterUSU's main campus in Logan is considered one of the university's greatest assets. It is situated on about [tpl]convert|500|acre|km2[/tpl], approximately one mile northeast of downtown Logan, at the mouth of Logan Canyon. The campus lies on a "bench," or shelf-like foothill overlooking the valley to the west. Mount Logan and the Bear River Range rise sharply to the immediate east. The campus contains over a hundred major buildings. Most student activity is centered around the south end of campus, which is home to the vast majority of academic departments, the quad, the Taggart Student Center, and the Old Main building.
Notable structures include Old Main, the college's first building, as well as the Merrill-Cazier Library, the [tpl]convert|305000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]ultra-modern main university library, which houses over 1,549,000 total volumes. The library also boasts an extensive special collections and archives area, an automated storage and retrieval system, and over 150 workstations and 33 group study rooms.[ref]
