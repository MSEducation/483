under Conquistador Hernando de Soto, visited the area during the early Spanish exploration of North America. He anchored in Pensacola Bay for the winter of 1539–1540.
In 1559, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano led the first settlement of the region.  His 11 ships, with 1500 settlers, anchored in the bay and established its colony on the site of today's Naval Air Station Pensacola.  A hurricane decimated the colony a few weeks later, killing hundreds and sinking 5 ships.  Suffering long-term famine and fighting, this first settlement was finally abandoned in 1561. A presidio was constructed on Santa Rosa Island in 1722 near the location of the more recent Fort Pickens. Hurricanes in 1741 and 1752 forced its relocation to the mainland.
Pensacola Beach for many years remained largely undeveloped. A casino was constructed on the island (at the present day location of Casino Beach) where a variety of special events including beauty pagents, fishing tournaments and boxing matches were held from the 30s through 50s.
The entire island was initially owned by the federal government. In order to promote infrastructure and growth on the island, the federal government leased the lands now encompassing Pensacola Beach to the Santa Rosa Island Authority (SRIA), which in turn has leased the property to homeowners. As a result, all structures on the island have 99-year renewable leases with the SRIA rather than ownership of the land itself.

==Geography==

Pensacola Beach is located at [tpl]Coord|30|20|00|N|87|08|15|W|[/tpl], on the barrier island of Santa Rosa.  It is bordered to the south by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Santa Rosa Sound and Pensacola Bay, and to the east and west by the Gulf Islands National Seashore.

==High-Rises==

Pensacola Beach is home to some of the tallest buildings between Mobile and Tallahassee.  The list below ranks the buildings in height.  1) Portofino Towers (182 feet).  2) Beach Club (175 feet).  3) Santa Rosa Towers (170 feet).  4) Verandas Tower (154 feet).  5) Hilton Pensacola Beach Resort (152 feet).

==Climate==

While generally cooler than most of peninsular Florida, Pensacola Beach maintains a more stable temperature year round than inland areas of Pensacola and Escambia County. As such, winter lows are several degrees warmer than Pensacola proper and summer highs are generally cooler as a result of the surrounding waters. As with many islands, Pensacola Beach enjoys sea breezes which begin around noon and end around sunset in the summer. [tpl]Expand section|date=January 2007[/tpl]

===Oil Spill===

The Deepwater Horizon, a BP-operated oil-drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast, exploded April 20, 2010, eventually releasing almost 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf before being capped on August 4, 2010. Oil from the explosion did not reach Pensacola Beaches until June 4, 2010. Crews posted along Escambia County’s coastline quickly cleaned much of the oil that was evident along the beaches. Despite cleanup efforts, tourism in the Pensacola Beach area was adversely affected during the summer of 2010 but has since rebounded to levels nearly equal to pre-Deepwater Horizon levels.
As part of the ongoing environmental response, community, private and governmental organizations are monitoring the beach and water for any signs of oil related incidents. The sand on the beaches has been deep cleaned and the water quality is tested on a regular basis ensuring a beautiful and safe vacation destination for travelers from all over the world.

===Hurricanes===

As a community located on a low-lying barrier island, Pensacola Beach is vulnerable to hurricanes. Landfalling storms have been known to drive storm surge over the island, damaging or destroying man made structures and causing beach erosion. In 1995, two hurricanes made landfall on the island.  Hurrican Erin made landfall in August while Hurricane Opal blasted the island just two months later, leveling some dunes and destroying a number of homes.
On 16 September 2004, Hurricane Ivan devastated the Pensacola Beach area, destroying more than 650 homes and damaging many others. Ivan was the last Hurricane to make Florida landfall in 2004, one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in decades.
On 10 July 2005, Dennis made landfall between Pensacola Beach and east-end Navarre Beach. However, as with Erin several years earlier, the damage on Pensacola Beach was not nearly as extensive as predicted.
The island has been subject to mandatory evacuation order during some of these hurricanes.

==Public Transportation==

Pensacola Beach has service 7 days a week on ECAT's #64 route.http://www.goecat.com/routes/_doc/ride-guide.pdf

==Attractions==

===The Quietwater Beach Boardwalk===

The Boardwalk is on the Santa Rosa Sound side of the island, directly across from Casino Beach. Retail shops, restaurants, nightclubs, street musicians and sidewalk artists line it. The Boardwalk has a large sea shell stage where concerts are held several times a year. Most events are held here, including The Lobster Fest, DeLuna Fest, Bushwacker Fest, and the Independence Day fireworks. Behind the beach there is a boat dock where anyone can park their boats free of charge.

===Fort Pickens===

Located at the western end of Santa Rosa Island, Fort Pickens was completed in 1834 and used until WWII, when modern weapons made traditional coastal defenses obsolete. It is open to the public as part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, with a fee required for entry; campsites are also available for a fee. The road from Pensacola Beach to the fort was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, and remained closed until it re-opened on 22 May 2009.http://www.nps.gov/guis/

===Novelty houses===

Pensacola Beach is home to several "novelty houses", including the house "Dome of a Home",  built in 2002 using a monolithic dome in the form of a large concrete dome, designed to structurally withstand hurricane-force winds at [tpl]nowrap|133 m/s[/tpl] and storm surge. It withstood hurricane Ivan and Dennis. It is also known as the "Flintstone Home" due to the fact it resembles a rock home.monolithic.com - There’s a Dome of a Home Going Up On Pensacola Beach!, 2008-12-30
Another novelty house is the house with a  UFO-shaped Futuro attached as a second story. This Futuro house is sometimes called the "Spaceship House."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]

===Education===

There is one school on Pensacola Beach.  The Pensacola Beach Elementary School is for children from kindergarten through fifth grade.  This school has an enrollment ranging from 120 to 140 students.  All elementary-school age children on Pensacola Beach are eligible to attend the school.  The first year the school was open, for the school year 1977-1978, classes were held in an empty A-frame house owned by a local named Harry Gowens.  The Pensacola Beach Volunteer Fire Department building was also used in aiding the teachers and administrators.  In November 1977, four portable buildings were moved to the present site.  The school has continued to grow and produce some outstanding students.  The school has been ranked as an 'A' school in the state for many years running.  They have also received the 5 Star School award since 1998.  This award recognizes schools with exemplary student involvement.  In 2001 the Pensacola Beach Elementary lost its ties to the Escambia County School District and became a Charter school.Escambia County School District website http://www.escambia.k12.fl.us/  Now the school, with the help of parents, volunteers, and the community, must find ways to pay for their resources and staff.

===Churches===

There are only two traditional churches on the island of Pensacola Beach. It is under the laws and guidelines of the Santa Rosa Island Authority that these be the only churches on the island. However, since around 2011, at least two other area churches have held satellite church meeting and openly worshipped on the water's edge on Sunday mornings.
One is called "Worship on the Water" and is held behind Flounders.  The other meeting is at the first beach on your left, just as you go through the toll bridge. There are two traditional "brick and mortar" churches on the island.  The first is the Pensacola Beach Community Church, affiliated with the United Church of Christ. The second is the Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church. Our Lady of the Assumption Church is a mission church of St. Ann's Catholic church, located in Gulf Breeze, Florida.
Pensacola Beach is also home to many bridal destination weddings and many of the area's hotels have wedding packages available.  There are many businesses in the local area who are available to assist in the beach weddings.  A fairly diverse and impartial listing is available at VisitPensacola.com and clicking on the Wedding Vendor section.
