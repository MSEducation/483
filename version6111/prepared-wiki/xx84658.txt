CATEGORIES: Marketing terminology, Advertising terminology, Public relations terminology

The Q Score is a measurement of the familiarity and appeal of a brand, company, celebrity, or television show used in the United States. The higher the Q Score, the more highly regarded the item or person is among the group that is familiar with them. Q Scores and other variants are primarily used by the media, marketing, advertising, and public relations industries.

==Usage==

The Q Score is a metric that determines a "quotient" ("Q") factor through mail and online panelists who make up representative samples of the population. The Q score identifies the familiarity of an athlete, celebrity, licensed property, TV show, or brand and measures the appeal of each among people familiar with each.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/q%20rating | title=Q rating definition | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl] Other popular synonyms include Q rating, Q factor, or simply Q.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/07/arts/television-q-ratings-the-popularity-contest-of-the-stars.html?src=pm | title=TELEVISION; Q-Ratings: The Popularity Contest of the Stars | publisher=The New York Times | date=June 7, 1992 | accessdate=19 September 2013 | author=Finkle, David[/tpl]
The Q Score was developed in 1963 by Jack Landis and is owned by Marketing Evaluations, Inc,[tpl]cite web | url=http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/the-numbers-behind-modern-star-search-906/ | title=The Numbers Behind Modern Star Search | publisher=TheWall Street Journal | accessdate=19 September 2013 | author=Bialik, Carl[/tpl] the company he founded in 1964. Q Scores are calculated for the population as a whole as well as by demographic groups such as age, sex, income, marital status, or education level.
Q Score respondents are given the following choices for each person or item being surveyed:    A. One of my favorites.   B. Very Good   C. Good   D. Fair   E. Poor   F. Never heard of.
The score is calculated by dividing the percentage of respondents who answer A by the total percentage of respondents who are familiar with the subject (the sum of A through E) times 100. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Other companies have since created other measures and metrics related to the likability, popularity, and appeal of athletes, celebrities, and brands. Marketing Evaluations claims that the Q Score is more valuable to marketers than other popularity measurements, such as the Nielsen ratings, because Q Scores indicate not only how many people are aware of or watch a TV show but also how those people feel about the TV show. A well-liked television show, for example, may be worth more as a commercial venue to an advertiser than a higher-rated show that people don’t like as much. High emotional bonding with a show means strong viewer involvement and audience attention, which are important indicators for the quality of the show's advertising environment. Viewers who regard the show as a "favorite" have higher awareness of the show's commercial content.

Marketing Evaluations regularly calculates Q Scores in eight categories:[tpl]cite web | url=http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/you-like-me-you-really-like-me-1117896302/ | title=You like me! You really like me! | publisher=Varity | accessdate=19 September 2013 | author=Dempsey, John[/tpl]
TVQ and Cable Q Scores are calculated for all regularly scheduled broadcast and cable shows.
Other Q Scores are calculated to order for clients who want to research public perception of a brand or celebrity. For example, in 2000, IBM hired Marketing Evaluations to calculate the Q Score for Deep Blue, the supercomputer that defeated chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue’s Q Score was 9, meaning the computer was as familiar and appealing at the time as Carmen Electra, Howard Stern, and Bruce Wayne. In contrast, Albert Einstein’s Q Score at the time was 56, while Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy each received a Q Score of 6.IBM press release discussing Deep Blue’s Q ScoreCNN article on Deep Blue’s ranking
