===Water and waste disposal===

Water disposal is mostly done by draining in a septic tank where the sewage is not that well developed.
Waste is disposed mostly in areas requiring reclamation.This includes places like quarries,mined areas etc.

===Energy grid===

Yukon Energy operates four conventional hydroelectric generating stations: Whitehorse Dam (40 MW), Aishihik Lake (37 MW), Mayo A (5 MW), and Mayo B (10 MW), which provide the bulk of generation for the Yukon Energy grid. 39 MW of diesel generation is maintained for supplemental back-up.[tpl]cite web|title=Our Facilities|url=http://www.yukonenergy.ca/energy/facilities/|publisher=Yukon Energy|accessdate=2012-12-31[/tpl]
Additionally, Yukon Energy operates two wind turbines near Whitehorse, which are connected to the Whitehorse-Aishihik-Faro grid. The first turbine is a Bonus Energy 150 kW MARK III installed in 1993. The second turbine, a Vestas 660 kW V47 LT II was later installed in 2000. These units need to be specially adapted to deal with icing and the northern environment.Yukon Energy. Yukonenergy.ca.

===Health care===

The first "White Horse General Hospital" (WGH) was built in the downtown area in 1902 with a 10 bed capacity. During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt in on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl]
In 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.
The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.
