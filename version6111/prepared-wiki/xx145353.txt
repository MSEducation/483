[[Centroacinar cell]]

CATEGORIES: Digestive system

Centroacinar cells are spindle-shaped cells in the exocrine pancreas. Centroacinar cells are an extension of the intercalated duct cells into each pancreatic acinus. The intercalated ducts take the bicarbonate to intralobular ducts which become lobular ducts. These lobular ducts finally converge to form the main pancreatic duct.[tpl]cite book| author = Wendy Lackey M.A. | title = Oral Cavity and Upper GI tract (coursepack from Michigan State University College of Human Medicine) | chapter=lectures ession 12 | page = 327 |date=February 2011 | pmid = | doi = | url = | issn = [/tpl]
These cells are commonly known as duct cells, and secrete an aqueous bicarbonate solution under stimulation by the hormone secretin. They also secrete mucin.
