CATEGORIES: Lists of words, Regional nicknames, British culture, Anti-English sentiment

Alternative names for the British (people from the United Kingdom) include nicknames and terms, including affectionate ones, neutral ones, and derogatory ones to describe the British people and more specifically English, Welsh, Scottish and some Northern Irish people.

==Brit==

Brit is a commonly used term in the United States and elsewhere, simply as a shortened form of "British." It was considered offensive historically,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Brit&searchmode=none|title=Etymology Online "Brit"[/tpl] but has become somewhat more neutral over time, and is increasingly used by the British themselves in international contexts.

==Britisher==

An archaic form of "Briton," similar to "Brit", always much more used in North America than Britain itself, but even there largely outdated. The term was also used extensively in the British Raj and is still used extensively in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

==Brittunculi==

In one of the Vindolanda tablets the Latin pejorative of Brittunculi (wretched little Britons) [tpl]cite web|url=http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink2/4DACTION/WebRequestQuery?searchTerm=164&searchType=number&searchField=TVII&thisListPosition=1&thisPageNum=0 |title=Vindolanda Tablet 164 Leaf No. 1 (front) |publisher=Vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100624054155/http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink2/4DACTION/WebRequestQuery?searchTerm=164&searchType=number&searchField=TVII&thisListPosition=1&thisPageNum=0| archivedate= 24 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] is used (presumably by a Roman official) in a commentary of their particular military tactics.

==Hun==

Hun, Huns or the Hun are used in and, particularly among Northern Irish nationalist communities. Can refer to British people in general or English people specifically. Possibly related to the use of Hun as a name for the Germanic descent of the British Royal family.

==Inselaffe==

A pejorative German name for the British is Inselaffe, which means 'island ape' or 'island monkey'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Inselaffe.html|title=dict.cc "Inselaffe"[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Terms of abuse and affection: Do they mean us?

==Limey==

The term is thought to have originated in the 1850s as "lime-juicer",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lime-juicer|work=Merriam-Webster|title=lime–juic·er|accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl] and was later shortened to "limey".name=Dictionary>[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/limey|work=Dictionary.com:|title=limey|accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl] It was originally used as a derogatory word for sailors in the Royal Navy, because of the Royal Navy's practice since the beginning of the 19th century of adding lemon juice or lime juice to the sailors' daily ration of watered-down rum (known as grog), in order to prevent scurvy.Oxford Dictionaries: Limey  Retrieved 2011-07-06[tpl]cite web|url=http://ask.yahoo.com/20041027.html|work=Ask Yahoo!|title=Why are British people called "limeys"?|accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]
Eventually the term lost its naval connection and was used about British people in general. In the 1880s, it was used to refer to British immigrants in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Although the term may have been used earlier in the U.S. Navy as a slang word for a British sailor or a British warship, such usage isn't documented until 1918. By 1925, its usage in American English had been extended to mean any Briton, and the expression was so commonly known that it was used in American newspaper headlines.

==Pommy or Pom==

The terms pommy, pommie and pom, in Australia and New Zealand usually denotes an English person (or, less commonly, people from other parts of the UK).[tpl]cite book|chapter=It's no excuse I fear|title=Keeping the culture|author=Merv Webster|year=2006|url=http://users.tpg.com.au/thegrey/Written%20Poetry.htm|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] After complaints to the Australian Advertising Standards Board about five advertisements poking fun at "Poms",[tpl]Cite news |title=Pom ruled not offensive |newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph |location=Australia |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw-act/pom-ruled-not-offensive/story-e6freuzi-1111112734054 | accessdate = 20 January 2010[/tpl] the Board ruled (in 2006) that these words are not offensive.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10636663 |title='Pommy git' okay, BSA rules – National – NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl] The New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority made a similar ruling in 2010.
There are several folk etymologies for Pommy or Pom. The best-documented of these is that pommy originated as a contraction of "pomegranate".http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/287200.htmlhttp://www.allwords.com/word-pom.html According to this explanation, "pomegranate" was Australian rhyming slang for "immigrant" ("Jimmy Grant").Tom McArthur (ed.), 1992, The Oxford Companion to the English Language, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p384. Usage of "pomegranate" for English people may have been strengthened by a belief in Australia that sunburn occurred more frequently among English immigrants, turning those with fair skin the colour of pomegranates.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/01/10/scboyc110.xml |title=Cricket must crack down on the abuse – Telegraph | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Geoffrey | last=Boycott | date=10 January 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010[/tpl] Another explanation – now generally considered to be a false etymology – was that "pom" or "pommy" were derived from an acronym such as POM ("Prisoner of Millbank"), POME ("Prisoner of Mother England") or POHMS ("Prisoner Of Her Majesty's Service").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/pommy.asp |title=Snopes.com 'Etymology of Pommy'[/tpl] However, there is no evidence that such terms, or their acronyms, were used in Australia when "pom" and "pommy" entered use there. Another folk etymology suggests that the term was derived from the word "pompous".[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Redcoat==

The term Redcoat is a defunct slang term (along with "lobsterback") for a British soldier. This term applied from the mid-17th century to around 1902 when British Army soldiers wore distinctive Venetian Red coats as part of their formal fighting wear and military dress uniforms. This term, "redcoat", is still sometimes used by Americans in a modern sense towards the British in a jovial manner.
The '40th Regiment of Foot' re-enactments at Sovereign Hill, Ballarat, Australia features British soldiers dressed in their Redcoats.http://sovereignhilleducation.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/the-redcoats-connecting-history-lessons/ This and the events at the nearby Eureka Stockade reinforces the continued local use of the term 'Redcoat' to refer to a British soldier in the Ballarat area.
'Red Coat' is also a term that the British Army infantry battalion, the Green Jackets, would call the rest of the army as a derogatory term. This dates back to the times when the British Army would wear their red tunics, but the Green Jackets Battalion were used as a reconnaissance battalion and therefore would dress in green to be camouflaged. The Green Jackets have now amalgamated to form the 1st Battalion, The Rifles.

==Rosbif/Rosbeef==

The original explanation of this French term is that rosbif referred to the English style of cooking roast beef,[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rosbif|title=Wiktionary "Rosbif"[/tpl] and especially to the song The Roast Beef of Old England.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2913151.stm |title=BBC – Why do the French call the British 'the roast beefs'? |publisher=BBC News |date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-01[/tpl] Interestingly, it is reputed that Rosbeauf is from the Middle Ages when the King of France sent his Court Chefs to England to learn how to 'roast the beef', as the English were the experts. Hence, 'les rosbif'.
In Portugal, the term bife (literally meaning steak, but sounding like beef) is used as a slang term to refer to the English.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artshuttle.net/lisbonblog/?p=127|title=Lisbonblog "Bife"[/tpl] There is a feminine form, bifa, mainly used to refer to English female tourists[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl].

==Tommy==

The name Tommy for any soldier in the British Army is particularly associated with World War I. The French and the British Commonwealth armies used the name "Tommy" for the British. "Tommy" is derived from the name "Tommy Atkins" which had been used as a generic name for a soldier for many years (and had been used as an example name on British Army registration forms). The precise origin is the subject of some debate, but it is known to have been used as early as 1743. Rudyard Kipling published the poem "Tommy" (part of the Barrack Room Ballads) in 1892 and in 1893 the music hall song "Private Tommy Atkins" was published with words by Henry Hamilton and music by S. Potter. In 1898 William McGonagall wrote "Lines in Praise of Tommy Atkins".
The paybooks issued to all British soldiers of World War I used the name "Tommy Atkins" to illustrate how they should be filled in.

==Pākehā==

"Pākehā" is a Māori language term for New Zealanders who are "of European descent".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Europe==

In Polish a common formal term to describe an Englishman is Anglik, derived from the Polish word for England, Anglia, with the word Brytyjczyk meaning Briton, from the Polish name for Great Britain, Wielka Brytania. Derogatory terms coined in recent years are Angol and Brytol respectively; however, due to negative connotations they are not used in formal writing or by the media.
In the Czech Republic the term Anglán is often used, which has the same roots as the Polish Anglik- the Czechs call England Anglie. This word is neither positive nor negative. However, unlike the formal Angličan, it is not used by the press because of its informality.
In Hungary the English people are called "angol" or in plural "angolok". England is called "Anglia". British people in general are called "brit" or in plural "brittek" but the term is less widespread. Great Britain is called "Nagy-Britannia" but the United Kingdom is called "Egyesült Királyság".

==Africa==

In South Africa the term pom may also be used, while Afrikaans speakers may use the term rooinek (literally "red neck", another reference to sunburning).[tpl]cite news|author=Donald G. McNeil Jr|title=Like Politics, All Political Correctness Is Local|url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8414/pc.htm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 October 1998|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmszaGEx|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
During the Second Boer War, they became known as khakis, in reference to the colour of their uniforms – which, by then, was no longer the red coats due to them being unsuitable to the South African climate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/faskew/Colonial/Glossary/SouthAfrica.htm|title=British Military Terms and Soldier Slang[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saffagator.com/list-of-south-african-slang-words|title=List of South African Slang Words[/tpl]
Another common term used by Afrikaners to describe the British in South Africa is soutie or soutpiel, meaning "salty" or "salty penis" respectively. The meaning behind this is that they have one foot in Britain and one foot in South Africa, leaving their penis to hang in the salty sea water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/soutpiel|title=dictionary.com "soutpiel"[/tpl]
In the East African Bantu languages mzungu has come to mean any white European but more often than not especially the British or English due to their colonial past in the region.

==South Asia==

In Nepal, the British are often referred to as Kuires/Khaires which means people of white or pale colour. It is also used in general for any European person with white skin.
In Malaysia, one common Malay equivalent is Mat Salleh. The term may have originated from the general depiction of British colonial sailors who were often drunk (Mad Sailors); due to the inability of locals to pronounce English words correctly, it became mat salleh (Mat and Salleh are both typical Malay names). Another possible origin of the phrase is the Mat Salleh Rebellion, led by North Borneo chief Mat Salleh, against the British North Borneo Company during the late-19th century. Another alternative to mat salleh is orang putih (literally "white people" in Malay) or its shortened rural form, omputih. In ancient Malaccan times, the term orang deringgi was also used.
Angrez, Angrej, Ingraj, Anggrit are versions of French word Anglais meaning Englishman.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Ingraj is used in Maharashtra (Marathi) and West Bengal (Bengali) region of India to refer to British people.[tpl]cite book|last=Potdar|first=Datto Waman|title=Marathe Va Ingraj|year=1922|location=Pune|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datto_Vaman_Potdar[/tpl]
Among South Asians, Angrez has the same meaning, although its more specific meaning is Englishman, with Angrezan for an English woman. This is mostly seen as an ethnic, rather than a territorial, term and applied specifically for people of Anglo-Saxon origin. So people of South Asian origin living in England do not usually refer to themselves as Angrez or Angrezan. Replacing the z with j and j with z is common practice especially amongst people from India, particularly Indian Punjab; hence it would be "Angrej" (masculine) and "Angrejan" (female). 
The adjective Gora (Gori for females) is also commonly used amongst South Asians and South Asian British to refer to white Britons, although the term literally translates to "fair-skinned one", and thus could and is applied to individuals of any ethnicity with a fair complexion including south  Asians themselves. The adjective has also been used as a noun to describe white people – hence its potential as a racial slur. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Indian Punjabis use the term Englandi for any other citizen of England, including Asian British people, regardless of that person's ancestral ethnicity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Malayalis of Kerala use the term Sayyip to refer to a male westerner.
The feminine equivalent is Madaamma.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In Assam (which became part of British India in 1828), the British are called Boga Bongal (literally meaning White Foreigners or White Intruders). Bongal was a derogatory word for foreigners and invaders in Assam under Ahom rule and it still is used.
In  Tamil Nadu the Tamil word "Vellaikaaran" means White man usually referring British rulers during freedom struggles in the 18th to 19th century where prominent freedom fighters like 'Kappalottiya Tamilian' V.O.Chidambaranar, Subramanya Bharathi, Subramanya Siva, Kamarajar and Veerapaandi Kattabomman existed. It's used in present day to refer any one White with European origin where still many rural Tamil villagers believe that all Europeans are English. "Vellaikaari" means white woman and "Vellaikaarargal" or "Vellaiyargal" is the plural form meaning white people.
In Thai, the word anggrit (อังกฤษ) is used to described both the English in particular, and the British in general. In everyday speech the word Farang (ฝรั่ง) is usually used to describe British people as well as other light-skinned Europeans. Some foreigners regard this word as racist. In journalism, the expression puu dee (ผู้ดี) meaning "nobleman" is sometimes used to denote "English".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
"Suddo", "Ingrisikarayo" are Sri Lankan, Sinhalese names for British and other western white skinned people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==East Asia==

The following terms are used to mean "Britain" or "British" and use etymologies mostly unrelated to "Britain":
These terms are also used to refer to England in unofficial contexts. More formal names also exist, such as the Chinese 聯合王國 Liánhéwángguó and Japanese 連合王国 Rengōōkoku literally meaning "United Kingdom". Separate words exist in all of these languages for each of the constituent parts of the UK, including England, although, as elsewhere, there is little awareness of correct usage. The Chinese Dàbùlièdiān (Hanzi: 大不列颠) is used for historical purposes to mean "Great Britain." The first character means "Great" and the other three have unrelated meanings, having been selected for the sound instead of meaning.
The Chinese Yīngguó and the Japanese Eikoku are written identically as 英国, where the first character 英 means "outstanding," "excellence," or "flower," and the second character 国 means "country," "nation," or "kingdom." Korean 영국 also means "glorious"  (영 'yeong') and nation (국 'guk'). A British person is 영국 사람 'yeongguk saram', literally meaning Britain Person.
In Japanese, the term Igirisu (Katakana: [tpl]lang|ja|イギリス[/tpl]) is used interchangeably with Eikoku, but is considered slightly more foreign because it comes from the Portuguese "Inglês."

==Lack of British/English Distinction==

In many languages, the equivalent terms for 'English' and 'England' are often used interchangeably with 'British' and 'Britain', and this is also relatively common in many non-British varieties of English (and far from unknown in British English itself).
In Turkish 'İngiltere' is used for both Britain and England, despite there being a separate word for Britain, 'Britanya'. Welsh people in particular are very often referred to in French as 'Anglais' rather than 'Gallois', in Russian as 'англичанин' Angličanin, and so on. The same occurs rather less frequently in the case of individuals from Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, even those countries may still sometimes be considered to form part of Angleterre or the equivalent. In French, the word britannique ('British') is restricted to more official contexts and tends to be used for governments rather than for individuals.
In Spain the distinction between the English, Scots, Welsh and their mother countries is, as in Hispanic America, almost completely non-existent. This is reflected in the media where the British government, the army, etc., are all referred to as inglés (English).
