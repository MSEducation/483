==The concept==

WhizzGo provided a city-wide fleet of low emission Citroën cars that were located in designated on-street bays across city centres.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whizzgo.co.uk/index.cfm | title=Whizzgo website[/tpl]  WhizzGo offered an "environmentally sustainable service", reducing pollution and congestion by encouraging sustainable transport options so members take fewer car trips and walk, cycle or use public transport more, educating members on green driving tips and carbon offsetting.
Through its expansion, WhizzGo had partnered with Virgin Trains, public transport operators (such as Metro West Yorkshire and  Stagecoach in Manchester)and Dahon foldable bikes. WhizzGo had also developed through partnerships with several city councils nationwide such as Leeds, Sheffield, York, Liverpool, Southampton and St Albans. 
A membership fee of £25 plus an insurance deposit of £125 was required to joint the scheme.[tpl]cite web|title=Pay and go car system gets off the ground|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/1840376.0/?act=complaint&cid=785195|work=Worcester News|accessdate=12 March 2012|date=16 November 2007[/tpl]  Members paid a monthly membership fee of £5 and then can pay-as-they-go by the hour or day. Members were issued with a WhizzGo smart card which was held against a sensor in the windscreen of the vehicle to unlock the doors. Members entered their 4 digit PIN into the on-board computer, took the keys from the glove compartment and drove off.

==Acquisition by City Car Club==

On 28 August 2009, WhizzGo was acquired by City Car Club creating the UK's largest network of hourly rental cars. The acquisition marked the first major consolidation within the UK car club industry and secured City Car Club a leading position - with 500 cars in 15 cities and a membership base of 16,000. 
In November 2009, Whizzgo announced it would be closing some locations; for example, about the closure of the St Albans location and new owners could not be found.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/news/4706868.St_Albans_car_scheme_bites_the_dust/ | author=St Albans Review | title=St Albans car scheme bites the dust | accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl]
