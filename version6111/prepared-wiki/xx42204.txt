Accessed 2012-06-03.  Before its creation, fighting drug crimes was a responsibility of the Ministry of Defense."$20,000 Marijuana Destroyed", New Liberian, 1981-02-02, 7.  The agency began as the National Drug Committee of the Interim Government of National Unity; it was created in 1993 during the presidency of Amos Sawyer.  Five years later, the committee was converted into its present form: President Taylor signed a bill passed by the National Legislature that created the DEA and patterned it after the Drug Enforcement Administration in the United States.  The DEA is charged with fighting drug trafficking at the country's borders, arresting traffickers and dealers, and destroying illegal drugs.DEA Destroys Over LD$10 Million Drugs, AllAfrica, 2011-10-04.

In 2011, the DEA boss was Director Henry Shaw, but by 2012 he had been replaced by Anthony Souh.  Directors are appointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Senate of Liberia.  The DEA is not responsible for overseeing commerce in legal drugs and other pharmaceuticals; such substances are within the purview of the Pharmaceutical Board of Liberia."Operation Fake Drugs To Commence Soon".
