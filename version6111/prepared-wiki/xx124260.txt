The Hollywood Split (officially Bruce T. Hinman Memorial Interchange) is a freeway interchange in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, California. It is the interchange of the following routes:

==Description==

The interchange is the western terminus of SR 134 and the southern terminus of SR 170 and is also known as the interchange of the Hollywood Freeway and the Ventura Freeway.LA Times Article on poor connectivity Motorists, especially visitors and newcomers to the Los Angeles area, find the interchange confusing for a number of reasons. The name "Hollywood Freeway" is attributed to US 101 south of the interchange and SR 170 north of the interchange, while "Ventura Freeway" is attributed to US 101 west of the interchange and SR 134 east of the interchange. The Ventura Freeway segment of US 101 has an east–west alignment, but is signed as a north–south highway. Throughout the San Fernando Valley, the same onramp may be signed as both 101 North and 101 West or 101 South/101 East.
Due to the freeways' acute intersecting angles, the interchange does not permit motorists entering the interchange to exit in all possible directions of travel. For example, motorists approaching the interchange on northbound US 101 may continue westbound ("northbound") on US 101 or northbound on SR 170 but not to eastbound SR 134.SCV Los Angeles Orange County Frwys
