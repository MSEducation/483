Col RLC is responsible for the Moral Component, regimental infrastructure and support and works to the Adjutant General (AG).
An update was given at Deepcut on 9 February 2012 on the future planned move of HQ RLC & Defence Logistics School from Deepcut to Worthy Down (Project KESTREL) the date of 2018 is now projected for moves, with new buildings being built from April 2015 with 'ring-fenced' cash not affected by the 'Strategic Defence Review'. The plans are subject to confirmation by the Central Staffs, however a "No move before..." 2015 remains.

==Master General of Logistics==

There is also a ceremonial head (instituted in 2009), who heads the Corps and its wider family such as the Associations and Cadets, known as the Master General of Logistics (MGL). The first MGL was General Sir Kevin O'Donoghue, who held until December 2010 the post of Chief of Defence Materiel, the senior military post associated with supply and acquisition in the Ministry of Defence. The latest MGL, appointed on 1 June 2012, is Major General Mark Poffley. He is currently serving in MOD, Whitehall.
