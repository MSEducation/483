==History==

Music for Youth (MFY) was founded in 1970, the first event staged was the National Festival on 10 and 11 July 1971 at the Lyceum on The Strand. Following this a nationwide series of Regional Festivals were introduced and there was a large increase in entries for the second National Festival in Fairfield Halls, Croydon in 1972. The National Festival moved to London's South Bank Centre in 1981 and to Birmingham in 2005. The first Schools Prom was held at the Royal Albert Hall in November 1975.http://www.mfy.org.uk/pages/aboutmfy [tpl]Wayback|date=20110514054858|url=http://www.mfy.org.uk/pages/aboutmfy|df=yes[/tpl]
