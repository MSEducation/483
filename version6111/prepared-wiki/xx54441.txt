==History==

The University of Massachusetts Lowell owes its origins to two institutions founded in the 1890s: the Lowell State College on the south side of the Merrimack River and Lowell Textile School on the north side. Each would follow its own path of expansion through the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insidecollege.com/reno/University-of-Massachusetts--Lowell/2800137/school.do?itemId=17682|title=University of Massachusetts -- Lowell|year=2010|publisher=Alloy Education|accessdate=23 March 2014|location=Lowell, Massachusetts[/tpl]

===Lowell Normal School===

The Lowell Normal School was chartered in 1894 as a teacher training institution for women. The tenth and final normal school to be established in Massachusetts, it opened in 1898 with 108 students and five faculty members. The original classroom building opened the next year at the corner of Broadway and Wilder Streets, and quickly became a landmark in the city.[tpl]cite book|title=Lowell: The River City|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jOUDmFkD2VEC&pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-3932-4|pages=79–[/tpl] Designed by local firm Stickney & Austin, it reflects the fashion of the time: high-style Beaux Arts with classical symmetry, arches, cast-iron lampposts and yellow brick. Its design was influenced in part by Lowell High School, which was also designed by Lowell native Frederick W. Stickney. Frank Coburn, for whom the hall was later named, served as the school's first principal until 1908.[tpl]cite book|last=Hudon|first=Paul|title=Lower Merrimack: The Valley and Its Peoples|publisher=American Historical Press|date=November 15, 2004|edition=1st|pages=186–191|isbn=1-892724-44-8|accessdate=January 31, 2010[/tpl]
After being threatened with closure during the Great Depression, school administrators rallied local support to help keep it open. A delegation of prominent individuals representing Lowell's powerful interest groups traveled to Boston and convinced state officials of the school's importance. The result was that the school not only survived but continued to grow and expand. In 1950, Dr. Daniel O'Leary assumed the presidency and initiated an ambitious building program. The physical plant of the campus expanded during post-war era from a single structure to a multi-building complex, forming an area now known as UMass Lowell's South Campus.[tpl]cite book|author=Marie Frank|title=University of Massachusetts Lowell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HzxGMYAuw44C&pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7565-0|pages=8–[/tpl]
As the demand for more qualified teachers grew, the legislature reorganized the Normal School into Lowell State College in 1960 with a curriculum that expanded beyond education to include baccalaureate degrees in other fields as well, including nursing and music. Beginning in 1967, the college was authorized to confer two more degrees: Master of Education and Master of Music Education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uml.edu/Education/About/History.aspx|title=Graduate School of Education Umass Lowell-History|year=2010|publisher=University of Massachusetts Lowell|accessdate=23 March 2014|location=Lowell, Massachusetts[/tpl]

Modeled after the now-defunct Polytechnic College of Pennsylvania, Lowell Textile was the combined effort of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and corporations eager to form a school dedicated to textile education. Under the guidance of founder James T. Smith, Lowell Textile opened its doors in February 1897 in the upper floors of a downtown commercial block located on Middle Street. The school offered three-year training programs in cotton or wool manufacture, design, textile chemistry and dyeing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9507E0DC123CE433A25756C0A9669D94669ED7CF|title=The Lowell Textile School-First of Its Kind In Massachusetts Opens With 200 Students|date=October 5, 1897|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=30 January 2010|location=Lowell, Massachusetts | format=PDF[/tpl]
