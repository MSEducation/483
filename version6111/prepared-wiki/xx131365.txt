Dugald Livingstone (25 February 1898 – 15 January 1981), commonly known as "Duggie", "Doug" or "Dug", was a Scottish football player and manager.
He played fullback for Parkhead, Ashfield, Celtic, Dumbarton Harp (loan), Everton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.evertonfpf.org/players/dugald-livingstone/ |title=Dugald Livingstone |publisher=evertonfpf.org |date=6 July 2011[/tpl] Plymouth Argyle, Aberdeen and Tranmere Rovers during an illustrious playing career before hanging up his boots and going into management.Michael Joyce, Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939, Nottingham, 2004, p. 159
During his managerial career, Livingstone took charge of the Republic of Ireland from 1951 to 1953, before managing Belgium,http://www.scottishkanaries.eu/Storys/Connections/Dugald%20Livingstone.htm guiding them to the 1954 FIFA World Cup and notably was in charge for the thrilling 4–4 draw with England in the group stages.
After success with Belgium he moved on to manage Newcastle United in 1954. Some supporters and staff were at first concerned that his tactics were in total contrast to those of his predecessor George Martin, but these doubts were laid to rest when he guided the team to FA Cup victory in 1955. The Newcastle board had the final say in which players would be playing during his spell at the club and they notably played Jackie Milburn for this final, against Livingstone's wishes. Milburn coincidentally scored in the match.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toon1892.co.uk/detail_manager.php?id=7 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111009052438/http://www.toon1892.co.uk/detail_manager.php?id=7 |archivedate=9 October 2010 |title=Doug Livingstone|work=Manager details|publisher= toon1892 |accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl]
It was largely believed that Livingstone was unhappy with the amount of influence the board had on first team issues (although he never stated this). He left Newcastle in 1956 and went on to manage Fulham between 1956 and 1958http://www.fulhamfc.com/history/managers/dugald-livingstone and then Chesterfield until 1962.http://www.cfchistory.com/managers-livingstone
