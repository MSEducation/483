==History==

The area has been settled since prehistoric times, evidenced by archaeological excavations in the locality of Santa Barbara. It is believed to be the site of the ancient Greek city of Neapolis of Apulia, not mentioned by any extant records, but attested by many coins. Remains of the Roman domination include the bridge on the Via Traiana. The former cathedral includes works by the sculptor Stefano of Putignano. In the frazione of San Vito is a massive Benedictine abbey.
