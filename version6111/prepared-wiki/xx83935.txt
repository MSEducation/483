In Sheffield he was taught by well respected local drummer Haydon Cook, who had returned to the city after a long residency, in the 1950s, at Ronnie Scotts in London. While in the Black Watch military band from 1957 to 1960 he studied music theory and improved upon his drumming technique. From 1960 to 1964 he led his own quartet which performed locally in England, and in 1963 he began working with Gavin Bryars and guitarist Derek Bailey in a trio known as Joseph Holbrooke.[tpl]cite book| last =Cox| first =Christop, et al.| year =2004| title =Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music| pages= 257[/tpl] Oxley moved to London in 1966 and became house drummer at Ronnie Scott's, where he accompanied visiting musicians as Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Charlie Mariano, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins and Bill Evans until the early 1970s. He was also a member of various groups led by musicians such as Gordon Beck, Alan Skidmore and Mike Pyne.
In 1969 Oxley appeared on the recording of the later released John McLaughlin album Extrapolation and also formed his own quintet consisting of Derek Bailey, Jeff Clyne, Evan Parker and Kenny Wheeler, releasing the album The Baptised Traveller. Following this album the group was joined by Paul Rutherford on trombone and became a sextet, releasing the 1970 album 4 Compositions for Sextet. That same year Oxley helped found Incus Records along with Bailey and others and also the Musicians Cooperative. He also received a three-month "artist-in-residence" at the Sydney Conservatorium in Australia in 1970.[tpl]cite news| last =Brennan| first =Gerald E.| year =| title =Tony Oxley Biography| url= http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002906/Tony-Oxley.html[/tpl] Around this time he joined the London Jazz Composers Orchestra and also got involved with collaborations with Howard Riley.
