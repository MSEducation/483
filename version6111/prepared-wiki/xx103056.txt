Rich Rosen (born May 13, 1956) is a software developer and an author on the subject of web development, who gained notoriety as an early high-volume contributor to Usenet newsgroups.

==Early life and education==

Rosen grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, New York. He attended Cornell University and later Queens College, where he received a bachelor's degree in computer science. He later received his master's degree in the same subject from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, while working at Bell Labs and later at Bellcore.

==1980s - Bell Labs and Usenet==

While at Bell Labs and Bellcore (now known as Telcordia Technologies) during the 1980s, Rosen was a lead engineer on the team that beta-tested IBM's then brand-new DB2 relational database management system, which would become one of the first commercially available relational database systems on the market. He also developed one of the earliest online bulletin board systems used to keep telephone operating companies informed about Bell System software standards.
He also acquired a reputation there as a high-volume poster to Usenet newsgroups. The volume of Usenet postings he produced led to rumors that many people were actually using his account, or that he was an AI program produced by Bell Labs to increase the amount of Usenet traffic and thus augment AT&T's long distance telephone revenues.Reference to quoted article about Rich Rosen by Tom Richardson Weekly statistics collected during his heyday often showed that he, by himself, was responsible for more than 2% of the entire volume of Usenet postings. The phrase "We are all Rich Rosen" was coined during this period and persisted as a Usenet catchphrase for a number of years.
Rosen posted in a number of newsgroups on a variety of topics, most particularly music and religion. Among his contributions:
He was known for participating in (some would say "inciting") numerous flame wars with other Usenet contributors, including the notorious Brahms Gang, a pair of equally loquacious mathematics graduate students from Berkeley who posted from a server named brahms.berkeley.edu. His verbal battles with the Brahms Gang in particular were sometimes referred to as "The War of the Rosens". He was also known for his variety of frequently-changing .signature files, including:

===Usenet Citations and Acknowledgements===

The volume and content of Rosen's postings evoked strong reactions in both advocates and detractors. People either praised him for his postings or denounced him as a threat to the future of Usenet.

==Post-Bellcore (1990s)==

Rosen left Bellcore in 1989, but continued to post occasionally to Usenet from various outside accounts. He was one of the early members of the Panix user community in New York through the mid-1990s. He hosted his own popular "Monty Python home page" that was cited by both Lycos and the Global Network Navigator.
During the latter part of the 1990s, Rosen worked at Pencom Web Works with Leon Shklar, with whom he would later collaborate on Web Application Architecture: Principles, Protocols, and Practices, a widely used textbook for senior and graduate level college courses in Web application development.

==Present day==

Today, Rosen lives once again in New Jersey with his wife, Celia. He is "retired" from posting to Usenet, but now has his own blog to post to. He still writes on the subject of web application development, including articles for various online and print journals, while also working with Leon Shklar on a second edition of their Web Application Architecture book. In addition, he recently contributed material to the fourth edition of Mac OS X for Unix Geeks which was published in the fall of 2008. He continues to record his own music, some of which is accessible on his web site.
