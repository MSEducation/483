==History==

===Foundation===

In 2007, Indian football was in the process of a renovation, mainly with the start of the I-League replacing the old National Football League.[tpl]cite web|title=How-to-win-a-tourney tips from IIM to Lajong - Shillong B-school offers expert advice to boost confidence level of I-League entrants|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090821/jsp/northeast/story_11387593.jsp|work=Telegraph India|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl] However, despite this, the All India Football Federation still had trouble attracting investors to create new clubs, specially outside of West Bengal, Goa, and North East India due to the fact that, despite a good amount of fans in these areas and good wages to players, the clubs in these regions still had trouble creating any profit.[tpl]cite web|last=Ajgoankar|first=Ashlesh|title=Pune Football Club – Leading The Way In Indian Football|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2013/pune-football-club-leading-the-way-in-indian-football/|work=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl]
Ashok Piramal Group, a company based in Maharashtra, however did the opposite. Despite the city of Pune not having much history when it comes to football or much support for the sport, which is overshadowed by cricket, Ashok Piramal Group still created Pune Football Club in 2007. In creating the club they created one of the first clubs in India named after the city they were playing in and representing.

===I-League 2nd Division (2008–2009)===

In preparation for their first ever season in the I-League 2nd Division, the club signed mainly a bunch of unknown players and also signed on Stewart Hall as the first head coach of the club.[tpl]cite web|title=Gift Raikhan|url=http://punefc.com/?coaching-staff=gift-raikhan-2|work=Pune Football Club|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl] The club were grouped in Group A during the 2008 I-League 2nd Division along with Vasco, ONGC, HAL, and Chirag United. Mid-way through their 2nd Division campaign the club changed coaches, going from Stewart Hall to former Northern Ireland national teamer, Bernard McNally.[tpl]cite web|last=Banerjee|first=Subhajyoti|title=Indianfootball.com Interview: Bernard McNally|url=http://www.indianfootball.de/features/interview/interview65.html|work=IndianFootball.com|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl] The club finished in third place in Group A and thus failed to advance further that campaign.
The club then participated the next year in the 2009 I-League 2nd Division where there were now four promotion spots up for grabs instead of the usual two as the I-League was going to expand. Before the season began the club re-hired former coach Stewart Hall to coach the club.[tpl]cite web|last=Mondal|first=Subhankar|title=On Stewart Hall’s Departure From Pune FC|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1949/mondals-musings/2009/05/05/1247541/on-stewart-halls-departure-from-pune-fc|work=Goal.com|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl] Also before the season the club managed to make many changes to the squad.
