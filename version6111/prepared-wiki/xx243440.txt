CATEGORIES: Baltimore Orioles seasons, 2010 Major League Baseball season

The Baltimore Orioles' 2010 season was the 110th season in franchise history.

==Offseason==

The Orioles made many significant roster moves prior to the 2010 season.  The team parted ways with several contributors from the 2009 season including Aubrey Huff, and Melvin Mora who was the team's longest tenured player.  Miguel Tejada returned to the team to replace Mora at third base and brought in Garrett Atkins to play first. The Orioles also looked to improve the pitching staff by trading for veteran Kevin Millwood from the Texas Rangers and signing free agent closer Michael Gonzalez.

==Regular season==

Despite some predictions that the Orioles would have one of their best seasons in years (possibly even finishing with a .500 winning average), the Orioles continued to struggle throughout the first half of the season. The Orioles 2010 season got off to a horrendous start the team going 2–16 to start the season.  They would end the month of April 5–18.  May would be only slightly better as the team posted a 10–18 record for the month. On June 3, 2010. the Orioles fired manager Dave Trembley after compiling a record of 187 wins and 283 losses since being promoted during the 2007 season.  Trembley was replaced by third base coach Juan Samuel on an interim basis.
The managerial change accomplished little as the team's struggles continued under Samuel. Despite sweeping a four game series from the Texas Rangers in Texas to head into the All-Star break, the Orioles went 25–59 in the first half.  The team went 7–19 in the month of July.
On July 30, the Orioles hired Buck Showalter to be the team's full-time manager.[tpl]cite web |title = Orioles hire Buck Showalter as manager | url = http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38472552/ns/sports-baseball/| accessdate= August 5, 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100730163836/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38472552/ns/sports-baseball/| archivedate= July 30, 2010| deadurl= no[/tpl] He was introduced on August 2 and made his debut on August 3. Showalter chose to wear the number 26 in honor of his friend and former Orioles manager Johnny Oates.[tpl]cite web |title = Showalter pays tribute to friend and mentor | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Buck-Showalter-to-wear-Johnny-Oates-number-as-Orioles-manager| accessdate= August 5, 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100804202515/http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Buck-Showalter-to-wear-Johnny-Oates-number-as-Orioles-manager| archivedate= August 4, 2010| deadurl= no[/tpl] It was announced that Juan Samuel would not resume his role as third base coach and would instead take on a new role as a Dominican scout for the team.
With Showalter in the dugout the Orioles went 17–11 in August, their first winning month all season and first winning August since 2004. However, on August 29, the Orioles became the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention for the MLB 2010 season.[tpl]cite web|title=MLB Standings on August 29, 2010|url = http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?ymd=20100829| accessdate= August 31, 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908160604/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?ymd=20100829| archivedate= September 8, 2010| deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Orioles finished out the season by going 17–13 in the months of September and October, making the team 34–23 under Showalter.  This was the best record of any AL team over the same stretch of time. 2010 also marked the first time since 2004 that the Orioles improved on their previous season's win total. Their final record for the 2010 season was 66–96.
