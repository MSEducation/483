Jago was a British company making a range of kit cars principally Jeep styled between 1965 and 1997. It was based in Chichester, West Sussex.
Geoff Jago founded a company called Geoff Jago Custom Automotive in 1965 making Street Rod type vehicles. In 1971 he made the vehicle for which the company became most famous, the Geep.

An alternative version using Morris Minor parts was added in 1974 and a Ford Escort version in 1976. 
The company name was changed to Jago Automotive in 1979. 
The Ford Escort based Samuri, a four seat, beach buggy type vehicle costing Â£795 plus tax for the kit was announced in 1983. 
The Geep name changed to Sandero in 1991 to avoid any copyright issues.
The last Sandero kits were made around 1997 at Jago automotive.
The Sandero 4x4 kit is available from Belfield 4x4 Engineering.
This version is based around a Land Rover.
