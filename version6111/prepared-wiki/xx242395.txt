A Deeper Silence (2008) is an album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach.

==Concept==

A Deeper Silence was created to be unobtrusive and minimal, similar in nature to Structures from Silence and Darkest Before Dawn,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=TIM00019|title=Roach, Steve â€“ A Deeper Silence|publisher=Projekt|accessdate=3 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100103081256/http://projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=TIM00019| archivedate= 3 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and foregoes the more apparent layering, weaving of sound, and subtle shifts in structure that occur in the Immersion series.  The long-form piece, in its entirety, remains in the deeper tonal ranges, and is described by Steve Roach as "billowing...like a big sigh," "breathing," and "infinite in its essence."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.steveroach.com/store/store.php?item=400|title=A Deeper Silence description|publisher=SteveRoach.com|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]
