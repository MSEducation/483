 Protein:      [[methionine|Met]] [[Threonine|Thr]] [[Histidine|His]] Stop
The remaining codons of the mRNA are not translated into amino proteins because the stop codon is prematurely reached during translation. This can yield a truncated abbreviated protein product, which quite often lacks the functionality of the normal, non-mutant protein.

==Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay==

Despite an expected tendency for premature termination codons to yield shortened polypeptide products, in fact the formation of truncated proteins does not occur often in vivo. Many organisms—including humans and lower species, such as yeast—employ a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, which degrades mRNAs containing nonsense mutations before they are translated into nonfunctional polypeptides.
The three stop codons have been given names: UAG is amber, UGA is opal (sometimes also called umber), and UAA is ochre.  “Amber” was named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means “amber” in german.[tpl]cite journal |author=Edgar B |title=The genome of bacteriophage T4: an archeological dig |journal=Genetics |volume=168 |issue=2 |pages=575–82 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15514035 |pmc=1448817 |doi= |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Edgar+B+The+genome+of+bacteriophage+T4[/tpl]  The other two stop codons were named “ochre” and “opal” in order to keep the “color names” theme.  Stop codons are also called “termination”or “nonsense” codons.  They signal release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because there is no cognate tRNA that has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, and so a release factor binds to the ribosome instead.

==Pathology associated with nonsense mutations==

Nonsense mutations can cause a genetic disease by damaging a gene responsible for a specific protein, for example, dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The same disease may, however, be caused by other kinds of damage to the same gene. Examples of diseases in which nonsense mutations are known to be among the causes include:
An experimental drug known as PTC124 may be useful in treating some cases of each of the above diseases (that is, the cases caused by a nonsense mutation). PTC124 was scheduled to enter the final phase of clinical trials in 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1690544.ece |title=Daily pill to beat genetic diseases |accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=The Times | location=London | first=Mark | last=Henderson | date=23 April 2007[/tpl]
