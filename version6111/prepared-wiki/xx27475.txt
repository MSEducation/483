Bonnie Elizabeth Parker (October 1, 1910 – May 23, 1934) and Clyde Chestnut Barrow (March 24, 1909 – May 23, 1934) were American outlaws and robbers from the Dallas area who traveled the central United States with their gang during the Great Depression. At times, the gang included Buck Barrow, Blanche Barrow, Raymond Hamilton, W. D. Jones, Joe Palmer, Ralph Fults, and Henry Methvin. Their exploits captured the attention of the American public during the "public enemy era" between 1931 and 1934. Though known today for his dozen-or-so bank robberies, Barrow preferred to rob small stores or rural gas stations. The gang is believed to have killed at least nine police officers and several civilians. The couple were eventually ambushed and killed in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, by law officers. Their reputation was revived and cemented in American pop folklore by Arthur Penn's 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde,Toplin, Robert B. History by Hollywood: The Use and Abuse of the American Past (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois, 1996.) ISBN 0-252-06536-0. which starred Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty as the pair.
Even during their lifetimes, the couple's depiction in the press was at considerable odds with the hardscrabble reality of their life on the road—particularly in the case of Parker. Though she was present at a hundred or more felonies during her two years as Barrow's companion,Phillips, John Neal (2002). Running with Bonnie & Clyde: The Ten Fast Years of Ralph Fults. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. ISBN 0-8061-3429-1. she was not the machine gun-wielding killer portrayed in the newspapers, newsreels, and pulp detective magazines of the day. Gang member W.D. Jones later testified that he was unsure whether he had ever seen her fire at officers.Jones deposition, November 18, 1933. FBI file 26-4114, Section Sub A, pp. 59–62. FBI Records and Information.Jones, W.D. "Riding with Bonnie and Clyde", Playboy, November 1968. Reprinted at Cinetropic.com. Parker's reputation as a cigar-smoking gun moll grew out of a playful snapshot found by police at an abandoned hideout, released to the press, and published nationwide. While she did chain smoke Camel cigarettes, she was not a cigar smoker.Parker, Emma Krause; Nell Barrow Cowan and Jan I. Fortune (1968). The True Story of Bonnie and Clyde. New York: New American Library. ISBN 0-8488-2154-8. First published in September 1934 as Fugitives. Parker was Bonnie's mother, Cowan was Clyde's sister, and Fortune was a Dallas writer and reporter, who was chiefly responsible for the book. Parker and Cowan repudiated the book immediately upon its publication, but more for personal/family agenda reasons than for factual inaccuracies.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Page numbers in footnotes refer to the 1968 paperback edition.
Historian Jeff Guinn has said that the hideout photos led to the glamorization and creation of legend about the outlaws: 
 "John Dillinger had matinee-idol good looks and Pretty Boy Floyd had the best possible nickname, but the Joplin photos introduced new criminal superstars with the most titillating trademark of all—illicit sex. Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were wild and young, and undoubtedly slept together."[tpl]cite book |title= Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde |author1=Guinn, Jeff |date=March 9, 2010 |pages=174–176 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |pages=480 |asin=1416557075 |isbn=9781471105753 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uZv9yMrfMmYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Go+Down+Together:+The+True,+Untold+Story+of+Bonnie+and+Clyde&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bp6PUu-mJ6fdsATxpoH4DQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Go%20Down%20Together%3A%20The%20True%2C%20Untold%20Story%20of%20Bonnie%20and%20Clyde&f=false |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] 

==Beginnings==

===Bonnie Parker===

Bonnie Elizabeth Parker (October 1, 1910 – May 23, 1934) was born in Rowena, Texas, the second of three children. Her father Charles Parker, a bricklayer, died when Bonnie was four.Phillips, p xxxv; Guinn, p 45 Her mother Emma Krause moved with the children to her parents' home in Cement City, an industrial suburb of Dallas, where she found work as a seamstress.Guinn, p 46 Her maternal grandfather, Frank Krause, came from Germany.Bonnie Parker's Genealogy Parker was one of the best students in her high school, winning top prizes in spelling, writing, and public speaking.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa17 |title= Parker, Bonnie |author= Strickland, Kristi |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online - Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=December 1, 2012[/tpl]Parker, Cowan and Fortune, pp. 33, 47; Guinn, p. 48. As an adult, her fondness for writing found expression in poems such as "The Story of Suicide Sal"The Story of Suicide Sal. Cinetropic and "The Trail's End" (known since as "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde. Cinetropic).
In her second year of high school, Parker met Roy Thornton. They dropped out of school and were married on September 25, 1926, fourteen days before Parker's 16th birthday.Phillips, p xxxvi; Guinn, p 76 Their marriage, marked by his frequent absences and brushes with the law, was short-lived. After January 1929, their paths never crossed again. But they were never divorced, and Parker was wearing Thornton's wedding ring when she died.A few months after their breakup Roy went to prison for robbery, and Bonnie told her mother, "Well, I didn't get divorce before Roy was sent up, and it looks sort of dirty to file for one now." Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p. 56 Thornton was in prison in 1934 when he learned of her death. His reaction was, "I'm glad they went out like they did. It's much better than being caught."
In 1929, after the breakdown of her marriage, Parker lived with her mother and worked as a waitress in Dallas. One of her regular customers in the café was postal worker Ted Hinton, who would join the Dallas Sheriff's Department in 1932. As a posse member in 1934, he participated in her ambush.Guinn, p 79 In the diary she kept briefly early in 1929, Parker wrote of her loneliness, her impatience with life in provincial Dallas, and her love of talking pictures.Parker, Cowan and Fortune, pp 55–57

===Clyde Barrow===

Clyde Chestnut Barrow[tpl]cite web |url=http://texashideout.tripod.com/coroner.html |title=Clyde Barrow Death Certificate[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://texashideout.tripod.com/bc.htm |title=Bonnie and Clyde's Texas Hideout |accessdate=July 21, 2008[/tpl] (March 24, 1909 – May 23, 1934) was born into a poor farming family in Ellis County, Texas, near Telico, a town just southeast of Dallas.Barrow and Phillips, p. xxxv.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fba88 |title= Barrow, Clyde Chesnut |author= Long, Christopher |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online - Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=December 1, 2012[/tpl] He was the fifth of seven children of Henry Basil Barrow (1874–1957) and Cumie T. Walker (1874–1943). They migrated, piecemeal, to Dallas in the early 1920s as part of a wave of resettlement from the impoverished nearby farms to the urban slum known as West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon. When father Henry had earned enough money to buy a tent, it was a major step up for the family.Guinn provides a comprehensive description of West Dallas, p. 20.
Clyde was first arrested in late 1926, after running when police confronted him over a rental car he had failed to return on time. His second arrest, with brother Marvin "Buck" Barrow, came soon after, this time for possession of stolen goods (turkeys). Despite having legitimate jobs during the period 1927 through 1929, he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. After sequential arrests in 1928 and 1929, he was sent to Eastham Prison Farm in April 1930. While in prison, Barrow beat to death another inmate who had repeatedly assaulted him sexually.Guinn, p. 76. This was Clyde Barrow's first killing.
Paroled in February 1932, Barrow emerged from Eastham a hardened and bitter criminal. His sister Marie said, "Something awful sure must have happened to him in prison, because he wasn't the same person when he got out."Phillips, Running, p 324n9 A fellow inmate, Ralph Fults, said he watched him "change from a schoolboy to a rattlesnake."Phillips, Running, p. 53.
In his post-Eastham career, Barrow chose smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and gas stations, at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow Gang. His favored weapon was the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (called a BAR). According to John Neal Phillips, Barrow's goal in life was not to gain fame or fortune from robbing banks, but to seek revenge against the Texas prison system for the abuses he suffered while serving time.Phillips, John Neal. "Bonnie & Clyde's Revenge on Eastham", Historynet, originally published in American History, October 2000.

===First meeting===

Several accounts describe Bonnie and Clyde's first meeting, but the most credible version tells that Bonnie Parker met Clyde Barrow on January 5, 1930 at Clarence Clay's (a friend of Clyde) house at 105 Herbert Street. Parker was out of work and was staying in West Dallas to assist a female friend with a broken arm. Barrow dropped by the girl's house while Parker was in the kitchen making hot chocolate.Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p 80
When they met, both were smitten immediately; most historians believe Parker joined Barrow because she was in love. She remained a loyal companion to him as they carried out their crime spree and awaited the violent deaths they viewed as inevitable.Guinn, p. 81

==The Spree==

===1932: Early jobs, early murders===

After Barrow was released from prison in February 1932, he and Ralph Fults assembled a rotating core group of associates. They began a series of small robberies, primarily of stores and gas stations; their goal was to collect enough money and firepower to launch a raid of liberation against Eastham prison. On April 19, Bonnie Parker and Fults were captured in a failed hardware store burglary, where they intended to take guns, in Kaufman, Texas, and subsequently convicted and jailed.The items to be burgled were guns, not hardware. Guinn, pp 103–4 While Parker was released in a few months after the grand jury failed to indict her, Fults was prosecuted and tried; he served time and never rejoined the gang.
On April 30, Barrow was the driver in a robbery in Hillsboro, Texas, during which the store's owner, J.N. Bucher, was shot and killed.Ramsey, Winston G., ed. (2003). On The Trail of Bonnie and Clyde: Then and Now. London: After The Battle Books. ISBN 1-870067-51-7, p 53. This book includes a comprehensive time line, and tells about half of its narrative through contemporary newspaper stories. When shown mugshots, the victim's wife identified Barrow as one of the shooters, although he had stayed outside in the car.Mrs. Bucher picked out photos of Barrow and Hamilton, but their two colleagues, Ted Rogers and Johnny Russell, were the ones who had entered the store that night. Barrow was in the driver's seat of the car, and Hamilton was not in Texas at the time but in Michigan (Guinn, p. 146). Rogers killed Bucher. Mrs. Bucher had seen Barrow with the pair of men that afternoon when they had been in the store. She likely mistook Rogers for Hamilton because of a strong resemblance between the two. So Barrow was accused of his first murder as a robber without being near it. Hamilton was later tried, convicted and sentenced to 99 years for this death, which was added to his growing sentence; it finally totaled 266 years. Rogers said he would come forward and confess if Hamilton got a death sentence, but did not when his buddy just got "time." Hamilton was executed in 1935 not for murder, but from being convicted as a "habitual criminal," then a capital offense in Texas. Barrow and Phillips, pp. 208–9. It was the first time in the crime spree that Barrow was accused of murder.
Parker was held in jail until June 17, where she wrote poetry to pass the time.Guinn, p. 109. She composed these poems in an old bankbook the jailer's wife had given her to use as paper. Some were her own work, and some songs and poems she copied down from memory; Parker titled the lot "Poetry From Life's Other Side," and when she was released, either left it behind or gave it to the jailer. In 2007 the bankbook sold for $36,000. Item 5337 Bonhams 1793: Fine Art Auctioneers & Valuers One of the poems was "The Story of Suicide Sal," a neatly penned, 105-line prisoner's lament told "in the jargon of gangdom." Parker, Cowan and Fortune, pp. 82–5; Guinn, p. 109. A year later, in an apartment the gang had rented in Joplin, Missouri, Parker was tinkering with "Sal" when a shootout began downstairs. This draft became the best known of Bonnie Parker's poems after "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde." Guinn, pp. 168, 172. When the Kaufman County grand jury convened, it declined to indict her, and she was released.Guinn, p. 115. Within a few weeks, she reunited with Barrow.
On August 5, while Parker was visiting her mother in Dallas, Barrow, Raymond Hamilton and Ross DyerLater that night, Dyer used his frequent alias of Everett Milligan with officers. Knight and Davis, p 54 were drinking alcohol at a country dance in Stringtown, Oklahoma, when Sheriff C.G. Maxwell and his deputy, Eugene C. Moore, approached them in the parking lot. Barrow and Hamilton opened fire, killing the deputy and gravely wounding the sheriff.Guinn, p. 120[tpl]cite web |title=Deputy Sheriff Eugene C. Moore |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/9549-deputy-sheriff-eugene-c.-moore |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page |accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl] This was the first time Barrow and his gang killed a lawman; eventually, they reached a total of nine. On October 11, they allegedly killed Howard Hall at his store during a robbery in Sherman, Texas, though historians have considered this unlikely since 1997. Powell, Steven (2012). On 80th anniversary, Clyde Barrow no longer said to be Sherman murder.http://www.kxii.com/news/headlines/On-80th-anniversary-Clyde-Barrow-no-longer-said-to-be-Sherman-murder-173800241.html
W. D. Jones had been a friend of the Barrow family since childhood. Only 16 years old on Christmas Eve 1932, he persuaded Barrow to let him join the pair and leave Dallas with them that night.Guinn, p. 147 The next day, Jones was initiated when he and Barrow killed Doyle Johnson, a young family man, while stealing his car in Temple, Texas.Ramsey, pp 80–85 Less than two weeks later, on January 6, 1933, Barrow killed Tarrant County Deputy Sheriff Malcolm Davis when he, Parker and Jones wandered into a police trap set for another criminal.[tpl]cite web |title=Deputy Malcolm Davis |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3880-deputy-malcolm-davis |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page |accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl] The total murdered by the gang since April was five.

===1933: Buck joins the gang===

On March 22, 1933, Buck Barrow was granted a full pardon and released from prison. Within days, he and his wife Blanche had set up housekeeping with Clyde, Parker and Jones in a temporary hideout at 3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive in Joplin, Missouri. According to family sources,Barrow and Phillips, pp 31–33. Blanche's book tells of the gang's two-week "vacation" in Joplin. Buck and Blanche were there to visit; they tried to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement.
Bonnie and Clyde's next brush with the law arose from their generally suspicious—and conspicuous—behavior, not because they had been identified. The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood. "We bought a case of beer a day," Blanche would later recall.Barrow and Phillips, p 45 The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde discharged a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) in the apartment while cleaning it.Barrow and Phillips, p.243 n30. No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.
The lawmen assembled a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers living in the garage apartment. Though taken by surprise, Clyde was noted for remaining cool under fire. He, Jones, and Buck quickly killed Detective McGinnis and fatally wounded Constable Harryman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/8972-detective-harry-l.-mcginnis |title=Detective Harry L. McGinnis |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page |accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Constable J.W. Harryman |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/6155-constable-j.-w.-Dallasharryman |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page |accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl] During the escape from the apartment, Parker laid down covering fire with her own BAR, forcing Highway Patrol sergeant G. B. Kahler to duck behind a large oak tree while .30 caliber bullets struck the other side, forcing wood splinters into the sergeant's face.Ballou, James L., Rock in a Hard Place: The Browning Automatic Rifle, Collector Grade Publications (2000), p. 78. Parker got into the car with the others. They slowed enough to pull in Blanche Barrow from the street, where she was pursuing her dog Snow Ball.Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p. 114. The surviving officers later testified that their side had fired only fourteen rounds in the conflict,Ramsey, pp. 102. The contemporary photos and drawings of the hideout are particularly valuable. but one hit Jones in the side, one struck Clyde and was deflected by his suitcoat button, and one grazed Buck after ricocheting off a wall.
The group escaped the police at Joplin, but left behind most of their possessions at the apartment: items included Buck and Blanche's marriage license, Buck's parole papers (three weeks old), a large arsenal of weapons, a handwritten poem by Bonnie, and a camera with several rolls of undeveloped film.Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p 115 The film was developed at The Joplin Globe and yielded many now-famous photos of Barrow, Parker and Jones clowning and pointing weapons at one another.Ramsey p 108–113. He said that he published all the frames from the Joplin rolls in proper sequence, but missed at least ten: one is a shot of W. D. Jones sitting at the wheel of the Rosborough car with "Bonnie's" cigar clenched in his teeth like FDR (Barrow and Phillips, p 60); another has Jones lounging atop the clay bank behind the car(Barrow and Phillips, p 107); another is a second shot of Clyde alone up on the rocks, but with his hat off (Knight and Davis, p 72). Three frames not yet published in books are available to view at the Bonnie and Clyde-oriented website Boodles Board http://www.tmethvin.com/temp/b&c-rocks2.pdf: in two, W.D. is perched high on the rocks, and in a third, Clyde and W.D. play movie outlaws behind some large boulders, pointing their pistols. At the same website is a facsimile of a 1935 Startling Detective Adventures magazine, including a rare shot of Clyde squatting in front of the car by the clay bank. The final three of the missed ten are in the Ramsey book, but not included in the Joplin gallery: one is a "profile" of the Rosborough car alone (Ramsey, p 98); a second is Clyde standing by himself near the rocks with his hat in his hand (Ramsey, p 41); and finally a shot of Jones, with the weedy clay bank as background (Ramsey, p 80). The film was the then-popular size 116, discontinued in 1984; the Kodak No. 2A Folding Autographic Brownie camera, on loan from Blanche (Barrow and Phillips, p 227n10) produced eight shots per roll. The negatives known today are copy negs made in 1963. (Ramsey, p 107) When the poem and the photos, including one of Parker clenching a cigar in her teeth and a pistol in her hand, went out on the newly installed newswire, the obscure five criminals from Dallas became front-page news across America as the Barrow Gang. The poem "Story of 'Suicide Sal'" was an apparent backstory.
For the next three months, the group ranged from Texas as far north as Minnesota. In May, they tried to rob the bank in Lucerne, Indiana[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] and robbed the bank in Okabena, Minnesota.Ramsey, p 118 and p 122 Previously they had kidnapped Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone at Ruston, Louisiana, in the course of stealing Darby's car; this was one of several incidents between 1932 and 1934 in which they kidnapped lawmen or robbery victims.Clyde and Bonnie kidnapped seven persons during their crime career: Deputy Joe Johns on August 14, 1932; Officer Thomas Persell on January 26, 1933; civilians Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone on April 27, 1933; Sheriff George Corry and Chief Paul Hardy on June 10, 1933; and Chief Percy Boyd on April 6, 1934. All except Persell were taken across state lines. In addition, they also executed two "mini-kidnappings": on July 18, 1933, they kidnapped filling station attendants Harold Anderson and Harry Stark of Fort Dodge, Iowa, during the course of two sequential service station stick-ups. Upon stopping at a third station and robbing it, the gang realized they had no more room in the car for hostages, so they let Anderson and Stark go (Knight and Davis, p. 100). They usually released their hostages far from home, sometimes with money to help them return home.Anderson, Brian. "Reality less romantic than outlaw legend". The Dallas Morning News. April 18, 2003.
Stories of such encounters made headlines, as did the more violent episodes. The Barrow Gang did not hesitate to shoot anyone, lawman or civilian, who got in their way. Other members of the Barrow Gang known or thought to have committed murders included Raymond Hamilton, W.D. Jones, Buck Barrow and Henry Methvin. Eventually, the cold-bloodedness of their killings soured the public perception of the outlaws, and led to their ends.Guinn, pp 286–288
The photos entertained the public, but the gang was desperate and discontented, as described by Blanche Barrow in her account written while imprisoned in the late 1930s.Barrow and Phillips, pp 56. Blanche wrote that she felt, driving away from Joplin, that "all my hopes and dreams were tumbling down around me". With their new notoriety, their daily lives became more difficult, as they tried to evade discovery. Restaurants and motels became less secure; they resorted to campfire cooking and bathing in cold streams.Parker, Cowan and Fortune, pp 116–117 The unrelieved, round-the-clock proximity among two couples, plus a fifth-wheel, in one car gave rise to vicious bickering.Jones' Playboy interview, Barrow and Phillips, pp 65Barrow's sister Marie described her brother Buck as "the meanest, most hot-tempered" of all her siblings. Phillips, p 343n20 So unpleasant did it become that W.D. Jones, who was the driver when he and Barrow stole Dillard Darby's car in late April, used that car to leave the others. He stayed away throughout May and up until June 8.Treherne, p 123; Blanche describes the cramped conditions in her book, pp 70–71.
On June 10, while driving with Jones and Parker near Wellington, Texas, Barrow missed warning signs at a bridge under construction and flipped their car into a ravine.Red River Plunge of Bonnie and Clyde: Collingsworth Pioneers Park, US 83 north side of Salt Fork of the Red River: Texas marker #4218 – Texas Historical Commission Sources disagree on whether there was a gasoline fireJames R. Knight, "Incident at Alma: The Barrow Gang in Northwest Arkansas", The Arkansas Historical Quarterly, Vol. 56, No. 4 (Arkansas Historical Association Winter, 1997) 401. [tpl]JSTOR|40027888[/tpl]. or if Parker was doused with acid from the car's battery under the floorboards.Guinn, pp 191–194. Six witnesses at a farmhouse described battery acid as the culprit; the open-fire story started with the Parker-Cowan-Fortune book; it was repeated in Jones' Playboy interview. Parker sustained serious third-degree burns to her right leg so severe the muscles contracted and caused the leg to "draw up".Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p 132
Near the end of her life, Parker could hardly walk; she either hopped on her good leg or was carried by Clyde. After getting help from a nearby farm family and kidnapping two local lawmen,Clyde made a serious tactical error when he asked hostages Corry and Hardy if they had ever heard of the Barrow brothers, giving away their identity, and telling them that Parker was seriously wounded. After he released the officers, they told law enforcement world to be on the lookout for people buying burn medication and supplies. Guinn, p 194 the three outlaws rendezvoused with Blanche and Buck Barrow. They hid in a tourist court near Fort Smith, Arkansas, nursing Parker's burns. Buck and Jones bungled a local robbery and killed Town Marshal Henry D. Humphrey in Alma, Arkansas.[tpl]cite web |title=Town Marshal Henry D.
