It should be avoided the confusion between the Vatican City State, which refers to the country founded in 1929, and the Holy See, who in practice is the Pope and all who work for the Pope in the government of the Church. Economically, these two entities are independent, even though most of the Holy See operates within the territory of the Vatican City State. For example, the IOR - Institute for the Works of Religion, commonly known as "The Vatican Bank" - belongs to the Holy See and contributes to the Holy See with its profits, even though it is operating within the Vatican City State.
