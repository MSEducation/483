==History==

Following the release of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Joseph Bruce admitted that he was considering not completing the production of Hell's Pit. He is quoted as describing Shangri-La as "the end of the road. It's the end of the Joker's Cards. After this I could do anything I want, for the rest of my life. The positivity was so unbelievable."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457924/20021003/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Find Light (And Hotties, Homies, Faygo) At End Of Tunnel |accessdate=2008-05-05 |last=D'Angelo |first=Joe |date=October 4, 2002 |publisher=MTV[/tpl]

===Production===

Preceding the release of Hell's Pit, Bruce stated the album's sound was intended as a throwback to the minimalistic sound of Carnival of Carnage, particularly its darker second half.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_wf_20040426 |title=Weekly Freekly: Number 669 |accessdate=2008-08-17 |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |date=June 25, 2004 |publisher=Psychopathic Records |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820062709/http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_wf_20040426  |archivedate=2004-04-26 [/tpl] Bruce also stated that it would contain less rock elements and singing, and that it would not feature guest appearances. "Bowling Balls" samples the drum beat of Madonna's "Justify My Love," which was based upon Public Enemy's instrumental "Security of the First World",[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r705775|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Review of Hell's Pit |accessdate=2008-06-30 |last=Jeffries |first=David |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.citypages.com/2006-03-08/news/she-bop/6 |title=She Bop |accessdate=2008-06-30 |last=Thomas |first=Lindsey |coauthors= |date=March 8, 2006 |work= |publisher=City Pages[/tpl] which was in turn based on the end drum break of James Brown's "Funky Drummer".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315180,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Jeffrey | last=Ressner | title=Justify My Claim | date=1991-08-16[/tpl]
