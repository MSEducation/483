==Synopsis==

A young woman leads a timid and innocent young man in an initiation and exploration of Paris by night.

==Analysis==

The film is an odd mixture, with Rohmerian cast and dialogues, mixed with a complacent night tour of the red-light districts of Paris, bordering on sexploitation.
La Nuit porte-jarretelles got a César Award nomination (Best First Work) in 1986.
