Butterfly Conservation is an insect conservation organisation in the United Kingdom. It is one of the largest insect conservation organisations in the world.

==History of the organisation==

The organisation was originally formed in 1968 as the "British Butterfly Conservation Society," by a small group of naturalists, headed by Sir Peter Scott. It was registered as a charity on 7 March 1968. 

==Function of the society==

The aim of the new society is to stop the alarming decline of many butterfly and moth species in Britain, and at the same time help safeguard the environment itself. Butterfly Conservation has become the largest insect conservation organisation in Europe and publishes Butterfly magazine.
