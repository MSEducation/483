[[Bomber destroyer]]

CATEGORIES: Fighter aircraft

Historically, several aircraft were designated bomber destroyers prior and during the Second World War. They were interceptor aircraft dedicated to destroy enemy bomber aircraft with exceptionally powerful armament.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011|reason=At a minimum, a strict definition is needed: what was regarded a "bomber destroyer", and what was not. Otherwise this article will become cluttered with off-topic info.[/tpl] They were a generally intended for day use, so were a separate category from the existing night fighters.
The United States considered powerfully armed destroyers, like the Bell YFM-1 Airacuda prototype, to counter a potential attack of high-performance bombers. The Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Bell P-39 Airacobra were also design with the aim of mounting very heavy armament, including 37 mm guns, in the anti-bomber role.
A deceptively similar, although completely different, designation was the German Zerstörer (meaning "destroyer"). Introduced on 1 May 1939,[tpl]cite book| last = Weal| first = John| title = Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerstörer aces of World War 2| url = http://books.google.com/?id=PKa9EH5sb9gC&pg=PA85| year = 1999| publisher = Osprey Aviation| location = Oxford| isbn = 1-85532-753-8| pages = 6–7 [/tpl] the term did specifically exclude the defensive anti-bomber role (leaving it for the light fighters), and envisaged a heavy fighter for offensive missions: escorting the bombers, long-range fighter suppression, and ground attack.
Since then, improvements in both engine power and armament generally led to a loss of interest in this class for most nations. Even small fighters were able to carry enough firepower to effectively deal with enemy bombers. This remains true even today.
