She was called to the Northern Irish Bar in 1974, and remains a member of the Irish Bar. She opposes abortion and divorce.
In 1976, she married Martin McAleese, an accountant and dentist by profession.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0613/mcaleesem.html|title=Honorary degree for Martin McAleese|date=13 June 2007|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=RTÉ News[/tpl] He has assisted his wife with some of her initiatives as president.[tpl]cite news|author=Brian McDonald|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/heartbroken-town-salutes-as-robbie-gets-transfer-home-1707375.html|title=Heartbroken town salutes as Robbie 'gets transfer home'|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=Irish Independent[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Vincent Kearney|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8419471.stm|title=Martin McAleese fails in plan to deliver UDA guns|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Alan Murray|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/mcaleese-puts-uvf-guns-out-of-commission-1782342.html|title=McAleese puts UVF guns out of commission|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=Irish Independent[/tpl] They have three children.

==Early career==

In 1975, she was appointed Reid Professor of Criminal law, Criminology and Penology in Trinity College,[tpl]cite news|author=Katherine Donnelly|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/top-scholar-emma--proves-shes-a-chip-off-the-old-block-1735787.html|title=Top scholar Emma proves she's a chip off the old block|date=12 May 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009|work=Irish Independent[/tpl] succeeding Mary Robinson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1680695.stm |title=Europe | Mary Robinson: Human rights champion |work=BBC News |date=18 March 2002 |accessdate=28 August 2010|first=Mark |last=Snelling[/tpl]
During the same decade she was legal advisor to and a founding member of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform. She left this position in 1979 to join RTÉ as a journalist and presenter during one period as a reporter and presenter for their Today Tonight programme. However, in RTÉ she and Alex White (then TV producer and now Labour Party TD) were attacked and criticised by a group led by Eoghan Harris associated with the Workers' Party over what they perceived as her bias towards Republican groups in the North. McAleese was critical of the Provisional IRA but believed it was important to hear their side of the story; she opposed the Harris faction's support for Section 31 which she believed was an attack on free speech.[tpl]cite book|last1=Hanley|first1=Brian|last2=Millar|first2=Scott|title=The lost revolution: the story of the official IRA and the workers' party|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6814880.ece|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=26 March 2009|publisher=Penguin Ireland|isbn=978-1-84488-120-8[/tpl] In 1981, she returned to the Reid Professorship, but continued to work part-time for RTÉ for a further four years.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] In 1987, she returned to Queen's University to become Director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the Dublin South–East constituency at the 1987 general election, receiving 2,243 votes (5.9%).
McAleese was a member of the Catholic Church Episcopal Delegation to the New Ireland Forum in 1984, and a member of the Catholic Church delegation to the Northern Ireland Commission on Contentious Parades in 1996. She was also a delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland and to the subsequent Pittsburgh Conference in 1996. She became the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast. Prior to becoming president in 1997, McAleese had also held the following positions: Director of Channel 4 Television, Director, Northern Ireland Electricity, Director, Royal Group of Hospitals Trust and Founding member of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.

==Presidency==

McAleese is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilise the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cwwl.org/members.html|title=Council Members|accessdate=12 December 2009|publisher=Council of Women World Leaders[/tpl]

===First term (1997–2004)===

In 1997, McAleese defeated former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds in an internal party election held to determine the Fianna Fáil nomination for the Irish presidency.
Her opponents in the 1997 presidential election were Mary Banotti of Fine Gael, Adi Roche (the Labour Party candidate) and two independents: Dana Rosemary Scallon and Derek Nally.
McAleese won the Presidency with 45.2% of first preference votes. In the second and final count against Banotti, she won 58.7% of preferences. On 11 November 1997, she was inaugurated as the eighth President of Ireland. Within weeks of this she made her first official overseas trip to Lebanon."President revisits Lebanon on her final foreign trip in office", The Irish Times, 15 October 2011.
McAleese described the theme of her presidency as "building bridges". The first individual born in Northern Ireland to become President of Ireland, President McAleese was a regular visitor to Northern Ireland throughout her presidency, where she was on the whole warmly welcomed by both communities, confounding critics who had believed she would be a divisive figure. People from Northern Ireland, indeed people from right across the nine-county Province of Ulster, were regular and recurring visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin while she was there. She is also an admirer of Queen Elizabeth II, whom she came to know when she was Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Queen's. In March 1998, President McAleese announced that she would officially celebrate the Twelfth of July as well as Saint Patrick's Day, recognising the day's importance among Ulster Protestants.
She also incurred some criticism from some of the Irish Catholic hierarchy by taking communion in an Anglican (Church of Ireland) Cathedral in Dublin on 7 December 1997, although 78 percent of Irish people approved of her action in a following opinion poll. While Cardinal Desmond Connell called her action a "sham" and a "deception", Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said it was ironic that "the Church was condemning an act of reconciliation and bridge-building between the denominations."Communion with non-Catholic Christians: risks, challenges, and opportunities by Jeffrey Thomas VanderWilt, pp. 51–3. Collegeville, Minnesota, 2003.
In 1998, she met the Archbishop of Boston Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, on an official visit to the US. In an interview in 2012 she said that Law told her he was "sorry for Catholic Ireland to have you as President" and went on to insult a junior minister who was accompanying the then president. "His remarks were utterly inappropriate and unwelcome," she said. McAleese told the cardinal that she was the "President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland". At this point, a heated argument ensued between the two, according to McAleese.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mcaleese-reveals-attack-by-disgraced-cardinal-3251159.html | work=Irish Independent | title=McAleese reveals 'attack' by disgraced cardinal[/tpl]

===Second term (2004–2011)===

McAleese's initial seven-year term of office ended in November 2004, but she had announced on 14 September that she would stand for a second term in the 2004 presidential election. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] and was declared elected on 1 October. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second seven-year term on 11 November. McAleese's very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in an election that would prove difficult to win.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2004/0207/breaking4.html|title=President would defeat Higgins, poll shows|work=The Irish Times|date=7 February 2004|accessdate=28 December 2004[/tpl]
On 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp, she created friction by referring to the way some Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been raised to hate Catholics, just as European children "for generations, for centuries" were encouraged to hate Jews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=5&speech=43&lang=eng|title=Interview with President McAleese, Morning Ireland|work=www.president.ie|date=27 January 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4214263.stm|work=BBC News|title=McAleese row over Nazi comments|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=18 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/?c=IRELAND&jp=kfidgbgbqlmh&d=2005-01-27|title=McAleese: Protestant children taught to hate Catholics|work=BreakingNews.ie|date=27 January 2005|accessdate=1 September 2007[/tpl] These remarks provoked outrage among unionist politicians.

She was the Commencement Speaker at Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania, on 22 May 2005. The visit prompted protests by conservatives because of the President's professing heterodox Roman Catholic views on homosexuality and women in priesthood. She was the commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on 21 May 2006. In her commencement address, among other topics, she spoke of her pride at Notre Dame's Irish heritage, including the nickname the "Fighting Irish".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

The president turned down an invitation to be Grand Marshal at the 250th St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York City planned for 2011. The parade organisers refuse to allow gay people to march under their banner, and there was media speculation that this was the reason for the refusal. A spokesperson for the President's office stated that, while honoured by the invitation, she could not attend because of "scheduling constraints".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mcaleese-turns-down-role-in-ny-st-patricks-parade-2349478.html|title=McAleese turns down role in NY St Patrick's parade|last=Black|first=Fergus|date=23 September 2010|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=23 September 2010[/tpl]

In a radio interview discussing her book Quo Vadis? Collegiality in the Code of Canon Law on 28 September 2012, said she was concerned at the growing number of young men, and in particular young gay men, who take their own lives in Ireland. She said that when the research is broken down, it shows that young gay men are one of the most risk-prone groups in Ireland. McAleese said many of these young men will have gone to Catholic schools and they will have heard there their church's attitude to homosexuality. "They will have heard words like disorder, they may even have heard the word evil used in relation to homosexual practice," she said. She went on to say "And when they make the discovery, and it is a discovery and not a decision, when they make the discovery, that they are gay, when they are 14, 15 or 16, an internal conflict of absolutely appalling proportions opens up". She said many young gay men are driven into a place that is "dark and bleak". McAleese said she met the Apsotolic Nuncio, Archbishop Charles John Brown, shortly after Easter to raise with him her concern about the growing number of suicides among young men in Ireland.McAleese critical of Catholic Church's 'isolated' view on homosexuality
