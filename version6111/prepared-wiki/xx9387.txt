==History==

Odense (from Odins  Vé, meaning "Odin's shrine", referring  to the god Odin  of Denmark's indigenous Norse mythology),  is one of the oldest cities of Denmark and had its 1000th anniversary  in 1988. To celebrate this, a forest named "the Thousand Year Forest"  (Danish: Tusindårsskoven) was cultivated. The shrine of Saint Canute ([tpl]lang-da|Sankt Knud /  Knud den Hellige[/tpl]) in Saint Canute's Cathedral  held great attraction for pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages.
In the 16th century, the town was the meeting-place of several  parliaments, and down to 1805 it was the seat of the provincial  assembly of Funen.
Odense's most famous landmark was Odinstårnet (The Odin Tower) constructed in 1935, as the second-tallest tower in Europe, only surpassed by the Eiffel Tower with its 177 meters.  Odinstårnet was blown up by a Danish Nazi group  in 1944 and has never been rebuilt. However, a miniature model of it now  stands in the residential area Odinsparken in the area where the original  tower was.
Until the beginning of the Danish industrial revolution, Odense was also the second-largest city in modern Denmark, but has in recent times been  overtaken by Aarhus.

==Tourist  attractions==

Saint Canute's Cathedral ([tpl]lang-da|Sankt Knuds  Kirke[/tpl]) was formerly connected with the  great Benedictine  monastery of the same name, and is one of the largest and finest  buildings of its kind in Denmark. It is constructed of brick in a pure  Gothic style. Originally dating from 1081–1093, it was rebuilt in the 13th century. Under  the altar lies Canute  (Danish: Knud), the patron saint of Denmark, who  had planned to conquer England, then ruled by William of Normandy. Canute was slain in an insurrection at Odense in 1086. Odense is also the see of the bishop of Funen. The cathedral has the skeletons of both the Saint/King and his brother on public display. A large fragment of Byzantine cloth is displayed next to the two skeletons. The cathedral also boasts one of Denmark's finest altarpieces, a magnificent triptych by Claus Berg. Kings John ([tpl]lang-da|Hans[/tpl]) and Christian II are buried in the city.
Our Lady's Church, built in the 13th century and restored in 1851–1852 and again in 1864,  contains a carved 16th-century altarpiece by Claus Berg of Lübeck.
Odense Palace  was erected by King Frederick IV, who died there in 1730.
There is a theatre as well as a symphony orchestra, a zoo, and the Funen Village (Den Fynske Landsby)  which is an open-air museum with old houses typical of Funen.
The City Hall has a small scar from a battle between Germans and members of the Danish Resistance on 5 May 1945. The city's coat of arms – located above  the main entrance to City Hall – is damaged. On closer inspection, it can be seen that the kneecap of Saint Canute was penetrated by a bullet.

The city lies close to Odense Fjord on the Odense River (Odense Å). A 7.5 metre (25 ft) deep canal, dug from 1796 to 1806,[tpl]cite book|last=Thestrup|first=Poul|coauthors=Dorrit Andersen, Niels Oxenvad|title=Odense  bys historie. Mod bedre tider. Odense 1789–1868|publisher=Odense Universitetsforlag|pages=193–200|accessdate=2  February 2010|language=Danish[/tpl] gives access to the town's harbour from the fjord.
By road, Odense connects to Zealand and Jutland by way of the Funish  Motorway (Fynske  Motorvej), a section of the E20, and to Svendborg on the southern part of Funen by way of the Svendborg Motorway (Svendborgmotorvejen), which comprises the Danish route 9. Other, smaller routes connect Odense to the rest of Funen, with direct links to all coastal towns.
Odense's main railway station Odense station lies on the line between Copenhagen and Jutland, the peninsular mainland. International trains connect the town with Sweden and mainland Europe, i.e. Stockholm. SJ has a direct X2000 train to Stockholm daily, taking 7 hours to the capital city of Sweden. Local and regional trains link Odense to the rest of Denmark. A separate passenger railway (Svendborgbanen) operates between Odense and Svendborg. Formerly, railways connected Odense to most of Funen's coastal cities, but these links were closed down in the 1950s and 1960s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.danskejernbaner.dk/|title=danskejernbaner.dk  – Oversigt  over danske jernbaner, stationer og deres historie|last=Danske  Jernbaner|year=2008|language=Danish|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] Today, these regional routes are served by buses operated by the public company FynBus, which also operates the town's municipal bus service, connecting the town's suburbs to the city centre.
