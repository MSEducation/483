The new project was designed to be a creative outlet for Pete Trewavas (who has traditionally recorded in a "band" or "group" format on bass and acoustic guitar), in which he could also play lead guitar, lead vocals, drum programming and keyboards as well as have full creative control over the writing and producing of the record with.
