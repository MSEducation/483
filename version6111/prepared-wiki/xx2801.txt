The Armed Forces enjoy considerable power, prestige and independence within the Egyptian state.[tpl]cite news|last=Cambanis|first=Thanassis|title=Succession Gives Army a Stiff Test in Egypt|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html?_r=1&ref=global-home&pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 September 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 September 2010[/tpl] 
During almost the entire history of the Republic of Egypt, active or retired military officers have been head of the Egyptian state. The one democratically-elected civilian who served as president was removed by a military coup after only one year (July 2012-July 2013).
Starting with the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which created the Republic of Egypt, and was organized by the Free Officers Movement,  presidents of Egypt (Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak) were ex-military officers for almost 60 years.  This was interrupted with the 2011 revolution, when one of those presidents (Mubarak) stepped down, and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ruled until an elected president -- Muhammad Morsi—took office. On 3 July 2013, General Al-Sisiannounced Morsi removal in 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, although the interim president he named was a civilian—the Chief Justice of Supreme Constitutional Court Adly Mansour.
Even the new constitution drafted and passed under Morsi included protections for the military from legal and parliamentary oversight,[tpl]cite news|last=KIRKPATRICK|first=DAVID D.|title=Egypt Opposition Gears Up After Constitution Passes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/world/middleeast/as-egypt-constitution-passes-new-fights-lie-ahead.html|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 23, 2012|author2=MAYY EL SHEIKH|quote=the constitution’s principal defects were not about religion. The biggest problem, he said, is that it protects the Egyptian military from legal and parliamentary oversight, engraving its autonomy in the constitution. Leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood had said privately for months that they were willing to provide the military such constitutional protections in order to ease the transition of power from the generals who assumed control from Mr. Mubarak.[/tpl] and deferred to "objections from the country’s military leadership" by removing a "clear prohibition on trials of civilians before military courts" some drafters had tried to include.[tpl]cite web|title=Egypt: New Constitution Mixed on Support of Rights|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/11/29/egypt-new-constitution-mixed-support-rights|work=November 30, 2012|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 September 2013|quote=But the latest draft, unlike the earlier version, defers to objections from the country’s military leadership and removes the clear prohibition on trials of civilians before military courts.[/tpl]
