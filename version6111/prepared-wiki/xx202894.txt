Jen Stark (born 1983 in Miami, Florida) is a contemporary artist whose majority of work involves creating paper sculptures. She also works with drawing and animation. Her work draws inspiration from microscopic patterns in nature, wormholes, and sliced anatomy.Wired , Jen Stark's Paper Sculptures Explore Fractals, Wormholes, and Dead Bodies, May, 2008.  She studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), graduating Magna Cum Laude with a BFA majoring in Fibers with a minor in Animation.Official website , Jen Stark, May, 2008. 
Stark’s ideas are based on replication and infinity, echoing patterns and intelligent designs found in nature. Since expanding her medium from paper to include wood and even mirrors, Jen Stark's oeuvre of optically and methodologically baffling sculptures and drawings has enjoyed a renaissance of context. Her signature creations combine a variety of materials that have acted as a catalyst for more established spiritual proclivity as expressed through hypnotic mandala-like configurations. Jen Stark has exhibited her works in various galleries around the U.S. as well as the Girls' Club Collection, FL, the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale, FL and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Miami. She was a recipient of the prestigious South Florida Cultural Consortium's Visual and Media Artists Fellowship in 2008. Stark lives and works in Miami, Fl.
