Daejeon ([tpl]IPA-ko|tɛdʑʌn|lang|Ko-Daejeon.ogg[/tpl]) is South Korea's fifth largest metropolis. Daejeon had a population of over 1.5 million in 2010. 
Located in the center of South Korea, Daejeon serves as a hub of transportation and is at the crossroads of major transport routes. The capital Seoul is about 50 minutes away by high speed train.
Daejeon serves as an administration hub with the National Government Complex. The Korean administration in the 1980s decided to relocate some of its functions from Seoul, the national capital, to other cities. Currently, 12 national government offices including Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, the National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office as well as Patent Court of Korea are located in Daejeon. Korail (Korea Railroad Corporation), K-water (Korea Water Resources Corporation) and KOMSCO (Korea Minting & Security Printing Corporation) are also headquartered in the city.
Daejeon has 18 universities including KAIST, Chungnam National University, Hanbat National University, Hannam University and UST (Korea University of Science and Technology). Daejeon has earned its name as "Asia's Silicon Valley" and "High technology city". 
The city hosted the Taejon Expo '93 and the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) in 2000. Several important research institutes are based in the city.[tpl]cite journal|author=Song-Du-Bum|title=Scientific-industrial and nucleus administrative city, Daejeon|journal=GukTo(country)|date=(n. d.)| date=July 2000 |series=7|issue=225|page=70|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/998530?Seq=4&Collection=0&q=%5B%EB%8C%80%EC%A0%84%20%EA%B3%BC%ED%95%99%C2%A7coldb%C2%A72%C2%A751%C2%A73%5D&Sort=1&SortType=desc&Page=1&PageSize=20&Multimedia=0[/tpl]
Daedeok Innopolis (Daedeok Research and Development Special Zone) is composed of 28 state-run research centers as well as 79 private research institutes with as many as 20,000 researchers. In addition, Daejeon established the WTA (World Technopolis Association) in 1998 with the view of realizing regional development through international cooperation with world science cities. Currently the WTA has grown to have 67 members from 32 countries, and it actively cooperates with many international organizations including UNESCO as its official consultative body.

==History==

The Daejeon area was historically known as Hanbat (한밭),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daejeon.go.kr/daejeon/general/time_history/time_history1/index.html |title=선사시대의대전 |publisher=Daejeon.go.kr |accessdate=2014-03-22 |trans_title=Prehistoric War |language=Korean[/tpl] a native Korean term for "large field", during the Joseon Dynasty. The term "Daejeon" simply means the same thing in Hanja.
Historically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents.[tpl]Nonspecific|date=July 2007[/tpl] However in 1905, the Gyeongbu railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. Soon after in 1926 under rule of the Japanese government, the Honam railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub.[tpl]Verify source|date=July 2007[/tpl] Because of its geographical location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.
In 1932 the capital of Chungnam province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War the city was the site of an early major battle of the war, the Battle of Taejon.
Since then numerous changes have been made to the city boundaries, and its official names have evolved along as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi) and thus became a separate administrative region from Chungcheongnam-do. In 1995, all South Korean Directly Governed Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City ("대전광역시").
In 1997 the Daejeon Government Complex was constructed as part of an effort to move some government offices away from the densely populated capital, Seoul.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]  The population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result.
Today Daejeon's population growth is the second highest in the country (after Seoul), resulting in a large number of new apartment complex projects and high-tech industries in Yuseong-gu.[tpl]Dubious|Population growth|date=March 2008[/tpl]

==Geography==

Daejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'50" to N36°29'47" and longitudes E127°14'54" to E127°33'21" near the middle of South Korea.  It is [tpl]convert|167.3|km|mi|1|abbr=off[/tpl] from Seoul, [tpl]convert|294|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Busan and [tpl]convert|169|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Gwangju.  Sejong City, which is planned to be the new administrative capital of South Korea, will also be close by.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]  The city lies inside a great circus and is surrounded by several mountains, and Gyeryongsan National Park straddles the city border to the west. The city is divided into five boroughs: Seogu (서구), Donggu (동구), Yuseonggu (유성구), Daedeokgu (대덕구), Junggu (중구). Three streams flow through the city from south to north, eventually joining with Geum River: Gapcheon (갑천), Yudeungcheon (유등천), and Daejeoncheon (대전천).

Monthly mean temperatures range from [tpl]convert|−1.0|°C|1[/tpl] in January to [tpl]convert|25.6|°C|1[/tpl] in August.

==Administrative divisions==

==Central business district==

The middle of the city or the new central business district called Dunsan is where the effort has manifested itself. Newer apartment complexes, albeit structurally similar to that of the rest of the city, sprung up around the new government structures being constructed concurrently in just a few years starting from the mid-1990s. Newer municipal buildings including the city's courts and the province's main parliamentary building soon followed. The result is a several square mile neighbourhood full of restaurants, standard Korean western-type bars and coffee shops. The Dunsan-area is a place for the workers of the new Daejeon to live close to their offices, most able to walk to work, and dine and shop in a new urban environment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
