Bradley Edward Delp (June 12, 1951 – March 9, 2007) was an American musician, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock bands Boston and RTZ.

==Early life==

Delp was born in Peabody, Massachusetts on June 12, 1951 to French-Canadian immigrants.Pareles, Jon (March 10, 2007). Brad Delp, 55, Lead Singer for Boston, Dies. The New York Times While his father played the fiddle at home, Delp was inspired after seeing the Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. He began learning to play the guitar and claimed to have locked himself in his bedroom for several days in order to learn all the guitar and vocal parts. He saw the Beatles perform live at Suffolk Downs in East Boston on August 18, 1966. In 1968, Delp also discovered the music of a local group from Worcester called Orpheus and became a lifelong fan, calling them his "favorite band – second only to The Beatles". In 1970, Brad Delp was making heating elements for Mr. Coffee machines at Danvers company HotWatt when he met Boston founder Tom Scholz, Barry Goudreau and Jim Masdea while playing in a cover band. Delp auditioned as lead vocalist for Boston, and got the job immediately.

==Musical career==

In 1969, guitarist Barry Goudreau introduced Delp to Tom Scholz, who was looking for a singer to complete some demo recordings. Eventually Scholz formed the short-lived band Mother's Milk (1973–74), including Delp and Goudreau. After producing a demo, Epic Records eventually signed the act. Mother's Milk was renamed Boston, and the eponymous debut album (recorded in 1975, although many tracks had been written years before) was released in August 1976. Delp performed all of the lead and backing vocals, including all layered vocal overdubs.
Boston has sold more than 20 million copies, and produced rock standards such as "More Than a Feeling", "Foreplay/Long Time" and "Peace of Mind". Delp co-wrote "Smokin'" along with Scholz, and wrote the album's closing track, "Let Me Take You Home Tonight".
Their next album, Don't Look Back, was released two years later in August 1978. Its release spawned new hits such as the title track, "Party" (a sequel of sorts to "Smokin'"), and the poignant ballad "A Man I'll Never Be". As they did with "Smokin'", Delp and Scholz again collaborated on "Party", and Delp penned "Used To Bad News".
After the two Boston albums, Delp sang vocals on Barry Goudreau's self-titled solo album, released in 1980. Scholz's legendary perfectionism and a legal battle with their record company stalled any further Boston albums until 1986, when the band released the appropriately titled Third Stage.  Delp co-wrote the songs "Cool the Engines" and "Can'tcha Say / Still in Love" for the album, and both songs got significant airplay.
Another hiatus between albums forced Delp to part ways with Scholz in 1991 to form a new band with Goudreau called RTZ. After Boston released the album "Walk On" in 1994 with Fran Cosmo on vocals, Delp and Boston eventually reunited later that year for another major tour and Delp continued to record vocals on several albums and projects, including new tracks for Boston's 1997 Greatest Hits compilation and their 2002 release Corporate America.
Though well known for his "golden" voice with soaring vocals and range,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07071/768874-387.stm|title=RIP Brad Delp (1951-2007)|date=March 12, 2007|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] Delp was also a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, harmonica and keyboards. He wrote or co-wrote songs for Boston, RTZ, Orion the Hunter, Lisa Guyer, and other artists.
From the mid-1990s until his death in 2007, Delp also played in a side project when he had time off from Boston – a Beatles tribute band called Beatlejuice. The Beatles had always been a personal favorite of Delp, and he revered them for their songwriting. During this time Delp also co-wrote with Boston bandmate Barry Goudreau for the 2003 release Delp and Goudreau.
