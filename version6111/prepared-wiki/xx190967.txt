Bernhard Trares (born 18 August 1965) is a German retired professional footballer who played mainly as a central defender, and a current manager.

==Playing career==

Trares was born in Bensheim, Hesse. Having played in his youth for SV Kirschhausen he joined Eintracht Frankfurt in 1982 and completed his formation there, and his professional career started in the second division at SV Darmstadt 98, as a defensive midfielder. He competed solely in the category during his spell with the "Lilies", scoring a career-best 11 goals in his last season. 
In the 1989 summer Trares joined Alemannia Aachen also in second level, being relegated in his first year and switching to fellow league side TSV 1860 München in 1991, in another eventual relegation. In just two further seasons, however, the Bavarians succeeded to promote to the Bundesliga, subsequently finishing 14th to retain their league status with the player netting four times in 31 matches, while also being sent off twice. 
After two additional years Trares left Munich to join SV Werder Bremen, where he became an important player in the team's defence, also helping it to the 1999 conquest of the German Cup, a penalty shootout win against FC Bayern Munich (1–1 after extra time). At age 36 he moved to division two's SV Waldhof Mannheim, after which he signed with Karlsruher SC for another two years in the category, retiring at the end of the 2003–04 campaign.
Altogether, Trares made 183 top flight appearances and scored 16 goals, adding 281 games with 46 in the second division.
