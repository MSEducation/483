</ref> The rationale for this precise dating is interesting in itself as an example of [[Paleontology|paleological]] [[deductive reasoning]]. Exactly at the Cambrian boundary there is a marked fall in the abundance of [[carbon-13]], a "reverse spike" that [[paleontologist]]s call an ''excursion''. It is so widespread that it is the best indicator of the position of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary in [[stratigraphic]] sequences of roughly this age. One of the places that this well-established carbon-13 excursion occurs is in [[Oman]]. Amthor (2003) describes evidence from Oman that indicates the [[carbon]]-[[isotope]] excursion relates to a mass extinction: the disappearance of distinctive fossils from the [[Precambrian]] coincides exactly with the carbon-13 anomaly. Fortunately, in the Oman sequence, so too does a [[volcanic ash]] horizon from which [[zircon]]s provide a very precise age of 542 ± 0.3 mya (calculated on the decay rate of [[uranium]] to lead). This new and precise date tallies with the less precise dates for the carbon-13 anomaly, derived from sequences in [[Siberia]] and [[Namibia]].

==Paleogeography==

Plate reconstructions suggest a global supercontinent, Pannotia, was in the process of breaking up early in the period,[ref]

Large, high-velocity rotational movement of Gondwana appears to have occurred in the Early Cambrian.[tpl]cite doi|10.1130/G30910.1[/tpl]
With a lack of sea ice – the great glaciers of the Marinoan Snowball Earth were long melted[tpl]cite journal|author=Smith, A.G.|year=in press (2008)|title=Neoproterozoic time scales and stratigraphy|journal=Geol. Soc.|issue=Special publication[/tpl] – the sea level was high, which led to large areas of the continents being flooded in warm, shallow seas ideal for thriving life.  The sea levels fluctuated somewhat, suggesting there were 'ice ages', associated with pulses of expansion and contraction of a south polar ice cap.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.02.010[/tpl]

==Climate==

The Earth was generally cold during the early Cambrian, probably due to the ancient continent of Gondwana covering the South Pole and cutting off polar ocean currents. There were likely polar ice caps and a series of glaciations, as the planet was still recovering from an earlier Snowball Earth. It became warmer towards the end of the period; the glaciers receded and eventually disappeared, and sea levels rose dramatically. This trend would continue into the Ordovician period.

==Flora==

Although there were a variety of macroscopic marine plants (e.g. Margaretia and Dalyia), no true land plant (embryophyte) fossils are known from the Cambrian. However, biofilms and microbial mats were well developed on Cambrian tidal flats and beaches.,Schieber et al., 2007, pp. 53–71. and further inland were a variety of lichens,[tpl]citation needed|reason=earliest unequivocal lichen fossils are Devonian, from the Rhynie chert|date=April 2013[/tpl] fungi and microbes forming microbial earth ecosystems, comparable with modern soil crust of desert regions, contributing to soil formation.Retallack, G.J., 2008, Cambrian palaeosols and landscapes of South Australia.

==Fauna==

Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic, with trilobites assumed to be the dominant life form,Cambrian HSU NHM which has since proven to be incorrect. Arthropods in general were by far the most dominating animals in the ocean, but at the time, trilobites were only a minor part of the total arthropod diversity. What made them different from their relatives was their heavy armor, which fossilized far easier than the fragile exoskeleton of other arthropods, leaving behind numerous preserved remains which give the false impression that they were the most abundant part of the fauna.Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere The period marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth's biosphere. The incumbent Ediacaran biota suffered a mass extinction at the base of the period, which corresponds to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour. This behaviour had a profound and irreversible effect on the substrate which transformed the seabed ecosystems. Before the Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by microbial mats. By the end of the period, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats through bioturbation, and gradually turned the seabeds into what they are today. As a consequence, many of those organisms that were dependent on the mats went extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment that now offered new ecological niches.As the worms churn
Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the  mineralized phyla except the Bryozoa, which appear in the Lower Ordovician.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1666/13-029|title=Reinterpretation of the Cambrian 'bryozoan' Pywackia as an octocoral|year=2013|last1=Taylor|first1=P.D.|last2=Berning|first2=B.|last3=Wilson|first3=M.A.|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=87|issue=6|pages=984–990[/tpl] However, many of these phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla.[tpl]BuddJensen2000[/tpl]
While the early Cambrian showed such diversification that it has been named the Cambrian Explosion, this changed later in the period, when it was exposed to a sharp drop in biodiversity. About 515 million years ago, the number of species going extinct exceeded the amount of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also the speciation rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 million years ago, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to hypoxia, while the levels of poisonous hydrogen sulfide simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and show evidence of several rapid extinction events; the stromatolites which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as Archaeocyatha, returned once more as the archaeocyathids went extinct. This declining trend did not change before Ordovician.The Ordovician: Life's second big bangOxygen crash led to Cambrian mass extinction
Some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land, producing the trace fossils Protichnites and Climactichnites. Fossil evidence suggests that euthycarcinoids, an extinct group of arthropods, produced at least some of the Protichnites.Collette & Hagadorn, 2010.Collette, Gass & Hagadorn, 2012 Fossils of the maker of Climactichnites have not been found; however, fossil trackways and resting traces suggest a large, slug-like mollusk.Yochelson & Fedonkin, 1993.Getty & Hagadorn, 2008.
In contrast to later periods, the Cambrian fauna was somewhat restricted; free-floating organisms were rare, with the majority living on or close to the sea floor;[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.08.001[/tpl] and mineralizing animals were rarer than in future periods, in part due to the unfavourable ocean chemistry.
Many modes of preservation are unique to the Cambrian, resulting in an abundance of Lagerstätten.
