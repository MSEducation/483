During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington used Pennepacker Mills in 1777 as a headquarters prior to the Battle of Germantown, and also as a field hospital for injured soldiers after the battle.
Pennsylvania governor Samuel Pennypacker made the Mills his summer home in the early 1900s, and lived there for much of his term in office (1903–1907). He was an avid collector of antiques and manuscripts, and many of these can still be found on display at the Mills, along with letters and orders written by George Washington.[tpl]cite web|title=Pennypacker Mills Scope of Collections|url=http://pa-montgomerycounty.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/3450|publisher=Montgomery County, PA|accessdate=December 30,  2013[/tpl]
