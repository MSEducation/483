The Château de Jumilhac is a modified castle in the commune of Jumilhac-le-Grand in the Dordogne département of France.
Its construction dates from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The edifice is composed of the castle itself, constructed in the 15th century, and two wings added during the reign of Louis XIV. A covered porch and two arcaded walls link the ends of the wings and thus form an almost rectangular court of honour. At the rear façade is a terrassed lawn and an orangery. A parkland completes the site.Ministry of Culture:Château de Jumilhac
