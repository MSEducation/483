==Governors==

Georgia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and ratified the Constitution of the United States on January 2, 1788.[tpl]cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ratga.asp|title=Ratification of the Constitution by the State of Georgia - January 2, 1788|date=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=January 9, 2011[/tpl] Before it declared its independence, Georgia was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Like most early states, Georgia had claims to western areas, but did not cede its claims during the formation of the country like the other states. It sold this area, the Yazoo Lands, to the federal government on April 24, 1802, when it was assigned to Mississippi Territory.
In the Rules and Regulations of 1776, considered by some to be the first constitution, the chief executive was a president chosen by the legislature every six months.1776 Const. art. I This was quickly superseded by the 1777 constitution, which called for a governor to be chosen by the legislature each year,1777 Const. art. II with a term limited to one year out of every three.1777 Const. art. XXIII In the event of a vacancy, the president of the executive council acted as governor.1777 Const. art. XXIX The governor's term was lengthened to two years in the 1789 constitution.1789 Const. art. 2, § 1 The 1798 constitution modified succession so that the president of the senate would act as governor should that office become vacant. An 1818 amendment to that constitution extended the line of succession to the speaker of the house,1798 Const. Amendment 4 and an 1824 amendment provided for popular election of the governor.1798 Const. Amendment 7
While the 1861 secessionist constitution kept the office the same, the other constitutions surrounding the American Civil War brought lots of changes. The 1865 constitution, following Georgia's surrender, limited governors to two consecutive terms, allowing them to serve again after a gap of four years.1865 Const. art III, § 1 The Reconstruction constitution of 1868 increased the governor's term to four years.1868 Const. art. IV, § 1 The 1877 constitution, after local rule was re-established, returned the office to the provisions of the 1865 constitution.1877 Const. art. 5, § 1 par. 2 An amendment in 1941 lengthened terms to 4 years, but governors could no longer succeed themselves, having to wait four years to serve again.http://books.google.com/books?id=kwD3PrldCfUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=1945+georgia+constitution+amendments&source=bl&ots=DbZsWJC5pK&sig=yo3tOJfTRHzZlqwIM2wTdsYSRjc&hl=en&ei=i8grTeKRCc6fnwfh07T2AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&q=governor&f=false The constitution does not specify when terms start, only that the governor is installed at the next session of the General Assembly.GA Const. art V, § 1 par. 2
The 1945 constitution provided for a lieutenant governor, to serve the same term as governor and to act as governor if that office became vacant. Should it become vacant within 30 days of the next general election, or if the governor's term would have ended within 90 days of the next election, the lieutenant governor acts out the term; otherwise, a successor is chosen in the next general election.1945 Const. art. V, § 1 par. 7 This was retained in the 1976 constitution. The current constitution of 1983 allows governors to succeed themselves once before having to wait four years to serve again,GA Const. art V, § 1 par 4 and lieutenant governors now become governor in the event of a vacancy. Should the office of lieutenant governor be vacant, the speaker of the house acts as governor, and a special election to fill the office must happen in 90 days.GA Const. art. V, § 1 par 5
