==History==

The University of the West of England can trace its roots back to the foundation of the Merchant Venturers Navigation School, which was founded in 1595. Part of this institution, to which the Universities of Bristol and Bath also partly owe their origins, became a technical college which, after merger with other colleges, in turn became Bristol Polytechnic in 1970; the then-main campus was at Ashley Down, now a campus of the City of Bristol College. Like the other former polytechnics, this gained university status and its present name as a result of the Further and Higher Education Act, 1992.History of UWE
The Bower Ashton site was formed in 1969 as the West of England College of Art which was formerly the art school of the Royal West of England Academy in Queens Road, Bristol. The St Matthias site was originally built in Victorian times and was a teacher training college. These campuses, together with campuses in Redland, Ashley Down, Unity Street and Frenchay became part of Bristol Polytechnic around 1976.
The Avon and Gloucestershire College of Health which is now the Glenside Campus and the Bath and Swindon College of Health Studies joined in January 1996. Hartpury campus joined in 1997. An £80 million student village located at the Frenchay campus, which includes a sports centre and rooms for 2000 students, opened in 2006. The university is a lead academic sponsor of Bristol Technology and Engineering Academy, a new university technical college which is due to open in September 2013.

==Campuses==

===Frenchay campus===

UWE's largest and primary campus is Frenchay, situated to the 4 miles to the north of Bristol city centre with Filton to the West and Stoke Gifford to the North.
As of September 2008 UWE have purchased the major part of neighbour Hewlett Packard's adjoining land, resulting in a [tpl]convert|70|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] expansion to their current [tpl]convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] campus. After consultation meetings it has been stated that the campuses of Glenside and St Matthias will be moved to the Frenchay campus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uwenewcampus.com/news/development/consultation-starts-on-uwe-bristols-new-campus-project/|title=Consultation starts on UWE Bristol’s New Campus Project|date=7 April 2009|publisher=University of the West of England|quote=All activities at UWE Bristol’s St Matthias and Glenside campuses will be moved to Frenchay as part of the project.

===Bower Ashton campus===

The Bower Ashton campus is home to the School of Creative Arts (formerly the Faculty of Art, Media and Design), which forms the major part of the Faculty of Creative Arts following the university reorganisation in 2007.  Adjacent to the Ashton Court estate, on the edge of the city of Bristol, the West of England College of Art was established here in purpose-built premises in 1969, moving from its previous location as the art school of the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton. In 1970 the college became part of Bristol Polytechnic, the precursor of the University.
The campus is undergoing a programme of redevelopment. Phase 1 was completed in 2008 and included a new building (F Block), which is now the main entrance to the campus. The tower block (B block) was also refurbished.[ref]

===UWE Stadium===

As part of the masterplanning process, the University has identified an undeveloped area of 9.3 hectares which has the benefit of planning permission for office development. Potential uses for this site were considered, but it has subsequently been identified as an ‘opportunity site’ with the uses to be determined.Site Location. UWE Stadium. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.
It is part of this ‘opportunity site’ that has been identified for a new stadium by Bristol Rovers Football Club. The ‘UWE Stadium’, as it will be called, will be developed in a spirit of partnership between the University and Bristol Rovers, albeit privately financed.
The proposed 21,700 seat stadium is to include retail units, a sports bar and club, a banqueting suite and venue space for hire.UWE Stadium - UWE Bristol: UWE New Campus. .uwe.ac.uk (2012-07-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.

===Coat of arms===

Echoing Bristol's long connection with the sea and the Merchant Venturers' Navigation School, the top of the crest depicts a ship's mainmast and rigging. The flaming fire basket indicates guidance, hope and the desire for learning.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwe.ac.uk/aboutUWE/coatOfArms.shtml|title=The Bristol UWE coat of arms|publisher=University of the West of England|accessdate=2009-05-14[/tpl]
The shield at the centre is adapted from that of the College of St Matthias with the wavy line representing the rivers of Avon and Severn. The unicorn is taken from the arms of the City of Bristol and the sea stag from those of the former County of Avon. Both these creatures wear a crown of King Edgar around their necks. Edgar is regarded as a local monarch because he was crowned in Bath Abbey in 973.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/saxon_12.htm |title=Edgar the Peaceful |accessdate=2007-12-08 |work=English Monarchs – Kings and Queens of England [/tpl] The wavy lines enclosed in circles on the shoulders represent the fountain of knowledge and learning.
The unicorn and sea stag each support an apple tree, known as the tree of knowledge and is taken from the coat of arms of the Council for National Academic Awards which used to authorise degrees awarded to students of Bristol Polytechnic.
The motto Light, Liberty, Learning is a Disraeli quotation and corresponds directly to the symbolism of the coat of arms. The fire basket represents the Light, the Bristol and Avon supporters represent liberty, and the trees of knowledge and learning.

===Structure===

The university is divided into four faculties which are then subdivided into departments:
