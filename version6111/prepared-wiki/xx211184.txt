==Books==

CrimethInc. has published three collectively authored books that collect and expand upon the individual essays produced by the group in a particular period; authors are generally uncredited or credited pseudonymously.

===Letters series===

The CrimethInc. Letters series of books are not intended as direct propaganda, but rather as letters to the reader detailing the story of the experiences of the authors.

==Video==

In March 2001, two documentaries from Eugene, Oregon's Pickaxe Productions were published by a CrimethInc. cell: Pickaxe, an eyewitness account of environmental activism in the Pacific Northwest and Breaking the Spell, which documented anarchist activism at the  Battle of Seattle in 1999.
At the end of 2005 (a year after the release of Recipes for Disaster), CrimethInc. announced the first volume in a Guerrilla Film Series, a DVD including three feature-length documentaries and a collection of short films. A few of CrimethInc.'s "thinktank" experiments had been documented on film by the "folk-scientists" themselves, and copies of these lived in relative obscurity until included in the series. CrimethInc. Guerilla Film Series, Volume One included Pickaxe, Breaking the Spell, The Miami Model, two subMedia shorts and three Thinktank documentaries.

==Music==

CrimethInc. is associated with the North American anarcho-punk scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of Inside Front, a "journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action".[tpl]cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4 [/tpl] CrimethInc. releases include LPs, CDs, and 7"s from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore and anti-folk bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has situated CrimethInc. as "exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach" to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression. However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and crust punk bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective Profane Existence in the mid-to-late 90s.
