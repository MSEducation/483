In New Zealand, the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) publishes weekly record charts. Since 2000, at the end of each year the organisation also compiles an annual chart. That year had Anastacia's dance number, "I'm Outta Love", placed at number one, while 2001 saw Craig David's "Walking Away" top the chart. In 2002, pop song "Complicated" by Avril Lavigne of Canada reached the top spot, and the following year New Zealand rapper Scribe's double A-side "Stand Up"/"Not Many" achieved the number one position. New Zealand Idol season one winner Ben Lummis took the prime placing in 2004 with his winner's single "They Can't Take That Away", and Crazy Frog's cover of "Axel F" topped the chart in 2005. The year of 2006 had "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley go to number one, while Barbadan R&B singer Rihanna's "Umbrella" followed in 2007, which featured rapper Jay-Z. A duet of Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown rose to top the 2008 chart. 2009's "I Gotta Feeling" gave The Black Eyed Peas a year-end number-one, and last year New Zealand R&B singer J.Williams" reached number one with "You Got Me", which hosted an appearance by Scribe. Scribe is the only artist to have two year-end number-one singles, having topped both the 2003 and 2010 charts. Both "Axel F" and "Stand Up"/"Not Many" have spent twelve weeks at number one on the weekly charts, the most of all year-end number-one songs. "I'm Outta Love" is the annual number-one to have charted for the longest time throughout the year, with thirty-two weeks.
