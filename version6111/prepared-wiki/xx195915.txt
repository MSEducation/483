The Canterbury School is a private coeducational bilingual day school founded in 1972 by owner and current headteacher Beryl Pritchard.
The main school campus is located 4Â km outside Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in purposely designed buildings which house the Primary, Secondary and administrative departments. The Infant school and nursery is located in the city of Las Palmas and a newer, although smaller, second Primary school is located near to Playa del Ingles in the south of the island.
The school is authorised by both the British Council, NABSS, and local Spanish educational authorities to deliver a British-style education on the island. All students at the school follow the  British National Curriculum which is adapted, where appropriate, to suite the geographical location. The school is bilingual; using Spanish and English as working languages.
