Montreal Area Control Centre [tpl]Airport codes||CZUL[/tpl] is one of 7 Area Control Centres in Canada operated by Nav Canada. Montreal ACC is located in a building on the outskirts of Montr√©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.
From this ACC, air traffic controllers provide en route and terminal control services to aircraft in the Montreal Flight Information Region (FIR). The Montreal FIR airspace covers the entire province of Quebec (with the exception of the Bagotville Military Terminal Control Area), parts of eastern Ontario, the eastern shore of James Bay, Hudson Bay, the western section of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Nunavut region that includes Iqaluit.Montreal Flight Information Region The Montreal FIR is bordered by 5 Flight Information Regions and 1 Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). To the east are the Moncton and Gander FIRs, to the south is the Boston ARTCC, to the west are the Toronto and Winnipeg FIRs and the Edmonton FIR to the north.

==Aerodrome Classes==

The Montreal ACC assumes control of the following classes of airports
Class C (Controlled, IFR/IFR, IFR/VFR and VFR/VFR separation, VFR: Mode C and ATC clearance required)
Class D (Controlled, IFR/IFR and IFR/VFR separation, VFR: 2-way communication required)
Class E (Controlled, only IFR/IFR spacing)
This FIR contains several Class G aerodromes that are in uncontrolled airspace and IFR clearances are required to enter or leave controlled airspace.

==Peripheral station (PAL) frequencies==

Within each FIR, there are transmitter sites that allow the relay of distant communication from aircraft back to the ACC. These links are called a  peripheral stationGlossary for Pilots and Air Traffic Services Personnel from Transport Canada (PAL). They re-transmit the voice and data communication over high speed data links between the ACC and the remote transmitter. There are several PALs in the Montreal FIR:[tpl]CFS[/tpl]
