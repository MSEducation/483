Doric, the popular name for Mid Northern Scots Robert McColl Millar (2007) Northern and insular Scots Edinburgh University Press. p. 3 or Northeast Scots,Ana Deumert & Wim Vandenbussche (2003) Germanic standardizations: past to present. John Benjamins. p. 385 refers to the dialects of Scots spoken in the northeast of Scotland.  There is an extensive body of literature, mostly poetry, ballads, and songs.

==Nomenclature==

The term "Doric" was used to refer to all dialects of Lowland Scots but during the twentieth century it became increasingly associated with Mid Northern Scots.McColl Millar. 2007. Northern and Insular Scots. Edinburgh: University Press Ltd. p. 116
The term possibly originated as a jocular reference to the Doric dialect of the Ancient Greek language. Greek Dorians lived in Sparta amongst other places, a more rural area, and were supposed by the ancient Greeks to have spoken laconically and in a language that was thought harsher in tone and more phonetically conservative than the Attic spoken in Athens. Doric Greek was used for some of the verses spoken by the chorus in Greek tragedy.
As The Oxford Companion to English Literature explains:
Use of the term Doric in this context may also arise out of a contrast with the anglicised speech of the Scottish capital, because at one point, Edinburgh was nicknamed 'Athens of the North'. The upper/middle class speech of Edinburgh would thus be 'Attic', making the rural areas' speech 'Doric'.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] According to another source, 18th century Scots writers like Allan Ramsay justified their use of Scots (instead of English) by comparing it to the use of Ancient Greek Doric by Theocritus.[tpl]cite book|author=Billy Kay||title=Scots: The Mither Tongue|year=2006|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1845960521|edition=New[/tpl]

==Phonology==

Most consonants are usually pronounced much as in other Modern Scots dialects but:
Some vowel realisations differ markedly from those of Central Scots dialects. The vowel numbers are from Aitken.Aitken A.J. ‘How to Pronounce Older Scots’ in ‘Bards and Makars’. Glasgow University Press 1977 See also Cardinal vowels. 

==Literature==

North East Scots has an extensive body of literature, mostly poetry, ballads and songs. During the Middle Scots period writing from the North East of Scotland adhered to the literary conventions of the time; indications of particular "Doric" pronunciations were very rare. The 18th century literary revival also brought forth writers from the North East but, again, local dialect features were rare, the extant literary Scots conventions being preferred. In later times, a more deliberately regional literature began to emerge.
In contemporary prose writing, Doric occurs usually as quoted speech, although this is less and less often the case. As is usually the case with marginalised languages, local loyalties prevail in the written form, showing how the variety "deviates" from standard ("British") English as opposed to a general literary Scots "norm". This shows itself in the local media presentation of the language, e.g., Grampian Television & The Aberdeen Press and Journal. These local loyalties, waning knowledge of the older literary tradition and relative distance from the Central Lowlands ensure that the Doric scene has a degree of semi-autonomy. 
Doric was used in a lot of so-called Kailyard literature, a genre that paints a sentimental, melodramatic picture of the old rural life, and is currently unfashionable. This negative association still plagues Doric literature to a degree, as well as Scottish literature in general.
Poets who wrote in the Doric dialect include John M. Caie of Banffshire (1879-1949), Helen B. Cruickshank of Angus (1886-1975), Alexander Fenton (1929-2012), Flora Garry  (1900-2000), Sir Alexander Gray (1882-1968), Violet Jacob of Angus (1863-1946), Charles Murray (1864-1941) and J. C. Milne (1897-1962).[tpl]cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/poetry/doric.htm |work=Electric Scotland |title=Doric Dialects and Doric Poets of North-East Scotland |last=Henderson|first=John |year=1996 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl]
George MacDonald from Huntly used Doric in his novels. A friend of Mark Twain, he is commonly considered one of the fathers of the fantasy genre and an influence on C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.
Lewis Grassic Gibbon's Scots Quair trilogy is set in the Mearns and has been the basis of a successful play and television series. It is very popular throughout Scotland and tells the story of Chris, an independent-minded woman, mainly in a form of English strongly influenced by the rhythms of local speech. 
A version of Aesop's Fables has been published in Doric, as well as some sections of the Bible.
The North East has been claimed as the "real home of the ballad"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/elphinstone/kist/search/display.php?lwee37.dat |title=Display KIST Information Example |publisher=Abdn.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl] and, according to Les Wheeler, "91 out of a grand total of (Child's) 305 ballads came from the North East - in fact from Aberdeenshire", which makes the usual name of "Border Ballad" a misnomer put about by Sir Walter Scott.
Contemporary writers in Doric include Sheena Blackhall, a poet who writes in Doric and Scottish Gaelic, Mo Simpson, who writes in the Aberdeen Evening Express and peppers her humour column with "Doricisms" and Doric words.  The Doric has also featured in stage, radio and television, notably in the sketches and songs of the Aberdeen-based comedy groups Scotland the What? and the Flying Pigs.

==Recent developments==

In 2006 an Aberdeen hotel decided to use a Doric voice for their lift. Phrases said by the lift include "Gyaun Up" [tpl]IPA|/ɡʲɑːn ʌp/[/tpl] (Going up), "Gyaun Doun" [tpl]IPA|/ɡʲɑːn dun/[/tpl] (Going down), "atween fleers een an fower" [tpl]IPA|/əˈtwin fliːrz in ən ˈfʌur/[/tpl] (between floors one and four).[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5087270.stm |title=Hotel lands uplifting Doric voice |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |work= |publisher=BBC News|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-24 | date=2006-06-16 | location=London[/tpl]
Also in 2006, Maureen Watt of the SNP took her Scottish Parliamentary oath in Doric. She said "I want to advance the cause of Doric and show there's a strong and important culture in the North East."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4920268.stm |title=Doric oath as new MSPs sworn in |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |work= |publisher=BBC News |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-24 | date=2006-04-19 | location=London[/tpl] She was required to take an oath in English beforehand. There was some debate as to whether the oath was "gweed Doric" ([tpl]IPA|/ɡwid ˈdoːrɪk/[/tpl]) or not, and notably it is, to a certain extent, written phonetically and contains certain anglicised forms such as "I" rather than "A", and "and" instead of "an":
In Disney/Pixar's Brave, the character Young MacGuffin speaks the Doric dialect, and a running joke involves no one else understanding him. This was a choice by the voice actor, Kevin McKidd, a native of Elgin.[tpl]cite web|title=Say What?

==Translation of the Bible==

In August 2012, Gordon Hay, an Aberdeenshire author, successfully completed what is believed to be the very first translation of the New Testament into Doric. The project took him six years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19400903 |title=BBC News - Bible's New Testament translated into Doric by Gordon Hay |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2012-08-30[/tpl]

==Select vocabulary==

The most distinctive and common Doric phrase is Ay ay, fit like?, "Hello, how are you?" (Ay Ay, whit like? - ay is sometimes spelt aye.The SND entry for ay has 16 citations using ay and two using aye.DSL.ac.uk The SND also states:
"The spelling of this and the preceding word in Sc. is irregular, but ay = yes, and aye = always, seem to predominate. Both words in Sc. are markedly diphthongal but not identical in pronunciation. N.E.D. and Un. Eng. Dict. prefer ay = always, and aye = yes, the first of which rhymes with the ay series of Eng. words like say, day, etc., while the second does not. The Concise Eng. Dict. spells ay = yes, and aye = ever, always.")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=4971&startset=1196879&query=AYE&fhit=aye&dregion=form&dtext=snd#fhit |title=Aye, AY, Ey - region form |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-11-15[/tpl]
