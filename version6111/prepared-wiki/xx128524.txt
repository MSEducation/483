True Democracy is a roots reggae album released by Steel Pulse in May 1982.  The album was recorded over 25 days in Denmark, with legendary reggae producer Karl Pitterson.
While True Democracy does see Steel Pulse return somewhat to their political roots of Handsworth Revolution and Tribute to the Martyrs, it is also more light-hearted in the vein of Reggae Fever (Caught You).
True Democracy peak at #120 on Billboard's Top Pop Albums chart in 1982.
