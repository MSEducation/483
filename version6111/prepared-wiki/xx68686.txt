[tpl]Other uses|Balearic (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Balearic[/tpl]
Linguists coined Balearic ([tpl]lang-ca|balear[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ca|bəɫəˈa|IPA[/tpl]) as a collective name for the group of Catalan variants that people speak in the Balearic Islands. Those who speak it refer to their variant by the name local to their individual island: mallorquí (Majorcan), eivissenc (Ibizan), and menorquí (Minorcan).
At the last census, 746,792 people in the Balearic Islands claimed to be able to speak Catalan, though some of these people may be speakers of mainland variants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibestat.cat/ibestat/estadistiques/poblacio/censos-poblacio/cens-2001/bd1a335c-a1ce-4d5e-8abf-2fe69850118d |title=2001 census, from Institut Balear d'Estadística, Govern de les Illes Balears |publisher=Caib.es |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07[/tpl]

==Political questions about the Balearic dialects==

Some in the Balearic Islands, such as the Partido Popular and his governing José Ramón Bauzà, argue that the dialects of Baleric Islands are actually separate languages and not dialects of Catalan. Bauzà has even campaigned against having centralized or standardized standards of Catalan in public education.Mallorcai, menorcai, ibizai és formenterai nyelv (nyest.hu)
