==Early life and career==

Born in Winona, Mississippi, United States, and raised in a one-room shack, Davis learned to play the harmonica at the age of eight.[tpl]cite book|title=All Music Guide to the Blues|page=145|author=Dahl, Bill|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0-87930-736-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nS2l6Z_J99kC&pg=PA145&dq=%22Little+Sammy+Davis%22#v=onepage&q=%22Little%20Sammy%20Davis%22&f=false[/tpl] He eventually left home and settled in Florida, where he continued to play the blues in the Miami area while working in orange groves and saw mills to make ends meet.
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Davis traveled with medicine shows and played with blues musicians like Pine Top Perkins, and Ike Turner. He spent a total of nine years on the road with Earl Hooker, including with the short-lived band of Hooker, Ike Turner, Pine Top Perkins and Albert King,ending when the two titans of Blues Guitar came to blows,thus breaking up the band.Sammy and  Earl recorded four sides for Rockin' Records in 1952 and 1953 (as Little Sam Davis).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/littlesammydavisbluesband|title=Little Sammy Davis|publisher=Myspace Music[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Earl Hooker, Blues Master|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-G76U3ikkFAC&pg=PA52&dq=%22little+sammy+davis%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22little%20sammy%20davis%22&f=false|year=2001|page=52|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-307-8|author=Danchin, Sebastian[/tpl]
In the late 1950s, Davis lived in Chicago, Illinois, performing with Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed and occasionally fronting  Little Walter's Band, The Aces when Walter did not show. At some point, word had let out that "some guy looks and plays" just like Walter and people THINK he IS Little Walter". One night as Sammy Performed on stage,Sammy spotted a Policeman at the back of the club, accompanied by Hooker. Walter and the officer waited for Sammy to get through with his set and when Sammy got off of the stage, he was  arrested on the spot. To quote Sammy:" Walter was a good guy and told me that yes, you do indeed sound just like me but you can't be going around letting people think you ARE me". Sammy was locked up, spent a night in jail before Walter dropped the charges, leaving Davis and Walter friends for the rest of Walter's all too short and tragic life. He later married and settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, during which time he recorded a session for Trix Records that resulted in one "45" single. After the sudden death of his wife in 1970, Davis stopped playing and dropped out of the music scene for the next two decades. No one knew if Sammy was alive or even dead.

==Comeback==

In 1990, local DJ Doug Price was getting a haircut at a barber shop in Poughkeepsie, NY when he heard rumors that Davis was sitting in at a  Blues Jam at the " Side Tracked Inn". Price made mention of Davis's story and played some of his old recordings on WVKR.Then One night, Brad Scribner was hired to play drums at the Jam when Sammy got up to play and was amazed at what he saw and heard. Brad immediately came home to tell his brother Fred who had been supplying Blues Instrumentals for the Legendary Radio Shock Jock Don Imus   and had been actively looking for a Singer to progress from background instrumentals to being a Featured Guest on Imus' Show.     
Fred Scribner arranged to bring [Little Sammy Davis and Midnight Slim into Tom Veneble's Recording Studio in Walden, NY to record a fresh batch of Material including the Classic Howlin' Wolf song, "Sitting On Top Of The World".  Imus interviewed Sammy and Fred via telephone,Live and they were an instant hit and subsequently invited Davis and Scribner to perform on his show, Live in the Studio at WFAN,Radio,NY. The New York Daily News proclaimed the very next day:" Little Sammy Davis and Fred Scribner score on the Imus Show". Sammy and Fred started to appear regularly, soon earning the title of " House Band" for the Imus in the Morning Show for years to come. Imus, in his trademark style, later quipped that Davis had "more harmonicas than teeth" and that Fred looked like a manager of an Ace Hardware Store.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcsImus  Imus loved it and they went along for the ride.  studio cutssdll/article?AID=/20070411/ENTERTAIN/704110351/-1/NEWS|title=Helm stands by 'I-man'|author=Israel, Steve|date=April 11, 2007|publisher=Times Herald Record[/tpl]
