[[Spirulina (dietary supplement)]]

CATEGORIES: Cyanobacteria, Edible algae, Aquaculture, Dietary supplements

Spirulina is a cyanobacterium that can be consumed by humans and other animals and is made primarily from two species of cyanobacteria:  Arthrospira platensis and  Arthrospira maxima.
Arthrospira is cultivated worldwide; used as a dietary supplement as well as a whole food; and is available in tablet, flake and powder form. It is also used as a feed supplement in the aquaculture, aquarium and poultry industries.Vonshak, A. (ed.). Spirulina platensis (Arthrospira): Physiology, Cell-biology and Biotechnology. London: Taylor & Francis, 1997.

==Etymology and ecology==

The maxima and plaetensis species were once classified in the genus Spirulina. There is now agreement that they are in fact Arthrospira; nevertheless, and somewhat confusingly, the older term Spirulina remains in use for historical reasons.
Arthrospira are free-floating filamentous cyanobacteria characterized by cylindrical, multicellular trichomes in an open left-hand helix. They occur naturally in tropical and subtropical lakes with high pH and high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate. Arthrospira platensis occurs in Africa, Asia and South America, whereas Arthrospira maxima is confined to Central America. Most cultivated spirulina is produced in open channel raceway ponds, with paddle-wheels used to agitate the water. The largest commercial producers of spirulina are located in the United States, Thailand, India, Taiwan, China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Burma (a.k.a. Myanmar), Greece and Chile.
Spirulina thrives at a pH around 8.5 + , which will get more alkaline, and a temperature around 86 deg. F. They are able to  make their own food, and do not need a living energy or organic carbon source. In addition, spirulina have to have an ensemble of nutrients to thrive in a home aquarium or pond. A simple nutrient feed for growing Spirulina is: 

Baking soda - NaHCO3 - 16 g/L = 60.56 g/gal

Potassium nitrate - KNO3 - 2 g/L = 7.57 g/gal

Sea salt - NaCl - 1 g/L = 3.78 g/gal

Potassium phosphate - KH 2 PO 4 -  0.1 g/L = .378 g/gal

Iron sulphate - FeSO4 * 7H2O - 0.01 g/L = .0378 g/gal

which can all be found in aquarium or else in the agricultural division, all commonly occurring compounds except for the FeSO4. The algae has actually been tested and successfully grown in human urine at 1:180 parts. Feng, Dao-len and Wu, Zu-cheng. "Culture of Spirulina platensis in human urine for biomass production and O2 evolution." Journal of Zhejiang University Science. Jan 2006; 7(1): 34–37.  Published online Dec 21, 2005.  After 7days, 97% of NH4+-N, 96.5% of total phosphorus (TP) and 85–98% of urea in the urine (ca. 120-diluted) were removed by the microalgae under autotrophic culture (30°C).  Chang, Yuanyuan et al.

==Historical use==

Spirulina was a food source for the Aztecs and other Mesoamericans until the 16th century; the harvest from Lake Texcoco and subsequent sale as cakes were described by one of Cortés' soldiers.Diaz Del Castillo, B. The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico, 1517–1521. London: Routledge, 1928, p. 300.[tpl]cite book |author=Osborne, Ken; Kahn, Charles N. |title=World History: Societies of the Past |publisher=Portage & Main Press |location=Winnipeg |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-55379-045-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] The Aztecs called it "tecuitlatl".[tpl]cite web|title=A Review on Culture, Production and Use of Spirulina as Food dor Humans and Feeds for Domestic Animals and Fish|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0424e/i0424e00.pdf|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations|accessdate=November 20, 2011|author=Habib, M. Ahsan B.|coauthors=Parvin, Mashuda; Huntington, Tim C.; Hasan, Mohammad R.|year=2008[/tpl]
Spirulina was found in abundance at Lake Texcoco by French researchers in the 1960s, but there is no reference to its use by the Aztecs as a daily food source after the 16th century, probably due to the draining of the surrounding lakes for agricultural and urban development.  The first large-scale spirulina production plant, run by Sosa Texcoco, was established there in the early 1970s.
Spirulina has also been traditionally harvested in Chad. It is dried into cakes called dihé, which are used to make broths for meals, and also sold in markets.  The spirulina is harvested from small lakes and ponds around Lake Chad.Abdulqader, G., Barsanti, L., Tredici, M. "Harvest of Arthrospira platensis from Lake Kossorom (Chad) and its household usage among the Kanembu." Journal of Applied Phycology. 12: 493-498. 2000.

==Nutrient and vitamin content==

===Protein===

Dried spirulina contains about 60% (51–71%) protein. It is a complete protein containing all essential amino acids, though with reduced amounts of methionine, cysteine and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat, eggs and milk. It is, however, superior to typical plant protein, such as that from legumes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ciferri O |title=Spirulina, the edible microorganism |journal=Microbiol.

The U.S. National Library of Medicine said that spirulina was no better than milk or meat as a protein source, and was approximately 30 times more expensive per gram.[tpl]cite web | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | work = MedlinePlus | url =http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/923.html | title = Blue-green algae | date = November 18, 2010 | accessdate = April 15, 2011[/tpl]

===Other nutrients===

Spirulina's lipid content is about 7% by weight,http://www.ejbiotechnology.info/content/vol9/issue4/full/5/ and is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and also provides alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA).[tpl]cite journal | author = Tokusoglu O., Unal M.K. | title = Biomass Nutrient Profiles of Three Microalgae: Spirulina platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, and Isochrisis galbana | url = | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 68 | issue = 4| page = 2003 [/tpl] Spirulina contains vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (nicotinamide), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folic acid), vitamin C, vitamin A and vitamin E. It is also a source of potassium, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium, sodium and zinc. Spirulina contains many pigments which may be beneficial and bioavailable, including beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, chlorophyll-a, xanthophyll, echinenone, myxoxanthophyll, canthaxanthin, diatoxanthin, 3'-hydroxyechinenone, beta-cryptoxanthin and oscillaxanthin, plus the phycobiliproteins c-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin.

===Vitamin B12 controversy===

Spirulina is not considered to be a reliable source of Vitamin B12. Spirulina supplements contain predominantly pseudovitamin B12, which is biologically inactive in humans. Companies which grow and market spirulina have claimed it to be a significant source of B12 on the basis of alternative, unpublished assays, although their claims are not accepted by independent scientific organizations. The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada in their position paper on vegetarian diets state that spirulina cannot be counted on as a reliable source of active vitamin B12.Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets The medical literature similarly advises that spirulina is unsuitable as a source of B12.[tpl]cite journal | author = Watanabe F | title =Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability. | year = 2007 | journal = Exp. Biol. Med.

The edible cyanobacteria are not suitable for use as vitamin B(12) sources, especially in vegans.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y | title =Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets. | year = 1999 | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 47 | issue = 11 | pages = 4736–41 | pmid = 10552882 | doi = 10.1021/jf990541b | quote = The results presented here strongly suggest that spirulina tablet algal health food is not suitable for use as a B12 source, especially in vegetarians.[/tpl]

==Possible health benefits and risks==

===Safety===

====Toxicological studies====

Toxicological studies of the effects of spirulina consumption on humans and animals, including feeding as much as 800mg/kg,[tpl]cite journal|last=Krishnakumari|first=M.K.|coauthors=Ramesh, H.P., Venkataraman, L.V.|title=Food Safety Evaluation: acute oral and dermal effects of the algae Scenedesmus acutus and Spirulina platensis on albino rats|journal=J. Food Protect.|year=1981|volume=44|issue=934[/tpl]  and replacing up to 60% of protein intake with spirulina,[tpl]cite journal|last=Bizzi|first=A.|coauthors=et al|title=Trattamenti prolungati nel ratto con diete conntenenti proteine di Spirulina. Aspetti biochimici, morfologici e tossicologici|journal=Prospettive della coltura di Spirulina in Italia|year=1980|volume=205|editor1-first=R.|editor1-last=Materassi|trans_title=Extended Treatment of Rats with Diets Containing Spirulina.  Biochemical, morphological, and toxicological aspects.|publisher=Accademia dei Geo rgofili, Firence[/tpl]  have shown no toxic effects.http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874198000804
Fertility, teratogenicity, peri- and post-natal, and multi-generational studies on animals also have found no adverse effects from spirulina consumption.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chamorro-Cevallos|first=G.|coauthors=B.L. Barron, J. Vasquez-Sanchez|title=Toxicologic Studies and Antitoxic Properties of Spirulina|journal=Spirulina in Human Nutrition and Health|year=2008|editor1-first=M.E.|editor1-last=Gershwin|publisher=CRC Press[/tpl]  Spirulina intake has also been found to prevent damage caused by toxins affecting the heart, liver, kidneys, neurons, eyes, ovaries, DNA, and testicles.  In a 2009 study, 550 malnourished children were fed up to 10 g/day of spirulina powder, with no adverse effects. Similarly, dozens of clinical studies in humans have shown no harmful effects from spirulina supplementation.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/gras_notices/GRN000394.pdf

====Quality-related safety issues====

Spirulina is a form of cyanobacterium, some of which are known to produce toxins such as microcystins, BMAA, and others. Some spirulina supplements have been found to be contaminated with microcystins, albeit at levels below the limit set by the Oregon Health Department.  Microcystins can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and, in the long term, liver cancer. The effects of chronic exposure to even very low levels of microcystins are of concern, because of the potential risk of cancer.
These toxic compounds are not produced by spirulina itself,[tpl]cite journal|last=Belay|first=Amha|title=Spirulina (Arthrospira): Production and Quality Assurance|journal=Spirulina in Human Nutrition and Health, CRC Press|year=2008|pages=1–25|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Spirulina_in_Human_Nutrition_and_Health.html?id=Vz7SpjEsE3IC[/tpl] but may occur as a result of contamination of spirulina batches with other toxin-producing blue-green algae. Because spirulina is considered a dietary supplement in the U.S., there is no active, industry-wide regulation of its production and no enforced safety standards for its production or purity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gilroy, D., Kauffman, K., Hall, D., Huang, X., & Chu, F. | title = Assessing potential health risks from microcystin toxins in blue-green algae dietary supplements | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 435–439 | doi = 10.2307/3454384 | pmc = 1638057 | pmid = 10811570 | year = 2000 | jstor = 3454384 [/tpl] The U.S. National Institutes of Health describes spirulina supplements as "possibly safe", provided they are free of microcystin contamination, but "likely unsafe" (especially for children) if contaminated. Given the lack of regulatory standards in the U.S., some public-health researchers have raised the concern that consumers cannot be certain that spirulina and other blue-green algae supplements are free of contamination.
Heavy-metal contamination of spirulina supplements has also raised concern. The Chinese State Food and Drug Administration reported that lead, mercury, and arsenic contamination was widespread in spirulina supplements marketed in China.[tpl]cite news | work = Washington Post | title = China’s drug agency rejects state media claims of cover-up in lead found in health supplement |  url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-drug-agency-rejects-state-media-claims-of-tainted-spirulina-cover-up/2012/04/10/gIQAaEbt7S_story.html | date = April 10, 2012 | accessdate = April 23, 2012[/tpl]

====Safety issues for certain target groups====

Due to very high Vitamin K content, patients undergoing anticoagulant treatments should not change consumption patterns of spirulina without seeking medical advice to adjust the level of medication accordingly.
Like all protein-rich foods, spirulina contains the essential amino acid phenylalanine (2.6-4.1 g/100 g), which should be avoided by people who have phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from metabolizing phenylalanine, which then builds up in the brain, causing damage.[tpl]cite journal | author = Robb-Nicholson, C. | title = By the way, doctor | journal = Harvard Women's Health Watch | volume = 8 |  year = 2006 [/tpl]

===In vitro research===

The primary active component of spirulina is Phycocyanobilin, which constitutes about 1% of Spirulina by weight.[tpl]Cite pmid|11482785[/tpl][tpl]Cite pmid|18158824[/tpl] This compound inhibits NADPH oxidase.[tpl]Cite pmid|16129699[/tpl] Spirulina has been studied in vitro against HIV,Ayehunie, S. et al.

At present, these studies are considered preliminary. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, at present there is insufficient scientific evidence to recommend spirulina supplementation for any human condition, and more research is needed to clarify its benefits, if any.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/923.html | title = Blue-green algae | work = MedlinePlus | publisher = National Institutes of Health | date = July 6, 2011 | accessdate = October 4, 2011[/tpl]
