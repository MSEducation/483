"T'en va pas" ([tpl]lang-en|Don't Go[/tpl]) was the Swiss entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 1963. It was sung in French by Esther Ofarim.
The song performed tenth on the night (following Yugoslavia's Vice Vukov with "Brodovi" and preceding France's Alain Barrière with "Elle était si jolie"). At the close of the voting, the song had received 40 points, placing 2nd in a field of 16.
Controversially, after Norway had announced the votes, Katie Boyle (the presenter) said that she could not hear them and would return to them. However, everyone else did hear them. When Katie went back to Norway again the votes had been changed, thus changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to Norway's neighbours Denmark at Switzerland's expense. 
It was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1964 contest by Anita Traversi singing "I miei pensieri".
