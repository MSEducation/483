==History==

Airclic was founded in 2000. The company has gone through several shifts in strategic direction. It originally planned to use its technology to enable consumers with specially equipped mobile phones and handheld devices to scan bar codes in print ads and posters to get information and make purchases. Its proprietary bar codes were called “Scanlets.”
In its early days, the company announced ambitious partnerships with a variety of companies. At one point Motorola, Symbol Technologies, Connect Things and Airclic announced they would invest $500 million “to form a new company that will drive e-commerce growth through one-scan access to the Internet.”Motorola, Symbol Technologies, Connect Things and Airclic Form New Company to Drive the Growth of E-Commerce Through One-scan Ac – Symbol Technologies  A partnership with R.R.

After the Internet bubble burst the company regrouped, gradually shifting to its current focus on automating mobile and field processes for businesses. Its solutions still rely on bar codes and scanner-equipped mobile phones. Philadelphia Business Journal reports that "Airclic has grown its revenue tenfold over the past three years, from $1 million in 2004 to nearly $10 million last year 2007." Philadelphia Business Journal, Friday, September 26, 2008.
Until early 2010 the company was headquartered in Trevose, Pennsylvania, with operations in Bloomington, Minnesota. With the appointment of Rick Pontin as CEO in April 2010 the Bloomington office was closed and all operations were relocated to the headquarters location.
On July 13, 2010, Airclic announced it had merged with AirVersent, an $8.1 million company based in Owings Mills, Maryland. The Baltimore Sun reported the merger would create "a profitable company with revenue of $22 million a year."http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/technology/2010/07/post_2.html

===Funding===

It is unclear how much funding privately owned Airclic has received over the years, but news accounts and the company’s own communications would seem to put the figure at at least $340 million:

===Management===

Airclic has had a series of management shakeups since its founding. In March 2000 it announced a “management coup”[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_March 13/ai_60066480 | work=Business Wire | title=AirClic Unveils Revolutionary Technology And Announces Leadership Coup | date=2000-03-13[/tpl] in the appointment of David Klatt as CEO and Patrick Robinson as CFO. Both were former Black & Decker Corp. executives. AirClic’s chairman at the time was co-founder Peter Ritz. In August the company announced “the appointment of a stellar management team”—nine people in all.[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_August 2/ai_63814723 | work=Business Wire | title=Following Its Partnership with Motorola, Symbol Technologies and Ericsson's Connect Things, AirClic Continues to Drive Mobile Commerce Industry | date=2000-08-02[/tpl]
Months later, Klatt was lured away to become president of Rubbermaid.
