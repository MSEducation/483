==Etymology==

The word Nakhon originates from the Sanskrit word Nagara (Devanagari:  नगर) meaning city, and the word Nayok is sometimes described to be derive from Sanskrit Nāyaka (Devanagari:  नायक) meaning leader or captain. However in this connection, na means "of rice field" and yok means "exempted". Hence the name of the province literally means City of Tax-Free.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nakhonnayok.go.th/cms/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=2|publisher=จังหวัดนครนายก|title=ประวัติจังหวัดนครนายก|language=Thai| accessdate=2008-03-07[/tpl]

==Geography==

The northern part of the province is located in the Sankamphaeng Range, the southern prolongation of the Dong Phaya Yen mountain range, with the highest elevation the 1292 meter high Yod Khao Kiew. Most of that area is covered by the Khao Yai National Park. The central part of the province however is a rather flat river plain formed by the Nakhon Nayok River. The southern part of the province has relatively unfertile acidic soil.
The main river of the province is the Nakhon Nayok River. It joins the Prachinburi River at Pak Nam Yothaka in Amphoe Ban Sang, Prachinburi province, which then becomes the Bang Pa Kong River.
Wang Takhrai is a botanical garden belonging to the Chumphot - Phanthip Foundation. Located at the Wang Takhrai waterfall it is a popular place for tourists to visit. Several other waterfalls within the province are well known as touristical targets - Nangrong and the nine-leveled Sarika waterfall are located within the Khao Yai NP, and also the Lan Rak (or Tat Hin Kong) waterfall.

==History==

The city of Nakhon Nayok dates back to the Dvaravati kingdom, probably founded in the 11th century. Ruins from this time are visible at Mueang Boran Dong Lakhon south of the modern city. Originally named Mueang Lablae, the name Nakhon Nayok was assigned to it in 1350, when it became a garrison town of the Ayutthaya kingdom protecting the eastern boundary.
January 1, 1943 the government downgraded Nakhon Nayok Province and combined it with Prachinburi Province, except Ban Na district which became part of Saraburi Province.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=59|issue=77 ก|pages=2447–2449|title=พระราชบัญญัติยุบและรวมการปกครองบางจังหวัด พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๕|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2485/A/077/2447.PDF|format=PDF|date=December 10, 1942|language=Thai[/tpl] On May 9, 1946 the province was re-established.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=63|issue=29 ก|pages=315–317|title=พระราชบัญญัติจัดตั้งจังหวัดสมุทรปราการ จังหวัดนนทบุรี จังหวัดสมุทรสาคร และจังหวัดนครนายก พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๙|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2489/A/029/315.PDF|format=PDF|date=May 9, 1946|language=Thai[/tpl]
