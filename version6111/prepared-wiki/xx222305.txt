In 1975, he continued for the degree of M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford, the same college his father matriculated at in 1935,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/old-members/files/newsletters/newsletter3.pdf|title=page 6: "The donation was given in memory of Rowan Atkinson's father, Eric Atkinson, who matriculated at Queens in 1935."|format=PDF|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hoot.queens.ox.ac.uk/old-members/files/newsletters/newsletter8.pdf|title=queens iss 1|format=PDF|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] First winning national attention in the Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976, he had already written and performed early sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras – the revue group of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), meeting writer Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to collaborate during his career.

==Career==

===Radio===

Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1978 called The Atkinson People. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis, and produced by Griff Rhys Jones."Pick of the Day", The Guardian, 31 January 2007.

===Television===

After university, Atkinson toured with Angus Deayton as his straight man in an act that was eventually filmed for a television show. After the success of the show, he did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called Canned Laughter. Atkinson then went on to do Not the Nine O'Clock News for the BBC, produced by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.
The success of Not the Nine O'Clock News led to him taking the lead role in the medieval sitcom The Black Adder (1983), which he also co-wrote with Richard Curtis. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, this time written by Curtis and Ben Elton. Blackadder II (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the Elizabethan era. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels Blackadder the Third (1987) (set in the Regency era), and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989) (set in World War I). The Blackadder series became one of the most successful of all BBC situation comedies, spawning television specials including Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988), Blackadder: The Cavalier Years (1988), and later "Blackadder: Back & Forth" (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium.  
The final scene of "Blackadder Goes Forth" (when Blackadder and his men go "over the top" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as "bold and highly poignant".http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/  During the 2014 centennial of the start of World War I, Michael Gove and war historian Max Hastings have complained about the so-called "Blackadder version of history".http://www.historyextra.com/feature/blackadder-bad-first-world-war-historyhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25612369https://www.rusi.org/analysis/commentary/ref:C52D3C5B606225/#.U0lQ9tx18-A
Atkinson's other creation, the hapless Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day Buster Keaton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=atkinsonrow |title=Museum.tv |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] During this time, Atkinson appeared at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal in 1987 and 1989. Several sequels to Mr. Bean appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. Bean (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in Not the Nine O'Clock News. A second film, Mr. Bean's Holiday, was released in 2007. In 1995 and 1996, Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in The Thin Blue Line television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.
Atkinson has fronted campaigns for Kronenbourg,[tpl]cite web|author=mhm grax|url=http://mhmgrax.com/c_tvads.htm|title=Kronenbourg Commercial|publisher=Mhmgrax.com|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] Fujifilm, and Give Blood. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for Barclaycard, on which character his title role in Johnny English and Johnny English Reborn was based. He also starred in a comedy spoof of Doctor Who as the Doctor, for a "Red Nose Day" benefit. Atkinson appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on Top Gear in July 2011, driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2, placing him at the top of the leaderboard until Matt LeBlanc later recorded a 1:42.1 lap time.
Atkinson appeared at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of "Chariots of Fire", playing a repeated single note on synthesiser.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/07/27/london-olympics-2012-opening-ceremony-performance-mr-bean-chariots-of-fire/|title=Mr. Bean’s Hilarious ‘Chariots Of Fire’ Skit At Olympics|publisher=hollywoodlife.com|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012[/tpl] He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film of the same name (about the 1924 Summer Olympics), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a minicab and tripping the front runner.[tpl]cite news|title=Mr Bean's Olympic orchestral appearance|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19021660|publisher=BBC News|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]

===Retirement of Mr. Bean===

In November 2012 it emerged that the character of Mr. Bean was to be retired. "The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me – basically quite physical, quite childish – I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of," Atkinson told the Daily Telegraph's Review. "Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful."Victoria Ward "Rowan Atkinson suggests end is in sight for Mr Bean", telegraph.co.uk, 17 November 2012 He has also said that the role typecast him to a degree.Dominic Cavendish "Rowan Atkinson: Goodbye, Mr Bean?", telegraph.co.uk, 21 November 2012

===Film===

Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the 'unofficial' James Bond movie Never Say Never Again (1983) and a leading role in Dead on Time (also 1983) with Nigel Hawthorne. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film The Appointments of Dennis Jennings.  He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut The Tall Guy (1989) and appeared alongside Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling in Roald Dahl's The Witches (1990). He played the part of Dexter Hayman in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a parody of Rambo III, starring Charlie Sheen.
Atkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and featured in Disney's The Lion King (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the Red-billed Hornbill. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including Rat Race (2001), Scooby-Doo (2002), Love Actually (2003) and the crime comedy Keeping Mum (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Patrick Swayze.
In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with Bean (1997) to international success. A sequel, Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007) also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody Johnny English (2003) and its sequel, Johnny English Reborn (2011).

===Theatre===

Rowan Atkinson did live on-stage skits – also appearing with members of Monty Python – in The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) for the British section of Amnesty International.
In 1984 he appeared in a West End version of the comedy play The Nerd alongside a 10 year old Christian Bale.[tpl]Cite web | url =  http://www.thespiannet.com/actors/B/bale_christian/christian_bale.shtml | title = CHRISTIAN BALE - Screenshots and Info for Actor Christian Bale[/tpl]
The Sneeze and Other Stories, seven short Anton Chekhov plays, translated and adapted by Michael Frayn, were performed by Rowan Atkinson, Timothy West and Cheryl Campbell at the Aldwych Theatre, London in 1988 and early 1989.
On 28 November 2012 Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the "We are Most Amused" comedy gala for the Prince's Trust at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.
In 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by Richard Eyre) of the Simon Gray play Quartermaine's Terms at Wyndham's Theatre in London with costars Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones) and Felicity Montagu (I'm Alan Partridge).
At the end of 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre.  A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720

==Comic style==

Best known for his use of physical comedy in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more heavily on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely deadpan delivery.
One of his better-known comic devices is over-articulation of the "B" sound, such as his pronunciation of "Bob" in the Blackadder II episode "Bells". Atkinson suffers from a stammer,[tpl]cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007[/tpl] and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.
Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of Buster Keaton, sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called "the man with the rubber face": comedic reference was made to this in an episode of Blackadder the Third ("Sense and Senility"), in which Baldrick (Tony Robinson) refers to his master, Mr. E. Blackadder, as a "lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard".

===Politics===

In June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the UK's most prominent actors and writers, including Nicholas Hytner, Stephen Fry, and Ian McEwan, to the British Parliament in an attempt to force a review of the controversial Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535556.ece|title=Rowan Atkinson leads crusade against religious hatred Bill|last=Freeman|first=Simon|date=20 June 2005|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=22 September 2009 [/tpl]

It is a reaction to several recent high-profile arrests, which Atkinson sees as a restriction of freedom of expression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://reformsection5.org.uk/2012/10/rowan-atkinsons-speech-at-rs5-parliamentary-reception|title=Rowan Atkinson's address to the Reform Section 5 parliamentary reception|date= 16 October 2012 |publisher=reformsection5.org.uk|accessdate=21 October 2012[/tpl]

===Cars===

With an estimated wealth of approximately £85 million, Atkinson is able to indulge his passion for cars that began with driving his mother's Morris Minor around the family farm. He has written for the British magazines Car, Octane, Evo, and "SuperClassics", a short-lived UK magazine, in which he reviewed the McLaren F1 in 1995.
Atkinson holds a category C+E (formerly 'Class 1') lorry driving licence, gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned The Driven Man, a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=42187|work=The New York Times|title=Rowan Atkinson: The Driven Man – Trailer – Cast – Showtimes|first=Manohla|last=Dargis|date=7 February 2005[/tpl] A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver Henry Birkin in the television play Full Throttle in 1995.
Atkinson has raced in other cars, including a Renault 5 GT Turbo for two seasons for its one make series. He owns a McLaren F1, which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near Garstang, Lancashire with an Austin Metro in October 1999.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/485692.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Mr Bean crashes sports car|date=27 October 1999[/tpl] It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree.[tpl]cite news|last=Dunning|first=Craig|title=Mr Bean and Blackadder star Rowan Atkinson in hospital after McLaren F1 supercar crash|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 August 2011|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/story-e6freuy9-1226109003161|accessdate =5 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/news/cambridgeshire_tv_star_rowan_atkinson_in_hospital_following_crash_1_985153|title= Update: TV star Rowan Atkinson in hospital following Cambridgeshire crash|work= Evening Star[/tpl] He has previously owned a Honda NSX.

The Conservative Party politician Alan Clark, himself a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published Diaries a chance meeting with a man he later realised was Atkinson while driving through Oxfordshire in May 1984: "Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red DBS V8 Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat." Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his Rolls-Royce to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: "he didn't sparkle, was rather disappointing and chétif."Alan Clark Diaries (Phoenix, 1993) p. 80
One car Atkinson has said he will not own is a Porsche: "I have a problem with Porsches. They're wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people – and I wish them no ill – are not, I feel, my kind of people. I don't go around saying that Porsches are a pile of dung, but I do know that psychologically I couldn't handle owning one."[tpl]cite news|last=Wormald|first=Andrew|coauthors=Benjamin Atkinson|title=Stars & their Cars:Rowan Atkinson|page=1|publisher=MSN|date=6 October 2005|url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147861295|accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/atkinsonrow/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl]
