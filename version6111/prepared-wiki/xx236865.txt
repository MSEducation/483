Plain Jane is the fifth studio album by singer/songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. The album was released on October 13, 2009, in Canada, and was Kreviazuk's first release through Maple Music Recordings.

==Background==

Named after the track "Plain Jane", the title reflects Kreviazuk's feelings about living a double life. Splitting time between her native Canada and the United States, Kreviazuk lives a mostly anonymous life in California primarily as a working mother, while she leads a more public life in Canada as an established and recognizable singer songwriter.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/chantalkreviazuk|title=Chantal Kreviazuk on MySpace Music|accessdate=October 17, 2009|publisher=Fox Interactive Media|work=MySpace|date=June 18, 2009[/tpl]
The song "5000 Days" is considered by Kreviazuk to be a continuation of her 1999 Colour Moving and Still track "Until We Die".

==Album information==

Plain Jane features a guest appearance by jazz musician Chris Botti on the title track, performing on the trumpet. Kreviazuk previously made a guest appearance on Botti's 2003 album A Thousand Kisses Deep, providing vocals for the track "The Look of Love".
The closing track, "Na Miso", contains lyrics in an African language(Swahili) about connecting with loved ones. The song was written by and features vocals from Kreviazuk and Bibiane Mpoyo, a nanny of the family.
Two bonus tracks were available through the iTunes Store. "Backfires" can be purchased with the iTunes version of the album, while "Seclusion" was available only through the pre-order of the album.
