The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harris's contemporary, Peter Bonetti, who made 729 appearances (1959–79). With 103 caps (101 while at the club), Frank Lampard of England is Chelsea's most capped international player.

==Ownership and finances==

Chelsea Football Club was founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendents continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.[tpl]cite web |title=UK Football Clubs on the UK Stock Markets |url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_turnover_09.htm |publisher=Football Economy |accessdate=26 June 2012[/tpl] In July 2003, Roman Abramovich purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30 million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140 million takeover.

==Popular culture==

In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football films, The Great Game. One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=120–121[/tpl] Owing to the notoriety of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films about football hooliganism, including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od juče made an episode in which Chelsea plays against FK Sutjeska Nikšić for qualification of the UEFA Champions League.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nijesmomiodjuce.com/nijesmo-mi-od-juce-novosti/epizoda-chelsea-u-gledajte-onlajn-sekciji/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130830104319/http://www.nijesmomiodjuce.com/nijesmo-mi-od-juce-novosti/epizoda-chelsea-u-gledajte-onlajn-sekciji/|archivedate=30 August 2013|title= Nijesmo mi od Juce – Novosti – Epizode – Chelsea u "gledajte onlajn" sekciji|publisher=nijesmomiodjuce.com|accessdate=23 April 2014|language=Montenegrin[/tpl]YouTube – Chelsea – Nijesmo mi od juče
Up until the 1950s, the club had a long-running association with the music halls, with their underachievement often providing material for comedians such as George Robey. It culminated in comedian Norman Long's release of a comic song in 1933, ironically titled "On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup", the lyrics of which describe a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day when Chelsea finally won a trophy.
The song "Blue is the Colour" was released as a single in the build-up to the 1972 League Cup Final, with all members of Chelsea's first team squad singing; it reached number five in the UK Singles Chart. (The song was later adopted, as an anthem, by the Vancouver Whitecaps in Canada, after being changed to "White is the Colour".) In the build-up to the 1997 FA Cup Final, the song "Blue Day", performed by Suggs and members of the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK charts. Bryan Adams, a fan of Chelsea, dedicated the song "We're Gonna Win" from the album 18 Til I Die to the club.
