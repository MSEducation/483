In physics, the correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of quantum mechanics (or by the old quantum theory) reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers.  In other words, it says that for large orbits and for large energies, quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations.[tpl]cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Paul|last2=Llewellyn|first2=Ralph|title=Modern Physics|edition=5|year=2008|publisher=W.

The principle was formulated by Niels Bohr in 1920,[ref]
