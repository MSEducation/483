Mossend is a town on the A775, in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, to the east of its sister town Bellshill, and to the west of the large town of Motherwell.
The town is the site of a major railway freight terminal. The yard is primarily used by DB Schenker Rail (UK) formerly EWS. Mossend formed around the steel industry, with Clydesdale Steel Works once dominating the east end of the town.

==Early Map References==

Mossend first appears on an early Timothy Pont map at the end of the 16th century as Mossid (Moss-Side), but the name most likely 
originates from the area being at the end of Moss land.
Mining is the reason why the town began to expand. The arrival of Iron and Steel working industry and the attendant railway put Mossend on the map.
It is also home to the famous Mossend Football Club, a local community football club for children from the age of 6 to 21 years old.
