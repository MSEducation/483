[[Mazurkas, Op. 6 (Chopin)]]

CATEGORIES: Mazurkas by Frédéric Chopin

The Mazurkas, Op. 6 contained four of the first mazurkas that Chopin published.

==No. 1 in F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] minor==

This mazurka uses Polish folk rhythms and modes, and has a metronome mark of 132, making it one of the slower Chopin mazurkas. The Mazurka starts with a piano section, in which the central theme is stated, which revolves around oscillating triplets and heavy accents on the third beat of each bar. A second theme is then stated fortissimo, in a passage full of sforzandos and wedge accents. The original theme is then stated forte, but quickly decrescendos.  These two passages end with repeats.
A third theme is then introduced as an ostinato under a thundering accompaniment featuring a grace note before every chord. There is use of the Lydian mode, and the accents are even heavier than in the second section. After several percussion chords, the first theme is returned to, and the piece gradually dies away. 
It is of moderate difficulty; according to the ABRSM music grading system, it is graded as a grade 7. 
The piece is dedicated to the Grafin Pauline Plater.

==No. 2 in C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] minor==

The second mazurka of the set, in C-sharp minor, is faster than the previous one, with a more lively theme.

==No. 3 in E major==

The third mazurka of the set, in E major, features a happier theme than the rest, with a "waltz-esque" rhythm.

==No. 4 in E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] minor==

The final mazurka in E-flat minor is the shortest one of the set. The mazurka features a repeating theme.
