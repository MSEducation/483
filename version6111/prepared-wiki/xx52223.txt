[[Supercompact cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In set theory, a supercompact cardinal is a type of large cardinal.  They display a variety of reflection properties.

==Formal definition==

If λ is any ordinal, κ is λ-supercompact means that there exists an elementary embedding j from the universe V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ, j(κ)>λ and 
That is, M contains all of its λ-sequences.  Then κ is supercompact means that it is λ-supercompact for all ordinals λ.
Alternatively, an uncountable cardinal κ is supercompact if for every A such that |A| ≥ κ there exists a normal measure over A, in the following sense.  
A is defined as follows:

==Properties==

Supercompact cardinals have reflection properties. If a cardinal with some property (say a 3-huge cardinal) that is witnessed by a structure of limited rank exists above a supercompact cardinal κ, then a cardinal with that property exists below κ. For example, if κ is supercompact and the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds below κ then it holds everywhere because a bijection between the powerset of ν and a cardinal at least ν++ would be a witness of limited rank for the failure of GCH at ν so it would also have to exist below κ.
Finding a canonical inner model for supercompact cardinals is one of the major problems of inner model theory.
