==History==

The Dinah Shore Weekend was named after the late Dinah Shore – a singer, TV personality and renowned golfer born Frances Rose Shore in 1916, who lived in the Coachella Valley and is credited for having founded in Palm Springs the Colgate-Dinah Shore Winner's Circle. The Dinah now coincides with the Kraft Nabisco Championship women’s golf tournament. The first unofficial Dinah Shore Weekend took place in 1986 when women began to flock to Palm Springs in conjunction with the tournament. After-dinner parties following the golfing turned benefits for the Human Rights Campaign and the AIDS Service Foundation.
The first Dinah Shore Weekend was produced in 1991 by Mariah Hanson under her Club Skirts Presents The Dinah Marquee at the Palm Springs Art Museum.[tpl]cn|date=March 2012[/tpl]
In 2006 Guinevere Turner featured the event in the TV documentary A Lez in Wonderland (original title: Broute-minou à Palm Springs).[tpl]imdb title|id=0896793|title=A Lez in Wonderland[/tpl]
