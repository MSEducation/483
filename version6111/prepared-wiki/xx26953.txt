Charles Archibald "Archie" Hahn (September 14, 1880 – January 21, 1955) was a American track athlete and one of the best sprinters in the early 20th century.
Having won sprint events at the 1903 American and Canadian championships, Hahn—born in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, but running for the University of Michigan—was among the favorites at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, which was poorly attended by European athletes. 
In the first event at those Games, the 60 m, Hahn benefited from his quick start and won, making him a favorite for the remaining events he was entered in, the 100 m and 200 m. His run in the 200 m final delivered him the gold and a good time, although the latter was flattered, because the race was run on a straight course. In his third event, he again outclassed the field, thus winning all sprint events.
In 1906, the "Milwaukee Meteor" repeated his Olympic 100 m victory in Athens, a feat not equalled until 1988, when Carl Lewis won the 100 m twice in a row (albeit after disqualification of Ben Johnson).
After his running career, Hahn became a coach and wrote the classic book How to Sprint.  He coached track and number of other sports at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois, Whitman College, Brown University, Michigan, Princeton University, and the University of Virginia.[ref][tpl]cite news |last=Galliford |first=Walt |date=April 5, 1943 |title=Archie Hahn—Little Man With Big Stride |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1807&dat=19430405&id=Gg4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AWkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6618,2739141 |newspaper=The Cavalier Daily |location= |publisher= |accessdate=February 24, 2014 [/tpl]

Hahn was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1959.  He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1984 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.
