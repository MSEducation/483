Humberside Collegiate Institute is a public high school located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It serves the Bloor West Village, Baby Point, High Park North and Junction neighbourhoods.  Humberside was established in 1892 and has an academic program for students in grades 9 through 12.  In addition to the regular curriculum, the school has a strong music program, as well as an Extended French and French Immersion program. It is a non-semestered school, meaning that the students take all eight of their classes through the entire academic year (with the exception of Civics/Careers in grade ten  which switches in January).
Humberside's motto is "Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas", a Latin phrase from Virgil's work Georgics, meaning "Happy is the person who has been able to learn the reasons for things".[tpl]cite web|title=Principal's Message|url=http://www.tdsb.on.ca/SchoolWeb/Humberside/docs/NOV.NEWSLETTER.pdf|work=November 2009 Newsletter|publisher=Toronto District School Board|accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]

==History==

Humberside was established in 1892 as "Toronto Junction High School" in the basement of the local Presbyterian church.  It moved to the current site in 1894 with the construction of a new building. In 1903, the school was renamed "Humberside Collegiate Institute", after a local street that runs west from Dundas Street West, past Keele Street to the school's main entrance. During World War I, many students lost their lives in battle. The front entrance is now a memorial to those who lost their lives, and for quite some time, it was not allowed to be used, until recently. Names were added to the memorial after World War II . The school's yearbook, Hermes, was established in 1925. Since 2002, it has included a DVD to go along with it, called Video Hermes. The student council was formed in 1931, and three decades later, the school held its first formal dance.
1966 saw major renovations to the school. A new north wing was opened, which houses the science laboratories. A new library was also constructed, as well as a new structure at the back which housed the (then) new auditorium, and music facilities. In 1972, Humberside became one of the first schools to introduce computers as part of the curriculum. Extended French and French Immersion programs were introcuded in 1980 and 1983, respectively. Humberside celebrated its centennial in 1992. The school was used in the filming of the TV movie Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life in 2005.
In 2005, Mel Greif retired after thirty years of teaching history and geography. He won multiple awards including the Jane Jacobs Prize and the Governor General of Canada Award of Excellence.http://www.e-mediakits.com/gghistoryaward2001/Mel_Greif_holding_GG_Award_in_front_of_Rideau_Hall.htm.
