Norsk Bane is a Norwegian limited company that is working on plans to build a high-speed railway throughout large portions of Norway. The company has developed detailed plans for numerous lines and claims they would be able to build and operate a high-speed network in Norway, if granted permission. Norsk Bane operates in the twilight between the roles as a commercial investment company, an interest organization and a consulting company. The company is owned by municipalities, counties and other local forces in western Norway, and is mainly a lobbyist organization.
