==Station overview==

The station is a three-level, underground structure with two island platforms and seven exits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.sdpo.dorts.gov.tw/paper_gln/3th/stuff2.htm|title=第二章 土木，建築，水環、軌道|publisher=Department of Rapid Transit Systems|accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl] The two platforms are stacked on top of one another, allowing for cross-platform interchange. The washrooms are outside the entrance area. The station is situated under Roosevelt Road, between Nanhai Road, Linsen South Road, and Aiguo East Road.
When completed in 2013, the station will be a transfer station with the Songshan Line. It is also a planned terminus for the Wanda-Shulin Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.dorts.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=205658&ctNode=19582&mp=115002|title=Second Stage of Taipei MRT (Approved MRT Routes)|publisher=Department of Rapid Transit Systems|date=2010-03-12|accessdate=2010-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/01/10/2003463114|title=President promotes plans to build Wanda MRT line|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2010-01-10|accessdate=2010-11-22[/tpl]

===Public art===

The station is home to several public art pieces. By the escalators connecting the two platform levels, a piece titled "Metamorphosis" displays a holographic flight trajectory of a paper plane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.dorts.gov.tw/english/Humanity/PublicArt/Guide_Xindian.asp|title=Public Art on the Xindian Line|publisher=Department of Rapid Transit Systems|accessdate=2010-12-06[/tpl] Along some of the entrance hallways, "Musical Skies" shows light boxes with images clouds in a blue sky. On the upper platform in "Platform, Stage", elements from Taiwanese folk arts and Chinese opera have been transformed into abstract elements and minimized into two curtains of lines and flat surfaces.
