Cambridge Parnells is a Gaelic football club in the city of Cambridge, England.

==History==

The history of the club is a short one. The club was formed in April 2006 by two students at University of Cambridge. However the club re-establishes Gaelic games in the city after the presence of Cambridge Harps, a team that competed up until the late 1980s.
