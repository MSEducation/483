[[1988 Giro d'Italia]]

CATEGORIES: 1988 in cycle racing, 1988 in Italian sport, Giro d'Italia

The 1988 Giro d'Italia was the 71st edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Urbino on 23 May with a [tpl]convert|9|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial and concluded in Vittorio Veneto with a [tpl]convert|43|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial on 12 June. Twenty teams entered the race, which was won by American Andrew Hampsten of the [tpl]ct|MOT|1988[/tpl] team. Second and third respectively were Dutchman Erik Breukink and Swiss rider, Urs Zimmermann. It was the third time – and the second year in succession – in the history of the Giro, that the podium was occupied solely by non-Italian riders. Breukink had been part of the non-Italian podium in 1987, behind Ireland's Stephen Roche and Great Britain's Robert Millar.
Hampsten first gained the race lead after the famed fourteenth stage, which crossed the Gavia Pass towards Bormio, and where the riders battled against a snowstorm, strong winds, and muddy roads. Beforehand, the overall classification had been headed for several days by Massimo Podenzana. He had participated in a breakaway during stage 4a, which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's maglia rosa ([tpl]lang-en|pink jersey[/tpl]) for more than a week. Franco Chioccioli also wore the pink jersey for a two-stage period, before Hampsten took the lead. After stage 14, Hampsten began to build up a solid two-minute barrier against the second-placed rider, Breukink. This gap was sufficient to win Hampsten the race, despite losing around twenty seconds in the final two stages.
Hampsten became the first American, and non-European, to win the Giro. He also won the secondary mountains and combination classifications, as well as the special sprints classification In the other classifications, Fanini-Seven Up rider Stefano Tomasini of Italy placed ninth overall to finish as the best neo-professional in the general classification; Johan van der Velde of the GIS-Ecoflam-Jolly team was the winner of the points classification, and [tpl]ct|CAR|1988[/tpl] finished as the winners of the team classification.

From the 180 riders that began this edition, 125 made it to the finish in Vittorio Veneto.
The teams entering the race were:[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/05/27/pagina-36/1174931/pdf.html|title=Pondenza: Un Hombre de Paja Vestido de Rosa|language=Spanish|date=27 May 1988|page=36|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Pondenza: A Man of Straw Pink Dress[/tpl]

==Pre-race favorites==

The starting peloton of 180 riders did not include the 1987 winner, Stephen Roche, who was sidelined for the majority of the 1988 season with a knee injury.[tpl]cite news|author=Gino Sala|url=http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&file=/archivio/uni_1988_05/19880523_0025.pdf&query=|title=Ma al Giro mancheranno gli italiani|language=Italian|date=23 May 1988|page=25|newspaper=l'Unità|publisher=PCI|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=However Italians will miss the Giro[/tpl] Many riders were named as contenders, including Andrew Hampsten, Urs Zimmermann, Erik Breukink, Franco Chioccioli, and Pedro Delgado. Jean-François Bernard came into the Giro in great shape and l'Unità writer Gino Sala believed that the French rider could win the race if he could do well in the time trials and the mountains. In addition, Bernard Hinault told him that if he could do well in this edition of the Giro, he could one day lead a team in the Tour de France. Former Giro champion Gianni Motta approached Hampsten before the race and told him that he would win because of the efforts he expected Hampsten to put forth on the Gavia Pass.[tpl]sfn|Hildenbrand|2008|p=80[/tpl] Motta believed that Hampsten would excel on the Gavia Pass, while the Italian riders — who composed most of the peloton — would not because they did not realize the difficulty of the stage.[tpl]sfn|Hildenbrand|2008|p=80[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Phinney|Murphy|2011|p=171[/tpl] The 1986 Tour de France winner Greg LeMond entered the race with his [tpl]ct|PDM|1988[/tpl] squad, coming off from a cycling break as a result of injuries sustained in a hunting accident. Due to this, most did not see him as a front-runner for the overall victory. Swiss rider Tony Rominger also partook in the race and was considered by some as a dark-horse candidate for the victory after experiencing success at the beginning of his season.
During the presentation of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory. Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders, but Delgado, Hampsten, and LeMond also received many votes. Many media outlets felt that the overall victory would likely go to a non-Italian rider.
Guido Bontempi was seen by some newspapers as a favorite to win a couple of stages. Before he injured his right knee, many newspapers also believed Moreno Argentin to be a favorite to take several stages.[tpl]cite news|author=Curzio Maltese|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,28/articleid,0959_02_1988_0126_0028_25013186/anews,true/|title=Visentini contro gli stranieri |language=Italian|date=23 May 1988|page=28|newspaper=Stampa Sera|publisher=Editrice La Stampa|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Visentini against foreigners[/tpl] Stampa Sera writer Curzio Maltese believed that Flavio Giupponi could take one of the stages containing many categorized climbs, if properly supported by his team Del Tongo.

==Route and stages==

The route for the 1988 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani, on 5 March 1988.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/03/06/pagina-44/1453782/pdf.html#|title=Lemond, Alcala y Hampsten, Frente a Los Italianos|language=Spanish|date=6 March 1988|page=44|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Lemond, Hampsten Alcala, Face Italians[/tpl] It contained four time trial events, three of which were individual and one a team event. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the last day, would keep the race hotly contested to the end. There were fourteen stages containing categorized climbs, of which four had summit finishes: stage 6, to Campitello Matese;[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/05/28/pagina-37/1175363/pdf.html|title=Visentini: "Los Problemas de Roche No me Interesan"|language=Spanish|date=28 May 1988|page=37|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Visentini: "I'm not interested in Roche problems"[/tpl] stage 12, to Selvino;[tpl]sfn|Dzierzak|2007|p=121[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/03/pagina-40/1179873/pdf.html|title=Una Semana Para No Dormir|language=Spanish|date=3 June 1988|page=40|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=A Week To Keep You Awake[/tpl] stage 13, to Chiesa in Valmalenco;[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/04/pagina-39/1181830/pdf.html|title=Don Vicenzo, A Su Aire|language=Spanish|date=4 June 1988|page=39|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Don Vincenzo, Your Air[/tpl] and stage 15, to Merano 2000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/06/pagina-47/1175461/pdf.html|title=El Gavia Escribe La Historia|language=Spanish|date=6 June 1988|page=47|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Gavia Writes History[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=G.

The eleventh stage was cancelled due to protests near the finish line.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/03/pagina-39/1179872/pdf.html|title=Una Etapa Para Nada|language=Spanish|date=3 June 1988|page=39|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=A Stage For Nothing[/tpl] The fifteenth stage was originally intended to be [tpl]convert|132|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] and scheduled to start in Bormio.

Excluding the finish on the Merano 2000, the stage was relatively flat after the adjustments.
In previous years, the organizers had made the race easier for the Italian favorites by disregarding some of the harder climbs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/20130510/andy-hampsten-1988-giro-ditalia/#all|title=During a snowy stage of the '88 Giro, Andy Hampsten rode into history|author=Austin Murphy|date=13 May 2013|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl] With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many of the storied climbs of old, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling prosper. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [tpl]ct|MOT|1988[/tpl] rider Bob Roll said "Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year." Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could be a source of some sparks.[tpl]cite news|author=Gino Sala|url=http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&file=/archivio/uni_1988_03/19880306_0028.pdf&query=|title=Corsa da (un uomo solo al comando)|language=Italian|date=6 March 1988|page=28|newspaper=l'Unità|publisher=PCI|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Route of (a man in command)[/tpl] La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but containing only one flaw in that the race did not finish in any major Italian cities. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo, and Gavia mountain passes.

==Race overview==

The Giro began with a short [tpl]convert|9|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] time trial in the city of Urbino, which was won by Bernard with a three-second margin over Rominger. Bernard held the maglia rosa for three days, before losing it to Massimo Podenzana.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/05/24/pagina-41/1180753/pdf.html|title=Bernard: Quien Da Primero...|language=Spanish|date=24 May 1988|page=41|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Bernard: Who Gives First...[/tpl] Bontempi won the second stage and moved to third overall, while Bernard gained a five-second buffer over the second-placed rider, Rominger.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/05/25/pagina-38/1180810/pdf.html|title=Bontempi: Tipicamente Italiano|language=Spanish|date=25 May 1988|page=38|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Bontempi: Typically Italian[/tpl] In stage 4a Podenzana soloed to victory in Rodi Garganico, five minutes ahead of the second place finisher. This victory and the respective time bonus allowed Podenzana to gain the maglia rosa, which he held until stage 12. Stage 4b was a team time trial that stretched [tpl]convert|40|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl]; it was won by Del Tongo, eleven seconds ahead of [tpl]ct|CAR|1988[/tpl]. Podenzana's lead shrunk to a little over two minutes after his team, Atala-Ofmega, finished two minutes and thirty-six seconds later than Del Tongo.
The eleventh stage was run without a problem until the final mile, where environmentalist protestors occupied the finish line and forced the annulment of the stage. The protestors were upset with a nearby factory, owned by chemical manufacturer Montedison, which had been polluting the Bormida river.[tpl]cite news|author=Fulvio Lavina|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,1/articleid,0960_01_1988_0116_0038_13014775/|title=Bormio, proteste al Giro|language=Italian|date=3 June 1988|page=38|newspaper=La Stampa|publisher=Editrice La Stampa|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Bormio, protests the Tour[/tpl] The next stage saw the appearance of the major mountains and the maglia rosa bearer changing from Pondenzana to Chioccioli.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/04/pagina-38/1181829/pdf.html|title=Delgado Se Dejo Ver|language=Spanish|date=4 June 1988|page=38|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Delgado showed himself[/tpl] The ensuing stages saw the general classification shift more frequently due to the intensity of the mountains and the fatigue setting in.
The fourteenth stage was memorable for its extreme weather, most notably on the final climb of the Gavia Pass.[tpl]cite news|author=John Wilcockson|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/05/road/andy-hampsten-and-the-1988-pink-jersey-part-1_76639|title=Andy Hampsten and the 1988 Pink Jersey: Part 1|date=26 May 2008|page=1 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=11 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/giro-ditalia-anglophone-invasion |title=Giro d'Italia: Anglophone Invasion |author=Peter Hymas |date=4 May 2011 |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=13 July 2013[/tpl] Overnight, a large amount of snow had accumulated on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders.[tpl]sfn|Dzierzak|2007|p=122[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Phinney|Murphy|2011|p=172[/tpl] Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided to go through with the stage.[tpl]sfn|Dzierzak|2007|p=122[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Phinney|Murphy|2011|p=172[/tpl] As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Breukink, who eventually caught and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=/riders/2008/interviews/giro_hampsten08 |title=Cold comfort: Hampsten's day on the Gavia |author=Jason Sumner |date=29 May 2008|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=13 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Phinney|Murphy|2011|p=176[/tpl]
The start of the fifteenth stage was moved ahead from Bormio to Spondigna because of snow covering the Stevio Pass; the summit finish in Merano was maintained.[tpl]cite news|author=John Wilcockson|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2012/05/news/from-the-pages-of-velo-hampstens-giro-i-was-so-happy-to-survive_221346|title=From the pages of Velo: Hampsten's Giro: 'I was so happy to survive'|date=27 May 2012|page=1 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2012[/tpl] As soon as the climb started, Bernard, Zimmermann and Chioccioli jumped off the front. Bernard eventually shook the other two riders and won the stage, but with minimal time gain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/07/pagina-39/1175521/pdf.html|title=Una Raza Especial|language=Spanish|date=7 June 1988|page=39|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=A Special Breed[/tpl] The sixteenth stage was marked by rain – which turned into snow as the peloton rose higher – and by two protests while climbing the Rombo Pass. Near the summit of the last climb, Hampsten and a few others formed an escape group that was eventually caught in the final kilometers. The group rolled into Innsbruck, while Franco Vona made a last minute attack that won him the stage.
The eighteenth stage would prove critical in deciding the overall winner of the Giro, as it was an [tpl]convert|18|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial that lead up a mountain.[tpl]sfn|Dzierzak|2007|p=123[/tpl] The route started off with [tpl]convert|5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of flat roads, before the climb to the finish at the Vetriolo Terme ski station.[tpl]cite news|author=John Wilcockson|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/05/road/inside-cycling-andy-hampsten-and-the-1988-pink-jersey-part-3_76769|title=Inside Cycling: Andy Hampsten and the 1988 pink jersey, part 3|date=30 May 2008|page=1 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=14 August 2011[/tpl] Going into the stage, Hampsten led the race by 42 seconds over Breukink,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/american-giro-ditalia-stage-winners |title=American Giro d'Italia stage winners |author=Peter Hymas |date=5 May 2009 |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=13 July 2013[/tpl] a margin that was increased by a further 32 seconds after the time trial.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1988/06/10/pagina-36/1177576/pdf.html|title=Hampsten Se Aseguro El Triunfo En Un Dia "Loco"|language=Spanish|date=10 June 1988|page=36|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo S.A.|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Hampsten Clinched Victory In A "Crazy" Day[/tpl] The nineteenth stage featured three categorized climbs. Zimmermann attacked on the first climb, the Duran Pass, and remained out in front for the whole stage. However, he was later caught by Stefano Giuliani, who bridged the gap to Zimmermann from a chase group, on the descent of the Duran. Although Giuliani won the stage, Zimmermann moved into second place overall after gaining over three minutes on the general classification contenders.
The twentieth stage came down to a sprint finish won by Paolo Rosola, who was later disqualified as his teammate, Roberto Pagnin, was found to have pushed him during the sprint. As a result, the second place finisher, Alessio Di Basco, was awarded the stage victory. The penultimate stage was completely flat and culminated in a bunch sprint, won by Urs Freuler. Hours later, the final stage – a hilly [tpl]convert|43|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial – took place. The weather conditions were fine for the majority of the riders, but as the general classification contenders were on the course, lightning began to strike and rain began to pour.[tpl]sfn|Dzierzak|2007|p=123[/tpl] There was a tricky descent about 18 km into the stage, which became more dangerous with the rain, ultimately resulting in the crashes of Giupponi and Zimmerman.[tpl]cite news|author=John Wilcockson|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/05/road/hampsten-and-the-1988-pink-jersey-part-4_76790|title=Hampsten and the 1988 Pink Jersey: Part 4|date=30 May 2008|page=1 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=14 August 2011[/tpl] The time lost by Zimmermann cost him his second place overall. Lech Piasecki, who rode the course when dry, won the stage by a wide margin.

===Doping===

The organization performed anti-doping controls throughout the race.[tpl]cite news|author=Curzio Maltese|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,29/articleid,0960_02_1988_0143_0030_25019349/|title=Un'odissea fra archi, neve, sit-in e doping |language=Italian|date=13 June 1988|page=30|newspaper=Stampa Sera|publisher=Editrice La Stampa|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=An odyssey between arches, snow, sit-ins and doping[/tpl] Riders would be selected for testing after a stage and the results would be returned roughly between thirty minutes and one hour. No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would be applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a one-month suspension, and a fine of a thousand francs.

==Classification leadership==

Five different jerseys were awarded in the 1988 Giro d'Italia. For the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – the leader received a pink jersey.[tpl]cite web|author=Laura Weislo|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=/features/2008/giro_classifications08|title=Giro d'Italia classifications demystified|date=13 May 2008|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=13 July 2013[/tpl] This classification was considered the most important of the race, and its winner was considered the winner of the Giro.
There was also a points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. In this classification, cyclists got points for finishing a stage in the top 15. In addition, extra points could be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this classification, points were won by reaching the top of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded even more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was supposed to be the Stelvio Pass, however the day the Giro was supposed to climb it, a heavy snow cover forced the organization to skip the mountain pass from the stage route. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification. This ranking was decided the same way as the general classification, but only neo-professional cyclists – those in their first three years of professional racing – were eligible.
The combination classification, represented by a blue jersey, was calculated by summing up the points obtained by each rider in the other classifications; the leader was the rider with the lowest total of points.[tpl]cite news|author=Richard Pestes|url=http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/?pg=fullstory&id=5499|title=Giro 1988: Andy's Epic Day|date=1 December 2007|page=|work=PezCycling News|publisher=Pez|accessdate=27 May 2012[/tpl]
Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.
