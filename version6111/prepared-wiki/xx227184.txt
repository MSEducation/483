Treximet (formerly known as Trexima) is a medication manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and POZEN Pharmaceutical Development Company for the treatment of migraines.http://www.treximet.com/

==Active ingredients==

It combines 85 mg of sumatriptan (as the succinate), a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1 (5-HT1) receptor subtype agonist and 500 mg of naproxen sodium, a member of the arylacetic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in one tablet.http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2008/2008_us_pressrelease_10034.htmhttp://www.treximet.com/about/migraine-pain-relief.html
This drug has a unique RT formulation that allows for the rapid disintegration of the sumatriptan, but it does not affect the disintegration of the naproxen sodium component.
It targets nerves and blood vessels believed to trigger a migraine and relieves the inflammation that can cause migraine pain.
In clinical trials, Treximet provided a significantly greater percentage of patients migraine pain relief at two hours compared to sumatriptan 85 mg or naproxen sodium 500 mg alone. In addition, Treximet provided more patients sustained migraine pain relief from two to 24 hours compared to the individual components.
Sumatriptan is also available in the United States as an inexpensive generic prescription medicine, while naproxen is also inexpensive and over the counter. Many doctors and pharmacists saw the addition of a simple over the counter pain reliever to sumatriptan, and the subsequent marketing of Treximet as a "new" product, with a price of over $200 for 9 tablets, as a cynical ploy by GlaxoSmithKline to continue making brand-name profits when its patent for sumatriptan expired.

==Clinical trials==

During clinical trials Treximet performed better than placebo and better than the single ingredients by themselves. Treximet provided lasting relief in some cases for 24 hours. Treximet was also effective in reducing symptoms of migraines, such as nausea and sensitivity to light or sound.

==Side effects==

Some of the listed side effects include dizziness, nausea, sleepiness, dry mouth, pain in neck, throat or jaw, numbness or tingling.http://www.drugs.com/treximet.html
