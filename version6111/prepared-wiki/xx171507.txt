The A 13 Brenner Autobahnhttp://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40077377/NOR40077377.html Route index No.1 of the Austrian Federal Road Act is a relatively short autobahn (controlled-access highway) in the Austrian state of Tyrol, linking the A12 Inn Valley Autobahn near the state's capital Innsbruck to the Italian border at the Brenner Pass ([tpl]convert|1374|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]), where it becomes the Autostrada A22 (called also Autostrada del Brennero or Autobrennero) to Modena.http://www.asfinag.at/index.php?module=Pagesetter&type=file&func=get&tid=221&fid=download5&pid=6 It is part of the major European route E45.
The historic Brenner Pass is the lowest in the Central Eastern Alps. It therefore was particularly suitable for building the first motorway crossing the Alpine main chain from 1959 onwards. The route opened in 1963, including the Europabrücke, then Europe's highest bridge with [tpl]convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Tolls==

The whole Brenner Autobahn including the Europabrücke is a so-called special toll route. In this area instead of the general vignette requirement, extra tolls (Maut) are paid in cash or by credit card at the toll plaza at the Schönberg junction or via a Videomaut prepaid system. For driving on all other Austrian motoways the standard vignette is required.
