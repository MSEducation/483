===Recreation===

Climbing Cotopaxi to the summit is quite popular with up to 100 climbers attempting it on weekends.[tpl]cite book|first=John|last=Biggar|title=The Andes: a guide for climbers|publisher=BigR Publishing (Andes)|location=Scotland|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=0-9536087-0-0[/tpl] Today, mountain guide companies offer regular guided climbs of the mountain and — as of 11 December 2012 — no mountain peaks in Ecuador over 5,000 m high may be climbed without a licensed guide. Climbers grade the conventional route alpine PD (Peu Difficile) or WS (Wenig Schwierig) — or PD/WS+ (indicating "Mildly Difficult PLUS"). Use of crampons and ice axes are mandatory as snow and ice slopes of up to 50 degrees are encountered and climbers should be on belay and use aluminum ladders to cross one or two of the crevasses. A 4WD track goes up from the national park entrance to a carpark at 4600 m altitude on north side, just below the José F. Ribas Refuge. This stone mountain hut — owned and operated by Grupo Ascensionismo del Colegio San Gabriel — is situated 200 m higher at 4800 m (a 40-80 minute uphill hike). Here climbers can spend the night and begin their summit bid in the early morning without any intermediate camps. (Typically no more than about half of those attempting to summit Cotopaxi make it to the top after a daunting — though non-technical — six hour scramble.) Summiting normally starts around 12:30 am to reach the summit at latest 7:30 am and then return to the hut before the snow melts and glacier crevasses move/evolve. Adventure tourism operators in Quito also offer mountain biking tours from the Refuge downhill along the dirt track,

===Danger===

Future Cotopaxi eruptions pose a high risk to the local population, their settlements and fields. The main danger of a huge eruption of Cotopaxi would be the flow of ice from its glacier. If there were to be a very large explosion, it would destroy most of the settlements within the valley in the suburban area of Quito (pop. more than 2,000,000).[tpl]cite book|last1=Samaniego|first1=P|last2=Mothers|first2=P|last3=Hall|first3=ML|last4=Yepes|first4=H| last5=Castro|first5=M|last6=Aguilar|first6=J|title=LAHARZ hazard maps of the northern drainage of Cotopazi volcano, Ecuador|publisher=IAVCEI General Assembly|location=Pucon, Chile|year=2004[/tpl] Another city which would be in great danger is Latacunga which is located in the south valley and was destroyed in the 18th century by volcanic activity.
