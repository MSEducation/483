[[Rhyme scheme]]

CATEGORIES: Rhyme, Stanzaic form

A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyme between lines of a poem or song. It is usually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines designated with the same letter all rhyme with each other. Therefore, it is the pattern of end rhymes or lines.

Thus its own associations and resonances to cause a particular effect on the reader. A basic distinction is between rhyme schemes that apply to a single stanza, and those that continue their pattern throughout an entire poem (see chain rhyme). There are also more elaborate related forms, like the sestina - which requires repetition of exact words in a complex pattern.
In English, highly repetitive rhyme schemes are unusual.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] English has more vowel sounds than Italian, for example, meaning that such a scheme would be far more restrictive for an English writer than an Italian one - there are fewer suitable words to match a given pattern. Even such schemes as the terza rima ("aba bcb cdc ded..."), used by Dante Alighieri in The Divine Comedy, have been considered too difficult for English.

==Example rhyme schemes==

==Rhyme schemes in hip-hop music==

Hip-hop music and rapping’s rhyme schemes include traditional schemes such as couplets, as well as forms specific to the genre,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 95-110. which are broken down extensively in the books How to Rap and Book of Rhymes. Rhyme schemes used in hip-hop music include –
Couplets are the most common type of rhyme scheme in old school rapBradley, Adam, 2009, Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip-Hop, Basic Civitas Books, p. 50. and are still regularly used,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 99. though complex rhyme schemes have progressively become more frequent.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap Like A Star: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 97.Bradley, Adam, 2009, Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip-Hop, Basic Civitas Books, p. 73. Rather than relying on end rhymes, rap’s rhyme schemes can have rhymes placed anywhere in the bars of music to create a structure.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 107. There can also be numerous rhythmic elements which all work together in the same schemeEdwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 104. - this is called internal rhyme in traditional poetry,Bradley, Adam, 2009, Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip-Hop, Basic Civitas Books, p. 74. though as rap's rhymes schemes can be anywhere in the bar, they could all be internal, so the term is not always used.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 104. Rap verses can also employ 'extra rhymes', which do not structure the verse like the main rhyme schemes, but which add to the overall sound of the verse.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 103.

==The number of rhyme schemes==

The number of different possible rhyme schemes for an n-line poem is given by the Bell numbers,[ref]

which for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are
For instance, there are five different rhyme schemes for a three-line poem, ABC, AAB, ABA, ABB, and AAA. Historically, the first exhaustive listing of rhyme schemes appears to be in the Tale of Genji, an 11th century Japanese novel whose chapters are headed by diagrams representing the 52 rhyme schemes of a five-line poem. The number of rhyme schemes in which all lines rhyme with at least one other line is given by the numbers
For instance the four such rhyme schemes for a four-line poem are AABB, ABAB, ABBA, and AAAA.
Both sequences of numbers may be found on either side of an augmented version of the Bell triangle.
