Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld (Bischweiler, September 6, 1722 – Herschweiler-Pettersheim, November 5, 1775) was Duke of Zweibrücken from 1735 to 1775.  He was the son of Christian III, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken and Caroline of Nassau-Saarbrücken.
In 1751 he married, morganatically, Maria Johanna Camasse (1734–1807, created Countess Forbach in 1757).  They had six children, who were unable to succeed to their father's Duchy due to the morganatic nature of their parents' marriage at first, but in 1792 were allowed to carry the name Freiherr von Zweibrücken:Zweibrücken (German), Pierer's Universal-Lexikon.
His grandson Christian Freiherr von Zweibrücken (1782–1859, son of Philipp Guillaume) was a Royal Bavarian General der Kavallerie and Generalkapitän of the Hartschiere.
