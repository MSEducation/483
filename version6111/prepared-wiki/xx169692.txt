==Football career==

After an unsuccessful stint in Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth academy (never going past its reserves), Mangualde represented Clube Oriental de Lisboa. In January 2006 he joined top division side F.C. Paços de Ferreira, where would be regularly used throughout his two 1/2 seasons stint; he appeared 23 times, all as a starter, as the northern club finished sixth in the 2006–07 campaign and qualified to the UEFA Cup for the first time in its history.
In the 2008 summer Mangualde joined S.C. Freamunde in the second level, moving to Cyprus with Doxa Katokopias F.C. after just one year.
