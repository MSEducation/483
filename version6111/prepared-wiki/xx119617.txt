==Early life==

Lucas Arnau’s musical curiosity started at a very young age inspired by his father’s singing and songwriting. His Mother, a creative director for an Advertising Agency in Colombia, was also an important influence in Arnau’s artistic interests. Lucas wrote his first song at age 11 and was able to sing it at the age of 23.
The curiosities continued at the age of 13 when he composed his first score for an independent film called All the Rave. The film was regarded by local critics Ernest Williams and Romelio Gonzalez of the Colombian Times as "brilliant."
Arnau at the age of 17 started his first band at Colombia Public High School 118. He and three of his friends played their Variety Show under the name "The Bone Jams" and received a standing ovation, performing an encore for three more hours while the crowd and teachers completely disregarded any other acts.
