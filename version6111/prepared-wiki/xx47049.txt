[tpl]About|the British motorway||M6 (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]M6[/tpl]

The M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the M1 at the Catthorpe Interchange, near Rugby via Birmingham then heads north, passing Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool, Manchester, Preston, Lancaster, Carlisle and terminating at the Gretna junction (J45). Here, just short of the Scottish border it becomes the A74(M) which continues to Glasgow as the M74.
The M6 is the longest motorway in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest. It incorporated the Preston By-pass, the first length of motorway opened in the UK and forms part of a motorway "Backbone of Britain", running north−south between London and Glasgow via the industrial North of England. It is also part of the east−west route between the Midlands and the east-coast ports. The section from the M1 to the M6 Toll split near Birmingham forms part of the unsigned E-road E 24 and the section from the M6 Toll and the M42 forms part of E 05.

==Route==

The M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the M1 and from the beginning of A14 in Catthorpe near Rugby in central England, passes between Coventry and Nuneaton, through Birmingham, Walsall and Stafford and near the major cities of Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent.[tpl]cite book|author=Frommer's Short|title=The Borders and Galloway Regions, Scotland: Frommer's ShortCuts|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=1|volume=I|date=22 December 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=London|isbn=978-1-118-27111-7|pages=56–|chapter=4|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl] The motorway has major junctions with the M56 and M62 at Warrington, giving access to Chester, Manchester and Liverpool.[tpl]cite book|editor=Highways Agency|title=M6 Route Management Strategy: Warrington to the Scottish Borders : Final Strategy Summary Brochure, January 2004|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=1|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=Highways Agency|location=Scotland|page=54|chapter=1[/tpl] The M6 then heads north past Wigan, Preston and Lancaster.[tpl]cite book|author1=Lesley Anne Rose|author2=Michael Macaroon|author3=Vivienne Crow|title=Frommer's Scotland|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|date=6 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=London|isbn=978-1-119-99276-9|pages=424–|chapter=36|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl] After the latter two cities it passes through Cumbria with some parts very close to the edge of the Lake District, and then passes Carlisle on its way to Gretna,[tpl]cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=Porter (M.S.)|first2=John|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ndZVcax375EC&pg=PA836|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=One|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=836–|chapter=72|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl] before the motorway becomes the A74(M) a few hundred metres short of the Scottish border.[tpl]cite book|editor=Highways Agency|title=M6 Route Management Strategy: Warrington to the Scottish Borders : Final Strategy Summary Brochure, January 2004|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=1|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=Highways Agency|location=Scotland|page=73|chapter=1[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Frommer's Short|title=The Borders and Galloway Regions, Scotland: Frommer's ShortCuts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YNWrbtodFUUC&pg=PT56|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|date=22 December 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Scotland|isbn=978-1-118-27111-7|pages=56–|chapter=3|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl]

==History==

[tpl]anchor|Preston By-pass[/tpl][tpl]anchor|Preston by-pass[/tpl]

===Planning and construction===

The first section of the motorway and the first motorway in the country was the Preston By-pass. It was built by Tarmac Construction and opened by the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 5 December 1958.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/openingbooklets/pdf/prestonbypass.pdf|title=Preston Bypass Opening (Booklet)|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] In January 1959 the Preston by-pass was closed because of rapid surface deterioration over a stretch of [tpl]convert|100|yd|m[/tpl] "due to water freezing and then thawing". Motorists were diverted to the old road while the UK road research laboratory at Harmondsworth pondered the importance of surface water drainage.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = Waysider 'on the road’ column |title = The Preston By-pass-Enquiry Needed| journal =Practical  Motorist and Motor Cyclist| volume =5 |issue= 57 | page =803 |date=March 1959[/tpl]
Later, other sections of the motorway were constructed, and finally it was all linked together, giving an uninterrupted motorway length of [tpl]convert|230|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|title=Surveyor|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=1978|publisher=The St. Bride's press|page=21|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=British Information Services|author2=Great Britain.

The second phase of construction was completed in 1960, forming the Lancaster by-pass. Some [tpl]convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] south, the Stafford by-pass was completed in 1962.[tpl]cite book|title=Surveyor|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=XII|series=1|volume=XII|year=1978|publisher=The St. Bride's press|location=London|page=35|chapter=III[/tpl] By 1965, the remaining sections of motorway Stafford–Preston and Preston–Lancaster had been completed. 1968 saw the completion of the Walsall to Stafford link as well as the Penrith by-pass some [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] north in Cumberland. In 1970, the Lancaster–Penrith link was completed, along with a short section of motorway by-passing the south of Walsall. The most northerly section of the motorway also opened in 1970, running to the designated terminus north of Carlisle. By 1971,[tpl]cite book|author=Institution of Highway Engineers|title=The Highway engineer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cPRVAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=1981|publisher=Institution of Highway Engineers.|page=23|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl] the full route was completed between the junction with the M1 motorway at Rugby and the A38 road several miles north-east of Birmingham city centre, including Bromford Viaduct between Castle Bromwich (J5) and Gravelly Hill (J6), which at 3½ miles is the longest viaduct in Great Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m5m6midlink.htm |title=ciht.org.uk |publisher=Ciht.org.uk (Self-published)|accessdate=31 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=John Porter (M.S.)|title=The Motorway Achievement: Frontiers of Knowledge and Practice|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=2002|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-3197-5|pages=539–[/tpl]
Junction 6 in Birmingham is widely known as Spaghetti Junction because of its complexity. On the elevated ground between Shap and Tebay, the north- and south-bound carriages split apart.[tpl]cite book|author=T. G.

The section of the M6 that runs over Shap Fell in Cumbria is [tpl]convert|1050|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, one of the highest points on any motorway in the UK (junction 22 of the M62 on Saddleworth Moor is higher). The motorway engineers here chose to follow the route of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway engineered by Joseph Locke (now part of the West Coast Main Line) where the motorway runs in a split-level cutting above the railway in the descent from Shap Fell through the Lune Gorge into southern Cumbria.[tpl]cite book|author=Great Britain.

The northbound entry slip road at Lancaster (junction 34) is unusually short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune at this point and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer slip road. This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design.[tpl]cite book|author1=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Transport Committee|author2=Parliament Transport Committee Great Britain House of Commons|title=Road Pricing: The Next Steps; Seventh Report of Session 2004–05|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=2 August 2005|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-02566-1|pages=46–[/tpl]
The route was originally intended to replace the old A6, which it does along the northern section starting with the Preston Bypass. However, a much closer approximation to the overall actual route of the M6 (heading north from its southern terminus) is provided by following the A45, A34, A50, A49, then the A6.[tpl]cite book|author1=Peter Baldwin|author2=John Porter (M.S.)|author3=Robert Baldwin|title=The Motorway Achievement|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=469–[/tpl] South of Preston, the A6 route is instead supplemented by the M61 as far as Manchester, with the M60 acting as a bypass around the city. South of Manchester, there is no true motorway replacement for the old road. The M1 acts as a bypass for long-distance traffic in the south, from the Kegworth junction near Nottingham, to Luton and St. Albans near London; but, it is not an alternative for local traffic as the routes diverge by more than 15 miles while passing through Northamptonshire. Across the Pennines, the old road remains the main local through-route, and long-distance fast traffic between Derby and Manchester must instead take either the A50 and M6, or M1 and M62.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m5m6midlink.htm|title=M6|work=The Motorway Archive.

===Operational===

In July 1972 the UK Minister for Transport Industries announced that [tpl]convert|86|mi|km[/tpl] of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which "should be" completed by 1973.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = Peter Garnier (Ed)|title = News: Motorway lighting| journal = Autocar | volume =  137 |issue= 3978| page = page 19| date = 13 July 1972|accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl] Sections to be illuminated included the M6 between junctions 10 and 11, and between junctions 20 and 27.
In March 2006, after 15 years of debate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/upgrade/m6.shtml|title=M6 Carlisle — Gretna|work=CBRD|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=July 2012[/tpl] the government authorised the construction of a [tpl]convert|6|mi|adj=on[/tpl] extension of the M6 from its then northern terminus near Carlisle to the Anglo-Scottish border at Gretna (the so-called "Cumberland Gap"), where it links into the existing A74(M).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5069.aspx|title=M6 Carlisle to Guards Mill Extension|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] The road opened on 5 December 2008, the 50th anniversary of the M6 Preston By-pass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/northextension/|title=M6 North Extension, United Kingdom|work=Road Traffic Technology|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] The project, which was a mixture of new road and upgrade of the existing A74, crosses the West Coast Main Line and had an estimated costs of £174 million. It completed an uninterrupted motorway from just south of Dunblane (via the M9, the recently opened M80 section near Cumbernauld and the M73) in the north to Exeter (via the M5) and to London (via both the M42/M40 and the M1) in the south.[tpl]cite book|author=Royal Town Planning Institute|title=Planning: for the natural and built environment|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=1|series=I|volume=I|year=2006|publisher=Planning Publications|location=London|page=14|chapter=I[/tpl]
The M6 Toll, Britain's first toll motorway, which bypasses the West Midlands conurbation to the east and north of Birmingham and Walsall and was built to alleviate congestion through the West Midlands, and opened in December 2003. Before the opening of the toll motorway, this section of the M6 carried 180,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point near Wolverhampton (between the junctions with the M54 and M5 motorways), compared with a design capacity of only 72,000 vehicles. Usage, at about 50,000 vehicles, was lower than expected and traffic levels on the M6 were only slightly reduced as a result. The high toll prices, which were set by the operating company and over which the UK government has no influence until 2054, were blamed for the low usage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/one_year_after_study.pdf|title=one year after study|publisher=Highways Agency|date=11 August 2005|accessdate=24 January 2008|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lNKToGIN |archivedate = 2009-11-18|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Much traffic continues to use the M6 or the continued on the M1 and took the A50 or A52.[tpl]cite book|title=Highways & road construction international|accessdate=9 July 2012|volume=41|year=1973[/tpl] [tpl]As of|July 2012[/tpl] the road between Junctions 3A and 11A now carries 120,000 motor vehicles every day.[tpl]cite book|author=Great Britain.

A proposed extension to the M6 Toll known as the 'M6 Expressway', which would have continued from the M6 Toll as far as Knutsford, at which point much of the existing M6 traffic leaves the M6 for Manchester, was abandoned in 2006 due to excessive costs, anticipated construction problems[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&NewsAreaID=2|title=Decision on M6 upgrade announced|date=20 July 2006|accessdate=30 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] and disappointing levels of use of the M6 Toll.

===Hard shoulder running (junction 4–5 and 8 to 10a)===

In October 2007, following a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the UK government have announced that two stretches of the M6 will be upgraded to allow the hard shoulder to be used as a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called Active Traffic Management.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/article3096713.ece|title=Hard-shoulder scheme to go nationwide|publisher=The Independent|date=27 October 2007|accessdate=25 January 2007[/tpl] The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway.[tpl]cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=John|first2=Porter (M.S.)|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|coauthors=Thomas Telford|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=693|chapter=XIV|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl] The system could also be extended onto other stretches of the M6 as the government is going to undertake a feasibility study to determine other likely locations where this technology can be used.[tpl]cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=John|first2=Porter (M.S.)|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|coauthors=Thomas Telford|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=694–|chapter=XV|authormask=|trans_title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans_chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=[/tpl]

===Managed motorway J13 and J19===

The government wishes to improve reliability and capacity between Junctions 11 by Cannock and Junction 19 near Knutsford. In 2004, it favoured a new motorway, 'The Expressway' following a roughly parallel course to the existing M6.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/encouragingbetteruseofroadsa5919|title=Encouraging better use of roads and the M6|publisher=Department for Transport|accessdate=20 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070811065448/http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/encouragingbetteruseofroadsa5919  |archivedate = 11 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Welsh Affairs Committee|title=The Severn crossings toll: third report of session 2010–11, report, together with formal minutes and written evidence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k50RNr2_iIUC&pg=PA58|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=22 December 2010|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-55570-0|pages=58–[/tpl] In July 2006, the government announced its decision to abandon the Expressway proposal, and favoured widening accompanied by demand-management measures,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&NewsAreaID=2|title=Decision on M6 upgrade announced |date=22 June 2006|publisher=Government News Network|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] and have launched a study to consider options for providing additional capacity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11587.aspx|title=M6 Jct 11A – 19 (Increasing Capacity) Study|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] The current proposal is in introduce managed motorway between Junction 13 and 19.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/m6-junctions-13-19-managed-motorway/|title=M6 Junctions 13–19 Managed Motorway|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/m6-junctions-13-19-managed-motorway/[/tpl]

Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres and the start and end distances are known, both distances are shown.Driver Location Signs, M6 J4-18(map) Highway Authority 2009.

==Legislation==

Each motorway in England requires that a legal document called a Statutory Instrument to be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these Statutory Instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of the Statutory Instruments relating to the route of the M6.
