[[Minister for Development Cooperation (Netherlands)]]

CATEGORIES: Government ministries of the Netherlands

The Minister for Development Cooperation is a government minister for international development.
In the Netherlands the minister for development cooperation was not the head of a ministry, but rather part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The minister for a short time in 2010 was Maxime Verhagen of the Christian Democratic Appeal in the Cabinet Balkenende IV. The First Rutte cabinet chose not to continue this policy, instead retaining a State Secretary for the portfolio, but the second Rutte cabinet revived the office, with Lilianne Ploumen of the Labour Party being appointed.
