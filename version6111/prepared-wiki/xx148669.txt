Wall2Wall Soccer is an indoor multi-purpose sports facility in Mason, Ohio.  With a seating capacity of 850 (and a plan to expand to 6,500 seats in two years), it currently hosts youth indoor soccer as well as other youth sports programs.  In 2007 it was supposed be the new home of the Cincinnati Marshals indoor football team, but the team later decided to play at Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bengals uses Wall2Wall Soccer as an indoor practice facility.
