Cement Accelerator is an admixture for the use in concrete, mortar, rendering or screeds.  The addition of Cement Accelerator speeds the setting time and thus cure time starts earlier.Justnes, H.

Typical materials used for acceleration are Ca(NO3)2 and NaNO3. CaCl2 has been very popular, but due to its reinforcement corroding behaviour the use is not recommended any more CEMENT ADMIXTURES ASSOCIATION: Admixture Sheet – ATS 4: Accelerating admixtures, http://www.admixtures.org.uk/downloads/ATS%204%20Accelerating%20admixtures.pdf and in many cases prohibited.
