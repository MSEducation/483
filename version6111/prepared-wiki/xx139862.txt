CATEGORIES: Game variants, Training, Simulation games

A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from "real life" in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, or prediction. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with players instead allowed to freely control a character."Simulations: A Handbook for Teachers and Trainers", by Ken Jones, 1995, ISBN 0-7494-1666-1, p. 21 Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation.
From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.Danny Saunders, Jacqui Severn, "Simulation and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning", p. 20
Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published."Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning", 1996, ISBN 0-7494-1866-4, p. 50

==History==

Simulation games began with Will Wright opening the Sim series in 1989 with SimCity, a city-building game. Certain games such as SimLife and SimEarth were subsequently created and are capable of teaching players the basics of genetics and global ecosystems.[tpl]citation needed|reason=MS Flight Sim was released on the Apple II and, therefore, way before Sim City|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In a study where adolescents played SimCity 2000, the study found that those participants who played the game had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zeynep|first=Tanes|coauthors=Zeynep Cemalcilar|title=Learning from SimCity: An empirical study of Turkish adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=20 November 2009|year=2010|month=October|volume=33|issue=5|pages=731â€“739|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197109001304|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2009.10.007[/tpl]
