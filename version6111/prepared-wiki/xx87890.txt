Erki Nool (born 25 June 1970 in Võru, Estonia) is an Estonian decathlete and politician. 
Nool is a winner of the gold medal for decathlon in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although Nool did not place first in any individual event, his total score was the highest. Nool won the title after the competition referee decided to over-rule a discus judge, who had red-flagged his last and only valid attempt due to alleged step-out. The reinstatement of his 43.66-metre third throw sparked unsuccessful counter-protests from other teams. Nool took gold ahead of the Czech Roman Šebrle and American Chris Huffins.
On September 1997 he established the first private athletics school in Estonia.About Erki Nool on Decathlon2000.ee
