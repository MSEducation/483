[[Khawr Abd Allah]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Iraq, Geography of Kuwait

The Khawr Abd Allah ([tpl]Lang-ar|خور عبد الله[/tpl]) is today an estuary, but once was the point where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (Shatt al-Arab) emptied into the Persian Gulf. Located in the south of Iraq, the Iraq-Kuwaiti border divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of Umm Qasr the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi. The Shatt al-Arab is now the point where the rivers drain out, east of the Khawr Abd Allah. As it extends northwestward into Iraq, it changes its name to Khawr az-Zubayr, at the location of Umm Qasr. From this point it links by canalagain to the northwest and into the Tigris and Euphrates proper. It forms the northeast coastline of Jazirat Bubiyan and the north coastline of Jazirat Warbah.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title='Abd Allah Khawr|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=16[/tpl] Both of these islands are officially Kuwait, however Iraq does claim them.
It has also lent its name to the maritime Khawr Abd Allah Protocols or KAA Interoperability Protocols first developed by the British Royal Navy between March and June 2008 during the British command of Combined Task Force 158.
The non-legally binding KAA Interoperability Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the then British naval barrister and legal advisor to CTF 158. David Hammond now heads the Maritime Practice at 9 Bedford Row International Chambers, London - http://9bri.com/members/david-hammond. This included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. On November 11, 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed onboard HMS Chatham (F87) on 8 May 2008.http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/articles/2008/140.html The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991 Gulf War. Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report.http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/9010_Report_to_Congress_Dec_08.pdf The detail of the text of the KAA Interoperability Protocols has now been made available open source over the internet from leaked US diplomatic documents.http://www.leakoverflow.com/questions/554987/09kuwait465-protocols-assist-iraqi-and-kuwaiti-navies-in
More recently the former Head of the Kuwaiti Navy, Major-General Ahmad Yousef Al-Mulla, was invited to speak at the United Kingdom's Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London on February 1, 2012 on the topic of the Khor Abdallah waterway as part of a lecture covering Kuwaiti-Iraqi maritime boundary interactions and future relations. The lecture was introduced by Lord Astor of Hever John Astor, 3rd Baron Astor of Hever, the United Kingdom government's Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Ministry of Defense) and the Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies Vice Admiral Charles Style.
