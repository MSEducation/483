==History==

The [tpl]Nihongo|Tsugaru|津軽[/tpl] was first introduced on 1 October 1954 as an express service operating between [tpl]ja-stalink|Ueno[/tpl] in Tokyo and [tpl]ja-stalink|Aomori[/tpl] via [tpl]ja-stalink|Niitsu[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Akita[/tpl]. From 19 November 1956, the train was rerouted to run via [tpl]ja-stalink|Fukushima||Fukushima[/tpl] and Akita. This service was discontinued from the start of the revised timetable on 1 December 1993.[tpl]cite book | title = 列車名鑑1995 |trans_title= Train Name Directory 1995| publisher = Railway Journal| date = August 1995 | location = Japan| page = 127| isbn = [/tpl]
The Tsugaru name was revived from 1 December 2002 as a limited express service operating between [tpl]ja-stalink|Hachinohe[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Hirosaki[/tpl], superseding the former Hatsukari limited express service which ran between [tpl]ja-stalink|Morioka[/tpl] and Aomori up until the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen extension to Hachinohe.[tpl]cite book | last = Haraguchi| first = Takayuki | title = Encyclopedia of JR's Railway Cars: JR全車輌 | publisher = Sekai Bunka | year = 2009 | location = Japan | page = 50| isbn = 978-4-418-09905-4[/tpl] Services were formed of 6-car 485-3000 series and E751 series EMUs based at Aomori depot, with JR Hokkaido 789 series EMUs used on some services.
From 4 December 2010, with the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen extension from Hachinohe to [tpl]ja-stalink|Shin-Aomori[/tpl], the Tsugaru services were rerouted to operate between Aomori and Akita, replacing the Kamoshika and Inaho services that previously ran on this route. From this date, services were formed of shortened 4-car 485-3000 series EMUs, with the E751 series EMUs temporarily removed from service.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jreast.co.jp/akita/topics/daiya2010/index.html#page=8|title= 2010年12月ダイヤ改正について|trans_title= December 2010 Timetable Revision |date= 24 September 2010 |publisher= East Japan Railway Company - Akita Branch|location= Japan|pages= 8–9|language= Japanese|format= pdf|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 6 December 2010[/tpl]
