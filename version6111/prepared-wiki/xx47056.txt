The M1 is a north–south motorway in England connecting London to Leeds, where it joins the A1(M) near Aberford. It was the first inter-urban motorway to be completed in the UK;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m1m10m45.htm|title=Motorway archive|publisher=Institute of Highways and Transportation|work=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] the first road to be built to motorway standard in the country was the Preston By-pass, which later became part of the M6.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/338.aspx|title=Key facts about England's motorways and trunk roads|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl]
The motorway is [tpl]convert|193|mi[/tpl] long and was constructed in four phases. Most of the motorway was opened between 1959 and 1968 but the southern end was extended in 1977 and the northern end was extended in 1999. It forms part of the unsigned European route E13.

==History==

The first motorways (autostrade) were built in Italy on the order of Benito Mussolini in the 1920s, with other countries subsequently following, notably Germany with the first 'autobahn' in 1931 and then developed by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler. There had been plans since before the Second World War for a motorway network in the United Kingdom. Lord Montagu formed a company to build a 'motorway like road' from London to Birmingham in 1923;[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ndZVcax375EC&lpg=PA65&dq|title=The motorway achievement volume 1|page=57|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|author1=Bridle, Ron|author2=Baldwin, Peter|author3=Baldwin, Robert[/tpl] however it was a further 26 years before the Special Roads Act 1949 was passed which allowed for the construction of roads limited to specific vehicle classifications, and the 1950s when the country's first motorways were given the government go-ahead.
The first section of motorway was the Preston Bypass in Lancashire, which opened in 1958 (now part of the M6 motorway). The M1 was Britain's first full-length motorway and opened in 1959.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m1/ |title=Motorway Database – M1 |author=Chris Marshall |work=CBRD |accessdate=31 October 2009 [/tpl]

===First section, 1959===

The first section of the motorway opened between Junction 5 (Watford) and Junction 18 (Crick/Rugby) on 2 November 1959 together with the motorway's two spurs, the M10 (from Junction 7 to south of St Albans originally connecting to the A1) and the M45 (from Junction 17 to the A45 and Coventry). Parts of the Hertfordshire section were built using steam rollers.
The M1 was officially inaugurated from Slip End (close to Luton), this was celebrated by a large concrete slab[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slipend.co.uk/Info/Local%20History/images/The%20Slab.jpg|title=The Slab|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] on the bridge next to the village with inscription "London-Yorkshire Motorway – This slab was sealed by the Rt Hon Harold Watkinson M.P. – Minister of Transport – Inauguration Day – 24th March 1958". It was removed during widening works in 2007-08.
This section of the M1 broadly follows the route of the A5 north-west. It starts at the Watford Bypass (A41), which runs south-east to meet the A1 at Apex corner, and ended on the A5 at Crick. The M10 spur motorway connected the M1 to the North Orbital Road (A405/A414, a precursor of the M25) where it also met the A5 (now renumbered here as the A5183) and, [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] to the east via the A414, the A6, which subsequently became part of the M25.
Although the whole of first section opened in 1959, it was built in two parts with the northern part (Junctions 10 to 18) being built by John Laing and the southern part (the St Albans Bypass) being built by Tarmac Construction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m1eastamat.htm|work=Motorway archive|title=list of material held by Northamptonshire CC|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl]

===Rugby to Leeds, 1965 to 1968===

The continuation of the motorway from Junction 18 towards Yorkshire was carried out as a series of extensions between 1965 and 1968. Diverging from the A5, the motorway takes a more northerly route through the East Midlands, via Leicester, Loughborough, Nottingham to Sheffield, where the M18 splits from the M1 at Junction 32 to head to Doncaster.
Originally, the M1 was planned to end at Doncaster but it was decided to make what was going to be the "Leeds and Sheffield Spur" the primary route with the [tpl]convert|11|mi|adj=on[/tpl] section to the A1(M) south of Doncaster given the separate motorway number M18.
From Junction 32, the motorway passes between Sheffield and Rotherham towards Barnsley and then heads towards Wakefield, reaching the original end of the motorway at Junction 44 to the east of Leeds. There were plans to route the M1 from just south of Junction 42 where it interchanges with the M62, round the west of Leeds to the A1 at Dishforth; the chosen route passes to the east of Leeds. With the M62 and M621, the M1 forms a ring of motorways around the south of Leeds.

===Leeds South Eastern Urban Motorway, 1972===

In 1972 an extension of the M1 was opened into central Leeds as the Leeds South Eastern Motorway where it met the Leeds South Western Motorway (M621) coming north-east from the M62 at Junction 3.

===Lighting===

In July 1972 the UK Minister for Transport Industries, John Peyton announced that [tpl]convert|86|mi|0[/tpl] of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which "should be" completed by 1973.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = Peter Garnier (Ed)|title = News: Motorway lighting| journal = Autocar | volume =  137 nbr 3978| page = 19| date = 13 July 1972[/tpl] Sections to be illuminated included the M1 between Junctions 3 and 14, and between Junctions 16 and 24.  In August 2011, the Highways Agency announced that despite being converted to Managed Motorway the lights will be switched off on stretches of the motorway between Junctions 10 (Luton) and 13 (Milton Keynes) without affecting road user safety. The motorway junctions and their approaches, and a section of the M1 on either side of Junction 11 (north Luton), would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=420762&SubjectId=2 |title=HA press release M1 J10-13 lighting |publisher=Nds.coi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011[/tpl]

===Safety barriers===

An increasing official interest in secondary safety was evident in an announcement in March 1973 that work would shortly begin on erecting "tensioned safety barriers" along the central reservation of a [tpl]convert|34|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] section of the M1 between Kegworth (J24) and Barlborough (J30).[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title = Motorweek: More M1 barriers| journal =Motor| volume = nbr 3677| page = 40| date = 31 March 1973[/tpl]

===Leeds to Hook Moor, 1999===

Between 1996 and 1999 the M1 section north of the M62 underwent a major reconstruction and extension to take the M1 on a new route to the A1(M) at Aberford. The new road involved the construction of a series of new junctions, bridges and viaducts to the east of Leeds. When the new section of M1 was completed and opened on 4 February 1999, the Leeds South Eastern Motorway section of the M1 was redesignated as the M621 and the junctions were given new numbers (M621 Junctions 4 to 7).

===London extensions, 1966, 1967 and 1977===

The M1 was extended south from its original starting point at Junction 5 towards London in three stages. The first stage, opened in 1966, took the motorway south-east, parallel to the A41 to meet the A5 at junction 4 south of Elstree. The second phase continued east to Scratchwood (the London Gateway Service Area occupies the location of the missing junction 3 from where an unbuilt spur would have connected to the A1 at Stirling Corner to the north-east). The M1 then runs south alongside the Midland Main Line towards Hendon where it meets the A1 again at Junction 2 via a tightly curved flyover section. These flyovers connecting from the A1 were originally both for northbound traffic; the left one as the on-ramp to the M1, the right one going over the A1/A41 junction beneath to rejoin the A1 northbound.
Junction 2 is about [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of the original Junction 3. Southbound traffic originally left the motorway via a slip road which passed under the A41/A1 Mill Hill Bypass and looped round to join it at Fiveways Interchange. This slip road is still visible to southbound traffic approximately [tpl]convert|650|yd|m[/tpl] before Junction 2 and was maintained until the early 2000s though not accessible to traffic. The northbound slip road from the A1 is now partially used as the entrance way to a business park but no longer reaches the northbound carriageway as it is cut off by the motorway continuing south.
The final section of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the motorway meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s would have seen the motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern section of the London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the Staples Corner junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.
On its completion, the M1 acted as a fast link road between London and Birmingham. It also provided a link to London Luton Airport for these regions, and its proximity to the site of the Milton Keynes new town (designated in 1967) meant that it was soon providing a vital transport link to another major area.

===Recent developments===

In 2006 plans were developed to widen [tpl]convert|91|mi|km[/tpl] from Leicester through to Leeds (Junctions 21–42) which were subject to widespread road protests.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/6098408.stm|title=Protesters unfurl anti-M1 banners|work=BBC News | date=30 October 2006 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] The Transport Select Committee then claimed the Highways Agency had "lost budgetary control" and the National Audit Office was asked to investigate why the price of the project has risen from £3.7 billion to £5.1 billion in 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2073611,00.html|title=M1 widening to cost £21m per mile|work=The Observer|date=6 May 2007|accessdate=28 January 2008 | location=London | first=Juliette | last=Jowit[/tpl] Plans were scaled back with widening to 4 lanes limited to the section from the M25 to Luton (Junctions 6a to 10) which was already in progress and from Nottingham and Mansfield (Junctions 25–28) with hard-shoulder running being proposed for other sections.
A [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] section between the M25 and Luton (Junctions 6a and 10) was widened to dual 4-lanes and opened in 2009. This project included the construction of new parallel roads between Junctions 7 and 8 for local traffic, widening or replacement of eleven underbridges on one or both carriageways and replacing seven overbridges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4478.aspx|title=M1 Jct 6a to 10 Widening|publisher=Highways Agency[/tpl] The cost was £294 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090309/text/90309w0003.htm|title=9 Mar 2009 : Column 10W—continued|work=Hansard[/tpl] As part of the project a variable speed limit system (MIDAS) has been installed, much like the one used on the M25. Also, the M10 spur was reclassified as part of the A414 road.
Work to widen the [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] section from Nottingham to Mansfield (J25-J28) to dual 4-lanes began in January 2008 and was completed in 2010 at a cost of £340 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/newsroom.aspx?pressreleaseid=156326|title=M1 widening J25-28: work to reduce congestion and improve safety starts in earnest|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emcbe.com/january-constructive-article6.html|title=£340m M1 contract to MVM consortium[/tpl]  Average speed cameras which were installed initially only for the period of construction have proven to be so effective that they have been retained permanently on this section of the motorway.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8438375.stm|title=M1 works speed cameras will stay|work=BBC News|quote=Temporary cameras installed for widening road works between Junctions 25 and 28 have proved so effective they will stay, it has been confirmed.|date=3 January 2010[/tpl]

==Current developments==

===M1 J10 to J13 improvement scheme===

Hard shoulder running is being introduced on approximately [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] of motorway between Junction 10, south of Luton, and Junction 13 where it joins with the A421. Modifications are also being made to Junctions 11 and 12.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4482.aspx|title=M1 Jct 10 to 13 Improvements|publisher=Highways Agency[/tpl] The scheme was announced in January 2009 and will cost between £326 million and £503 million and opening in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=171923|title=Public exhibitions announced for M1 j10 to j13 improvement scheme|publisher=Highways Agency[/tpl] This plan replaced earlier proposals to widen the section to four lanes and replace bridges crossing the motorway, including some considered to be of historical architectural value. The public inquiry was then delayed by four months in 2007 for further traffic modelling work to be undertaken. The widening scheme was abandoned after the estimated cost had escalated from £382 million to £601 million.
Related schemes include the upgrade to the A421 road to dual two-lane from Junction 13 to the Bedford southern bypass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4584.aspx|title=A421 Bedford to M1 Junction 13|publisher=Highways Agency[/tpl]

===M1 J19 reconstruction===

A planned £201 million to £302 million upgrade to the overloaded Catthorpe Interchange between the M1 motorway, M6 motorway and A14 road close to Catthorpe[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11934.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2008|title=M1 Jct 19[/tpl] was put on hold in June 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11934.aspx|title=M1 Junction 19 news[/tpl] It was then 'shelved' as a result of the government spending review.[tpl]cite news |title=Catthorpe Interchange motorway access scheme is shelved |date=18 June 2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10352742 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 November 2010[/tpl] The junction prior to the improvement scheme handles 142,000 vehicles per day. Following a public inquiry in March 2013 the Secretary of State for Transport announced on 18 July 2013 that the scheme would go ahead.[tpl]cite web|title=Press release:Go ahead for two new road schemes in the Midlands|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/go-ahead-for-two-new-road-schemes-in-the-midlands|publisher=Department for Transport|accessdate=13 October 2013|date=18 July 2013[/tpl] The new junction will be built on 3 layers with construction planned to start by March 2014 and completion by 2017.[tpl]cite web|title=M1 Junction 19 Improvement Scheme|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/M1-Junction-19-Improvement-Scheme|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl]

==Proposed developments==

===M1 J28–J31 managed motorways===

There is a plan to introduce managed motorway technologies between Junctions 28 (Mansfield) and 31 (Sheffield) with work scheduled to take place between 2012 and 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/23106.aspx|title=M1 J28-31 Managed Motorways|publisher=Highways Agency[/tpl]

===M1 J32–J35a managed motorways===

Provisional plans exist for a managed motorway scheme including dynamic hard shoulder running on the M1 motorway between Junctions 32 and 35a serving South Yorkshire and in particular the urban areas of Sheffield and Leeds was confirmed in November 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/clientmicrosite/Content/Detail.aspx?ClientId=202&NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=416188&SubjectId=36|title=Transport Secretary gives the go-ahead to 24 New Schemes and announces over £600M of further funding|publisher=Department for Transport[/tpl]

===M1 Junctions 39–42 managed motorways===

Provisional plans exist for a managed motorway scheme including dynamic hard shoulder running on the M1 motorway between Junctions 39 and 42 serving South Yorkshire and in particular the urban areas of Wakefield and Leeds was announced in November 2010 which includes a link to the M62 at Junction 42.

===M1/M69 junction===

There are plans to widen the M1 to dual 4-lane or dual 5-lane between Junctions 21 and 21a and construct a new link road between the M1 and the M69 including a new road bridge to take southbound M1 traffic over the motorway to connect to the M69. During this work the Leicester Forest East services would be closed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/14485.aspx|title=M1/M69 Public Consultation Information – The new solution|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] Consultation took place in 2007 and a completion date of 2014 is suggested.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/14484.aspx|title=M1/M69 Public Consultation Information – what happens now|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] However the Highway Agency separately suggests that scheme development will "recommence" in 2014/15 with a provisional programmed start of works 2017/18.

===Other proposals===

In addition to the above schemes, the Highways Agency also plans to add capacity and improve flows on the following sections of motorway in the longer term.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4347.aspx|title=M1 Junctions 21 to 31 Improvements|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=9 July 2012[/tpl]
Plans to dual the A421 from Junction 13 to Milton Keynes and to add capacity to Junction 10a on the Luton spur are being developed.[ref]
