General Garrard was ordered by General Sherman to interpose between General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry and detached infantry at Noonday Creek, which was just a few miles from Sherman's headquarters at Big Shanty.  When, after a week, Garrard failed to do so, two brigades of infantry and three brigades of cavalry with artillery support were advanced against the Confederate positions on June 9.  Two charges failed, and the Union Army retired from the field. However, Wheeler's cavalry was moved to a position between Bell's Ferry and Canton Road.Cracker cavaliers: the 2nd Georgia cavalry under Wheeler and Forrest
