Flushing is a neighborhood in the north-central part of the New York City borough of Queens, in the United States.
While much of the neighborhood is residential, Downtown Flushing, centered around the northern end of Main Street, is a large commercial and retail area and is the fourth largest central business district in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/north/a-cleaner-flushing-is-pushed-by-kim/article_0ba50fe1-d475-57af-b0bf-73b5e0922741.html|title=A cleaner Flushing is pushed by Kim|work=Queens Chronicles |accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/201201_flushing_report.pdf|title=Downtown Flushing Mobility and Safety Improvement Project[/tpl]
Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there, including people of Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, and African American ancestry. It is part of the Fifth Congressional District, which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring Nassau County. Flushing is served by five railroad stations on the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line ([tpl]NYCS trains|Flushing[/tpl]), which has its terminus at Main Street. The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the third busiest intersection in New York City, behind only Times and Herald Squares.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.queensmetro.com/guides/41/all-the-neighborhoods-towns-and-zip-codes-in-queens/living-in-queens |title=All the Neighborhoods, Towns, and Zip Codes in Queens |work=QueensMetro |author=Hess, Meagan |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Dutch colony===

In 1645, Flushing was established by Dutch settlers on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek under charter of the Dutch West India Company and was part of the New Netherland colony. The settlement was named after the city of Vlissingen, in the southwestern Netherlands, the main port of the company; Flushing is an anglicization of the Dutch name that was then in use.
In its early days, Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named John Bowne. John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General Peter Stuyvesant on harboring Quakers by allowing Quaker meetings in his home. The Flushing Remonstrance, signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely.Vermeer's Life: Timeline As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.[tpl]cite news |title=A Colony With a Conscience |first=Kenneth T. |last=Jackson |url=http://www.flushingremonstrance.info/documents/jackson_oped_nyt_071227.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl]
Landmarks remaining from the Dutch period in Flushing include the John Bowne House on Bowne Street and the Old Quaker Meeting House on Northern Boulevard.

===English colonial history===

In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it the Province of New York. When Queens County was established in 1683, the "Town of Flushing" was one of the original five towns which comprised the county.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Map/5.Bor.Q.Rich.html |title=Before the Five Borough City:Queens[/tpl] This later map shows former boundaries of the Town of Flushing. The map does not show the towns that were part of Queens and are now part of Nassau. Many historical references to Flushing are to this town, bounded from Newtown on the west by Flushing Creek (now Flushing River), from Jamaica on the south by the watershed, and from Hempstead on the east by what later became the Nassau County line. The town was dissolved in 1898 when Queens became a borough of New York City, and the term "Flushing" today usually refers to a much smaller area, for example the former Village of Flushing.
Flushing was the site of the first commercial tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of Kissena Park, former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan.
During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the Battle of Long Island, Nathan Hale, an officer in the Continental Army, was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.
The 1785 Kingsland Homestead, originally the residence of a wealthy Quaker merchant, now serves as the home of the Queens Historical Society.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.queenshistoricalsociety.org/kingsland.html  |title=Kingsland Homestead |publisher=Queens Historical Society |accessdate=July 5, 2007[/tpl] The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.

===Nineteenth century===

During the 19th century, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic vitality, so did Flushing. Its proximity to Manhattan was critical in its transformation into a fashionable residential area. In 1813, the Village of Flushing was incorporated within the Town of Flushing.History of the town of Flushing, Long Island, New York (1899). Internet Archive, Cornell University Library. Retrieved 24 July 2012. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's growth continued with two new villages incorporating: College Point in 1867, and Whitestone in 1868. In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, the Town of Flushing (along with two other towns of Queens County) was consolidated into the City of New York to form the new Borough of Queens. All towns, villages, and cities within the new borough were dissolved. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===

The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the Queensboro Bridge (also known as the 59th Street Bridge) over the East River connected Queens County to midtown Manhattan.Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge. Accessed May 14, 2011
The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line ([tpl]NYCS trains| Flushing[/tpl]) hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a  commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the U.S. East Coast and Chicago. Decades later, the RKO Keith's movie palace would host vaudeville acts and appearances by the likes of Mickey Rooney, The Marx Brothers and Bob Hope. The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]

==Demographics==

Flushing is among the most religiously diverse communities in America. There are "over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles (6.3 square kilometers)."Historian Scott Hanson Discusses Religious Diversity in America "Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."[tpl]cite news |title=Religious Freedom Laws Help Create Culture of Tolerance |first=Louise |last=Fenner |url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20080826083401tsop.nb/topstory.html |work=newsblaze.com |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl]
In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the Flushing Remonstrance was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Remonstrants cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience.
Today, Flushing abounds with houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, the Congregation of Georgian Jews, St. Mel Roman Catholic Church, St. Michael's Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Shrine Church, Queensboro Hill Community Church, Hindu Temple Society of North America, and the Muslim Center of New York.[tpl]cite news |title=The Melting Pot on a High Boil in Flushing |first=John |last=Strausbaugh |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/arts/02expl.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl]
The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a large concentration of Chinese and Korean businesses, including Asian restaurants. Chinese-owned businesses in particular dominate the area along Main Street and the blocks west of it. Many of the signs and advertisements of the stores in the area are in Chinese. Ethnic Chinese constitute an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population and as well as of the overall population in Flushing. Consequently, Flushing's Chinatown has grown rapidly enough to become the second-largest Chinatown outside of Asia. In fact, the Flushing Chinatown may surpass the original Manhattan Chinatown itself within a few years.[tpl]When|date=January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ghKia5k6hXUC&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Contemporary Chinese America: Immigration, Ethnicity, and Community |first=Min |last=Zhou |authorlink=Min Zhou |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2009 |pages=57–59 |isbn=978-1-59213-858-6[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MR4iVnvulMQC&pg=PA158#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=New immigrants in New York |first=Nancy |last=Foner |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=158–161 |isbn=978-0-231-12414-0[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.queenstribune.com/anniversary2002/koreans.htm |title=Koreans In Queens: Finding A Second Home In The Borough Of Queens |first=Angela |last=Montefinise |newspaper=Queens Tribune|year=2002 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl]

===Chinatown, Flushing (法拉盛華埠)===

The Flushing Chinatown is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic Chinese enclaves outside of Asia, as well as within New York City itself. Main Street and the area to its west, particularly along Roosevelt Avenue, have become the primary nexus of Flushing Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MR4iVnvulMQC&pg=PA158#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=New immigrants in New York|author=Nancy Foner|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2001|pages=158–161|accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl] However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://qcpages.qc.edu/Asian_American_Center/research_papers/aacre15.html|accessdate=2012-10-18|title=Chinese in Chinatown and Flushing|author=Hsiang-shui Chen[/tpl] Mandarin Chinese[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html|title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin|date=2009-10-21|accessdate=2011-07-16 | work=The New York Times | first=Kirk | last=Semple [/tpl] (including Northeastern Mandarin), Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan Fujianese, Wu Chinese, Beijing dialect, Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Suzhou dialect, Hangzhou dialect, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and English are all prevalently spoken in Flushing Chinatown, while the Mongolian language is now emerging. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing Chinatown.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/dining/10chine.html?scp=1&sq=dongbei%20cuisine&st=cse|title=Northeast China Branches Out in Flushing|date=2010-02-09|accessdate=2012-10-18 | work=The New York Times | first=Julia | last=Moskin[/tpl] Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown may surpass in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan within a few years, and it is debatable whether this has already happened. The New York Times says that Flushing's Chinatown now rivals Manhattan's Chinatown for being the center of Chinese-speaking New Yorkers' politics and trade.[tpl]cite news |title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin |first=Kirk |last=Semple |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl]

===Additional communities===

The neighborhood of East Flushing, technically within Greater Flushing, houses a substantial Chinese community along with most of Downtown Flushing, but also includes substantial Irish, Greek, Russian, and Italian communities, as well as communities of Indians, Koreans, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans. This neighborhood tends to be more diverse visibly than Flushing Downtown because of the more even distribution of the ethnicities of East Flushing residents resulting in more businesses catering to each community rather than the dominance of Chinese and to a lesser extent Korean businesses in Downtown Flushing.
The northeastern section of Flushing near Bayside continues to maintain large Italian and Greek presences that are reflected in its many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants. The northwest is a mix of Jews, Greeks, and Italians. Most of central Flushing is an ethnic mix of Whites, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans.
An area south of Franklin Avenue houses a concentration of Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, and Bangladeshi markets. This concentration of South Asian businesses south of Franklin Avenue has existed since the late 1970s, one of the oldest Little Indias in North America. The Hindu Temple Society of North America (Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam Sanskrit: श्री महावल्लभ गणपति देवस्थानम्) at 45-57 Bowne Street in Flushing was the very first of the traditional Hindu temples in the US.Famous Hindu chaplain honored at Hindu Sangathan Diwas celebrations in New York, 27 August 2007, http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7144Vedanta Society in San Francisco (1906) or the Vedanta Center in Boston (1910) are sometimes considered to be the first Hindu temple in the US. However they were not fully consecrated traditional temples.

Several attractions were originally developed for the World's Fairs in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year Westinghouse Time Capsules made of special alloys buried in the park, chronicling 20th-century life in the United States, dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also in the park are the Queens Museum of Art which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park http://queenstheatre.org/; the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Zoo.
The Queens Botanical Garden on Main Street has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries-long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.

==Other notable neighborhoods==

Broadway-Flushing, also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29th Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155th to the west and 172nd Streets to the east.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
The Waldheim neighborhood, an estate subdivision in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, is a small district of high quality "in-town" suburban architecture that preservationists have tried to save for at least twenty-five years. Waldheim (German for "home in the woods"), known for its large homes of varying architectural styles, laid out in an unusual street pattern, was the home of some of Flushing's wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway family of piano notability, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. The neighborhood was rezoned by the City of New York in 2008, in order to halt the destruction of its original housing stock, which began in the late 1980s, and to help preserve the low density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission to date. Today, Waldheim stretches between Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to the Kissena Park and East Flushing neighborhoods.
The area South of Kissena Park is often referred to as South Flushing.

==Parks==

All the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.

Since 2006 the school made room for a new school to use the space up on the 4th floor for The East-West School of International Studies. In 1999 the school owned a park called Rachel Carson Playground which is right across from the school. On April 10, 2013, Daniel Reilly, an English teacher at this school was arrested for accusations of sexual assault and rape charges after a former student's sister found sexually explicit texts between the teacher and the girl. He is no longer working at the school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/21914430/nyc-teacher-accused-of-rape |title=NYC teacher accused of rape - New York News | NYC Breaking News |publisher=Myfoxny.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-27[/tpl]
