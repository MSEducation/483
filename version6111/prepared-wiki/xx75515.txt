==History==

The split meant that the FTSE 100 Index temporarily held 101 firms, before Cable & Wireless Communications dropped to the FTSE 250 Index.Cable & Wireless demerger takes the FTSE 100 to 101 BBC News, 26 March 2010
Following the split, CWW went through a tumultuous period -  its shares, which hit a high of 98.5 pence after the split, valuing the group at $4.25 billion; fell to 13 pence in November 2011, increasing speculation it would be a takeover target.

==Operations==

===Current===

Cable & Wireless Worldwide was the third-largest supplier of IP services to FTSE 350 Index customers.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] However, with recent cable company consolidation it can no longer claim its position as the second largest UK fixed player. The fortunes of the international wholesale telecoms division of C&W UK is significant - accounting for over one third of UK revenues. Indeed, its international wholesale voice operation and IP network (AS1273) remain sizable, but commercially struggling.
Following the acquisition of Energis in August 2005, C&W strengthened its UK position but still have only half the Internet Access corporate market share of former incumbent (BT). Former CEO Francesco Caio publicly stated the aim of making C&W the preferred alternative to BT in the UK. John Pluthero, on his accession in the Energis management takeover, modified this to be the leading UK IP services company.
C&W also bought Bulldog Communications in the UK, providing it with an LLU network as well as a consumer broadband Internet service provider. During aggressive expansion it gained a poor reputation for provisioning and customer service. Falling new sales and a strategy change led C&W to sell the brand and customer base to Pipex in September 2006. It continues to own, and wholesale on, the LLU capability. In 2009 through a series of mergers and takeovers Pipex became part of TalkTalk.

===Former===

Cable & Wireless HKT was the Hong Kong operations of British-based telecom firm Cable & Wireless and was established in the then British colony in 1934. It was not until 1981 that the unit formally registered as a Hong Kong company, Cable and Wireless (Hong Kong) Limited. In 1988 Cable and Wireless (Hong Kong) Limited merged with Hong Kong Telephone Company as Hong Kong Telecom. It was renamed as Cable and Wireless HKT International in 1998. CWHKT was acquired by PCCW Limited in 2000.

==Controversy==

Shareholder groups have repeatedly warned about excessive executive remuneration at the company. Before it split into two separately listed companies in early 2010, Cable & Wireless suffered one of the biggest shareholder rebellions in 2009 when 38pc of the shareholder register failed to back the company's pay policy at a fiery meeting. 
The company's highly controversial long-term incentive plan (LTIP) is calculated on 10% of the company valuation and is claimed to pay out to senior managers, in fact the members of the LTIP are only the executive directors who for the year 2009/2010 share a £60 million bonus pool.Cable & Wireless shares tumble on austerity warning
