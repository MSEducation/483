Todd McCarthy of Hollywood Reporter spoke highly of the piece particially the "unpredictable dynamic between Eric and his father Neville", and praised enormously the acting performance of O'Connell, "Young actor Jack O'Connell is the main attraction in this tough British drama." and further adding, "O'Connell would seem to have live wires running through his whole body and it should be very interesting to follow his career from here on."[tpl]cite news|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|title=Starred Up: Telluride Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/starred-up-telluride-review-619077|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 1, 2013|date=September 1, 2013[/tpl] David Sexton of This is London praised the film, commenting that, "Starred Up is the finest British-made prison drama for a long time, courting comparison even with the likes of A Man Escaped."

Peter Debruge of Variety noted praise of Mackenzie, remarking, "Mackenzie isn't attempting to craft a larger-than-life antihero here, but delving into the sociology of this hellish subculture, where prisoners and staff alike coexist in this dehumanizing environment." and that of Asser, "Asser brings more than just realism, however, crafting the central father-son relationship on the foundation of classical Greek tragedy."[tpl]cite news|first=Peter|last=Debruge|title=Telluride Film Review: ‘Starred Up’|url=http://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/telluride-film-review-starred-up-1200594716/|newspaper=Variety|accessdate=September 1, 2013|date=September 1, 2013[/tpl] Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph commented of the piece, "Prison films have always had their share of surrogate father-son bonding, so there's something satisfying about making it biological - it's a shrewd twist in the formula."[tpl]cite news|first=Tim|last=Robey|title=Starred Up, review|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10309173/Starred-Up-review.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=October 10, 2013[/tpl] Tom Huddleston of Time Out stated, "For the most part this is furiously compelling stuff, convincingly mounted and superbly acted."[tpl]cite news|first=Tom|last=Huddleston|title=Starred Up, review|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/starred-up|newspaper=Time Out|accessdate=October 9, 2013|date=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
Rich Cline of Shadows on the Wall, albeit, noting the piece "deploys cliché in the prison-thriller genre" he adds "it continually twists its story in more personal directions, which allows the fine cast to create vividly intense characters." Furthermore, praising the acting, " O'Connell delivers a powerfully involving performance that captures Eric's inner emotional energy with remarkable balance." as well as those of Mendelsohn and Friend. And Mackenzie's "earthy, edgy direction."[tpl]cite news|first=Rich|last=Cline|title=Starred Up|url=http://www.shadowsonthewall.co.uk/13/starreup.htm|newspaper=Shadows on the Wall|accessdate=October 8, 2013|date=October 8, 2013[/tpl] Lisa Giles-Keddie of HeyUGuys praised Mackenzie's film and the underlying angle, "exploring the miserable fallout of domestic violence on children." She continued by praising the performances of O'Connell and Mendelsohn, citing, "Some outstanding performances from O'Connell and Mendelsohn, both hugely exciting actors in British cinema today." As well as Mackenzie's "commendable direction" and "talent".[tpl]cite news|first=Lisa|last=Giles-Keddie|title=LFF 2013: Starred Up Review|url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/starred-up-review/|newspaper=HeyUGuys|accessdate=October 16, 2013|date=October 16, 2013[/tpl] Jessica Kiang of The Playlist gave the film an "A-" rating, stating, "Starred Up, like its characters, never loses face, never compromises its bloodily-earned hard-man cred, yet its real agenda is one of compassion." and praising the acting, commentating, "Mendelsohn is amazing" and "The supporting cast all do excellent work too, but this is Eric’s story, and so it’s O’Connell’s film. His performance is a revelation." Allan Hunter of Screen International commended the father-son relationship of the piece, "A complex father/son relationship is viewed through a raw depiction of prison life in the riveting Starred Up."[tpl]cite news|first=Jessica|last=Kiang|title=Göteborg Review: 'Starred Up' Is An Instant Classic Of The Prison Movie Genre|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/goteborg-review-david-mackenzies-starred-up-with-breakout-jack-oconnell-ben-mendelsohn-and-rupert-friend-20140127|newspaper=The Playlist|accessdate=October 16, 2013|date=October 16, 2013[/tpl]
Jason Gorber of Twitch gave the film an "B" rating, stating "Starred Up is a gritty, intense, and shockingly unique take on the prison drama genre." Heralds the acting O'Connell and Mendelsohn, "O'Connell's performance is one of the finest of the year, and Mendelsohn once again demonstrates his unique brand of cold hearted intensity.", as well as Asser's screenplay, "Asser captures life in the system with enormous clarity." And notes the depth in its execution, "Shakespearean in its levels of violence and manipulation".[tpl]cite news|first=Jason|last=Gorber|title= TIFF 2013 Review: STARRED UP, A Gritty And Intense Morality Play|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/09/tiff-2013-review-starred-up-a-gritty-and-intense-morality-play.html|newspaper=Twitch|accessdate=September 17, 2013|date=September 17, 2013[/tpl] Anton Bitel of Eye for Film stated, "McKenzie's comes with high ambition in the pecking order of the prison flick - a subgenre known to be overcrowded, hierarchically organised and unforgivingly hostile to any weaker new entries." Adding, "Clichés are avoided by the complicated characterisation of both Neville and Oliver."

Emma Simmonds of The List spoke positively and commented, "Starred Up gives you a good sharp shake and, in doing so, truly opens your eyes." Describing Asser's script as "authentically abrasive and peppered with welcome snatches of humour" and both Mackenzie and cinematographer Michael McDonough as being able to "capture the volatility of the environment without surrendering sensitivity to character."[tpl]cite news|first=Emma|last=Simmonds|title=Starred Up|url=http://film.list.co.uk/article/55705-starred-up/|newspaper=The List|accessdate=October 16, 2013|date=October 16, 2013[/tpl] Chris Bumbray  of JoBlo.com was most praising of the piece, especially the acting performances. In regard to Mendelsohn he stated, "Mendelsohn manages to hold his own opposite O'Connell's almost Brando-like performance." And of O'Connell, "O'Connell is brilliant, managing to give Eric a kind of Bronson-like intensity, although they keep him sympathetic in that it's clear that his rage is a by-product of a vicious upbringing."[tpl]cite news|first=Chris|last=Bumbray|title=Review: Starred Up (TIFF 2013)|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/review-starred-up-tiff-2013|newspaper=JoBlo.com|accessdate=September 18, 2013|date=September 18, 2013[/tpl] Matthew Turner of View London highly praise the film and noted, "Gripping and sharply written British drama that offers an intriguing twist on the usual prison movie clichés and features a star-making performance from Jack O'Connell." Speaking highly of Asser's script and Mackenzie's ability to "Maintain an atmosphere of nail-biting tension throughout". O'Connell and Ben Mendelsohn's performances were praised.[tpl]cite news|first=Matthew|last=Turner|title=Review:Starred Up Film Review|url=http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/films/starred-up-film-review-55180.html|newspaper=View London|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=October 10, 2013[/tpl]
Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the piece an "A-" rating, commenting of director Mackenzie, "Pushing beyond the brutal exterior of his material, Mackenzie reveals the tender story of estrangement beneath, but never forces the sentimentality." And additional, "British director David Mackenzie's gradually affecting "Starred Up" has all those ingredients but uses them for more precise means that merely revealing the harsh nature of life behind bars. Mackenzie applies a sharp kitchen sink realism to this haunting setting and directs it toward an ultimately moving family drama that just happens to involve vicious convicts."[tpl]cite news|first=Eric|last=Kohn|title=Telluride Film Festival Review: 'Starred Up' Is a Moving Father-Son Drama Masquerading as a Brutal Prison Exposé|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/telluride-film-festival-review-starred-up-is-a-moving-father-son-drama-masquerading-as-a-brutal-prison-expose|newspaper=IndieWire|accessdate=August 31, 2013|date=August 31, 2013[/tpl]
Mark Kermode of The Observer gave a positive review of the piece, commenting, "Mackenzie keeps us grounded in the maze of prison life, coaxing powerful performances from his cast, each apparently encouraged and emboldened to find their own space." Speaking highly of Friend's performance as "terrifically edgy" and describing O'Connell's as "An electrified and electrifying performance" furthering such a statement by remarking "there's a hint of the young Malcolm McDowell about him." He concludes by praising cinematographer Michael McDonough's ability to "capture the claustrophobia of the physical environment without reducing the characters within the frame."
