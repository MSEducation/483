[[Khwe language]]

CATEGORIES: Khoe languages, Languages of Botswana, Languages of South Africa

Khwe [tpl]sc|aka[/tpl] Kxoe ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔɪ[/tpl]) is a dialect continuum of the Khoe family of Namibia, Angola, Botswana, South Africa, and small parts of Zambia, with some 11,000 speakers. It is learned locally as a second language in Namibia, but the language is being lost in Botswana as speakers shift to Tswana. Thousands of Kxoe were murdered in Angola after independence, as they had been used by the Portuguese as trackers, and the survivors fled to Zambia. However, some may have returned to Angola more recently. 
There is currently a dictionary of the Kxoe language.

==Name==

Khwe is the preferred spelling of the Khwe people, also commonly written Khoe.  Khoe-dam and Khwedam are also seen. 
Other names and spellings of ǁAni include ǀAnda, Gǀanda, Handá, Gani, Tanne, and Tsʼéxa with various combinations of -kwe/khwe/khoe and -dam.

==Speaker breakdown==

Namibia: 3,700 
Angola and Zambia: 300–400 
Botswana: 2,700 (incl. 1,000 ǁAni) 
South Africa: 1,300 

==Dialects==

Eastern and Western dialects, ǁXom-Buma and ǁXo-Buga, have been largely leveled since resettlement in the mid 1970s.  Khwe and ǁAni are an ethnic distinction, and in 2000 the two groups founded a committee to establish a common standard language.

==Phonology==

Khwe has 32 or 36 clicks, depending on whether one counts the four prenasalized clicks. There are four places of articulation, [tpl]IPAblink|ǀ[/tpl],  [tpl]IPAblink|ǃ[/tpl],  [tpl]IPAblink|ǂ[/tpl], and [tpl]IPAblink|ǁ[/tpl], each with several "releases". Miller (2011), in a comparative study with other languages, interprets the description in Kilian-Hatz (2003) as follows, illustrated with the palatal articulation:Amanda Miller, 2011.
