</ref> After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''Further Down the Spiral'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia and subsequently embarked on the [[Outside Tour|Dissonance Tour]], which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner David Bowie. Nine Inch Nails was the opening act for the tour, and its set transitioned into Bowie's set with joint performances of both bands' songs.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=215â€“220[/tpl] However, the crowds reportedly did not respond positively to the pairing due to their creative differences.<ref>

The tour concluded with "Nights of Nothing", a three-night showcase of performances from Nothing Records bands Marilyn Manson, Prick, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Pop Will Eat Itself, which ended with an 80-minute set from Nine Inch Nails. Kerrang! described the Nine Inch Nails set during the Nights of Nothing showcase as "tight, brash and dramatic", but was disappointed at the lack of new material. On the second of the three nights, Richard Patrick was briefly reunited with the band and contributed guitar to a performance of "Head Like a Hole".[ref]
