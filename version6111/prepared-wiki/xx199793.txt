Todd Kenneth Strueby (born June 15, 1963 in Lanigan, Saskatchewan and raised in Humboldt, Saskatchewan) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey centre who played most of his career in the minor leagues.
Strueby played junior hockey for the Regina Pats and Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He played for the Canada national junior hockey team at the 1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where Canada won the gold medal.
Strueby was selected in the second round of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers.  He made his National Hockey League debut in the 1981–82 season, appearing in three games before returning to the Blades.  He was also called up for one game in the 1982–83 season, his last in the WHL.  Strueby turned professional for the 1983–84 season, but spent almost that entire season playing for the minor league Moncton Alpines.  His single game played for the Oilers that season would be his last in the NHL.
Strueby spent the next four seasons playing for the Nova Scotia Oilers in the American Hockey League and for the Muskegon Lumberjacks and Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League.  He spent the next three seasons (1988–91) playing for the Canadian national team and for EHC Freiburg in the German ice hockey Bundesliga.  He returned to the IHL for the 1991–92 season, playing for the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, and he retired in 1993.
