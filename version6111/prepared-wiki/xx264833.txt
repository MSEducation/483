Hockey Sock Rock is a song written and produced by Alan Thicke, as a publicity tool for the New York Rangers and the NHL in 1979, as Rangers president Sonny Werblin worked to make the Rangers more hip in disco-era New York City; the proceeds of the recording went to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.  It was released on Platinum Records 1217-75. Ranger Dave Maloney later said that supposedly, the record went on to sell over 100,000 copies; yet 90,000 of the sales could be attributed to Gordon Lightfoot, as he was a friend of Thicke's.[tpl]cite web|last=DeLessio|first=Joe|title=Dave Maloney on 'Hockey Sock Rock' and Realistic Goals for the Rangers|url=http://nymag.com/daily/sports/2011/10/dave-maloney-on-realistic-goals-for-the-rangers.html|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=5 October 2011[/tpl]
