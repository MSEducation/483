Italy's Federica Pellegrini broke a new world record of 1:54.82 to claim a gold medal in the event, which was probably the weakest on the female program. Sara Isakovič, who finished behind Pellegrini by 0.15 of a second, cleared a 1:55 barrier to set a new Slovenian record of 1:54.97, and ultimately become the nation's first ever medalist in swimming. China's Pang Jiaying edged out U.S. swimmer Katie Hoff on the final lap to pick up a bronze in 1:55.05. Hoff settled only for fourth place in an American record of 1:55.78.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Federica Pellegrini Breaks 1:55, Lowers 200 Free World Record|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18791.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Pellegrini takes 200m free gold|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/swimming/7557692.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Katie Hoff falls short in 200 freestyle, 200 IM |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26166830/#.UZiKncpYr9k|publisher=NBC News|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]
Defending champion Camelia Potec finished outside the medals in fifth place, posting a Romanian record of 1:56.87. Great Britain's Caitlin McClatchey earned a sixth spot in 1:57.65, and was followed by a seventh-place tie between Australia's Bronte Barratt and France's Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne in a matching time of 1:57.83. For the first time in Olympic history, all eight swimmers went faster than a winning time of 1:58.03, previously set by Potec in Athens four years earlier.
Earlier in the prelims, Pang broke one of the oldest Olympic records in the book, when she clocked at 1:57.37 to lead the fourth heat, slashing 0.28 seconds off the old, drug-tainted mark set by East Germany's Heike Friedrich from Seoul in 1988. Two heats later, Pellegrini posted a top-seeded time of 1:55.45 to erase Laure Manaudou's world record, set in 2007.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Federica Pellegrini Downs World Record in 200 Free Prelims|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18762.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=11 August 2008|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]
