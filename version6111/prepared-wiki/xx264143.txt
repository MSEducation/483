==Merger with Cotton Research Association==

By at least 1955 it was apparent that there was potential for overlap in research with the work of the British Cotton Industry Research Association. In 1957 an official agreement was made to avoid duplication.The Times, 18 February 1957, page 15
Wilson retired from the BRRA in 1958, and Len Wiseman became Director.
Consensus emerged that a merger between the BCIRA and BRRA was needed. BRRA's life ended with its merger with the BCRA to form the Cotton, Silk, and Man-Made Fibres Research Association in 1961, better known as the Shirley Institute.Hansard, written answers, 9 February 1961 Len Wiseman was appointed its Deputy Director.Len Wiseman obituary, TI News, Textile Institute 2009
