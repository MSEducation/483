[[Interval (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Sets of real numbers, Order theory, Topology

Real intervals play an important role in the theory of integration, because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define.  The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the Borel measure and eventually to the Lebesgue measure.
Intervals are central to interval arithmetic, a general numerical computing technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and arithmetic roundoff.
Intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary totally ordered set, such as integers or rational numbers. The notation of integer intervals is considered in the special section below.

==Notations for intervals==

The interval of numbers between [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl], including [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl], is often denoted [tpl]closed-closed|a, b[/tpl]. The two numbers are called the endpoints of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a decimal comma, a semicolon may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity.

===Excluding the endpoints===

To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in International standard ISO 31-11.  Thus, in set builder notation,
Note that [tpl]open-open|a, a[/tpl], [tpl]closed-open|a, a[/tpl], and [tpl]open-closed|a, a[/tpl] represent the empty set, whereas [tpl]closed-closed|a, a[/tpl] denotes the set [tpl]math|{a} [/tpl].  When [tpl]math|a > b[/tpl], all four notations are usually assumed to represent the empty set.

===Infinite endpoints===

The notations [tpl]closed-closed|−∞, b[/tpl] , [tpl]closed-open|−∞, b[/tpl] , [tpl]closed-closed|a, +∞[/tpl] , and [tpl]open-closed|a, +∞[/tpl] are ambiguous.  For authors who define intervals as subsets of the real numbers, those notations are either meaningless, or equivalent to the open variants. In the latter case, the interval comprising all real numbers is both open and closed, [tpl]open-open|−∞, +∞[/tpl] = [tpl]closed-closed|−∞, +∞[/tpl] = [tpl]closed-open|−∞, +∞[/tpl] = [tpl]open-closed|−∞, +∞[/tpl] .
On the extended real number line the intervals are all different as this includes [tpl]math|−∞[/tpl] and [tpl]math|+∞[/tpl] elements. For example [tpl]open-closed|−∞, +∞[/tpl] means the extended real numbers excluding only [tpl]math|−∞[/tpl].
The notation [tpl]closed-closed|a .. b[/tpl] when [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] are integers, or [tpl]math|{a .. b} [/tpl], or just [tpl]math|a .. b[/tpl] is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all integers between [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl], including both.  This notation is used in some programming languages; in Pascal, for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid indices of an array.
