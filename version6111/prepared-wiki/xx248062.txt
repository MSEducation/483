==History==

In the thirteenth century the Order of St. Anthony was established here.[tpl]cite book |title=Lyon et ses rues |last=Brun De La Valette |first=Robert |publisher=Le Fleuve |place=Paris |year=1969 |language=French |page=40[/tpl] This square partly absorbed the Rue Pierre-Percée, now called rue Monseigneur Lavarenne.
The square was modified when the Quai Fulchiron was created in 1858, then expanded after the destruction of houses that prolonged the rue Lavarenne.[tpl]cite web |title=Place Benoît-Crépu |url=http://ruesdelyon.wysiup.net/PageRubrique.php?ID=1006083&rubID=1006158# |publisher=Rues de Lyon |language=French |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] The square was renovated for the construction of an underground car park from 2001 to 2006. During this work, various objects, including three Gallo-Roman boats, relatively well preserved, dating from the first or second century, were discovered. Similarly, while digging the tunnel which connects the parking under the rue Monseigneur-Lavarenne, several buildings of the Middle Ages were discovered, apparently abandoned after the many floods of the Saône. Some of the old ramparts were also found. All archaeological discoveries caused a six to nine-month delay of work.[tpl]cite web |title=Place Benoît-Crépu |url=http://www.inrap.fr/archeologie-preventive/Sites-archeologiques/p-935-Place-Benoit-Crepu.htm |publisher=Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives |date=5 October 2009 |language=French |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Archéologie et environnement dans la Méditerranée antique |first1=Dumasy |last1=Françoise |first2=Queyrel |last2=François |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=TJKE_poINksC&pg=PP1&dq=place+beno%C3%AEt-cr%C3%A9pu&lr=&cd=45#v=onepage&q=place%20beno%C3%AEt%20cr%C3%A9pu&f=false |year=2009 |page=247 |language=French[/tpl]

The vegetation consists mainly of silk trees and groves of laurel[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |title=Lyon et ses parcs et jardins — Grand Lyon, département du Rhône |first=Pierrick |last=Eberhard |publisher=Éditions Lyonnaises d'Art et d'Histoire |place=Lyon |year=2010 |isbn=2-84147-218-3 |language=French |page=41[/tpl]
The majority of the square consists of two rows of four to six-storey buildings with narrow facades generally built in the 19th century. The building between the wharf and the rue Lavarenne was created in 1845 ; it has  six different floors with a Virgin and Child at the corner of the wharf. At No. 8, two plaques say the height of the floods of the Saône on 5 November 1840 and 21 May 1856.
After having served for a while as a station for trolleys and buses, the square was gradually transformed into a large garden through a space reorganization. In 2008, landscapers of the Ilex agency completely modified the square.
The Église Saint-Georges is near the square.
