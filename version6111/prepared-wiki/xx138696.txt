==Biography==

Barron was born in Port Chester, New York. He was one of barely a dozen professional golfers who earned their living as touring professionals in the 1930s and 1940s. His first professional win came at the 1934 Philadelphia Open. On February 8, 1942, Barron became the first Jewish golfer to win an official PGA Tour event by winning the Western Open by two strokes over Henry Picard at Phoenix Golf Club in Phoenix, Arizona.
Barron was consistently among the Tour's top money winners. His best year came in 1946. During a three-week period, he won the Philadelphia Inquirer Open, finished fourth in the U.S. Open, and won the All-American Championship at Tam O'Shanter in Chicago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishsports.net/BioPages/HermanBarron.htm|title=Biographical information from International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame[/tpl]
Barron played on America's victorious 1947 Ryder Cup team, but was soon forced into retiring as a touring professional due to failing health. For the next 15 years, he held the position of teaching pro at the Fenway Golf Club in Westchester County, New York.
Barron returned to the touring circuit in the early 1960s and won the 1963 Senior PGA Championship.
Barron continued to work as a teaching pro until his death in Pompano Beach, Florida at the age of 68. He played a large role in the development of Israel's first golf course, at Caesarea. He is enshrined in the Westchester Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Fenway Golf Club|url=http://www.fenwaygolfclub.com/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&pageid=277974&ssid=151829&vnf=1[/tpl]
