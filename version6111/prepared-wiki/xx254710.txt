The GE C40-8M is a 6-axle diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1990 to 1994. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and is often referred to as a Dash 8-40CM.
Mechanically identical to the Dash 8-40CW, the Dash 8-40CM was constructed only for Canadian railways, with a production total of 84 units.  It is distinguished from the Dash 8-40CW by the addition of a full-width cowl body and the use of a Canada-specific nose and windshield configuration. The trucks also differ, all units built ride on trucks taken from retired Alco/Montreal Locomotive Works locomotives.

==Technical==

The Dash 8-40CM is powered by a [tpl]convert|4000|hp|adj=on[/tpl] V16 7FDL diesel engine driving a GE GMG187 main alternator. The power generated by the main alternator drives six GE 752AG or 752AH direct current traction motors, each with a gear ratio of 83:20 and connected to [tpl]convert|40|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] wheels which allow the Dash 8-40CM a maximum speed of 70 mph (110 km/h). 
Depending on customer options, the Dash 8-40CM carries approximately [tpl]convert|5000|gal|L[/tpl] of diesel fuel, [tpl]convert|410|gal|L[/tpl] of lubricating oil, and [tpl]convert|380|gal|L[/tpl] of coolant.  Like most North American diesel locomotives, the Dash 8-40CM uses normal water for cooling.  The Dash 8-40CM has a maximum tractive effort of [tpl]convert|108600|lbf|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|11|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] with the 83:20 gearing. Overall dimensions for the Dash 8-40CM are [tpl]convert|70|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in Length, [tpl]convert|15|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in height and [tpl]convert|10|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in width.
