==Club career==

===Early years===

Born in Aba, Abia, Uche's career began in his country with Amanze United and Iwuanyanwu Nationale. Aged just 18 he moved to Racing de Ferrol in the Spanish second division, appearing in 24 games in his second season, which ended in relegation for the Galician team.
Uche then joined another club in the country's second level, Recreativo de Huelva, for a fee of US$300,000, and scored 12 goals in his first year, becoming the league's top scorer in the 2005–06 campaign at 20 in just 28 appearances (with five braces), as the Andalusians returned – as champions – to La Liga after a three-year absence.
In his first top flight season Uche scored on eight occasions. Notably, he netted in three consecutive matches in November 2006 (with wins at Celta de Vigo and against CA Osasuna), helping Recre finish eight.
For 2007–08 Uche joined Madrid's Getafe CF, mainly being used as a substitute. On 29 November 2008, also from the bench, he scored in a 3–1 home win over Real Madrid.[tpl]cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/252901?cc=5739|title=Miserable return for Schuster|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=29 November 2008|accessdate=31 August 2011[/tpl]
