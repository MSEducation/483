Arthur Davidson, Sr. (c. 1881–1950, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was one of the four original founders of Harley-Davidson. His father William C Davidson, son of a blacksmith who owned a smithy in Netherton, Scotland, had emigrated to the United States around the year 1857 where he became a cabinet maker and married Margaret McFarlane in 1867.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/harley-davidson-devotees-rescue-crumbling-scots-home-of-legendary-motorbike-maker-1-2291800|title=Harley-Davidson devotees rescue crumbling Scots home of legendary motorbike maker|last=Cowing|first=Emma|date=13 May 2012|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=6 April 2014[/tpl]
One of Davidson's favorite pastimes was fishing in the Wisconsin wilderness, which inspired him to create a motorcycle that would, "take the hard work out of pedaling a bicycle". He was a story teller, salesman, and United States patriot. During World Wars I and II, Arthur and company diverted motorcycle production to support US troops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cannonsuperstore.com/harleywla.html|title=World War Two Harley Davidson WLA & WLC Motorcycles Available!|accessdate=6 April 2014[/tpl] This act was rewarded with returning troops ready, trained and willing to buy Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The "Honey Uncle" story is one of the family stories told about Davidson and a pivotal moment for the fate of Harley-Davidson company. One day shortly after Davidson's cleaning lady visited, he discovered the seed money he had stashed between his mattress to start Harley-Davidson was missing.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Fortunately, Davidson was able to borrow the $500 in venture capital needed for Harley-Davidson from an uncle who owned a bee farm in Madison, Wisconsin.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] From then on, the uncle was known as the "Honey Uncle" for helping the business get off the ground.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The bee farm on Lake Mendota was later sold to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and is now known as Picnic Point in the Lakeshore Nature Preserve.http://www.lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/visit/picnicpoint.htm
