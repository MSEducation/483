[[Mathematical constants by continued fraction representation]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical constants, Continued fractions

This is a list of mathematical constants sorted by their representations as continued fractions.
Continued fractions with more than 20 known terms have been truncated, with an ellipsis to show that they continue.  Rational numbers have two continued fractions; the version in this list is the shorter one.  Decimal representations are rounded or padded to 10 places if the values are known.
