True Love is a five-episode 2012 semi-improvised BBC television drama, which began on BBC One on 17 June 2012. 
Each episode is a self-contained story (though there is some cross-over between all the episodes), devised through improvisation (a first for BBC One drama), exploring an issue related to love and relationships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/08_august/26/love.shtml|title=Love Life: five original, provocative love stories from Dominic Savage for BBC One|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl]

The series premiered on 17 June 2012 on BBC One, the remaining four episodes being stripped across the next three nights, with the final two airing as a double-bill on 20 June.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k692j/episodes/guide | work=BBC One Website | location=London | title=BBC One - True Love - Episode Guide | date=June 2012 | accessdate= 16 June 2012[/tpl] True Love was originally titled Love Life but was re-titled, as ITV also has a TV series with the same title.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3927:bbc-and-itv-resolve-love-life-clash&catid=1:tv-media&Itemid=3 | work=ATV Today | title=BBC and ITV resolve Love Life clash | date=25 February 2012 | accessdate= 25 February 2012[/tpl]

==Reception==

The first episode was generally received negatively by critics. Reviewing the episode for The Daily Telegraph, Isabel Mohan criticised the plot and Margate backdrop, both of which she found uninspiring,[tpl]cite news|first=Isabel |last=Mohan |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9334968/True-Love-BBC-One-review.html |title=True Love, BBC One, review |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |location=London[/tpl] while Sam Wollaston of The Guardian compared the storyline, overlaid with sentimental music, unfavourably to an edition of the Our Tune radio feature.[tpl]cite news|first=Sam |last=Wollaston |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/17/into-orbit-culture-show-special?newsfeed=true |title=TV review: Into Orbit: A Culture Show Special; Secrets of Our Living Planet; True Love | Television & radio |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |location=London[/tpl] The Independent's Terence Blacker was also unenthusiastic: "It messed up the story, revealing the outcome of a will-they-won't-they tale of infidelity before a single word of dialogue had been spoken."[tpl]cite news|first=Terence |last=Blacker |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/terence-blacker/terence-blacker-its-a-fascinating-time-for-love--but-tv-cant-keep-up-7858753.html |title=Terence Blacker: It's a fascinating time for love â€“ but TV can't keep up |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |location=London[/tpl]
