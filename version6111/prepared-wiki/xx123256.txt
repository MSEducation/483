The NASA Academy is NASA's premiere leadership training program for undergraduate and graduate students. Since its founding in 1993, the NASA Academy has brought together future leaders of the aerospace industry and exposed them to the inner workings of NASA, academia, and industry. The Academy consists of a ten-week summer program hosted by a participating NASA center. Currently there are academies at Ames Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center and Glenn Research Center. Goddard Space Flight Center and Dryden Flight Research Center previously hosted NASA Academies, as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/org_academy_overview.html |title=NAAA - NASA Academy Program Overview |publisher=Nasa-academy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]

==History==

The NASA Academy at was founded in 1993 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center by Gerald "Gerry" Soffen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen/ |title=Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial at NASA Academy Alumni Association |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl] The concept was largely based on the concept of the International Space University. Soffen envisioned the NASA Academy as a leadership program with an inter-disciplinary approach similar to ISU, but without the emphasis on the international and intercultural aspects. Specifically, Soffen created the program to "give possible 'leaders' a view into how NASA, the university community, and the private sector function; to set their priorities; and to contribute to the success of the aerospace program."[ref]

==Mission Statement==

The NASA Academy states its mission as follows: "to identify and recruit the future leaders of the space exploration community, to introduce them to the key aspects of the industry, to provide them with critical training, and to build an ever-expanding network of these future leaders, so that these young scientists and engineers are prepared to assume the highest responsibilities of a career dedicated to leadership in space exploration."[ref]

==Program Overview==

The 2010 NASA Academy Definitions Document outlines six key criteria that are critical to the program and which, when taken as a whole, differentiate it from other NASA leadership development programs:
NASA Academy students are typically expected to work long hours: as a general rule, the day is scheduled from 07:30 to 21:00, after which students work on the Team Project or on individual research assignments. However, NASA Academy students are also typically given excellent opportunities, including field trips to other centers and excellent access to the leaders and decision-makers of the aerospace industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/nasa_academy/ |title=TSGC | NASA Academy |publisher=Tsgc.utexas.edu |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]
A NASA Academy class typically varies from 10-20 students per center per year. Participants are selected in a joint effort between the NASA Center, the NASA Academy Alumni Association, the PIs, and the State Space Grant Consortia. For several years in the early 2000s (decade), the NASA Academy at GSFC admitted a French student every year as part of a cooperative agreement with the Centre National d'Ã‰tudes Spatiales, the French space agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Education/SEM8KVCJD3G_0.html |title=ESA - Education - Opportunity for European students to attend NASA Academy 2010 |publisher=Esa.int |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]
