I Count is a campaign of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition of UK NGOs.
The campaign aims to ensure that world leaders act on rising global greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep average global temperature increase to under 2°C (3.6°F) and so avoiding the more serious consequences of global warming.
In 2006 the campaign focused on the lead up to the Queen's speech, urging the Government to introduce a Climate Change Bill in the forthcoming Parliamentary session - including legally binding cuts  in emissions (3% per year and 50% by 2050), and an annual carbon budget.
The coalition organised the iCount Climate Change Rally on the 4th of November 2006 to coincide with the Stern Report.
The campaign is now focusing on the contents of the Climate Change Bill and have criticised the initial proposals as failing to take into account the 2°C 'global warming danger threshold'.

==I Count Rally==

The i Count London Climate Change Rally was a demonstration organised by Stop Climate Chaos in London on November 4, 2006. It was attended by 20,000 to 25,000 people and was timed to coincide with the release of the Stern Report, calling on the government to take more serious action to prevent damage from climate change.
The event started with an initial rally at Grosvenor Square, outside the US Embassy, where George Monbiot, Caroline Lucas, and Norman Baker addressed the crowd. The rally marched to Trafalgar Square, joining with an already assembled crowd.  More speakers addressed the crowd, musicians Razorlight and KT Tunstall performed. The Vj duo Marco Ruffatti and Alberto Roveroni of Cluster One http://www.cluster-1.com closed the event with a live interactive Vj set.
