The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary expresses the Virgin Mary's "real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to Jesus the Son of God made Man". According to the doctrine, Mary was ever-virgin ([tpl]lang-grc-gre|ἀειπάρθενος|aeiparthenos[/tpl]) for the whole of her life, making Jesus her only biological son, whose conception and birth are held to be miraculous.
By the fourth century, the doctrine was widely supported by the Church Fathers, and by the seventh century it had been affirmed in a number of ecumenical councils. The doctrine is part of the teaching of Catholicism and Anglo-Catholics, as well as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, as expressed in their liturgies, in which they repeatedly refer to Mary as "ever virgin".Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 ISBN 0-87779-044-2 page 1134Catechism of the Catholic Church §499Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom, Coptic Liturgy of St Basil, Liturgy of St Cyril, Liturgy of St James, Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy etc.
Some early Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther supported the doctrine, and founding figures of Anglicanism such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer "followed the tradition that they had inherited by accepting Mary as 'ever virgin'" Timothy Bradshaw, "Commentary and Study Guide on the Seattle Statement Mary: Hope and Grace in Christ of the Anglican – Roman Catholic International Commission"). However, later Reformed teaching largely abandoned it. The doctrine of perpetual virginity is, however, currently maintained by some Anglican and Lutheran theologians.Jackson, Gregory Lee, Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison. 1993 ISBN 978-0-615-16635-3 page 254Richard R.

==Doctrine and representations==

The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, which is believed de fide (i.e. held by Catholics as being an essential part of faith), states that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth for all her life.Mark Miravalle, 1993, Introduction to Mary, Queenship Publishing ISBN 978-1-882972-06-7, pages 56-64Vatican website Catechism of the Catholic Church item 499 The threefold nature this doctrine (referring to before, during and after) thus subsumes the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus.Mary in the New Testament edited by Raymond Edward Brown 1978 ISBN 0-8091-2168-9 page 273
The doctrine of perpetual virginity is also distinct from the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, which relates to the conception of the Virgin Mary herself without any stain (macula in Latin) of original sin.A history of the church in the Middle Ages by F. Donald Logan, 2002, ISBN 0-415-13289-4, p150
The Greek term Aeiparthenos (i.e. "Ever Virgin") is attested to by Epiphanius of Salamis from the early 4th century.Joseph, Mary, Jesus by Lucien Deiss, Madeleine Beaumont 1996 ISBN 0-8146-2255-0 page 30 It is widely used in the liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church.The image of the Virgin Mary in the Akathistos hymn by Leena Mari Peltomaa 2001 ISBN 90-04-12088-2 page 127 The Catechism of the Catholic Church (item 499) also includes to the term Aeiparthenos and referring to the dogmatic constitution Lumen Gentium (item 57) states: "Christ's birth did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it."Catechism of the Catholic Church by the Vatican, 2002 ISBN 0-86012-324-3 page 112Vatican website: Catechism item 499Vatican website: Lumen Gentium item 57 The doctrine of perpetual virginity is also held by some Anglican and some Lutheran churches, but not all of those churches endorse the doctrine. Eastern Orthodox liturgical prayers typically end with "Remembering our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and Ever Virgin Mary".Eastern Orthodoxy through Western eyes by Donald Fairbairn 2002 ISBN 0-664-22497-0 page 100
The virginity of Mary at the time of her conception of Jesus is a key topic in Marian art in the Catholic Church, usually represented as the annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would virginally conceive a child to be born the Son of God. Frescos depicting this scene have appeared in Roman Catholic Marian churches for centuries.Annunciation Art, Phaidon Press, 2004, ISBN 0-7148-4447-0 The oldest fresco of the annunciation is a 4th-century depiction in the Catacomb of Priscilla in Rome.The Annunciation to Mary by Eugene Laverdiere 2007 ISBN 1-56854-557-6 page 29
Mary's virginity even after her conception of Jesus is regularly represented in the Christian art of both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox (as well as in early Western religious art) by including in Nativity scenes the figure of Salome, whom the Gospel of James presents as finding that Mary had preserved her virginity even in giving birth to her son.Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography by Helene E. Roberts 1998 ISBN 1-57958-009-2 page 904Treasures from the Ark: 1700 Years of Armenian Christian Art by Vrej Nersessian 2001 ISBN 0-7123-4699-6 page 167 In many icons, Mary's perpetual virginity is signified by three stars that appear on her left, her right, and above her or on her head, which represent her virginity before, during and after giving birth.Heroes of the icon: people, places, events by Steven Bigham 1998 ISBN 1-879038-91-9 page 47The icon handbook by David Coomler 1995 ISBN 0-87243-210-6 page 203

==Development of the doctrine==

===Early Church===

As of the second century, interest developed within the early Church regarding the conception of Jesus and the virginity of Mary."The Theme of Mary's Virginity", in Mary in the New Testament edited by Raymond Edward Brown 1978 ISBN 0-8091-2168-9 pages 267-277 The majority of early Christian writers accepted the virginal conception of Jesus via reliance on the accounts in the gospels of Luke and Matthew, yet, the focus of these early discussions was of virginity before birth, not during or afterwards.
The interpretation of the Matthew 1:25 statement that Joseph "knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son" and of the various New Testament mentions of the brothers (and sisters) of Jesus is discussed below under the heading "Scripture". Some early writers, Tertullian, Helvidius and Eunomius of Cyzicus, interpreted Matthew's statement to mean that Joseph and Mary did have normal marital relations after Jesus' birth, and that James, Joses, Jude, and Simon were the biological sons of Mary and Joseph, a view held by Helvidius and Eunomius.M. DelCogliano Tradition and Polemic in Basil of Caesarea's Homily on the Theophany - Vigiliae Christianae, 2012, p. 41: "Another objection to Mary's perpetual virginity, for which, however, there is scant evidence before the middle of the fourth century (to be discussed in more detail below), was based on an interpretation of Matthew 1:25, according to which Joseph refrained from marital relations with Mary until the birth of Jesus, but initiated them after he was born."
A second-century document that paid special attention to Mary’s virginity was originally known as the Nativity of Mary, but later became known as the Protoevangelium of James.L. Gambero, Mary and the Fathers of the Church trans. T. Buffer (San Francisco: Ignatius, 1991), p. 35. The document tells of Mary’s virginity before giving birth, the miraculous way in which she gave birth, and her physical virginity even after giving birth.Protoevangelium of James (M.R. James translation), XIX-XXL. Gambero, Mary and the Fathers of the Church trans. T. Buffer (San Francisco: Ignatius, 1991), p. 40.Quasten, Patrology 1:120-1. The work also claims that Jesus' "brothers" and "sisters"[tpl]bibleverse ||Matthew|13:56[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse ||Mark|6:3[/tpl] are Joseph’s children from a marriage previous to his union with Mary.Protoevangelium chapters 7–8. However, this text does not explicitly assert Mary's perpetual virginity after the birth of Jesus.
The "brothers" and "sisters" of Jesus mentioned in the Gospels, and the "James, the Lord's brother", mentioned in [tpl]bibleverse||Galatians|1:19[/tpl], "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James", mentioned by JosephusJosephus, Antiquities, book 20, chapter 9 were thus interpreted by some texts as not being children of Mary.
There was no full consensus on the doctrine of perpetual virginity within the early Church by the end of the second century, e.g. Tertullian (c.160 – c.225) did not teach the doctrine (although he taught virgin birth), but Irenaeus  (c.130 – c.202) taught perpetual virginity, along with other Marian themes. However, wider support for the doctrine began to appear within the next century.
Origen (185-254) was emphatic on the issue of the brothers of Jesus, and stated that he believed them to have been the children of Joseph from a previous marriage.The Westminster handbook to Origen by John Anthony McGuckin 2004 ISBN 0-664-22472-5 page 150
Helvidius appealed to the authority of Tertullian against the doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity, to which Jerome (c.340-419) replied that Tertullian was "not a man of the church."Tertullian, Treatises on marriage and remarriage: - Page 160  ed. T. C. Lawler, Walter J. Burghardt - 1951 "Helvidius appealed to the authority of Tertullian in his attack on the Church's doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity, ... I have nothing else to say except that he was not a man of the Church (Ecclesiae hominem ,non fuisse)."
By the 4th century, the doctrine of perpetual virginity had been well attested.L. Gambero, Mary and the Fathers of the Church trans. T. Buffer (San Francisco: Ignatius, 1991) pp. 97-98; and also for an overview of each source. For example, references can be found in the 3rd century writings of Hippolytus of Rome, who called Mary "the tabernacle exempt from defilement and corruption,"  and the 4th century works of Athanasius,Athanasius, Orations against the Arians 2.70 Epiphanius,Epiphanius of Salamis, The Man Well-Anchored 120, c.f. Medicine Chest Against All Heresies 78:6 Hilary,Hilary of Poitiers, Commentary on Matthew §1:4 Didymus,Didymus the Blind, The Trinity 3:4 Ambrose,Ambrose of Milan, Letters 63:111 Jerome,Jerome, Against Helvetius, 21 and SiriciusDenziger §91 continued the attestations to perpetual virginity [tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] a trend that gathered pace in the next century.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W.

===Church Fathers and the Middle Ages===

John Chrysostom (347–407) defended perpetual virginity on a number of grounds, one of which was Jesus' commands to his mother in Calvary: "Woman, behold your son!" and to his disciple "Behold, thy mother!" in John 19:26-27.Mary for evangelicals: toward an understanding of the mother of our Lord by Tim S. Perry, William J. Abraham 2006 ISBN 0-8308-2569-Xpages 153-154John 11-21 by Joel C. Elowsky 2007 ISBN 0-8308-1099-4 page 318 Since the second century these two statements of Jesus from the cross had been the basis of reasonings that Mary had no other children and "from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home" because after the deaths of Joseph and Jesus there was no one else to look after Mary, and she had to be entrusted to the disciple.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008).

By the time of Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine of Hippo, with the increased emphasis on Marian piety, a wider role for Mary began to appear in the context of the history of salvation. Augustine himself presented a number of arguments in favor of the doctrine of perpetual virginity.Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia by John C. Cavadini 1999 ISBN 0-8028-3843-X page 544[ref]''St. Augustine, Faith, Hope & Charity
