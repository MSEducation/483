==Background==

The Florida Marlins made Adrian Gonzalez of Eastlake High School in Chula Vista, CA the first overall selection in the 2000 First-Year Player Draft. Gonzalez, who was rated as the best pure high school hitter in the draft by Baseball America, was the first high school first baseman taken first overall since the New York Yankees chose Ron Blomberg in 1967. In his senior year, Gonzalez hit .645 with 13 home runs and 34 RBI. 
Among the college players chosen was David Parrish, son of former major leaguer Lance Parrish, by the New York Yankees with the 28th pick. In addition, David Espinosa, a high school shortstop from Miami, FL, became the first RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) alumnus ever selected in the first round of the draft. 
Infielder Xavier Nady, second round pick of the San Diego Padres out of the University of California, went straight to the Major Leagues in 2000. He became the 19th player to do so since the draft started in 1965.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/index.jsp?feature=decade2000s|title=Background on the 2000 MLB Draft|accessdate=April 2, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080402021100/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/index.jsp?feature=decade2000s|archivedate=2 April 2008 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
