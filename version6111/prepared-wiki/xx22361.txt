She worked at the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Daily News, and wrote for The New Republic, People, The Nation, and Boston Magazine. She wrote a syndicated social commentary column -- "Margo"—in the 1970s.

For several years, Howard wrote the Dear Prudence column featured in Slate magazine. Dear Prudence also was featured on National Public Radio and syndicated in more than 200 newspapers.

Her aunt, Pauline Esther Friedman Phillips, wrote the Dear Abby column. Although her mother and aunt were twin sisters and close while growing up, an intense rivalry developed between them because of their columns. In an echo of that rivalry, Howard has had several public differences with her cousin Jeanne Phillips, who took over the Dear Abby column when her mother became ill with Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
