Hambleton Junction is a grade-separated railway junction near Selby, North Yorkshire, England, which connects the East Coast Main Line with the Leeds to Selby Line.
The junction was opened in 1983 as part of the Selby Diversion, which diverted the East Coast Main Line away from the Selby coalfield. The Leeds to Selby Line passes over the East Coast Main Line on a bridge. Sharply-curved chords allow southbound trains on the East Coast Main Line to head eastwards towards Selby (and vice versa), and eastbound trains heading away from Leeds to join the southbound East Coast Main Line (and vice versa).
The junction is regularly used by Northern Rail services between York and Selby.
At present only the East Coast Main Line running under the junction is electrified, however previous east coast rail operator GNER proposed electrifying the Leeds to Selby Line as far as this junction and its east-south chord.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wypta.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/FDE89D80-0008-46DC-BC73-90B9FC96AED1/0/RWG41005ITEM5.pdf|title=Rolling Stock and Network Development Issues|date=2005-10-04|accessdate=2008-10-05|publisher=West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority[/tpl] Though GNER lost its franchise in 2007, electrification of the line appears to be part of the plans for East Leeds Parkway station which was allocated funding in April 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wymetro.com/News/08/080404-1.htm|title=Transport Board funding welcomed|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2008-10-05|publisher=Metro[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
