CATEGORIES: Virgin Mary in art, Roman Catholic Church paintings, Roman Catholic Church sculpture

A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she is depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic areas. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12C-15C), with dark or black features whose exact origins are not always easy to determine.Duricy, Michael P., "Black Madonnas", Marian Library, Univ of Dayton The statues are mostly wooden but occasionally stone, often painted and up to [tpl]convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. They fall into two main groups: free-standing upright figures and seated figures on a throne. The pictures are usually icons which are Byzantine in style, often made in 13th or 14th century Italy. There are about 450â€“500 Black Madonnas in Europe, depending on how they are classified. There are at least 180 Vierges Noires in France, and there are hundreds of non-medieval copies as well. Some are in museums, but most are in churches or shrines and are venerated by devotees. A few are associated with miracles and attract substantial numbers of pilgrims.
Important early studies of dark images in France were done by Marie Durand-Lefebvre (1937), Emile Saillens (1945), and Jacques Huynen (1972).  The first notable study of the origin and meaning of the so-called Black Madonnas in English appears to have been presented by Leonard Moss at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Dec. 28, 1952. Moss broke the images into three categories: 1) dark brown or black madonnas with physiognomy and skin pigmentation matching that of the indigenous population; 2) various art forms that have turned black as a result of certain physical factors such as deterioration of lead-based pigments, accumulated smoke from the use of votive candles, and accumulation of grime over the ages, and 3) residual category with no ready explanation.

==The madonna as reflecting ancient cults==

According to Stephen Benko, "the Black Madonna is the ancient earth-goddess converted to Christianity."  His argument begins by noting that many goddesses were pictured as black, among them Artemis of Ephesus, Isis, Ceres, and others.  Ceres, the Roman goddess of agricultural fertility, is particularly important.  Her Greek equivalent is Demeter, Earth Mother.  The best fertile soil is black in color and the blacker it is, the more suited it is for agriculture.
