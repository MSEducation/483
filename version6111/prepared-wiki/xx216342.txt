Ruzhintsi ([tpl]lang-bg|Ружинци[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA-bg|ruʒint͡si|[/tpl]; also transliterated Ružinci, Ruzhinci, Ruzhintzi, Rujinci, Rujintsi, Rujintzi, etc.) is a village in northwestern Bulgaria, part of Vidin Province. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Ruzhintsi Municipality, which lies in the southeastern part of Vidin Province. Ruzhintsi is located 54 kilometres from the provincial capital Vidin and 43 kilometres from Montana.
The village may have been founded in the 14th century. There are several etymologies suggested, two from Proto-Indo-European *h₁reudʰ-ó- ("red"): from ruzha ("rose") or from the dialectal verb oruzhavam ("burn down"), and one involving the name of Fruzhin, son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and organizer of the anti-Ottoman Uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin in the early 15th century. The village church was built in 1852 together with a monastical school.
