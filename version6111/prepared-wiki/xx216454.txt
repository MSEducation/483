The Cayuse language (Cailloux, Willetpoos) is an extinct unclassified language formerly spoken by the Cayuse Native American tribe in the U.S. state of Oregon.  The Cayuse name for themselves was Liksiyu (see Aoki 1998).
Similarities to Molala, the language of people to the south of them in central Oregon, are thought to have been due to contact.
