Taj Mihelich (born 31 August 1973 in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is an American Freestyle BMX rider. He is probably best known for his part ownership of Terrible One with fellow rider, Joe Rich until March 2006.
He is currently sponsored by Odyssey.
He first began riding at the age of 12 and was brought to the world of Freestyle BMX by Ron Kilmer, who appeared with Taj in the celebrated "Road Fools" videos.
After years riding for the company Hoffman Bikes, he started Terrible One with Joe Rich, by releasing the "Barcode" bike frame, largely based on Taj's signature bike design at Hoffman Bikes.
It was rumored that Taj was displeased with the way that his signature frame was holding up after Hoffman Bikes moved their manufacturing overseas, and that he didn't want his name attached to something that he felt was of substandard quality.
Taj was also sponsored by Etnies, where he had several signature shoes as well as appearing in the widely recognized "Forward" video featuring the Etnies BMX team.
In late March 2006, Taj announced, that he would be leaving his half of Terrible One to Joe Rich, via the company's website. He cited the stresses of running a company as a key factor in this decision. Despite this, he will continue to ride for the company.
In early 2008 Taj announced that he would be riding for Giant bicycles, a large corporation. He rode for Giant throughout 2008 and 2009, but they dropped their entire BMX program in 2010. Taj is now currently a part of the Sunday Bikes trails team.
In 2010, Taj launched an all-purpose road, commuter and town bicycle company called Fairdale Bicycles.[tpl]cite web|first=Fat Tony|title=Taj Mihelich Launches Fairdale Bicycles|url=http://bmx.transworld.net/1000112255/news/taj-mihelich-launches-fairdale-bicycles/|publisher=Transworld BMX|accessdate=25 July 2013[/tpl]
