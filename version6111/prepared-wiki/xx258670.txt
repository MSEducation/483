The Chapel of St. Paul is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located in Staatsburg, Dutchess County, New York. It was established in 1887.

==History==

The first Roman Catholic church in Staatsburgh was a stone structure built in 1849 by Rev. Michael J. Riordan, pastor of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie, on Clay Hill, on land owned by Thomas Emmett. This church was about two miles from Staatsburg, so a more convenient site was chosen at Staatsburgh, where St. Paul's was built in 1853. The first pastor was Rev. Michael J. Scully. St. Paul's operated as a mission church of St. Joseph's Chapel (Rhinecliff, New York), where Father Scully resided.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X.
