Inside Story is Grace Jones's eighth studio album, released in 1986, and her first with the Manhattan Records label. The album spawned the hit single "I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You)".

==Background==

Having achieved a major success with the comeback album Slave to the Rhythm and the bestselling hits compilation Island Life, both in 1985, Grace Jones delivered her next album the following year. Released under new contract with Manhattan Records, Inside Story saw Jones working with the music producer Nile Rodgers of Chic (Jones had previously tried to work with the band during disco era[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/chic.shtml |title=Nile & Bernard - Chic - Tribute @ Disco-Disco.com |accessdate=2012-04-19 |publisher=www.disco-disco.com[/tpl]). The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. Inside Story is notable for being Jones' first foray into production, which resulted in frequent, heated clashes with Rodgers. Musically, the album explores varieties of pop music, with elements of jazz, gospel and Caribbean sounds, marking the point when Jones turned towards more accessible, commercial sound. All songs were written by Grace Jones and Bruce Woolley. The artwork for the album cover was designed by Richard Bernstein, who had previously worked with Jones on artworks for the 70s albums Portfolio, Fame and Muse.
The release of Inside Story was surrounded by Manhattan Records' "most extensive marketing and merchandising campaign ever", as described by the Billboard magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com.br/books?id=ICUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=grace+jones+million&hl=pt-br&ei=OmqRTbeCGsLegQfghoUZ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=grace%20jones%20million&f=false |title=Billboard â€“ Google Livros |publisher=Google Books |date=1986-12-13 |accessdate=2011-03-29[/tpl] The promotional strategy would include magazine and newspaper advertisements, street posters, radio spots and more, with the record company targeting the US market, where Grace had never been a mainstream pop star. Eventually, Inside Story would become one of Jones' greatest album successes, making the top 40 in a number of European countries. Despite being her lowest-charting album in the UK, it still sold well enough in the British market to receive silver certification there. The album also remains her last entry to date on US Billboard 200 albums chart.
A remastered, copy protected edition of the album was released in 2004 on EMI Records, along with Bulletproof Heart. Unlike the latter, re-released Inside Story came with no bonus tracks.

==Singles==

"I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You)" became album's lead single, accompanied by a popular music video. The song would become one of Jones' most successful singles and her highest (as well as last ever) entry on Billboard Hot 100. "Party Girl" was released at the end of 1986 to a very modest success, making the top 40 only in Italy.
The third single was different for North American and European markets. The R&B-influenced "Crush" has been chosen for the USA and Canada, while European market opted for jazzy "Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician". Both singles, released in spring 1987, did not turn out successful.
