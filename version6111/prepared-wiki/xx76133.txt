[[Gate count]]

CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device fabrication

In microprocessor design, gate count refers to the number of gates build with transistor and other electronic devices, that are needed to implement a design. Even with today's process technology providing what was formerly considered impossible numbers of gates on a single chip, gate counts remain one of the most important overall factors in the end price of a chip. Designs with fewer gates will typically cost less, and for this reason gate count remains a commonly used metric in the industry.
The term can also refer to the number of persons entering an event (such as a sports event) http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2002/03/11/editorial4.html or a library http://www.niso.org/emetrics/current/category7.1.html during a specified period.
