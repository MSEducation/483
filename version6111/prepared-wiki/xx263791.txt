==Critical reception==

The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.
Britflicks critic Zachary Cooke gave the film a favourable review saying “There may not be an obvious category to put On the Ropes into, but it’s really just a great film that tips its hat to documentaries, dramas and the egos of those that are part of reality TV.” He was also complimentary about the quality of the acting and commented that “Both lead actors Mark Noyce and Ben Shockley are very convincing in their roles”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://britflicks.azurewebsites.net/Review.aspx?filmId=246|title= Britflicks film review[/tpl]
Richard Cross of A Full Tank of Gas stated “Thankfully, while On the Ropes is highly derivative of The Office - particularly in the performance of leading man Mark Noyce, who also wrote and directed - it generates a surprising amount of good will on the part of the viewer thanks largely to likeable performances and a refusal to take itself too seriously.” However he went on to write that “While Noyce gives an enjoyable performance as Kraft, his mannerisms and speech patterns are so closely modelled on those of The Office’s David Brent that his performance draws unnecessary - and unfavourable - comparisons, which is a shame because it diminishes his achievements in other departments”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.afulltankofgas.com/ontheropes.html|title= A Full Tank of Gas review[/tpl]
The British Comedy Guide editor Mark Boosey wrote “this mockumentary gets off to a faltering start as it struggles to focus on anything in particular.”  but felt “things improve when the movie does settle down on the idea of following around and focusing on karate instructor Keith Kraft. This monstrous egocentric 'plonker' carries many of the film's best lines and set pieces, and is played very well by the film's creator, Mark Noyce.” [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/film/on_the_ropes/|title= British Comedy Guide review[/tpl]
