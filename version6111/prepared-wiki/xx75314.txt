[[Ferula]]

CATEGORIES: Apiaceae

Ferula (from Latin ferula, "rod") is a genus of about 170 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to the Mediterranean region east to central Asia, mostly growing in arid climates. They are herbaceous perennial plants growing to 1–4 m tall, with stout, hollow, somewhat succulent stems. The leaves are tripinnate or even more finely divided, with a stout basal sheath clasping the stem. The flowers are yellow, produced in large umbels. Many plants of this genus, especially F. communis are referred to as "giant fennel," although they are not fennel in the strict sense.

==Uses==

The gummy resin of many species of Ferula is used for medical or culinary purposes:
The Romans called the hollow light rod made from this plant a ferula (compare also fasces, judicial birches). Such rods were used for walking sticks, splints, for stirring boiling liquids, and for corporal punishment.
The ferula also shows up in mythological contexts. The main shaft of a thyrsus was traditionally made from this plant, and Prometheus smuggled fire to humanity by hiding it in a ferula as well.
The leaf aqueous-ethanol extract of Feruia foetida has shown antioxidant and antihemolytic activities.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nabavi SM. Ebrahimzadeh MA. Nabavi SE. Eslami B.
