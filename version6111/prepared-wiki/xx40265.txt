==History==

===Early years (1992–2000)===

Puddle of Mudd was formed on September 13, 1991 in Kansas City by Wes Scantlin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Jimmy Allen (guitar), Sean Sammon (bass), and Kenny Burkitt (drums).The last name of the original drummer, Kenny Burkitt, is misspelled as "Burkett" in various sources. A 2005 legal document regarding use and rights to the name "Puddle of Mudd", has the spelling of his last name with an I not an E. – Burkitt Vs. Flawless Records. According to Wes Scantlin, the band name was inspired by practicing next to the Missouri river levy which always inundated the band's practice space, but never ruined their equipment since they were on the second floor. In order to get to their practice space, the band "had to walk through a pile of shit."[tpl]cite web|title=Puddle Of Mudd Wes Scantlin Interview|url=http://spinitloud.com/?p=162|publisher=spinitloud.com|accessdate=26 September 2013[/tpl] The group's first album, Stuck'', was released in 1994 on V&R Records. The album was produced by the band and E.J. Rose, and was recorded at Red House Studio in Lawrence, Kansas. It spawned two radio singles (the first was "You Don't Know", the second "Drift and Die").
Minus Jimmy Allen, the group released a second album, Abrasive, in 1997 on Hardknocks Records. It had eleven tracks, all written by the band, three of which would eventually make it on to Puddle of Mudd's first major label release.  Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member. He then decided to reform the band with Jimmy Allen late in 1999 but shortly fell into differences again.

===Come Clean (2001–2002)===

Scantlin's start in the music business came after a copy of his demo tape was delivered to Fred Durst. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together.
One of the first people Scantlin met upon arriving in California was Doug Ardito, an intern at Interscope Records.  When Scantlin found out about Ardito's bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, Paul Phillips, who had formerly played in a local band there called Happy Hour. After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd, and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join.  The band held auditions for a new drummer, which produced Greg Upchurch, an ex-member of Eleven who had also toured with Chris Cornell.
Puddle of Mudd released its major-label debut album Come Clean on August 28, 2001. The lead single from the album, "Control" was successful. It was also the theme song for WWE's Survivor Series 2001 Which was critically acclaimed. The second single off the album, "Blurry", co-written with Jimmy Allen and Doug Ardito, turned out to be Puddle of Mudd's most successful single, reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. Also winning an ASCAP song of the year award for Ardito, Allen and Scantlin  This song was also used in the game Ace Combat 5, published by Namco. "Drift & Die" co-written by Jimmy Allen was also released as a single spending six weeks at the No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The fourth single, "She Hates Me" co-written by Jimmy Allen was released in late 2002, and reached the No. 1 spot on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, as well as No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Winning Allen and Scantlin the ASCAP most played rock song of the year.
The group then embarked on a European and American tour as the opening act for Godsmack & Deftones and were also part of the Family Values 2001 tour, alongside the Linkin Park, Stone Temple Pilots and Staind.
The album was certified triple platinum in the U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 31, 2003, and as of late 2006 total sales worldwide were in excess of five million copies.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

===Life On Display (2003–2005)===

Puddle of Mudd's follow up, Life on Display spawned three singles "Away From Me", "Heel Over Head", and "Spin You Around". The album sold below expectations. Although shortly after its release, the record was certified gold and to date has sold over 706,000 copies.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Some suggested this was the primary cause of drummer Greg Upchurch's leaving the band to join  3 Doors Down.[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r1085937|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Famous – Puddle of Mudd |publisher=AllMusic |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl] Marisa Miller appeared in the music video for "Spin You Around". "Away From Me" was featured in The O.C. in 2004. The song "Nothing Left to Lose" was the official theme song of WWE's 2004 Royal Rumble.

===Famous (2006–2008)===

On October 9, 2007, the band released their third major label record, Famous. The first single, "Famous", was leaked through the band's Myspace and radio in July before the CD was released. Another track, "Merry Go Round", was released through iTunes before the official release. The following single, "Psycho", topped both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts for nine weeks. "Livin' on Borrowed Time" and "We Don't Have To Look Back Now" were the final singles released.
Their song "Famous" was the WWE One Night Stand 2007 official theme song and was also featured in the video game WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008, as well as UFC 2009 Undisputed.

===Vol.4 Songs in the Key of Love and Hate (2009–2010)===

In 2009, former guitarist Paul Phillips rejoined the band after replacement Christian Stone was let go on good terms.  Around this time the band recruited Famous producer Brian Howes to begin recording a new record in Vancouver. Prior to the new album's release, band members said the album's name would be called 'Jacket on the Rack'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tunelab.com/2009/09/03/puddle-of-mudd-title-new-album-jacket-on-the-rack/ |title=Puddle Of Mudd Title New Album "Jacket On The Rack" | TuneLab Music – Everything Rock |publisher=Tunelab.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl] However it was changed to Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love & Hate.

==Connection with Fred Durst==

Due to the notoriety surrounding how the band was signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin blasted Durst in an interview in 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy..." He added, "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is."[tpl]cite web|author=12:10 AM |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=7614 |title=Wes Scantlin of Puddle Of Mudd Slams Fred Durst – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=19253 |title=Blabbermouth.Net – Puddle Of Mudd'S Scantlin Unleashes On 'Pathetic' Fred Durst |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl]
On January 6, 2011, Durst attempted to get back in touch with Scantlin via a tweet on his official Twitter page. "Who knows Wes from puddle of mudd? I wanna connect w him again. Let me know."[tpl]cite web|author=Full name |url=http://twitter.com/#!/freddurst |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15[/tpl] Scantlin's reaction to this is not yet known, but both Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd are playing together on Epicenter 2011, along with another one of Durst's former proteges, Staind.
