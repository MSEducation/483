[[Amoz]]

CATEGORIES: Prophets in Judaism, Hebrew Bible people, Isaiah

Amoz ([tpl]Hebrew Name|אָמוֹץ |stan=Amots |tiber=ʼĀmôṣ |means="strong"[/tpl]; [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|m|ɒ|z[/tpl]) was the father of the prophet Isaiah, mentioned in Isaiah 1:1 and 2:1, and in II Kings 19:2, 20; 20:1. Nothing else is known for certain about him.
There is a Talmudic tradition that when the name of a prophet's father is given, the father was also a prophet, so that Amoz would have been a prophet like his son. Though it is mentioned frequently as the patronymic title of Isaiah, the name Amoz appears nowhere else in the Bible. The rabbis of the Talmud declared, based upon a rabbinic tradition, that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah (אמציה), the king of Judah at that time (and, as a result, that Isaiah himself was a member of the royal family). According to one tradition{which?}, Amoz is the "man of God" in 2 Chronicles 25:7-9, who cautioned Amaziah to release the Israelite mercenaries that he had hired.
