CATEGORIES: Transport in Australia

There are many forms of transport in Australia. The nation is highly dependent on road transport.  There are more than 300 airports with paved runways.  An extensive rail network for passengers connects many rural areas to major metropolitan centres.  The mining sector is reliant on rail to transport its product to Australia's ports for export.

==Roads===

Australia has the second highest level of car ownership in the world. It has three to four times more road per capita than Europe and seven to nine times more than Asia. Australia also has the third highest per capita rate of fuel consumption in the world. Melbourne is the most car-dependent city in Australia, as of a data survey in the 2010's. Having over 110,000 more cars driving to and from the city each day than Sydney. Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane are rated as being close behind. All these capital cictes are rated among the highest in this category in the world (car dependency).Urban Australia: Where most of us live. CSIRO. Retrieved on 15 July 2012. Furthermore, the distance travelled by car (or similar vehicle) in Australia is among the highest in the world, being exceeded by USA and Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/aus|title=Transport in Australia|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=iRAP [/tpl]

Victoria has the largest network, with thousands of arterial (major, primary and secondary) roads to add.
The majority of road tunnels in Australia have been constructed since the 1990s to relieve traffic congestion in metropolitan areas, or to cross significant watercourses.

==Public transport in Australia==

Rising petrol prices and increasing traffic congestion are thought to be factors contributing to renewed growth in use of urban public transport.Use of urban public transport in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics. Retrieved on 15 July 2012.

===Intra-city public transport networks===

The table below lists major cities in Australia with currently operating multi-modal intra-city (as opposed to inter-city or regional) public transportation networks. 
The only Australian capital cities without multi-modal networks are Canberra and Darwin, which rely entirely on buses. Canberra is planning a light rail line (Capital Metro), which will link with existing bus services, and is expected to be operational in 2018.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katygallagher.net/?p=2285|title=Capital Metro Light Rail Project to be delivered through Canberra’s first large-scale private partnership|publisher=Katy Gallagher, ACT Chief Minister|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=4 May 2013[/tpl]
Trams in Australia historically serviced many Australian towns and several cities formerly operated tram networks, however the majority of these were shut down before the 1970s. Melbourne is an exception here however, and today boasts the largest tram network of any city in the world.  Major regional cities where trams formerly facilitated multi-modal public transport networks Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Rockhampton.
The following table presents an overview of public transport networks in Australia's larger cities. The table does not include tourist or heritage transport modes (such as the private monorail at Sea World or the tourist Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram).
