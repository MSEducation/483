The practice of inoculation slowly spread amongst the royal families of Europe, usually followed by more general adoption amongst the people.
The practice is documented in America as early as 1721, when Zabdiel Boylston, at the urging of Cotton Mather, successfully inoculated two slaves and his own son. Mather, a prominent Boston minister, had heard a description of the African practice of inoculation from his Sudanese slave, Onesimus, in 1706, but had been previously unable to convince local physicians to attempt the procedure.Silverman, Kenneth. The Life and Times of Cotton Mather, Harper & Row, New York, 1984. ISBN 0-06-015231-1,  p. 339. Following this initial success, Boylston began performing inoculations throughout Boston, despite much controversy and at least one attempt upon his life. The effectiveness of the procedure was proven when, of the nearly three hundred people Boylston inoculated during the outbreak, only six died, whereas the mortality rate among those who contracted the disease naturally was one in six.[tpl]Cite book | publisher = D.

There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.
In France, considerable opposition arose to the introduction of inoculation, and it was banned by the Parlement.  Voltaire, in his Lettres Philosophiques, wrote a criticism of his countrymen for being opposed to inoculation and having so little regard for the welfare of their children, concluding that "had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the lives of thousands.".Lettres Philosophiques.  Voltaire.  (English translation on-line http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/11.html)
Inoculation grew in popularity in Europe through the 18th century. Given the high prevalence and often severe consequences of smallpox in Europe in the 18th century (according to Voltaire, there was a 60% incidence of first infection, a 20% mortality rate, and a 20% incidence of severe scarring),In fact, the mortality rate of the Varoiola Minor form of smallpox then found in Europe was 1–3% as opposed to 30–50% for the Variola Major type found elsewhere; however, blindness, infertility, and severe scarring were common.  Figures from "The Search for Immunisation", In Our Time, BBC Radio 4 (2006). http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20060420.shtml many parents felt that the benefits of inoculation outweighed the risks and so inoculated their children.Letter of Lady Montagu reproduced at http://www.foundersofscience.net/lady_mary_montagu.htm viewed 18 March 2006

==Mechanism==

Two forms of the disease of Smallpox were recognised, now known to be due to two strains of the Variola virus.  Those contracting Variola Minor had a greatly reduced risk of death – 1–2% – compared to those contracting Variola Major with 30% mortality.  Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small skin wound.  The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient.  The rising immunity terminates the infection.  So the twofold effect is to ensure the less fatal form of the disease is the one caught, and to give the immune system  the best start possible in combating it.
Inoculation in the East was historically performed by blowing smallpox crusts into the nostril. In Britain, Europe and the American Colonies the preferred method was rubbing material from a smallpox pustule from a selected mild case (Variola minor) into a scratch between the thumb and forefinger.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_variolation.html |title=Smallpox: Variolation |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2003-10-18 |accessdate=2009-11-02[/tpl]  This would generally be performed when an individual was in normal good health, and thus at peak resistance.  The recipient would develop smallpox; however, due to being introduced through the skin rather than the lungs, and possibly because of the inoculated individual's preexisting state of good health, the small inoculum, and the single point of initial infection, the resulting case of smallpox was generally milder than the naturally-occurring form, produced far less facial scarring, and had a far lower mortality rate. As with survivors of the natural disease, the inoculated individual was subsequently immune to re-infection.

==Obsolescence==

In 1798, the English surgeon/scientist Edward Jenner published the results of his experiments and thus introduced the far superior and safer method of inoculation with  cowpox virus, a mild infection  that also induced immunity to smallpox. Jenner was not the first person to inoculate with cowpox nor  the first to realize that infection with cowpox gave immunity to smallpox. However, he was the first to publish evidence that it was effective and to provide advice on its production.  His efforts led to smallpox inoculation falling into disuse and eventually being banned in England in 1840.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Robert M|coauthors=Sharp, Lisa K|date=24 August 2002|title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present|journal=British Medical Journal|location=London|page=325|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf|pmid=12193361|pmc=1123944|volume=325|issue=7361[/tpl]
