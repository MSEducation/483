[[Computer addiction]]

CATEGORIES: Behavioral addiction

Computer addiction can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social or occupational function. Another clear conceptualization is made by Block who stated that "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging".[tpl]cite journal|last=Block|first=J.

The term offline Computer Addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can both be practiced offline and online.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lemmens|first=Jeroen S.|coauthors=Valkenburg, Patti M.; Peter, Jochen|title=Development and Validation of a Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents|journal=Media Psychology|date=26 February 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=77–95|doi=10.1080/15213260802669458[/tpl] Online computer Addiction is also known as Internet addiction and gets in general more attention from scientific research than Offline Computer Addiction, mainly because most cases of Computer Addiction are related to the excessive use of the internet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pies|first=R|title=Should DSM-V Designate "Internet Addiction" a Mental Disorder?|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=2|pages=31–37[/tpl]
Although addiction is usually used to describe substances, addiction can also be used to describe pathological Internet use. Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual being intensely working on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet with efficient time, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yellowlees|first=Peter|author2=Marks|title=Problematic Internet use or Internet addiction?|journal=ScienceDirect|date=May 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1447–1453|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563205000439|accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl]  However, not all people who spend hours each day on the computer are considered addicted. There are many uses for computers and the internet and in many cases, an individual may spend 6 or more hours in a day on the computer but still not be considered an addict. Each individual situation is different and therefore, there is no set number of hours that is (or is not) considered a potential for computer addiction.[tpl]cite web|title=Computer Addiction|url=http://www.addictions.com/computer/|publisher=ADDICTIONS.COM|accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl]

==Origin of the term and history==

British e-Learning academic Nicholas Rushby suggested in his 1979 book, An Introduction to Educational Computing, that people can be addicted to computers and suffer withdrawal symptoms. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book Computer Addiction.
The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the internet, as well the availability of the Personal Computer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pratarelli|first=Marc E.|author2=Browne, Blaine L.|author3=Johnson, Kimberly|title=The bits and bytes of computer/internet addiction: A factor analytic approach|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers|date=June 1999|volume=31|issue=2|pages=305–314|doi=10.3758/BF03207725[/tpl] Computers and internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium which could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive grow of individuals making use of PCs and the internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. Hypothesized was that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, that abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and for the society in the long term.[tpl]cite book|first=Center for Information Revolution Analyses. Robert H. Anderson|title=Universal access to e-mail : feasibility and societal implications|year=1995|publisher=Rand|location=Santa Monica, Calif. u.a.|isbn=9780833023315[/tpl]  In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet where already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label "a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems" as Computer or Internet Addiction.
There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest computer games. Many NetNews users were considered obsessive[tpl]Who|date=February 2009[/tpl] in the 1980s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009|reason=Not doubting this, but we need sources[/tpl] Press reports have furthermore noted that some Finnish Defence Forces conscripts were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life, and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is overuse of computer games or the Internet. Forbes termed this overuse "Web fixations", and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000-2005.
