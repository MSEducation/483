The Prayer of Manasseh is a short work of 15 verses of the penitential prayer of king Manasseh of Judah.  Manasseh is recorded in the Bible as one of the most idolatrous kings of Judah ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|21:1–18|NIV[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:1–9|NIV[/tpl]). Chronicles, but not Kings, records that Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:11–13|NIV[/tpl]) While a prisoner, Manasseh prayed for mercy, and upon being freed and restored to the throne turned from his idolatrous ways. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:15–17|NIV[/tpl]) A reference to the prayer, but not the prayer itself, is made in [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:19|NIV[/tpl], which says that the prayer is written in the "history of the seers."
The prayer is considered apocryphal by Jews, Catholics and Protestants. It was placed at the end of 2 Chronicles in the late 4th-century Vulgate.  Over a millennium later, Martin Luther included the book in his 74-book translation of the Bible.http://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2011/06/luther-added-books-to-his-bible.html It was part of the 1537 Matthew Bible, and the 1599 Geneva Bible. It also appears in the Apocrypha of the King James Bible. Pope Clement VIII included the prayer in an appendix to the Vulgate stating that it should continue to be read "lest it perish entirely." 
The prayer is included in some editions of the Greek Septuagint. For example, the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus includes the prayer among fourteen Odes appearing just after the Psalms.NET Bible  It is accepted as a deuterocanonical book by some Orthodox Christians, though it does not appear in Bibles printed in Greece. The prayer is chanted during the Orthodox Christian and Byzantine Catholic service of Great Compline.
