A [tpl]IAST|śloka[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-sa|श्लोक[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sa|ˈɕloːkə|IPA[/tpl]; also anglicized as shloka or sloka, meaning "song", from the root śru, "hear"Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 232(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927).) is a category of verse line developed from the Vedic Anustubh. It is the basis for Indian epic verse, and may be considered the Indian verse form par excellence, occurring, as it does, far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry.Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 232(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927). The Mahabharata and Ramayana, for example, are written almost exclusively in shlokas. The traditional view is that this form of verse occurred to Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana, on seeing a hunter shoot down one of two birds in love.
The shloka is treated as a couplet.  Each hemistich (half-verse) of 16 syllables, composed of two Pādas of eight syllables, can take either a pathyā ("normal") form or one of several vipulā ("extended") forms. The form of the second foot of the first Pāda (II) limits the possible patterns the first foot (I) may assume, as in the scheme below.
The Pathyā and Vipulā half-verses are arranged in the table above in order of frequency of occurrence. Out of 2579 half-verses taken from Kalidasa, Magha, Bharavi, and Bilhana, each of the four admissible forms of shloka in the above order claims the following share: 2289, 116, 89, 85.Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 233(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927)  
The metrical constraints on a hemistich in terms of its two constituent padas are as follows:Steiner, Appendix 4; translated: Macdonald, Appendix
Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first pāda.  By comparison, Syllables 5-7 of any pāda in the old Vedic anuṣṭubh is typically a ja-gaṇa ("⏑ – ⏑"), or a dijambus.
An example of an anuṣṭubh stanza which fails the classical requirements of a shloka is from the Shatapatha Brahmana
