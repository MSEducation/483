Originally named "Willersley Hall",British History on-line it was built on the slopes of Wild Cat Tor, [tpl]convert|400|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, for the occupation of industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright by architect William Thomas, following the purchase of the estate in 1782 from Thomas Hallet Hodges for £8,864.Heritage OpenDays siteArkwright Society News
At the time of purchase there was no large house here, just a few farms and "Derwent House", which still stands off the main drive. Arkwright planted many trees, though not before clearing away a large limestone rock, which cost £3,000.Chaddesden Historical Group newsletter
In 1791, when the building was approaching completion, a fire broke out and severe damage was caused to part of the interior of the castle.  Although the damage was repaired, Arkwright died in 1792 before the building was completed.  In 1796 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, moved into it with his family, and the Arkwright family lived there until 1922.
The estate was bought in 1927 by a group of Methodist businessmen, and in 1928 it opened as a Methodist Guild holiday centre.Willersley Castle Hotel

Today it operates as a Christian Guild Hotel.
