</ref> French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted and designated 27 stars with the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]] felt were too dim to warrant their letters.

Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, also known as the December Phoenicids, were first observed on 3 December 1887.
