==Biography==

The son of a Texas radio station owner, Hicks was born in Houston, Texas, he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tjhs1964.com/HTML/TJHS.htm|title=TJHS Class of 1964|publisher=Tjhs1964.com|date=2009-11-08|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1964.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texasifc.org/famousalums.htm|title=The University of Texas at Austin Interfraternity Council|publisher=Texasifc.org|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] received his Bachelor's degree in Finance from the University of Texas in 1968, and received his MBA from the University of Southern California in 1970. He is a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.
Hicks became interested in leveraged buyouts as a member of First National Bank of Austin's venture capital group. Hicks and Robert Haas formed Hicks & Haas in 1984. The next year that firm bought Hicks Communications, a radio outfit run by Hicks' brother Steven – the first of several media companies bought or created by the buyout firm that involved Steven (Capstar, Chancellor, and AMFM).
Hicks & Haas' in the mid-1980s bought several soft drink makers, including Dr Pepper and 7 Up. The firm took Dr Pepper/7 Up public just 18 months after merging the two companies. In all, Hicks & Haas turned $88 million of investor funding into $1.3 billion. The pair went their separate ways in May 1989.COMPANY NEWS; Hicks & Haas Founders Split New York Times, May 11, 1989 .

Retrieved April 18, 2010.
In 1989, Hicks co-founded the investment firm, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst with former Prudential Securities banker John Muse. The firm raised $250 million, with early investments including a life insurance company, Life Partners Group (bought in 1990 and sold in 1996). In 1991, Morgan Stanley's Charles Tate and First Boston's Jack Furst became partners. Hicks was chairman from 1989 to 2004, Hicks Muse raised $12 billion of private equity funds, consummated over $50 billion of leveraged acquisitions, and grew to become one of the largest private investment firms in the country.Lau, Debra Profile at "Forbes Faces", Forbes, April 23, 2001. Retrieved April 17, 2010.
But Hicks Muse hit a rough patch by the early 2000s, when investors in Equity Fund IV were burned by a $1.2 billion plunge into telecom investments in 1999. Hicks announced that he would leave the Hicks Muse on March 8, 2004, to spend more time with his family and his sports teams. (Hicks Muse was subsequently renamed HM Capital Partners.) He has remained active in his own ventures. He created Hicks Holdings, a vehicle for his sports and real estate empire, and then started buying companies again in the $10 to $250 million level, including:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_26/b3990073.htm|title=This Buyout Game Ain't Over Yet|work=Business Week|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|date=2006-06-06|accessdate=2008-04-28|last=Morrison|first=Mark[/tpl] a Chinese electronics firm, a venture with DirecTV selling bundled TV-telecom services to condos, a landscaping materials company in the Midwest, a pet food firm in Argentina, and Gammaloy – an oil field rental outfit he bought from his wife's family, paying approximately $20 million in the 1990s.

==Politics==

Hicks was a member of the political action committee for the 2008 presidential election campaign for former Republican Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani.[tpl]cite web|last=Chan|first=Sewell|url=http://www.greatdreams.com/2008/rudolph_giuliani.htm|title=RUDOLPH GULIANI FOR PRESIDENT – 2008|publisher=Greatdreams.com|date=2005-01-22|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]

Tom Hicks Elementary School in Frisco, Texas, part of the Lewisville Independent School District, was given its name after Hicks donated the land for the school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_school/tx/8845|title=Tom Hicks Elementary School|publisher=Greatschools.net|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]

==Sports==

Hicks moved from the business pages to the sports section in December 1995 when he bought the National Hockey League Dallas Stars for $82 million.[tpl]cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/01/08/archive/main69.shtml|title=Stars owner Hicks to buy Rangers for $250 million |publisher=CBS News|date=1998-01-08|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]

===Corinthians===

In 1999, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst entered into a partnership with Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, a successful Brazilian football club. Club directors and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst assured the fans that a new stadium was in development, but this never materialized.
Corinthians had won the Brazilian championship in 1998, so they inherited a winning team. There was an initial capital investment to tie down existing players and to finance the signing of Dida and Luizão. The initial expenditure assisted in retaining the league title in December 1999 and the club also won the inaugural FIFA Club World Championship the following month.
They began selling the club's star players and announced plans to change Corinthians' famous black-and-white kit. This led to a furious reaction from supporters. In 2003, after legal/financial troubles and partner infighting, Hicks retired from the company and the ownership group eventually left the partnership with Corinthians. There was no new stadium.The Mirror coverage of Corinthians' scandal

===Dallas Stars===

Hicks contracted to purchase the NHL franchise from Norman Green in December 1995. During his tenure as owner of the club, Hicks served as the Stars' Chairman of the Board and the club's representative on the NHL Board of Governors. Hicks played an instrumental role in the development and planning of American Airlines Center. Under his ownership, Stars won seven Division Championships, two Western Conference crowns, two Presidents' Trophies as the team with the best regular season record, two consecutive trips to the Stanley Cup Finals and the 1999 Stanley Cup Championship. In April 2010, Hicks’s company defaulted on $525-million in bank loans backed by the Stars and a 50-percent interest in the American Airlines Center.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/bidding-on-dallas-stars-stalls/article1751910|title=Bidding on Dallas Stars stalls|publisher=CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-10-10|location=Toronto[/tpl]

===Texas Rangers===

In June 1998, Hicks became the Chairman and Owner of the Texas Rangers Baseball Club of the Major League Baseball’s American League. Under Hicks ownership, the Rangers won the American League West Division crown in 1998 and 1999, but failed to deliver a World Series. Hicks made headlines across all MLB when he personally negotiated and signed then shortstop Alex Rodriguez to the biggest contract in MLB history at that time; a ten-year, $252 million deal at the December 2000 winter meetings.Sullivan, T.R. Hicks 'betrayed' by A-Rod's steroid use MLB.com, Accessed June 1, 2013 He would later point to that contract as "one of his biggest regrets."Marchand, Andrew Tom Hicks regrets A-Rod contract ESPN.com, accessed June 1, 2013
The Rangers also spent a large amount of money on  Chan Ho Park, who signed a $65,000,000 contract with the Rangers following the 2001 season. The Park signing would be a disaster for the Rangers as the new ‘staff ace’ was unable to pitch away from the pitcher-friendly Dodgers stadium and in the hitter friendly American League. After finishing in last place for the division three seasons in a row with Rodriguez, Hicks agreed to trade to the New York Yankees before the 2004 season. Five years later, Hicks stated that he felt personally "betrayed" and "deceived" after Rodriguez admitted use of steroids while with the club in 2001-2003.
As part of the agreement the Rangers would supplement a portion of his remaining contract. This agreement would continue until Rodriguez opted out of his contract in 2007. Hicks' ownership would see only 3 winning seasons in 11 full seasons of ownership. On January 23, 2010, it was announced Hicks had agreed to sell the Rangers to a group led by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan. Hicks would have been a minority share holder in the new ownership group.[tpl]cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.bbtia.com/the-clubhouse/2010/1/23/newsflash-final-agreement-reached-in-rangers-sale.html|title=NEWSFLASH: Final Agreement Reached In Rangers Sale|publisher=Bbtia.com|date=2010-01-23|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]
Prior to bids being placed by potential buyers, Hicks told the media the Rangers were operating under normal business with no interference from MLB. Regarding the Rangers' inability to sign 2009 first round pick Matt Purke, he said, "We were disappointed that the family insisted on $6 million. The Texas Rangers were not willing to do that. It had nothing to do with MLB restrictions. There is a clear misimpression we didn't sign Matt Purke because MLB wouldn't let us. That's not true. We didn't because of Tom Hicks, Nolan Ryan and Jon Daniels. We were not willing to go to $6 million."[tpl]cite web|author=Staff|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090912&content_id=6922070&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=Hicks: MLB not restricting Rangers' funds|publisher=Mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] After his group had completed the purchase agreement, Ryan told the media the Rangers were unable to offer the 1st round pick the $6,000,000 signing bonus both parties had verbally agreed upon after the draft because MLB, who were strictly overseeing the Rangers budget by this time, wouldn't approve the amount needed to sign Purke. After the announcement of the pending sale by Hicks Sports Group, several additional hurdles occurred which had to be remedied before the sale of the team could be finalized. Several of the lenders, who were owed over $500 million, vocally objected to the deal accusing Hicks of rejecting a higher offer by Jim Crane and stated they would not sign off on the deal.[tpl]cite web|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|url=http://bases.nbcsports.com/2010/01/the-rangers-deal-is-not-a-done-deal.html.php|title=The Rangers deal is not a done deal|publisher=Bases.nbcsports.com|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Hicks has been sued by 3 different parties over the land adjacent to the stadium that was sold in a separate transaction as a part of the purchase by Greenberg and Ryan."Hicks Sued Over Glorypark", nbcdfw.comDallas News coverage of Tom Hicks, dallasnews.com, February 2, 2010
On May 24, 2010, HSG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection/separation of the Texas Rangers from HSG and asked the courts to approve of the sale of the Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan. The move was made to expedite the sale and resolve the sale prior to the MLB trade deadline and draft signing deadline.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4393:texas-rangers-voluntarily-go-into-chapter-11-bankruptcy-to-finish-sale-to-greenbergryan-group&catid=70:mlb-club-sales&Itemid=157|title=Texas Rangers Voluntarily Go Into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to Finish Sale to Greenberg/Ryan Group|author=Maury Brown|date=2010-05-24|work=bizofbaseball.com|accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] Ironically, Alex Rodriguez was the largest unsecured creditor, owed nearly $25 million in deferred payments despite being traded six years earlier.
Emails presented in court show that after Hicks agreed to an exclusive negotiation period with Greenberg attorneys for HSG were still in discussion with another bidder, Dennis Crane, about a sale price for the team and emailed the creditors on December 31, 2009 saying "Basically, the response from the MLB was to prohibit us from negotiating with anyone other than Greenberg. Their intent seems to be to lock us into Greenberg even though Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal -- and may always have had based on Greenberg's current position. We need help here. Unless the lenders weigh in, we are going to be stuck negotiating a deal that is clearly worse than Crane's."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/139996|title=HSG Claims Crane Made Higher Offer Than Greenberg For Rangers|date=June 14, 2010|work=sportsbusinessdaily.com |accessdate=June 14, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/rangers-sale-price-could-have-been-higher-creditors-say|title=Rangers’ Sale Price Could Have Been Higher, Creditors Say|author=RICHARD SANDOMIR|date=June 11, 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=June 14, 2010[/tpl]
The bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held on August 4, 2010, and the winning bid was submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. Co-lead investors Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen.[ref]Club release on Chuck Greenberg's exit - Dallas Texas Rangers Blog - ESPN Dallas

In March 2011 Greenberg resigned as Chief Executive, sold his interest,

and Nolan Ryan was named President and Chief Executive Officer.

Ryan was subsequently designated the Controlling Owner of the Club by a unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011.

===Liverpool F.C.===

On February 1, 2007, it was made known through the English press that he was involved in a consortium with one-time friend and Montreal Canadiens owner George N.

On October 15, 2010, Hicks lost ownership of Liverpool F.C. Despite numerous attempts to prevent it, the club was sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), for a fee believed to be around £300 million, which was far below Hicks' valuation of "between £600M and £1 billion(B)", by the Liverpool F.C. board of directors in a 3–2 vote. Hicks is pursuing a (max.) £1B suit against NESV and Kop Holdings for damages, claiming that "This outcome... devalues the club..." and suggesting that he had been the victim of an "epic swindle".http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/9098046.stm[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/9094283.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2010-10-15 |title=NESV completes Liverpool takeover[/tpl] However from the time the club had been put up for sale it had been widely reported that the fee that Hicks and Gillett were asking for was unlikely to be achieved.http://www.itv.com/sport/football/news/liverpool-questions-answered-28894/  http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/torres-returns-as-chinese-bid-to-take-control-at-anfield-2041099.html For suggestions that an earlier valuation of the club by Hicks was unrealistic see: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2327146/Liverpool-owner-Tom-Hicks-to-sell-Anfield-stake.html The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the asking price of £600 million–£800 million took no account of the fact that a new owner would have to spend £375 million building the new stadium which Hicks and Gillett had promised and failed to deliver. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Hicks and Gillett were unlikely to achieve their estimated price because everyone knew that there was huge debt at the club and that these debts were due to be called in very shortly, meaning that the bankers would subsequently put the club into administration and then sell off the club at a bargain price anyway.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/7995539/RBS-ready-to-step-in-to-force-swift-Liverpool-sale.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=RBS ready to step in to force swift Liverpool sale | date=2010-09-11[/tpl] The likelihood of the club being placed in administration increased once, on September 7, 2010, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Hicks's main creditor, placed the Texan's indebtedness in the toxic debt category as he was considered unable to find refinancing or to pay off the debt.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/sep/09/rbs-tom-hicks-george-gillett-sell-liverpool | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matt | last=Scott | title=RBS moves to force George Gillett and Tom Hicks to sell Liverpool | date=2010-09-09[/tpl] In the end, none of the offers made were anywhere close to Hicks and Gillett's valuation and with the threat of administration looming the club was sold for £300 million.http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2010/10/lims_new_offer_for_liverpool. html This meant that the sale in 2010 fetched £80 million more than Hicks and Gillett had paid for the club in 2007 but because more than £200 million worth of debt had been piled on to the club, resulting in huge interest rates and penalty payments, the outgoing owners ended up losing an estimated £144 million on their investment.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8047093/Tom-Hicks-vows-to-fight-all-way-as-Boston-Red-Sox-owners-lie-in-wait-to-take-over-Liverpool.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=Tom Hicks vows to fight all way as Boston Red Sox owners lie in wait to take over Liverpool | date=2010-10-06[/tpl]

“It’s like a huge cloud has been lifted off us.....Hicks and Gillett leave with no legacy, apart from one of chaos.” http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/10/16/hicks-and-gillett-were-outclassed-liverpool-fc-fans-give-verdict-on-the-nesv-takeover-100252-27482669/ Chairman of Liverpool Supporters Club, Richie Pedder announced to the Liverpool Echo: “This is the start of a new era. A lot has been taken off the club’s shoulders now. Good riddance to Hicks and Gillett." Former Liverpool player Tommy Smith expressed his joy at the departure of Hicks and Gillett in his regular newspaper column: "But today they are out of our club - and I’m as happy as every one of the Liverpool fans who’ve made it clear they’re so sick of them. All they were ever interested in was making money - not in owning what is for me the greatest football club in the world, investing in it properly and taking good care of it. Good riddance."http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/10/16/tommy-smith-on-lfc-thank-god-we-ve-got-rid-of-hicks-and-gillett-at-last-100252-27482104/ After selling the club, Hicks admitted that his relationship with the fans had been strained: "something went wrong with my ability to communicate with the fans.

In the two years before Hicks and Gillett took control of the club, Liverpool won the Champions' League in 2005 and the FA Cup in 2006 under manager Rafa Benitez. In the three and a half years in which Hicks and Gillett owned the club, they won not a single trophy and at the time they left Liverpool the club were in the relegation zone of the Premier League.http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/sports/soccer/14liverpool.html http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/10/05/relegation-is-stretching-credulity-says-liverpool-fc-manager-roy-hodgson-92534-27401811/

During Hicks and Gillett's period of ownership, the club struggled to meet the interest payments on the loans taken out as part of the leveraged buy-out. Christian Purslow, managing director of Liverpool since June 2009, publicly stated in September 2010 that the debt was an important burden for the club because it limited investment in players: "The issue is that too much of that profit is being used to service loans put into place when the club was bought."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/sep/22/christian-purslow-liverpool-board | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Conn | title=Christian Purslow admits Liverpool can barely service loans | date=2010-09-22[/tpl] Hicks admitted after the sale that the club's debt was too great but argued that he had not been given sufficient time by his main creditor, the Royal Bank of Scotland, to repay the debt: "It has a little bit too much debt, no question. But we were going to fix that and we were frustrated by others."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/oct/15/tom-hicks-rafael-benitez-liverpool | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Tom Hicks blames Rafael Benítez after bitter Liverpool battle | date=2010-10-15[/tpl] He has also suggested that the Royal Bank of Scotland prevented him paying back the debt to them: "I can't go into the details but I can confirm the funds were available to pay off Royal Bank of Scotland entirely but between Royal Bank of Scotland, the chairman and the employees that conspired against us, they would not let us."
After more legal trouble with his other sports team, Tom Hicks decided not to pursue his claims of a conspiracy against him.http://thelfczone.com/site/2011/05/06/fan-power-wins-the-day-liverpool-fc-an-epic-swindle-part-two/ On 11 January 2013 Tom Hicks and George Gillet finally decided to drop their case in the English Law Courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow & Ian Ayre, the 3 directors on the board of Liverpool FC at the time of the sale of the club to NESV, they also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillet. Earlier in the week Hicks and Gillet had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court Trial so they could have more time to raise the monies needed to fund the multi million pound lawsuit.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jan/11/liverpool-tom-hicks-george-gillett
