Oss was first mentioned in a letter by Pope Alexander II on 6 May 1069.
Oss was granted city rights in 1399 by Hertogin (Duchess) Johanna van Brabant. Present-day Oss has several chemical and pharmaceutical industries like Merck & Co. (previously Schering-Plough, Organon and Diosynth).
Oss is also host to the professional football team FC Oss, and is the birthplace of former Manchester United and Real Madrid star Ruud van Nistelrooy, although he did not play for the local side, but for rivals FC Den Bosch.
The gothic metal/alternative rock band The Gathering, formed in 1989, originally hails from Oss.
