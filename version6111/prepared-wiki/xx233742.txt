==Reception==

Robert Workman, of Modojo, said that the game reminds him of 1950s sci-fi, has a good soundtrack, and that he enjoys seeing the aliens explode. His problems with it is that the game is repetitive and that the later levels are really hard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modojo.com/reviews/iphone/inkvaders/20090909/914/ |title=Inkvaders Review |accessdate=2009-10-16 |last=Workman |first=Robert |date=2009-09-09 |work=Modojo [/tpl] An appVersity reviewer said that they liked the game, but thinks that it's hard to believe that games like this are a hit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.appversity.com/games/inkvaders/ |title=Inkvaders Review |accessdate=2009-10-17 |date=2009-08-31 |work=appVersity [/tpl]
