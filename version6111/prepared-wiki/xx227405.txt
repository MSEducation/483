Free-for-All was singer-songwriter Michael Penn's second full-length record, released in 1992 on RCA. There were no big hit singles of the strength of his only top 40 hit, 1989's "No Myth", but the album did feature two songs that reached the Top 20 on the Modern Rock Charts: "Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In)" peaked at number 14, while the second single, "Seen the Doctor", reached nine spots higher, for a number 5 placing.  The album led to a bitter battle between Penn and his record company, leading him to forgo releasing a follow-up until 1997.

==Reception==

In his review for allmusic, reviewer Stewart Mason gave the recording 4 and a half stars (out of a possible five). He said that it was the record which proved to critics that Penn was no one-hit wonder, calling "Long Way Down" a "dark and pained opening to an album that was hardly pop-star material."
