[tpl]nihongo|Hinamatsuri|雛祭り|Hina-matsuri[/tpl], also called Doll's Day or Girls' Day, is a special day in Japan.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Hina Matsuri" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 313. Hinamatsuri is celebrated each year on March 3. Platforms covered with a red carpet are used to display a set of [tpl]nihongo|ornamental dolls|雛人形|hina-ningyō[/tpl] representing the Emperor, Empress, attendants, and musicians in traditional court dress of the Heian period.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E3BOTWH4VvAC&pg=PA52&dq=Hina-ningyo&num=100&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Hina-ningyo&f=false |page=52|title=Japanese Dolls: The Fascinating World of Ningyo|first= Alan Scott |last=Pate |publisher= Tuttle Publishing|year= 2008 |isbn= 4-8053-0922-9[/tpl]

==Origin and customs==

The custom of displaying dolls  began during the Heian period. Formerly, people believed the dolls possessed the power to contain bad spirits. Hinamatsuri traces its origins to an ancient Japanese custom called [tpl]nihongo|hina-nagashi|雛流し||lit. "doll floating"[/tpl], in which straw hina dolls are set afloat on a boat and sent down a river to the sea, supposedly taking troubles or bad spirits with them. The Shimogamo Shrine (part of the Kamo Shrine complex in Kyoto) celebrates the Nagashibina by floating these dolls between the Takano and Kamo Rivers to pray for the safety of children.  People have stopped doing this now because of fishermen catching the dolls in their nets. They now send them out to sea, and when the spectators are gone they[tpl]who|date=March 2013[/tpl] take the boats out of the water and bring them back to the temple and burn them.
The customary drink for the festival is shirozake, a sake made from fermented rice. A colored hina-arare, bite-sized crackers flavored with sugar or soy sauce depending on the region, and hishimochi, a diamond-shaped colored rice cake, are served.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KHkyUp-EH2MC&pg=PA134&dq=hishimochi+shirozake+chirashisushi#v=onepage&q=hishimochi%20shirozake%20chirashisushi&f=false|page=134|title=Gift-giving in Japan: cash, connections, cosmologies |first=Katherine |last=Rupp |publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2003 |isbn= 0-8047-4704-0[/tpl] Chirashizushi (sushi rice flavored with sugar, vinegar, topped with raw fish and a variety of ingredients) is often eaten. A salt-based soup called ushiojiru containing clams still in the shell is also served. Clam shells in food are deemed the symbol of a united and peaceful couple, because a pair of clam shells fits perfectly, and no pair but the original pair can do so.
Families generally start to display the dolls in February and take them down immediately after the festival.  Superstition says that leaving the dolls past March 4 will result in a late marriage for the daughter.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E4%BA%8B%E6%83%85%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88-%E4%BD%90%E3%80%85%E6%9C%A8-%E7%91%9E%E6%9E%9D/dp/4872344340|page=36|title=日本事情入門 View of Today's Japan|first=Mizue |last=Sasaki |publisher=Alc|year=1999 |isbn= 4-87234-434-0[/tpl]

==Placement==

The Kantō region and Kansai region have different placement orders of the dolls from left to right, but the order of dolls per level are the same.
The term for the platform in Japanese is [tpl]nihongo|hina dan|雛壇[/tpl].  The layer of covering is called [tpl]nihongo|dankake|段掛[/tpl] or simply [tpl]nihongo|hi-mōsen|緋毛氈[/tpl], a red carpet with rainbow stripes at the bottom.

===First platform, the top===

The top tier holds two dolls, known as [tpl]nihongo|imperial dolls|内裏雛 (だいりびな)|dairi-bina[/tpl]. The words dairi means "imperial palace". These are the [tpl]nihongo|Emperor|男雛|O-bina[/tpl] holding a [tpl]nihongo|ritual baton|笏|shaku|[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|Empress|女雛|Me-bina[/tpl] holding a fan, often mistakenly called [tpl]nihongo|Odairi-sama|御内裏様[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|Ohina-sama|御雛様[/tpl] respectively.
The dolls are usually placed in front of a gold folding screen [tpl]nihongo||屏風|byōbu[/tpl] and placed beside green Japanese garden trees.
Optional are the two lampstands, called [tpl]nihongo|bonbori|雪洞[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title= Bonbori 雪洞 |url=http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%BC%E3%82%93%E3%81%BC%E3%82%8A|publisher=Weblio|language=Japanese [/tpl] and the paper or silk lanterns that are known as [tpl]nihongo|hibukuro|火袋[/tpl], which are usually decorated with cherry or ume blossom patterns.
Complete sets would include accessories placed between the two figures, known as [tpl]nihongo|sanbō kazari|三方飾[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title= Sanbō B9%E9%A3%BE|publisher=Weblio|language=Japanese[/tpl] composing of two vases of artificial peach branch [tpl]nihongo|kuchibana|口花[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title= Kuchibana 口花 |url=http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E5%8F%A3%E8%8A%B1|publisher=Weblio|language=Japanese [/tpl]
The traditional arrangement had the male on the right, while modern arrangements had him on the left (from the viewer's perspective).

===Second platform===

The second tier holds three court ladies [tpl]nihongo||三人官女|san-nin kanjo[/tpl]. Each holds sake equipment.  From the viewer's perspective, the standing lady on the right is the long-handled sake-bearer [tpl]nihongo||長柄の銚子|Nagae no chōshi[/tpl], the standing lady on the left is the backup sake-bearer [tpl]nihongo||加えの銚子|Kuwae no chōshi[/tpl], and the only lady in the middle is the seated sake bearer [tpl]nihongo||三方|Sanpō[/tpl].
Accessories placed between the ladies are [tpl]nihongo||高坏|takatsuki[/tpl], stands with round table-tops for seasonal sweets, excluding hishimochi.

===Third platform===

The third tier holds five male musicians [tpl]nihongo||五人囃子|gonin bayashi[/tpl]. Each holds a musical instrument except the singer, who holds a fan.
Left to right, from viewer's perspective, they are the:

===Fourth platform===

Two ministers (daijin) may be displayed on the fourth tier: the [tpl]nihongo|Minister of the Right|右大臣|Udaijin[/tpl] and the [tpl]nihongo|Minister of the Left|左大臣|Sadaijin[/tpl]. The Minister of the Right is depicted as a young person, while the Minister of the Left is much older. Also, because the dolls are placed in positions relative to each other, the Minister of the Right will be on the viewer's left and the Minister of the Left will be on the viewer's right.  Both are sometimes equipped with bows and arrows.
Between the two figures are covered bowl tables [tpl]nihongo||掛盤膳|kakebanzen[/tpl], also referred to as [tpl]nihongo|o-zen|お膳[/tpl], as well as diamond-shaped stands [tpl]nihongo||菱台|hishidai[/tpl] bearing diamond-shaped ricecakes [tpl]nihongo||菱餅|hishimochi[/tpl].  Hishidai with feline-shaped legs are known as [tpl]nihongo||猫足形菱台|nekoashigata hishidai[/tpl].
Just below the ministers: on the rightmost, a mandarin orange tree [tpl]nihongo||右近の橘|Ukon no tachibana[/tpl], and on the leftmost, a cherry blossom tree [tpl]nihongo||左近の桜|Sakon no sakura[/tpl].

===Fifth platform===

The fifth tier, between the plants, holds three helpers or samurai as the protectors of the Emperor and Empress.  From left to right (viewer's perspective):

==Collectors==

Japanese dolls or Hina are broken down into several subcategories. Two of the most prominent are Girl’s Day, hina-ningyo, and the Boy’s Day musha-ningyo, or display dolls, sagu-ningyo, gosho-ningyo, and isho-ningyo (Scott, 2008[tpl]Incomplete short citation|date=March 2014[/tpl]). Collections can be categorized by the material they are made of such as wood dolls kamo-ningyo and nara-ningyo and, clay forms such as fushimi-ningyo and Hakata ningyo.
In the nineteenth century ningyo were introduced to the West. Doll collecting has since become a popular pastime in the West (Scott, 2008[tpl]Incomplete short citation|date=March 2014[/tpl]).[tpl]citation unclear[/tpl]  Famous well known collectors from the West include individuals such as James Tissot (1836–1902), Jules Adeline (1845–1909), Eloise Thomas (1907–1982), and Samuel Pryor (1898–1985).  James Tissot was known to be a religious history painter. In 1862, after attending a London Exhibition, he was drawn to Japanese Art. During the 1860s Tissot, was known as one of most important collectors of Japanese art in Paris.  His collections included kosode-style kimonos, paintings, bronze, ceramics, screens and a number bijan-nigyo (dolls from late Edo period) (Scott, 2008).  Adeline was known as a working artist and he is also known as “Mikika”.  Adeline produced many works throughout his career as a working artist.  He is best known for his “etchings” and received the Cross of the Legion of Honor for his Vieuex-Roven “Le Parvis Notre-Dame”. Unlike Tissot, Adeline is recognized as a true collector.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  A majority of Adeline’s collection consisted of ningyo, and only a few prints.
During the Meiji Era, three men became pioneers in collecting ningyo, Kurihara Sokosut (1851-1913), Nishizawa, Senko (1864–1914), and Tsuboi Shogoro (1863–1913). The three men are referred to as “Gangu San Ketsu” (the three great toy collectors). They introduced a systematic approach to collecting ningyo in an effort to preserve and document the various forms of ningyo (Scott, 2008[tpl]Incomplete short citation|date=March 2014[/tpl]). Shimizu Seifu, an artist and calligrapher, put his artistic ability to use by creating an illustrated catalog of his own collection of 440 ningyo dolls.  The catalog was published in (1891) under the title “Unai no Tomo”.  Nishizawa Senko, a banker, gathered a significant collection on hina-ningyo. He was an active researcher, collector of stories, documents, and information relating to the development of hina-ningyo during the Edo period. Senko’s son Tekiho (1889–1965) inherited his collection but a great portion of the collection was lost in the Kanto earthquake of 1923. (Scott, 2008[tpl]Incomplete short citation|date=March 2014[/tpl]).  Tsuboi Shogoro, the first appointed Professor of Anthropology at the Tokyo Imperial University (Yamashita, Bosco, & Seymour, 2004[tpl]Incomplete short citation|date=March 2014[/tpl]), was the most trained of the three, and he brought a scientific element to the collecting of ningyo.  Dolls have been a part of Japanese culture for many years, and the phenomenon of collecting them is still practiced. Many collections are preserved in museums, including the Peabody Essex Museum, Kyoto National Museum, and the Yodoko Guest House.
