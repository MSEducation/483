==History==

===1935 to 2000===

Fujitsu is the second oldest IT company after IBM, established on June 20, 1935,Official Fujitsu history under the name Fuji Tsūshinki Seizō ([tpl]lang|ja|富士通信機製造[/tpl], Fuji Telecommunications Equipment Manufacturing), as a spinoff of the Fuji Electric Company, itself a joint venture between the Furukawa Electric Company and the German conglomerate Siemens which had been founded in 1923. Despite its connections to the Furukawa zaibatsu, Fujitsu escaped the Allied occupation of Japan after the Second World War mostly unscathed.
In 1954, Fujitsu manufactured Japan's first computer, the FACOM 100, and in 1961 launched the transistorized FACOM 222. In 1955, Fujitsu founded Kawasaki Frontale as a company football club; Kawasaki Frontale has been a J. League football club since 1999. In 1967, the company's name was officially changed to the contraction Fujitsū ([tpl]lang|ja|富士通[/tpl]).

Mers Kutt, inventor of  Key-Edit and founder of CCL, was the common thread that led to Fujitsu’s later association with ICL and Gene Amdahl.
