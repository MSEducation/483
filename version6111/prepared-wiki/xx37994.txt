O'Shea Jackson (born June 15, 1969), better known by his stage name Ice Cube, is an American hip hop artist, record producer, actor, screenwriter, film producer, and director. He began his career as a member of the hip-hop group C.I.A. and later joined N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes). After leaving N.W.A in December 1989,[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] he built a successful solo career in music, and also as a writer, director, actor and producer in cinema. Additionally, he has served as one of the producers of the Showtime television series Barbershop and the TBS series Are We There Yet?, both of which are based upon films in which he portrayed the lead character.
Cube is noted as a proficient lyricist and storyteller and is regarded as a brutally honest rapper;  his lyrics are often political as well as violent, and he is considered one of the founding artists in gangsta rap. He was ranked #8 on MTV's list of the 10 Greatest MCs of All Time, while fellow rapper Snoop Dogg ranked Ice Cube as the greatest MC of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index4.jhtml |title=The Greatest MCs Of All Time |publisher=MTV.com |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] About.com ranked him #11 on its list of the "Top 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_8.htm |title=Top 50 MCs of Our Time: 1987 - 2007 - 50 Greatest Emcees of Our Time |publisher=Rap.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] Allmusic has called him one of hip-hop's best and most controversial artists,[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ice-cube-p48/biography |title=Ice Cube |publisher=AllMusic |date=1969-06-15 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] as well as "one of rap's greatest storytellers."[tpl]cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/death-certificate-r27942/review |title=Death Certificate - Ice Cube |publisher=AllMusic |date=1991-10-31 |accessdate=2012-04-11[/tpl] In 2012, The Source ranked him #14 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/forum/topics/the-source-s-top-50-lyricists-of-all-time-complete-list-inside |title=The Source's Top 50 Lyricists Of All Time **Complete List Inside** |publisher=ThisIs50.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27[/tpl]

He attended the Phoenix Institute of Technology in the fall of 1987, and studied architectural drafting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.black-collegian.com/issues/2ndsem04/icecube2004-2nd.shtml|title=Ice Cube: Building On His Vision|accessdate=December 8, 2011|date=February 2004|author=Jefferson, Jevaillier | work=Black Collegian[/tpl] With friend Sir Jinx, Ice Cube formed the C.I.A., and they performed at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. Young Ice Cube met Dr. Dre in 1984, who was 19 at the time. Dre soon entered the recording industry; working on records with the World Class Wreckin' Cru. Dre saw Cube's potential as a writer and had him assist with writing Wreckin Cru's big L.A. hit track, "Cabbage Patch" as well as joining Cube on a side partnership which the duo called Stereo Crew. Stereo Crew produced a twelve-inch record, "She's a Skag" released on Epic Records in 1986.[tpl]Cite news|last=Johson|first=Bill|title=Ice Cube Reminisces On His Very First Gig And Single|url=http://theurbandaily.com/music/first-things-first-music/billjohnson/ice-cube-reminisces-on-his-very-first-gig-and-single/|work=The Urban Daily |date=May 31, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2011[/tpl]

==Music career==

===N.W.A: 1987–1989===

In 1987, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre released the single My Posse under the alias CIA. After the collaboration, Ice Cube showed Eazy-E the lyrics to "Boyz-n-the-Hood."[tpl]cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Ice Cube – Biography|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008[/tpl] Eazy-E, although initially rejecting the lyrics, eventually recorded the song for N.W.A. and the Posse, the debut album for the group N.W.A that included Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella, and him.
By this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with Dr. Dre, and MC Ren. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, Jerry Heller, after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.Ice Cube: Attitude (McIver, 2002) ISBN 1-86074-428-1
Since Ice Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both Straight Outta Compton, and Eazy-E's solo album, Eazy-Duz-It, he was advised of the amounts he was truly owed by Heller, and took legal action soon after leaving the group and the label. In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP 100 Miles and Runnin' and on their next and final album, Niggaz4Life.

===Solo career: 1989–present===

In 1989, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, in Los Angeles with the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed the female rapper Yo-Yo (who appeared on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as 'Doughboy' in John Singleton's hood-based drama, Boyz n the Hood. In the same year as AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, Ice Cube released the acclaimed EP, Kill At Will which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go Platinum.
His second album Death Certificate was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' ("a vision of where we are today") and the 'Life Side' ("a vision of where we need to go"). It features "No Vaseline", a scathing response to N.W.A's attacks and "Black Korea," a track regarded by some as prophetic of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but also interpreted as racist by many. Ice Cube toured with Lollapalooza in 1992, which widened his fan base.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK [/tpl]
Ice Cube released his third album, The Predator, in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's Los Angeles riots, in the first single, "Wicked", he rapped "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel". The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from The Predator included "It Was a Good Day" and "Check Yo Self", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well-received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after The Predator, Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album Lethal Injection, which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from Lethal Injection, including "Really Doe", "Bop Gun (One Nation)", "You Know How We Do It" & "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.
In 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member Dr. Dre, who was now part of Death Row Records, in their duet "Natural Born Killaz". In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc). The delayed sixth album Volume 2, was released in 2000. The albums featured appearances from Westside Connection as well as a reunion with fellow N.W.A members, Dr. Dre and MC Ren, though many fans maintained that the two albums were not on par with his past work, especially the second volume.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title="War & Peace, Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)" – Overview|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r465652|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 13, 2008[/tpl] In 2001, Ice Cube also joined Dr. Dre, Eminem & Snoop Dogg on the Up In Smoke Tour.[tpl]Cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Four Hours of Swagger from Dr. Dre and Friends|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DE123BF934A25754C0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times |date=July 17, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008[/tpl]
In 2006, Ice Cube released his seventh solo album, Laugh Now, Cry Later, on his Lench Mob Records label, debuting at number four on the Billboard Charts and selling 144,000 units in the first week.[tpl]cite web|title=Ice Cube – Billboard Albums|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/charts-awards|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008[/tpl] The album featured production from Lil Jon and Scott Storch, who produced the lead single "Why We Thugs". He released his eighth studio album, Raw Footage, on August 19, 2008, featuring the controversial single "Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It".
On October 12, 2009, he released a non-album track called 'Raider Nation' in tribute to the Oakland Raiders.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://icecube.com/news/5743/ |title=Raider Nation! |publisher=Ice Cube |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl]
On May 11, 2010, Ice Cube released a 30 for 30 documentary, "Straight Outta L.A.", for ESPN on the relationship between the gangsta rap scene in Los Angeles and the tenure of the Raiders there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsradiointerviews.com/2009/11/12/ice-cube-%e2%80%9craiders-fans-were-gangster%e2%80%99s-way-before-we-came-into-the-picture%e2%80%9d/ |title=Blog Archive » Ice Cube: “Raiders fans were gangster’s way before we came into the picture” |publisher=Sports Radio Interviews |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://30for30.espn.com/film/straight-outta-la.html |title=ESPN 30 for 30 |publisher=ESPN  |date=June 17, 1994 |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl] He has been voted as eighth of MTV's "greatest emcees of all time.""Ice Cube: Rank 8", MTV.com.

On September 28, 2010, Cube released his ninth solo album, I Am the West. The album featured the single "I Rep That West". It debuted at #22 on the Billboard 200 and sold 22,000 copies in its first week.

===Westside Connection: 1996–2007===

In 1996, Ice Cube formed Westside Connection with Mack 10 and WC, and together they released an album called Bow Down. Some of the album was used to engage in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry of the 90s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified Platinum by the end of 1996. With Bow Down, Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast rap fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like "Bow Down" and "Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with Eazy-E shortly before the latter's death in 1995.
After a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort Terrorist Threats in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its commercial reception was less than that of Bow Down. "Gangsta Nation" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by Fredwreck and featured Nate Dogg; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded. WC did release a new solo album on Lench Mob Records entitled Guilty by Affiliation on August 14, 2007.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Collaborations 1992–present===

In 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from Del the Funkee Homosapien (I Wish My Brother George Was Here), Da Lench Mob (Guerillas in tha Mist, 1992) and Kam (Neva Again, 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on Guerillas in tha Mist.
In 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, Planet of tha Apes. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with Tupac Shakur on his album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., appearing on the track "Last Wordz" with Ice-T. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: "Natural Born Killaz", for the Murder Was The Case soundtrack, and also contributed to the Office Space soundtrack.

After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as "Straight Outta Compton Tour", and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in Amsterdam and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's Enmore Theatre to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.
Ice Cube collaborated with Tech N9ne on the song "Blackboy" that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album Killer.

In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and will return to perform at the 2011 festival.[tpl]youtube|5gKE67L97SA|2011 Gathering Of The Juggalos Infomercial[/tpl]
Despite rumors of conflicts with other rappers in 2010, Ice Cube stated in an interview with DJ Whoo Kid on Sirius Shade 45 that he has "no beef."[tpl]cite web|author=DJ Whoo Kid|url=http://www.radioplanet.tv/ice-cube-shade-45-interview|title=Ice Cube New Friday?!

Ice Cube's ninth studio album I Am the West was released on September 28, 2010. Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, E-A-Ski, and Sir Jinx, not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label Lench Mob. Ice Cube has stated that "being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box' He also signed a upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me."
In November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he "always got an album coming out" which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.
In 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the Insane Clown Posse song "Chris Benoit", from ICP's The Mighty Death Pop! album, appearing on the album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120517/ENT09/205170387 |title=Grapevine: ICP, Ice Cube team up on new album | The Detroit News |publisher=detroitnews.com |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-27[/tpl] Also in 2012, Ice Cube had released more details on his upcoming tenth studio album titled, Everythang's Corrupt. A music video for the album's first single of the same name was released on the day before the 2012 USA Election. Ice Cube explained the inspiration and reason for the song saying, "You know, this record is for the political heads. This to me is more a leak at the right time, in time, to drop it. We could have dropped a more catchier tune, but the time wouldn’t have been right. The time is right for "Everythang’s Corrupt," so that’s what we wanted to do. We wanted to drop it at this point and time, and then come with a visual to highlight what we’re saying in the music."[tpl]cite web|last=Ortiz |first=Edwin |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21729/title.ice-cube-details-new-song-everythangs-corrupt-album-praises-kendrick-lamar |title=Ice Cube Details New Song "Everythang's Corrupt" & Album, Praises Kendrick Lamar | Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-05-05[/tpl] "Everythang's Corrupt" was released on iTunes in January 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/everythangs-corrupt-single/id587675433 |title=iTunes - Music - Everythang's Corrupt - Single by Ice Cube |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-05[/tpl] The second single "Crowded" was released to iTunes on March 29.[tpl]cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/crowded-single/id626624693 |title=iTunes - Music - Crowded - Single by Ice Cube |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2013-05-05[/tpl] Ice Cube confirmed on his Twitter account that the album will be released in the fall of 2013 and will also be released via Lench Mob Records.[tpl]cite web|title=Twitter / icecube|url=https://twitter.com/icecube/status/325003749187792897|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl] However the album would be pushed back once again with no release date currently set.

Ice Cube was offered a co-star role with Janet Jackson in the 1993 romantic film Poetic Justice, but he refused to play the role, which was given to Tupac Shakur instead.
John Singleton had encouraged Ice Cube to try his hand at screenwriting, telling him, "If you can write a record, you can write a movie."[tpl]cite web|title=Ice Cube – Brief Article|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-60041449.html|work=Jet|date=February 28, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008[/tpl] With this encouragement, Ice Cube wrote the screenplay for what became the 1995 comedy Friday, in which he also starred, alongside then up-and-coming comedian Chris Tucker. Friday earned $28 million worldwide on a $3.5 million budget, and spawned two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next. (On March 9, 2011 he announced that he was making the final sequel called Last Friday.) That year, he also starred in his second collaboration with John Singleton, Higher Learning, as world-weary university student "Fudge"; a role for which he earned award nominations.

A father of four, Ice Cube was asked by Fresh Air's Terry Gross to provide some perspective on the relationship between his work and his family. When asked whether or not he allowed his children to listen to his music, he responded: "What's worked for me is instilling in my kids a level of self-respect," helping them to understand the content of not just music but the violence found on the evening news. When asked what he tells his children about profanity, he recalled telling his kids that there are "appropriate times to use any kind of language.... Adults should never hear you use these words. If you want to use these words around your friends, that's really on you." Two of his sons (O'Shea Jr. and Darrel) are also rappers under the names OMG and Doughboy. They were featured on his latest album I Am the West.
Jackson is also the cousin of rapper Del the Funky Homosapien who started his career writing for Jackson's Group Da Lench Mob. With Cube's help Del released his debut album I Wish My Brother George Was Here when he was only 18.
