Sewri has a fort that dates back to 1770. The Agri-Horticultural Society had established gardens at Sewri, which were acquired in 1865 by Arthur Crawford, then the Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, for building a European cemetery. Large parts of Sewri belong to the Bombay Port Trust and were incorporated into the harbour facilities. In 1996, the mangrove swamps of Sewri were declared a protected ecology. Lesser Flamingoes from other parts of India come to these mangroves to breed.[tpl]cite news|title=Homecoming for lesser flamingos in Sewri |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-09/mumbai/31041066_1_flamingos-sewri-mudflats |publisher=Times of India |date= 9 February 2012 |accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Mumbai's Sewri mudflats must await pink-feathered flamingos |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_mumbai-s-sewri-mudflats-must-await-pink-feathered-flamingos_1629100 |publisher=Daily News & Analysis |date= 23 December 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl] They arrive at the mudflats from the months of October to March every year.
