Quirin Marie Hubert Guerin (25 January 1896 – 1986) was a French diplomat and military officer. He served as an ambassador to Canada (1949 – 1955), Brazil (1946 – 1949) and the Netherlands (1945 – 1946), and represented the exiled French Committee of National Liberation during World War II.

==Early career==

Before entering France's diplomatic corps, Guerin served in the French Army in World War I. He was awarded the Croix de guerre for his service and shortly after the war was appointed as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. After the war he joined the diplomatic service where he was promoted through the ranks until, in 1943, he joined the exiled anti-Nazi French Committee of National Liberation in Algiers, led by Charles de Gaulle. In 1944, he was appointed as the Committee's representative to the Holy See.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OdMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ndwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6805,7073362&dq=hubert-guerin&hl=en|title=New French Ambassador|date=27 July 1949|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Postmedia Network|page=18|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] According to historian Peter C. Kent, the Vatican's receipt of Guerin as an envoy at the time of the Allied landings in France marked "a striking deviation from traditional Vatican practice which would not normally give official recognition to wartime changes of territory and government".[tpl]cite book|last=Kent|first=Peter C.|title=The lonely Cold War of Pope Pius XII: the Roman Catholic Church and the division of Europe, 1943-1950|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=AZZoTdLB4nwC&pg=PA40&dq=%22hubert+guerin%22+holy+see&hl=en&ei=ddQgTe2yMIK3cN-p0cMK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22hubert%20guerin%22%20holy%20see&f=false|year=2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=0-7735-2326-X|page=40[/tpl]
