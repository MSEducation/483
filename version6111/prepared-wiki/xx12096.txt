</ref> states that if one can explain a phenomenon without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it, i.e. that one should always opt for an explanation in terms of the fewest possible causes, factors, or variables. He turned this into a concern for ontological parsimony; the principle says that one should not multiply entities beyond necessity – ''Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate'' – although this well-known formulation of the principle is not to be found in any of Ockham's extant writings.<ref name="thorburn">[tpl]cite journal |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Occam%27s_Razor | title=The Myth of Occam's Razor| journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] | author=W.

''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham''. Cambridge University Press, 1999: 104.</ref> For Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else is contingent. He thus does not accept the [[principle of sufficient reason]], rejects the distinction between essence and existence, and advocates against the [[Thomism|Thomistic doctrine]] of active and passive intellect. His scepticism to which his ontological parsimony request leads appears in his doctrine that human reason can prove neither the immortality of the soul nor the existence, unity, and infinity of God. These truths, he teaches, are known to us by revelation alone.

===Natural philosophy===

Ockham wrote a great deal on natural philosophy, including a long commentary on Aristotle's Physics. According to the principle of ontological parsimony, he holds that we do not need to allow entities in all ten of Aristotle's categories; we thus do not need the category of quantity, as the mathematical entities are not "real". Mathematics must be applied to other categories, such as the categories of substance or qualities, thus anticipating modern scientific renaissance while violating Aristotelian prohibition of metabasis.

===Theory of knowledge===

In the theory of knowledge, Ockham rejected the scholastic theory of species, as unnecessary and not supported by experience, in favour of a theory of abstraction. This was an important development in late medieval epistemology. He also distinguished between intuitive and abstract cognition; intuitive cognition depends on the existence or non existence of the object, whereas abstractive cognition "abstracts" the object from the existence predicate. Interpreters are, as yet, undecided about the roles of these two types of cognitive activities.

===Political theory===

Ockham is also increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of Western constitutional ideas,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] especially those of government with limited responsibility.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] He was one of the first medieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] and was important for the early development of the notion of property rights. His political ideas are regarded as "natural" or "secular",[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] holding for a secular absolutism.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] The views on monarchical accountability espoused in his Dialogus (written between 1332 and 1347)Cf. the online British Academy edition at http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html greatly influenced the Conciliar movement and assisted in the emergence of liberal democratic ideologies.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Logic===

In logic, Ockham wrote down in words the formulae that would later be called De Morgan's Laws,In his Summa Logicae, part II, sections 32 & 33.Translated on page 80 of Philosophical Writings, tr. P. Boehner, rev. S. Brown, (Indianapolis, IN, 1990) and he pondered ternary logic, that is, a logical system with three truth values; a concept that would be taken up again in the mathematical logic of the 19th and 20th centuries. His contributions to semantics, especially to the maturing theory of supposition, are still studied by logicians.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Graham Priest |last2=Read |first2=S. |title=The Formalization of Ockham's Theory of Supposition |journal=Mind |volume=LXXXVI |pages=109–113 |year=1977 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXXVI.341.109 |url=http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LXXXVI/341/109.full.pdf+html?sid=c98343a3-49ab-4711-83ce-8418cc417280 |issue=341 [/tpl]JOHN CORCORAN AND JOHN SWINIARSKI. 1978. Logical Structures of Ockham's Theory of Supposition, Franciscan Studies 38, 161–83. Ockham was probably the first logician to treat empty terms in Aristotelian syllogistic effectively; he devised an empty term semantics that exactly fit the syllogistic. Specifically, an argument is valid according to Ockham’s semantics if and only if it is valid according to Prior Analytics.John Corcoran .1981.Ockham's Syllogistic Semantics, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 46 (1981) 197–198.

==Literary Ockhamism/nominalism==

Ockham and his works have been discussed as a possible influence on several late medieval literary figures and works, especially Geoffrey Chaucer, but also Jean Molinet, the Gawain poet, François Rabelais, John Skelton, Julian of Norwich, the York and Townely Plays, and Renaissance romances. Only in very few of these cases is it possible to demonstrate direct links to Ockham or his texts. Correspondences between Ockhamist and Nominalist philosophy/theology and literary texts from medieval to postmodern times have been discussed within the scholarly paradigm of literary nominalism.William H. Watts and Richard J. Utz, "Nominalist Influence on Chaucer's Poetry: A Bibliographical Essay," Medievalia & Humanistica 20 n.s. (1993), 147–73; Helen Ruth Andretta, Chaucer's 'Troilus and Criseyde.' A Poet's Response to Ockhamism (New York: Lang, 1997).

==Works==

The standard edition of his philosophical and theological works is William of Ockham: Opera philosophica et theologica, Gedeon Gál, et al., eds. 17 vols. St. Bonaventure, N. Y.: The Franciscan Institute, 1967–88.  For his political works, all but the Dialogus have been edited in William of Ockham,  H. S. Offler, et al., eds. 4 vols., 1940–97, Manchester: Manchester University Press 1–3; Oxford: Oxford University Press 4.
