Invasive species, also called invasive exotics or simply exotics, is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native habitats, with several definitions.
Because of the variability of its definition, and because definitions are often from a socioeconomic perspective, the phrase invasive species  is often criticized as an imprecise term for the scientific field of ecology.  This article concerns the first two definitions; for the third, see Introduced species.

==Causes==

Scientists include species- and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms, that when combined establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species-based mechanisms===

Invasive species seem to have traits or combinations thereof that enable them to outcompete native species. The competition sometimes is about rates of growth and reproduction; species other times interact with each other more directly.
Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |coauthors=D.M. Lodge |year=2001 |title=Progress in invasion biology: predicting invaders|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=199–204 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02101-2 |pmid=11245943[/tpl] Another study found invasive species tended only to have a small subset of the presumed traits, and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species, requiring other explanations.[tpl]cite journal |last=Thebaud |first=C. |coauthors=A.C.

An introduced species typically must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location. At low population densities, reproduction and maintenance in a new location can be difficult: a species might go somewhere multiple times before establishing.  Such repeated patterns of human movement as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high propagule pressure).[tpl]cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |coauthors=G.M. Ruiz, L.D. Smith, B. Galil, A.W. Miller, and K.R. Murphy |year=2005 |title=Supply-side invasion ecology: characterizing propagule pressure in coastal ecosystems |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume= 272 |pages=1249–1256 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3090 |pmid= 16024389 |issue= 1569 |pmc= 1564104[/tpl]
An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for such resources as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great competition or predation, then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to quickly proliferate. Ecosystems wherein native species fully use all available resources can be modeled as zero-sum systems wherein any gain for the invader is a loss for the native; yet however enticing this model is, unilateral competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.[tpl]cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |coauthors= D. Binkley, G.W. Chong, M.A. Kalkhan, L.D. Schell, K.A. Bull, Y. Otsuki, G. Newman, M. Bashkin, and Y. Son |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)0690025:EPSIHS2.0.CO;2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Sax |first= D.F. |coauthors= S.

Brown |year=2002 |title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds |journal=American Naturalist |volume=160 |pages=766–783 |doi=10.1086/343877 |pmid=18707464 |issue=6[/tpl] Invasive species often coexist with native species for while gradually outcompeting it by adapting to the new location and growing in number and population density.
An invasive species might use such resources that were previously unavailable to native species as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot, or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) was introduced to California on serpentine soils, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high Magnesium/Calcium ratio, and possible heavy metal toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density whereas goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils, crowding out native species that have poorly adapted to serpentine soils.[tpl]cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |coauthors= S. Hamburg, R. Koide, H. Mooney, and P. Vitousek |year=1990 |title=Effects of soil resources on plant invasion and community structure in California (USA) serpentine grassland |journal=Ecology |volume= 71 |pages=478–491 |doi=10.2307/1940302 |jstor=1940302 |issue=2 |publisher=Ecology, Vol. 71, No. 2[/tpl]
Ecological facilitation occurs where a species alters its environment by so using chemicals or manipulating abiotic factors as to enable itself to thrive while making the environment less favorable to competitors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] One facilitative mechanism is allelopathy, which also is known as chemical competition or interference competition, whereby a plant secretes chemicals that make the surrounding soil uninhabitable, or at least inhibitory, to competing species.
Examples of ecological facilitaion in Centaurea are Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) and Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed). These Eastern European noxious weeds have spread through the western and West Coast states. Experiments show that 8-hydroxyquinoline, a chemical produced at the root of C. diffusa, has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. C. diffusa and C. solstitialis appear not in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack thereof in one habitat is not necessarily indicative of success in others; examining habitats wherein a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |coauthors=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |coauthors=H.P.

Callaway |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x[/tpl]
Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. Bromus tectorum, originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It spreads rapidly after burning and increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry detritus during the fire season in western North America. Where widespread it has so altered the local fire regimen that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing B. tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.[tpl]cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |coauthors=C. M. D’Antonio, D. M. Richardson, J. B. Grace, J. E. Keeley, J. M. DiTomaso, R. J. Hobbs, M. Pellant, and D.

Facilitation also occurs where one species so physically modifies a habitat as to help other species. For example, zebra mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices wherein invertebrates live: this increase in complexity and the nutrition that the waste products of mussel filter-feeding provide increases the density and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities.[tpl]cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |coauthors= B.

Schlosser |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184[/tpl]

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===

In ecosystems, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.[tpl]cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x[/tpl]
When changes such as a forest fire occur, normal succession favors native grasses and forbs. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. Nitrogen and phosphorus are often the limiting factors in these situations.[tpl]cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |coauthors=J.P. Grime, K. Thompson |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x[/tpl]
Every species occupies a niche in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example edge effects describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining  undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Ecology==

===Native "invaders"===

Although invasive species have typically been introduced to a habitat, some native species can, under the influence of events, such as long-term rainfall changes or human modifications to the habitat, increase in number and range and become invasive by expanding into new areas and disturbing the balance of species in the new area.
All species experience increases and decreases in numbers, in many cases accompanied by expansion or contraction of range. For example, the Monterey cypress is an endangered endemic,[tpl]cite book |last= Smith|first=J. P., Jr. |coauthors=K. Berg |title=Inventory of rare and endangered vascular plants of California |publisher=California Native Plant Society |location=Sacramento, California |isbn=0-943460-14-X |year= 1988[/tpl] naturally occurring only in two small stands in California. They are being exterminated as exotic invasive species less than [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] from their natural habitat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Traits of invaded ecosystems===

In 1958, Charles S. Elton[tpl]cite book |last= Elton|first=C.S. |others=Foreword by Daniel Simberloff |title=The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants |origyear=1958 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-20638-6 |page=196[/tpl] claimed that ecosystems with higher species diversity were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches. Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion.[tpl]cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J., |coauthors= D. Binkley, G.W. Chong, M.A. Kalkhan, L.D. Schell, K.A. Bull, Y. Otsuki, G. Newman, M. Bashkin, and Y. Son |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)0690025:EPSIHS2.0.CO;2[/tpl]
This debate hinged on the spatial scale at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability  to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.[tpl]cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |coauthors=E.G. Noonburg |year=2003 |title=Scale dependent effects of biotic resistance to biological invasion |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |pages=1428–1433 |doi=10.1890/02-3131 |issue=6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Levine |first=J. M. |year=2000 |title=Species diversity and biological invasions: Relating local process to community pattern |journal=Science |volume=288 |pages=852–854 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.852 |pmid=10797006 |issue=5467[/tpl]
Invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to the one in which the potential invader evolved.[tpl]cite journal |last=Williams |first=J.D. |coauthors=G. K. Meffe |year= 1998 |title= Nonindigenous Species|journal= Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources. Reston, Virginia: United States Department of the Interior, Geological Survey|volume=1[/tpl] Island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators, or because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have "open" niches.[tpl]cite book |last=Stachowicz |first=J.J. |coauthors=D.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced. Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.[tpl]cite journal |last= Tilman |first= D. |year= 2004|title=Niche tradeoffs, neutrality, and community structure: A stochastic theory of resource competition, invasion, and community assembly |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 101 |pages=10854–10861|doi=10.1073/pnas.0403458101|pmid=15243158 |issue= 30 |pmc= 503710[/tpl]

===Vectors===

Non-native species have many vectors, including biogenic vectors, but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural range extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.[tpl]cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |coauthors=T.M. Blackburn, R.P. Duncan and S.L. Chown |year=2005 |title= Concerning Invasive Species: Reply to Brown and Sax|journal= Austral Ecology|volume= 30|issue= 4|page=475|doi= 10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01505.x[/tpl]
An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) to Polynesia.[tpl]cite journal |last=Matisoo-Smith |first=E. |coauthors=R.M. Roberts, G.J. Irwin, J.S. Allen, D. Penny, and D.M. Lambert |year=1998 |title= Patterns of prehistoric human mobility in Polynesia indicated by mtDNA from the Pacific rat|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |pages=15145–15150|doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.25.15145|pmid= 9844030 |issue=25 |pmc=24590[/tpl]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for horticulture. The pet trade moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.  Ballast water taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions. Around the world on the average day, more than 3,000 different species of aquatic life may be transported on these vessels.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gulfbase.org/issue/view.php? |title= Invasive Species |editor= F.

Tunnell, Jr. |work= GulfBase: Resource Database for Gulf of Mexico Research |series= |publisher= Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi |accessdate= March 19, 2013[/tpl] For example, freshwater zebra mussels, native to the Black, Caspian and Azov seas, probably reached the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.Aquatic invasive species.

The arrival of invasive propagules to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.[tpl]cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |coauthors=N.E.

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home", American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles.  Agricultural Research Service entomologists identified them as rhinoceros beetle, hercules beetle, and king stag beetle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17[/tpl] Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems. To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. USDA programs such as Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.
Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable Chinese mitten crab is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===Impacts of wildfire===

Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem (wildfires, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires are capable of sterilizing soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.

====Impact of wildfire suppression on spreading====

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and wildland-urban interface areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads often overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Large wild fires attract firefighters from remote locales, further increasing the potential for seed transport.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Effects==

===Ecological===

Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as [tpl]okina[/tpl]ae[tpl]okina[/tpl]ae in Hawaii (the indigenous Bacopa monnieri) is regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.
Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the amethyst gem clam (Gemma gemma) and the European green crab (Carcinus maenas). The gem clam was introduced into California's Bodega Harbor from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (Nutricola spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.[tpl]cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825[/tpl]
In the Waterberg region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original grassland, resulting in a massive reduction in forage for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are giraffe, blue wildebeest, impala, kudu and white rhino.
Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regimen (cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora), and hydrology (Tamarix) in native ecosystems.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |coauthors=D.

===Economic===

====Benefits====

Non-native species can have benefits. Asian oysters, for example, better filter water pollutants than native[tpl]clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012[/tpl] oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this mollusk in the Chesapeake Bay to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.Tom Pelton, Baltimore Sun, May 26, 2006.

====Costs====

Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138 billion annually.[tpl]cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |authorlink= |coauthors= R. Zuniga and D., Morrison |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 [/tpl] Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.[tpl]cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315[/tpl] When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of ecosystem services, costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase. The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

====Economic opportunities====

Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, silver carp and common carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product, or processed into pet foods, or mink feed. Vegetative invasives such as water hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane digesters[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl].

====Plant Industry====

Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see dynamic accumulator) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects and/or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, Euphorbia esula) or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., yellow starthistle). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly US$1 billion in the U.S. alone. A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by honey bees infected by the invasive varroa mite. Introduced rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus) have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.
Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the  impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.2013. "Citrus Greening."

====Aquaculture====

The aquaculture is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., Oreochromis niloticus)[tpl]cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |coauthors=O. Rigolin-Sá, and F.M. Pelicice |year=2011 |title= Growing, losing or introducing?

====Forestry====

The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change forest ecology and damage the timber industry. The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees. As of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions.
In North America, the woolly adelgid has inflicted damage on old-growth spruce, fir and hemlock  forests and damages the Christmas tree industry.[ref]

Garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, is one of the most problematic invasive plant species in eastern North American forests. The characteristics of garlic mustard are slightly different from those of the surrounding native plants, which results in a highly successful species that is altering the composition and function of the native communities it invades. When garlic mustard invades the understory of a forest, it effects the growth rate of tree seedlings, which is likely to alter forest regeneration of impact forest composition in the future.Rodger, Vikki,Stinson, Kristin & Finzi, Adrian (2008) "Ready or Not, Garlic Mustard Is Moving In: Alliaria petiolata as a Member of Eastern North American Forests" BioScience Vol.58 No.5.

====Tourism and recreation====

Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.[tpl]cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.[/tpl] Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds."

===Health===

Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases  such as AIDS virus to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and tsetse fly pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of Asian lung fluke.Aquatic invasive species. A Guide to Least-Wanted Aquatic Organisms of the Pacific Northwest. 2001. University of Washington Throughout recorded history, epidemics of human diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, and bubonic plague, spread via these vectors. A recent example of an introduced disease is the spread of the West Nile virus, which killed humans, birds, mammals, and reptiles.[tpl]cite journal |last= Lanciotti|first=R.S. |year=1999 |title=Origin of the West Nile virus responsible for an outbreak of encephalitis in the northeastern United States|journal=Science |volume=286 |pages=2333–2337 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5448.2333 |pmid=10600742 |last2= Roehrig |first2= JT |last3= Deubel |first3= V |last4= Smith |first4= J |last5= Parker |first5= M |last6= Steele |first6= K |last7= Crise |first7= B |last8= Volpe |first8= KE |last9= Crabtree |first9= MB |issue= 5448 |first10= JH |first11= RA |first12= JS |first13= CB |first14= B |first15= E |first16= B |first17= M |first18= C |first19= J |first20= N |first21= HM |first22= W |first23= T |first24= DJ[/tpl] Waterborne disease agents, such as cholera bacteria (Vibrio cholerae), and causative agents of harmful algal blooms are often transported via ballast water.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hallegraeff |first=G.M. |authorlink= |year=1998 |title=Transport of toxic dinoflagellates via ships' ballast water: Bioeconomic risk assessment and efficacy of possible ballast water management strategies|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=168 |pages=297–309 |doi=10.3354/meps168297[/tpl] Invasive species and accompanying control efforts can have long term public health implications. For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.

===Biodiversity===

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global biodiversity loss and is increasing because of tourism and globalization.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh water systems, though quarantines and ballast water rules have improved the situation.
Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion, niche displacement, or hybridisation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world’s fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.Odendaal L. J., Haupt T. M. & Griffiths C. L. (2008). "The alien invasive land snail Theba pisana in the West Coast National Park: Is there cause for concern?". Koedoe - African Protected Area Conservation and Science 50(1): 93-98. abstract, [tpl]doi|10.4102/koedoe.v50i1.153[/tpl]. Nevertheless, it is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion, and the few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa. Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the potential risk.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

====Genetic pollution====

Native species can be threatened with extinction[tpl]cite journal|author= |pmc=33232 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |publisher= date=|year= 2001|volume= 98|issue= 10|pmid= 11344292|last1= Mooney|first1= HA|last2= Cleland|first2= EE|pages= 5446–51|doi= 10.1073/pnas.091093398|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America [/tpl] through the process of genetic pollution. Genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and introgression, which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of the introduced species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nativeseednetwork.org/article_view?id=13 |title=Glossary: definitions from the following publication: Aubry, C., R. Shoal and V. Erickson. 2005. Grass cultivars: their origins, development, and use on national forests and grasslands in the Pacific Northwest.

Hybrids resulting from rare species that interbreed with abundant species can swamp the rarer species' gene pool. This is not always apparent from morphological observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is normal, and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes.EXTINCTION BY HYBRIDIZATION AND INTROGRESSION; by Judith M.

==Study==

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of ecology where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by Charles Elton's 1958 book The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.[tpl]cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|coauthors=Martha F. Hoopes, Michael P. Marchetti|accessdate=21 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and evolution[/tpl] Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day. This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial plants. The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology". This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.
In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on biogeography rather than on taxa.[tpl]cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |coauthors=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2[/tpl]
By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.
