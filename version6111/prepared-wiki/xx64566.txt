"The Patriotic Song (of Glinka)" ([tpl]lang-rus|Патриотическая Песнь Глинки|r=Patrioticheskaya Pesn' Glinki[/tpl]; also translatable as "A Patriotic Song") was the state and national anthem of the Russian SFSR and of the Russian Federation from 1990 to 2000.

==History==

The song originally was not a song but a composition for piano without lyrics, written by Mikhail Glinka and entitled in French, "Motif de chant national."  The song has been confused with the closing chorus of Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar, probably because both begin with the same word ("Slav'sya"), but the two compositions are unrelated (though the operatic music, too, has been suggested as a candidate for the Russian national anthem).
The melody of the "Patriotic song" is similar to the melody of the Lenten hymn "Christe, qui lux es et dies" by
Venceslaus Samotulinus (1526-1560), what is not surprising because of Polish roots of Glinka's family.
The tune of this instrumental anthem, which was chosen by Boris Yeltsin in the early 1990s and favored by the Russian Orthodox church, went without lyrics for several years. In 1999, a contest to provide suitable words for the anthem was won by Viktor Radugin with his poem "Славься, Россия!" ("Slav'sya, Rossiya!"; "Be glorious, Russia!"). Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin took office. The National Anthem of the Soviet Union music with modified lyrics was established and approved by federal legislature in December 2000.

==Above the Great Motherland==

Above the Great Motherland (Nad Otcziznoi Velichavo) by Vladimir Kalinkin, written in 1998 was another proposed set of lyrics. Performed by honored Russian artist Vladimir Detayov, the Duma was made aware of this piece's existence in April 1999. At the initiative of the Ministry of Ethnic Policy of Russia, this record was first publicly presented at the First Congress of the Assembly of Peoples of Russia. During the summer of that year, the anthem was performed on the radio station "Radio of Russia" and the TV channel "Moskoviya", devoted to writing the text of the anthem of the country.
In January 2000, was carried out in a new orchestral arrangement demo studio recording of this project anthem performed by the National Academic Orchestra of Folk Instruments Russia it. NP Osipova and the Russian State Academic Choir of them. AV Sveshnikov. Overall the song received very positive reviews, although like "Slav'sya Rossiya", never attained official status.
