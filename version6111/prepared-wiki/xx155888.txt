==Campus==

The campus is located on one of the most beautiful stretches of Aegean coast just outside the city of Izmir. Comprising [tpl]convert|15000|acre|km2[/tpl], it boasts two ancient Roman baths, its own waterfalls, olive groves, vineyards, valleys, hills, Mediterranean flora as well as landscaped areas — not to mention the breathtaking sunsets and dawns that must have inspired Anaxagoras as well as the builders of the earliest known olive oil atelier at Klazomenai some ten kilometers from the campus entrance. 
Spanning an Edenic natural environment (such as Antiquity knew) with expansive research and living premises and the urban facilities of an ancient, yet energetic, city of three million residents, the İzmir Institute of Technology offers a wide range of possibilities for the active, enquiring researcher and for the contemplative intellectual. Living, working, and natural leisure facilities as well as a large variety of student activities and sports are available on campus. Efficient transportation between campus and city centre is provided by the Institute via the İzmir-Çeşme Highway.
