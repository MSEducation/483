Rede Bandeirantes ([tpl]IPA-pt|ˈʁedʒi bɐ̃dejˈɾɐ̃tʃis[/tpl], Bandeirantes Network), officially nicknamed Band, is a television network from Brazil, based in São Paulo.

==History==

Rede Bandeirantes was founded on May 13, 1967, by João Saad, nephew of São Paulo state governor Ademar de Barros and owner of Rádio Bandeirantes. In 1969 the main TV building suffered a massive fire, which forced Saad to renew his broadcasting equipment. By 1972, TV Bandeirantes was the first Brazilian television network to fully broadcast in color, the same year that Rede Globo did the same. Later in the 1970s Bandeirantes became a national broadcasting network. In 2007, the network launched a digital over-the-air feed in São Paulo.
In 2008, Band began to have the support of the Argentinean production company Cuatro Cabezas. Since then, the station gained more ratings and media attention, thanks to the humoristic show CQC - Custe o Que Custar and later to other Cuatro-Cabezas-produced shows. In 2012, the founder and head of the production company, Diego Guebel became artistic director of the network. With his direction, Band enjoyed a new growth of ratings; those responsible for this new achievement were the shows Pânico na Band - Humoristic show with the cast of former Pânico na TV, on RedeTV! -  and Quem Fica em Pé? - Brazilian version of Who's Still Standing?.
