==History==

===Early years===

The airline was set up on 27 January 1955. It was established as Aryana Airlines with the assistance of Indamer Co. Ltd., which initially held a 49% interest, and the government of Afghanistan owned the balance. At the beginning, services were operated to Bahrain, India, Iran, and Lebanon, with a fleet of three Douglas DC-3s. In 1957, Pan American World Airways became the minor shareholder of the airline when it took over the 49% interest from Indamer. Domestic scheduled services started the same year. By [tpl]start date|1960|4[/tpl], a fleet of three DC-3s was being used for linking Kabul with Amritsar, Delhi, Jeddah, and Karachi, as well as with some points within Afghanistan, while a single DC-4 operated the Kabul–Kandahar–Tehran–Damascus–Beirut–Ankara–Prague–Frankfurt service, so-called “Marco Polo” route. In the early 1960s, [tpl]US$|1100000|1960|link=yes[/tpl] from US aid to Afghanistan was used to capitalise the company.
By [tpl]start date|1970|3[/tpl], the airline had 650 employees. At this time, the fleet comprised one Boeing 727-100C, one CV-440, one DC-3 and two Douglas DC-6s that worked on routes serving the Middle East, India, Pakistan, the USSR, and Istanbul, Frankfurt and London. Domestic services were then operated by Bakhtar Alwatana, which was established by the government in 1967 to this specific purpose.
The carrier's first widebody aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, entered the fleet in early [tpl]start date|1979|10[/tpl]. By [tpl]start date|1985|3[/tpl], the aircraft park consisted of the DC-10 and two Boeing 727-100Cs.[tpl]cite journal|title= World airline directory[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Ariana Afghan Airlines|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200915.html|journal= Flight International|date= [tpl]date|1985-3-30[/tpl]|page= 55|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200915.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/69zyN4Jbt|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-8-18[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-8-18[/tpl][/tpl] In the mid-1980s, during the Soviet-Afghan War, the carrier was forced to sell the DC-10 to British Caledonian, as the Soviets wanted the carrier to fly the Tupolev Tu-154 as a replacement. In [tpl]start date|1985|10[/tpl], Ariana was taken over by Bakhtar, which became the country's new national airline. In 1986, Bakhtar ordered two Tupolev Tu-154Ms; the airline took possession of these aircraft in [tpl]start date|1987|4[/tpl]. In [tpl]start date|1988|2[/tpl], Bakhtar was merged back into Ariana, thus creating an airline which could serve both short and long haul routes.[tpl]additional citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===Taliban era===

After the end of the Soviet war in 1989 and collapse of Najibullah's government, the Taliban took over Kabul in 1996. Afghanistan faced substantial economic sanctions from the international sector during the Taliban regime. The sanctions, along with the Taliban government's control of the company and the grounding of many of the carrier's international flights, had a devastating effect on the economic health of the company through the 1990s. The fleet was reduced to only a handful of Russian and Ukrainian built An-26s, Yakovlev Yak-40s and three Boeing 727s, which were used on the longest domestic routes. In October 1996, Pakistan provided a temporary maintenance and operational base at Karachi. With no overseas assets, by 1999 Ariana's international operations consisted of flights to Dubai only; also, limited cargo flights continued into China's western provinces. However, sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1267 forced the airline company to suspend overseas operations. In [tpl]start date|2001|11[/tpl], the airline was grounded completely.

===Post-Taliban era===

Following the overthrow of the Taliban government during Operation Enduring Freedom, Ariana began to rebuild its operations in [tpl]start date|2001|12[/tpl]. About a month later, the UN sanctions were finally lifted, permitting the airline to resume international routes again.
In 2002, the government of India gave the carrier a gift of three ex-Air India Airbus A300s. Ariana's first international passenger flight since 1999 landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport in [tpl]start date|2002|1[/tpl], followed by routes to Pakistan and Germany in [tpl]MONTHNAME|6[/tpl] and [tpl]MONTHNAME|10[/tpl] the same year, respectively. In 2005, India signed an agreement on aviation cooperation with Afghanistan, with Air India training some 50 officials for Ariana.

===EU ban===

Ariana was mostly banned from flying into European Union airspace in [tpl]start date|2006|3[/tpl], with the European Commission allowing the carrier to fly only a single France-registered Airbus A310 into the member states;[tpl]cite news|title= Painted Black: a study of the EU unsafe airlines ban|agency= Flight International|location= London|publisher= Flightglobal|date= [tpl]date|2006-4-6[/tpl]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/painted-black-a-study-of-the-eu-unsafe-airlines-ban-205841/|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6DvSy3O17|archivedate= [tpl]date|2013-1-24[/tpl][/tpl] the ban was extended to the entire fleet in October of that year. The ban was confirmed in subsequent updates of the list released in late 2009[tpl]cite news|title= Other News - 12/01/2009|publisher= Air Transport World|date= [tpl]date|2009-12-2[/tpl]|url= http://atwonline.com/international-aviation-regulation/news/other-news-12012009-1201|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Akto3lbn|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-9-17[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]start date|2010|3[/tpl].
