this was an "off-promotion" project and not a real single knowing that no digital or physical release was published as such, except from a Cherry Cherry Boom Boom remix featuring Canadian musician Peaches.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/trouble-cherry-cherry-boom/id849344708

===2014–present: New projects and international breakthrough===
