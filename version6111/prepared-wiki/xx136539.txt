In mathematics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem or Daniell-Kolmogorov extension theorem (also known as Kolmogorov existence theorem or Kolmogorov consistency theorem) is a theorem that guarantees that a suitably "consistent" collection of finite-dimensional distributions will define a stochastic process. It is credited to the Soviet mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov[tpl]cite book | author=Ã˜ksendal, Bernt | title=Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications | publisher=Springer, Berlin | year=2003 | isbn=3-540-04758-1[/tpl] and also to British mathematician Percy John Daniell who discovered it independently in the slightly different setting of integration theory.

==Implications of the theorem==

Since the two conditions are trivially satisfied for any stochastic process, the powerful statement of the theorem is that no other conditions are required: For any reasonable (i.e., consistent) family of finite-dimensional distributions, there exists a stochastic process with these distributions. 
The measure-theoretic approach to stochastic processes starts with a probability space and defines a stochastic process as a family of functions on this probability space. However, in many applications the starting point is really the finite-dimensional distributions ("statistics") of the stochastic process. The theorem says that provided the finite-dimensional distributions satisfy the obvious consistency requirements, one can always identify a probability space to match the purpose. In many situations, this means that one does not have to be explicit about what the probability space is. Many texts on stochastic processes do, indeed, assume a probability space but never state explicitly what it is.
