Neal A Boortz, Jr. (born April 6, 1945) is an American author, attorney, and former radio host.[tpl]cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/nealboortz/|work=Townhall.com|title=Neal Boortz[/tpl] His nationally syndicated talk show, The Neal Boortz Show, which ended in 2013, was carried throughout the United States. It was ranked seventh in overall listeners, with more than 4.25 million per week.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=34|last=|first=|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences|publisher=Talkers Magazine|work=|date=2008-10-15|accessdate=2008-10-15[/tpl] The content of the show included politics, current events, social issues, and topics of interest, which Boortz discussed with callers, correspondents and guests. Boortz touched on many controversial topics and referred to himself as an "equal opportunity offender."
Boortz's first involvement with radio was in the 1960s, while he was a student at Texas A&M University, working as a local on-air personality at WTAW-AM. After moving to Georgia, he became an avid listener of Atlanta’s first talk radio station. Boortz became a regular caller to the morning talk show. When the show's host died, it created a job opening, which Boortz actively pursued. He was initially hired on a two-week "trial run", and later offered the permanent position. Boortz attended night law school, earning a law degree in 1977. For some years he worked as both an attorney and as a talk show host. He eventually closed his law practice in order to concentrate on his work in radio.
Boortz has received many industry accolades. He was named as one of the "25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America" by Talkers magazine, and one of "Georgia's 100 Most Influential People" by Georgia Trend. In 2009, Boortz was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.
Boortz's first book was The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear in 1997,[tpl]cite book|first=Neal|last=Boortz|year=1997|title=The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear|edition=Hardcover|publisher=Longstreet Press|isbn=978-1-56352-434-9[/tpl] followed by The Terrible Truth About Liberals, in 1998.[tpl]cite book|first=Neal|last=Boortz|year=1998| title=The Terrible Truth About Liberals|edition=Paperback|publisher=Longstreet Press|isbn=1-56352-685-9[/tpl] In 2005, he co-wrote The FairTax Book with Congressman John Linder, proposing to implement a variant of a national retail sales tax in lieu of other federal taxes. Boortz's involvement with the FairTax is covered in the documentary film An Inconvenient Tax.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Boortz was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, which was his mother's home. His father was a World War II pilot in the Marine Corps and later served in the Korean War and Vietnam War. Describing himself as a "military brat", Boortz lived in many locations throughout the country (including the small community of Thrall, Texas).[tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200503/03232005.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|title=Thrall Volunteer Fire Department|publisher=Cox Radio|work=Nealz Nuze|date=2003-03-23|accessdate=2006-12-15[/tpl] Boortz spent his first two years of High School at Tustin Union High School in Tustin, California. The family then moved to Florida. Boortz graduated from Pensacola High School, in 1963. He attended Texas A&M University, but did not graduate. Boortz states "I was in the Corps of Cadets. Fighting Seagram's Seven, to be exact"[tpl]cite web|title=More Boortz FAQ|url=http://boortz.com/more/faq.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|publisher=Cox Radio|work=More Boortz|accessdate=2006-03-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060302002315/http://boortz.com/more/faq.html |archivedate=2006-03-02[/tpl] Boortz then attended John Marshall Law School, in Atlanta, Georgia.

===Personal life===

Neal Boortz makes his permanent home in Naples, Florida, spending a few months in Atlanta, Georgia. He lives with his wife, Donna, whom he calls "The Queen", and "My Bride." They have one married daughter, and a granddaughter. Boortz is an avid pilot and enjoys spending his free time playing golf or flying. He has said that "There's nothing like flying upside down to clear your mind ... among other things." Boortz owns a Mooney Ovation3 and a Super Decathlon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://580wdbo.com/about_us/nealboortz2.html|publisher=580wdbo.com|title=Neal Boortz|accessdate=2007-09-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071113174358/http://580wdbo.com/about_us/nealboortz2.html|archivedate=November 13, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] He is also a motorcycle enthusiast.

==Career path==

Boortz began his radio career in College Station, Texas in the 1960s at WTAW-AM, under the name of Randy Neal, while attending Texas A&M University.[tpl]cite web|title=More Boortz Bio|work=More Boortz|publisher=Cox Radio|last=Boortz|first=Neal|url=http://boortz.com/more/bio.html|accessdate=2006-03-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060302002305/http://boortz.com/more/bio.html |archivedate=2006-03-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Neal Boortz Bio|work=|publisher=Soylent Communications/nndb.com|last=|first=|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/531/000121168/|accessdate=2007-09-06[/tpl] In 1967, after leaving Texas, Boortz moved to Atlanta and landed a sales job. For two years he worked at Rich's Department Store, where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was Martin Luther King, Jr. During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of WRNG-AM, which called itself "Ring Radio", Atlanta's first talk radio station. He listened to their morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a devotee. "Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/1998/07/01|title=Neal Boortz-Have Mouth Will Talk|publisher=Atlanta Magazine|date=1998-07-01|accessdate=10/09/2013[/tpl] While watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that "they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place", Boortz was offered to be a temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years. Boortz honed his skills at the tiny 1,000-watt station, and even wrote a few speeches for then Georgia Governor Lester Maddox. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG "dumped him". He worked briefly at a radio station in Schenectady, New York, but soon returned to Atlanta.
In 1974, Boortz enrolled in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class in his spare time, while he and his wife Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.

===Radio career===

While in law school, Boortz returned to work at WRNG. In 1983 he moved to the larger news and talk radio station WGST. He later recounted how he would often go into work at his law office at 5:00am, work there for several hours, then go to WGST, and finally back to the law office until 11:00pm. In 1992, Boortz asked WGST for a raise; a salary equal to his combined income as an attorney and a radio host. When WGST refused, Boortz left. He got his raise when he signed an exclusive contract with WSB to host a daily radio show. Shortly after that, he closed his law office. In 1995, Talkers Magazine named Boortz one of the "25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America". That same year, Georgia Trend magazine added Boortz to its list of the "100 Most Powerful & Influential People in Georgia".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/lpn/9807-conv-1998-speakers.html|title=Elder, Boortz, and McWilliams round out Convention '98 line-up|accessdate=2007-03-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703074051/http://www.lp.org/lpn/9807-conv-1998-speakers.html|archivedate=July 3, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2005/11/chirac_appeals_for_calm_as_par.php|title=Chirac Appeals for Calm as Paris Suburbs Endure Sixth Night of Violence|accessdate=2007-03-04[/tpl]

In 1999, his show became nationally syndicated through WSB's owner Cox Radio. The show originated in Atlanta. The Neal Boortz Show featured Boortz, producer Belinda Skelton, interviewees, and callers. On the air and on his website Boortz admonished his listeners to take no heed nor place any credence in anything he said, presenting himself as merely an "entertainer." As an entertainer, Boortz was a 2002 NAB Marconi Radio Awards finalist and Radio & Records NewsTalk Personality of the Year for 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coxradiosyndication.com/shows/boortz1.html|publisher=Cox Radio Interactive & Cox Radio|title=Neal Boortz|accessdate=2006-08-16[/tpl] NewsMax.com Magazine's "Top 25 Talk Radio Host" list selected Boortz as the ninth most influential host in the nation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/talkradio/|publisher=NewsMax|title=25 Most Influential Talk Radio Hosts (2006)|year=2006|accessdate=2006-08-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024070621/http://www.newsmax.com/talkradio/ |archivedate=October 24, 2006[/tpl]

===Author===

Boortz's first foray into authorship was in 1997 with The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear, in which he delivers his opinions on various topics in the form of a commencement speech he would give to new college graduates, if ever invited to do so.

==Political beliefs==

Boortz is a self-described libertarian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlanta.about.com/od/celebrityprofiles/p/nealboortz.htm|first=Joy|last=Johnston|publisher=About.com|work=|title=Neal Boortz Atlanta Celebrity Profile|accessdate=2007-09-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200610/10042006.html|first=Neal|last=Boortz|publisher=Cox Radio|work=Nealz Nuze|title=Following Up On Yesterday's Tirade|date=2006-10-04|accessdate=2006-10-05[/tpl] He advocates a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system and the release of all non-violent drug offenders who are currently in prison. He has supported Republican candidates and Republican tax policy, though he occasionally clashes with Republicans on social issues. Others describe his political views as being more in line with "republitarian" philosophy that embraces incrementalism domestically, and a generally interventionist foreign policy based on self-interest, national defense and the expansion of freedom.[tpl]cite web|title=Just What Is The Problem With Pre-Emptive Warfare|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200311/11242003.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|date=2003-11-24|accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl] Boortz disagrees with the Libertarian Party platform on several key issues including his firm support of the war in Iraq, incremental tax reform, and his opposition to the unrestricted immigration policy advocated by the Libertarian Party.
Boortz criticizes the major parties saying "I believe that the principal difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do." He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make up the majority of his listeners and callers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Boortz's post-9/11 platforms include support for the US-led War on Terror, a more aggressive foreign policy, and the USA Patriot Act. He is also strongly in favor of a crackdown on illegal immigration, including harsh penalties for businesses who employ illegals. These views occasionally put him in conflict with the Libertarian Party. Justin Raimondo of Antiwar.com has called Boortz a "statist, not a libertarian" and a "liberventionist" and has urged the Libertarian Party to "Boot Boortz".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/justin/jspecial112603.html|first=Justin|last=Raimondo|publisher=Antiwar.com|title=Boot Boortz!|date=2003-11-26|accessdate=2006-08-16[/tpl]
Prior to the 2006 midterm elections, Boortz opined that perhaps it would be a good thing to have the Republicans lose power in Congress, forcing them to wake up and stop taking their base for granted. Boortz told one disgruntled caller:
 I am happy about it defeat. It's the only way to get these Republicans to wake themselves up and say, 'You have abandoned what you were put in office for.'[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110900064.html|first=Matthew|last=Bigg|publisher=Reuters|title=Talk radio hosts lick election wounds|date=2006-11-09|accessdate=2006-11-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] 
Boortz creates controversy among conservatives for his support of abortion rights (on which Boortz does not allow calls), for his refusal to condemn homosexuality or gay marriage,[tpl]cite web|title=That Bush .. He's Really In Touch, Isn't He?|last=Boortz|first=Neal|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200606/06052006.html|publisher=Cox Radio|date=2006-06-05|accessdate=2007-10-06[/tpl] and for his negative comments regarding Baptists and the biblical story of creation. Although he calls himself a Christian, he keeps his religious views private. He has also causes a stir among some Southerners, by coining the term "Flaggots" during his frequent jabs at them and at Confederate issues (such as governmental support of the Confederate flag).[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgiaheritagecouncil.org/site2/commentary/scroggins-ACLU-boortz-cobb.phtml|title=Strange bedfellows:the ACLU, Neal Boortz & Cobb County police|accessdate=2007-10-07|last=Scroggins|first=Steve|publisher=GeorgiaHeritageCouncil.org[/tpl]

==The Neal Boortz Show==

The Neal Boortz Show was a nationally syndicated talk show, which ended in January 2013. It aired live from 8:30am to noon, weekdays. Boortz routinely criticized politicians, Muslim extremism,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=35182|last=Boortz|first=Neal|title=Democrats abandon America|publisher=World Net Daily|work=|date=2003-10-21|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl] the homeless, public schools (which he called 'government schools'), liberals, opponents of the Iraq war, teachers, smokers, the obese, Chevrolet Camaro drivers, cats, and welfare recipients. On air, Boortz referred to himself as an "equal opportunity offender".
Boortz marketed his talk radio show as "insensitivity training", creating controversy which increased ratings. His stated "beliefs" included a claim that ADD and ADHD are "medical frauds" and a scam that teachers, parents, and drug companies use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200305/05292003.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|title=For Those Of You Who Are Drugging Your Kids|publisher=Cox Radio|work=Nealz Nuze|date=2003-05-29|accessdate=2006-12-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200307/07182003.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|title=Ask Your Doctor About Stratteras|publisher=Cox Radio|work=Nealz Nuze|date=2003-07-18|accessdate=2006-12-15[/tpl] His attempts at controversy included referring to homeless people on air as "urban outdoorsmen".[tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/more/commencement.html|last=Boortz|first=Neal|title=The Neal Boortz Commencement Speech|publisher=Cox Radio|work=More Boortz|accessdate=2006-12-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061111011842/http://boortz.com/more/commencement.html |archivedate=2006-11-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200310/10062003.html|title=California Hasn't Been Punished Enough|publisher=Cox Radio|work=Nealz Nuze|last=Boortz|first=Neal|date=2003-10-06|accessdate=2006-12-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://boortz.com/more/boortztionary.html|title=Boortztionary: A Glossary of Terms Neal Uses|publisher=Cox Radio|last=Boortz|first=Neal|work=More Boortz|accessdate=2006-12-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061206112945/http://boortz.com/more/boortztionary.html |archivedate=2006-12-06[/tpl] and to public education as "tax payer funded child abuse".
