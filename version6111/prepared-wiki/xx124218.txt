Including K-9 and Sarah Jane, some characters from the past or current run of Doctor Who have appeared in The Sarah Jane Adventures.
Numerous others have been referenced in dialogue. Several former companions of the Doctor are referenced in the story Death of the Doctor, and the episode also includes brief on-screen flashbacks showing the Third, Fourth and Tenth Doctors. Companion Harry Sullivan is referenced separately in dialogue on several occasions and a photograph of the character is visible in one episode. In an issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Sophie Aldred was read an email from Russell T. Davies, in which he declared his plans to bring Ace into a story had the show continued.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/sfx-forum/showthread.php?p=935083 |title=If Ace had been in The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures |publisher=SFX |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl] The episode Sky was originally to have featured the Eleventh Doctor, but Matt Smith was not available.Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition: The Sarah Jane Companion Vol. 3, August 2012.

==Episodes==

The Sarah Jane Adventures was first seen by its original British audience in the form of a 60-minute New Year's Day special in 2007, titled "Invasion of the Bane", which was co-written by Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts. "Bane" was not a pilot, as may have been suspected by the atypical broadcast order — holiday specials in Britain typically air after the regular run of the series to which they're attached. The story also contains many conventional introductory elements common to pilots. Creator Russell T Davies has commented upon the exceptional broadcast situation, saying "Sarah Jane Adventures is slightly unusual in that it was commissioned before we'd written the script. If we'd written a load of rubbish, they'd still have had to make it." He refers to "Invasion of the Bane" simply as the "first episode".[ref]
</ref> The story focused on Sarah Jane's investigation of a popular and addictive soft drink called ''Bubble Shock!''.
Series one of the show aired in September of that year, consisting of five two-part half-hour stories. Individual half-hour episodes aired once a week on BBC One, with episodes airing a week ahead on children's digital channel CBBC. The final part aired in November 2007. The second season started in September 2008 using the same format, with six stories instead of five, ending the season in December. The third season started 15 October 2009, twice weekly (Thursdays and Fridays) on BBC One from 15 October to 20 November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s47/sarah-jane-adventures/interviews/a176657/elisabeth-sladen-sarah-jane-adventures.html |title=Elisabeth Sladen ('Sarah Jane Adventures') – Sarah Jane Adventures Interview – British TV |work=Digital Spy |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2013[/tpl] The fourth series aired from 11 October 2010.

It accompanied series 4 of the programme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdgwb|title=Sarah Jane's Alien Files BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/30/sja.shtml|title=The Sarah Jane Adventures: introduction |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2010/09/sarah-janes-alien-files.html|title=Sarah Jane's Alien Files|publisher=doctorwhonews.net |accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl]

===Audio adventures===

Ten audiobooks have been released on CD, all but the last two read by the series lead, Elisabeth Sladen, who read them in the first person in character as Sarah Jane Smith. The final two books, released in November 2011 after Sladen's death, were read by Daniel Anthony and Anjili Mohindra, respectively, though not as their characters.
The first two were the first time that BBC Audiobooks had commissioned new content for exclusive release on audio.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/10/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307140354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/10/ |archivedate=7 March 2008 |title=The Sarah Jane Audios |accessdate =2 October 2007 |work=BBC Doctor Who website [/tpl]

===Novelisations===

The Sarah Jane Adventures merchandising revived the concept of the episode novelisation, which had been part of the Doctor Who franchise from the 1970s to the 1990s. The first season and most of the second were adapted in this way, but later seasons saw only a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.

===Magazines and Books===

Although there has never been a Sarah Jane Adventures magazine there have been three special editions of the Doctor Who Magazine, focussed on the Sarah Jane Adventures, as well as regular mentions in the standard editions of Doctor Who Magazine.[tpl]cite web|title=Doctor Who Magazine Special: Sarah Jane Companion 1|url=http://www.galaxy4.co.uk/product.thtml?id=2483&vts=ga4EAAI|publisher=galaxy4.co.uk|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Doctor Who Magazine Special: Sarah Jane Companion 2|url=http://www.galaxy4.co.uk/product.thtml?id=3073&vts=ga4EAAI|publisher=galaxy4.co.uk|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition|url=http://www.paninicomics.co.uk/web/guest/news?id=53915|publisher=paninicomics.co.uk|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Doctor Who Magazine Special: Sarah Jane Companion 3|url=http://www.galaxy4.co.uk/product.thtml?id=1840&vts=ga4EAAI|publisher=galaxy4.co.uk|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl]
