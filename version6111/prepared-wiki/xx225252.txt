Longridge Circuit was a motor racing circuit built in the former Tootle Heights quarry close to Longridge, Lancashire, England. This circuit may be unique in the world in being the only motor racing track situated in a quarry.Peter Swinger, “Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now" (Ian Allan Publishing, ISBN 0 7110 3104 5, 2008)
The roads used for the extremely short circuit were already in place when racing started in 1973, although sprint events were held prior to this. Racing continued until 1978 on this 0.43 miles long (0.69 km) circuit, which meant that starters was limited to a maximum of 10.
In 1978 the site was sold, which caused considerable ill-feeling amongst those who organised the sport for both two and four wheels for they were not informed of the impending sale, and consequent loss of the venue as plans for 1979 were being laid.Peter Swinger, “Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now" (Ian Allan Publishing, ISBN 0 7110 3104 5, 2008)
