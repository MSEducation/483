==Early acting and recording career==

Foster was approached by a friend who worked in a theatre in the West End of London during casting for the musical Oliver!. Foster replied, "I've got the kid." Jones was cast and appeared to great acclaim as the Artful Dodger.[tpl]cite news|author=8:25PM GMT 29 February 2012 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/9114540/Davy-Jones.html |title=Davy Jones |publisher=Telegraph |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012 |location=London[/tpl] He played the role in London and then on Broadway and was nominated for a Tony Award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://davyjones.net/djbio.html |title=Davy Jones Bio |publisher=davyjones.net[/tpl] On 9 February 1964, he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show with Georgia Brown who was playing Nancy in the Broadway production of Oliver!. This was the same episode of the show in which the Beatles made their first appearance. Jones said of that night, "I watched the Beatles from the side of the stage, I saw the girls going crazy, and I said to myself, this is it, I want a piece of that."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/arts/music/davy-jones-a-singer-in-the-monkees-dies-at-66.html?_r=1&hp|title=Davy Jones, Monkees Singer, Dies at 66|last=Fox |first= Margalit|date=29 February 2012|work=New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]
Following his Ed Sullivan appearance, Jones signed a contract with Ward Sylvester of Screen Gems (then the television division of Columbia Pictures). A pair of American television appearances followed, as Jones received screen time in episodes of Ben Casey and The Farmer's Daughter.[tpl]citation|title=Davy Jones|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427888/[/tpl]
Jones debuted on the Hot 100 in the week of 14 August 1965, with the single "What Are We Going To Do?" The 19-year-old singer was signed to Colpix Records, a label owned by Columbia."Davy Jones and the Monkees' Billboard Chart Legacy" by Fred Bronson, Los Angeles, at billboard.biz His debut album David Jones, on the same label, followed soon after (CP493)."David Jones – David Jones" (1965) at discogs.com In 1967 the album was issued in the UK, in mono only, on the Pye Records label (NPL 18178)."David Jones – David Jones" (1967) at discogs.com

==The Monkees==

From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".[tpl]Cite book |last=Lefcowitz |first=Eric | authorlink =  |title=Monkee Business: The Revolutionary Made-For-TV Band |publisher=Retrofuture Products, LLC |year=2011 | location = Port Washington, New York | id = |isbn = 0-943249-00-7[/tpl]
The NBC television series the Monkees was popular, and remained so in syndication. After the group disbanded in 1971, Jones reunited with Micky Dolenz as well as Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart in 1974 as a short-lived group called Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart.
A Monkees television show marathon ("Pleasant Valley Sunday") broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the group's heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and Peter Tork from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, "That Was Then, This Is Now" was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, Pool It!.
Monkees activity ceased until 1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and Michael Nesmith to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band. The group released a new album entitled Justus, the first album since 1967's Headquarters that featured the band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.
In February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. "There's even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour," he told Disney's Backstage Pass newsletter. "You're always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere."[tpl]cite web|url=http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/myVacation/newsletter/download?id=BackstagePassS1NFPage&module=S1NF201102Article&CMP=NLC-WDWFY11Q2Feb2011WDWDomEnews0030 |title=Disney's Backstage Pass Feb. 2001 |publisher=Disneyworld.disney.go.com |accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl] The tour (Jones's last) came to fruition entitled, An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour.[tpl]cite news |title=Monkees announce 10-date concert tour |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2011/02/21/Monkees-announce-10-date-concert-tour/UPI-30601298316685/ |agency=United Press International |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl]

==Post-Monkees career==

In 1967, Jones opened his first store, called Zilch, at 217 Thompson Street in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. The store sold "hip" clothing and accessories and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
After the Monkees officially disbanded in 1971, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called "The Street" which cost approximately $40,000. He also collaborated with musical director Doug Trevor on a one-hour ABC television special entitled Pop Goes Davy Jones, which featured new artists the Jackson Five and the Osmonds.
Bell Records, then having a string of hits with The Partridge Family, signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971. Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lackluster and aimless records. His second solo album, Davy Jones (1971) was notable for the song "Rainy Jane", which reached No.52 in the Billboard charts. To promote the album, Jones performed "Girl" on an episode of The Brady Bunch entitled "Getting Davy Jones". Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones's appearance on the show resulted in "Girl" becoming his best remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album. The final single, "I'll Believe In You"/"Road to Love," was poorly received.thumb|left|150px|Jones and Maureen McCormick in 1971 during The Brady Bunch episode in which he was a guest star Jones also continued acting after the Monkees, either as himself or another character. He appeared in an episode of Here Come the Brides,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] as well as two episodes each of Love, American Style and My Two Dads. Jones also appeared in animated form as himself in 1972 in an hour-long episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. Other television appearances include Sledge Hammer!, Boy Meets World, Hey Arnold!, The Single Guy (where he is mistaken for Dudley Moore) and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch in which he sang "Daydream Believer" to Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart). In 2009, Jones made a cameo appearance as himself in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" (his appearance was meant to be a pun on Davy Jones' Locker).
Jones also returned to theatre several times after the Monkees. He appeared in several productions of Oliver! as The Artful Dodger, and in 1989 toured the US portraying Fagin. Jones also co-starred with Micky Dolenz in Harry Nilsson's play The Point at the Mermaid Theatre, London in 1978.
Despite his initial high profile after the end of the Monkees, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo artist. Glenn A. Baker, author of Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees, commented in 1986 that "for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling. For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices."
The continued popularity of his 1971 Brady Bunch appearance led to his being cast as himself in The Brady Bunch Movie. Jones sang his signature solo hit "Girl", with a grunge band providing backing, this time with middle-aged women swooning over him. Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork also appeared alongside Jones as judges.
In 2001, Jones released Just Me, an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases.[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r582063|pure_url=yes[/tpl] In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during Epcot's Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would continue until his death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monkeesrule43.com/myexperiences_davy_epcot02.html |title=Davy Jones Solo – April 19, 2002 – EPCOT's Flower Power Festival |publisher=Monkeesrule43.com |date=19 April 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl]2009 Flower Power Concert Series
In April 2006, Jones recorded the single "Your Personal Penguin",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/songs/boynton/YourPersonalPenguin.mp3 |title=MP3 of the song Personal Penguin |accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl] written by children's author Sandra Boynton, as a companion piece to her new board book of the same title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |title=Workman Publishing author site for Sandra Boynton |publisher=Workman.com |accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl] On 1 November 2007, the Boynton book and CD titled Blue Moo was released and Jones is featured in both the book and CD, singing "Your Personal Penguin". In 2009, Jones released a collection of classics and standards from the 1940s through the 1970s entitled She.
In December 2008, Yahoo! Music named Jones the "Number 1 teen idol of all time". In 2009, Jones was rated second in a list of 10 best teen idols compiled by Fox News.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,474846,00.html |title=Then & Now: 10 Best Teen Idols of All Time |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2 March 2012 |date=30 November 2011[/tpl]

==Personal life==

===Family life===

Jones was married three times. In December 1968 he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living. Their relationship had been kept out of the public eye until after the birth of their first child in October 1968; when it was finally made public, it caused a considerable backlash for Jones from his fans. Jones later stated, in Tiger Beat magazine, "I kept my marriage a secret because I believe stars should be allowed a private life."[tpl]Cite book |last=Baker |first=Glenn A.| authorlink = Glenn A.

The marriage ended in 1975.Davy Jones biography – spouse information 
Jones married his second wife, Anita Pollinger, on 24 January 1981, and also had two daughters with her: Jessica Lillian (born 4 September 1981) and Annabel Charlotte (born 26 June 1988). They divorced in 1996, during the Monkees' 30th Anniversary reunion tour. Jones married for a third time, on 30 August 2009, to Jessica Pacheco, 32 years his junior.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] This was Pacheco's third marriage as well.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] On 28 July 2011, Pacheco filed to divorce Jones in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but dropped the suit in October.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] They were still married when he died in February 2012. Pacheco was omitted from Jones's will, which he made before their marriage. His oldest daughter, Talia, whom he named his executor, was granted by the court the unusual request that her father's will be sealed, on the basis that “planning documents and financial affairs as public opinion could have a material effect on his copyrights, royalties and ongoing goodwill.”Monkey Business Surrounding Davy Jones Estate, Forbes. 8/20/2012

===Horse racing===

In addition to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said "I made one huge mistake. When the Monkees finished in 1969–70, I should have got away from Hollywood and got back into the racing game. Instead I waited another 10 years. Everyone makes mistakes in life and for me that was the biggest." He held an amateur rider's licence and rode in his first race at Newbury in Berkshire, England for trainer Toby Balding.
On 1 February 1996, he won his first race, on Digpast, in the one-mile Ontario Amateur Riders Handicap at Lingfield in Surrey.[tpl]cite news|last=Milham|first=Simon|title=How a racing-mad Monkee is repaying a debt of gratitude to a retired Newmarket trainer|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2102648/The-Monkees-frontman-Davy-Jones-repaying-Newmarket-trainer-setting-road-stardom.html|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=Dail Mail |date=17 February 2012|location=London[/tpl] Jones also had horse ownership interests in both the U.S. and the U.K., and served as a commercial spokesman for Colonial Downs racetrack in Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hbpa.org/NewsDisplay.asp?section=2&type=l&Affid=30 |title=Welcome to the National HBPA |publisher=Hbpa.org |accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl] In tribute to Jones, Lingfield Park announced that the first two races on the card for 3 March 2012 would be renamed the "Hey Hey We're The Monkees Handicap" and the "In Memory of Davy Jones Selling Stakes" with successful horses in those races accompanied into the Winners' Enclosure by some of the Monkees' biggest hits.

==Death==

On the morning of 29 February 2012, Jones went to tend his 14 horses at a farm in Indiantown, Florida. After riding one of his favorite horses around the track, he complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing and was rushed to Martin Memorial South Hospital in Stuart, Florida, where he was pronounced dead of a severe heart attack due to atherosclerosis.[tpl]cite news|title=Davy Jones' Death Caused By Severe Heart Attack|url=http://idolator.com/6205531/davy-jones-death-severe-heart-attack|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=idolator.com|date=2 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Davy Jones, lead singer of the Monkees, dies in Indiantown, according to medical examiner's office|url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/region_martin_county/davy-jones-lead-singer-of-the-monkees-dies-from-heart-attack-this-morning-according-to-tmz-report|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=WPTV|date=29 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17214430 |title=Davy Jones of The Monkees dies aged 66|date=1 March 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]
