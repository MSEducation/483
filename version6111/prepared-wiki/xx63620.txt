[[S1C reactor]]

CATEGORIES: United States naval reactors

The S1C reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships.  The S1C designation stands for:
This nuclear reactor was built in Windsor, Connecticut as a prototype for the experimental USS Tullibee (SSN-597) submarine, though that boat was in fact powered by a S2C reactor. The propulsion plant was unusual in that the steam turbines powered an electric motor, rather than a set of reduction gears.  The USS Tullibee was an early advanced-design, fast-attack submarine constructed by Electric Boat and commissioned in 1960. 
Throughout the Cold War, the S1C Prototype nuclear submarine propulsion plant at the Windsor Site (41°52'45.08" N  72°43'02.55" W) supported the submarines and surface ships of the Navy’s nuclear fleet by testing new equipment and training Naval propulsion plant operators. S1C was the prototype for the USS Tullibee. The S1C Prototype was operated at the Windsor Site from 1959 until 1993. During that time, over 14,000 Naval operators were trained there, including Admiral Kirkland H. Donald early in his career. 
Full cleanup of the S1C site was recently declared to be complete by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection in 2006.DOE Reactor Site Returns To Green Field Conditions - First Unrestricted Release Of A Nuclear Power Site Remediation of the site was undertaken by Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), based out of Schenectady, New York. KAPL had taken over operation of the S1C site in the 1960s after expiration of the Navy's original contract with C-E.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The reactor was situated on land and known as the S1C Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU). Except for its size and electric drive, the system layout was very similar to the S5W reactor used in most nuclear-powered submarines at the time.
