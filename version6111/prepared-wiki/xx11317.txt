On November 1, 2012, Crow released an original song she called Woman in the White House that was made available for a free download. As the title suggests, the country-flavored tune defends the idea of a woman president, and received mixed reviews from critics that ranged from "sort of patronizing and gender essentialist" to "good-natured and well-intentioned". The song, praised for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, became subject to comment for country singer Brad Paisley who characterized the song as being "all in good fun".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sherylcrownews.com/ |title=Sherylove - Est. 1996 |publisher=Sherylcrownews.com |accessdate=February 11, 2013[/tpl] The song was later released for digital download on iTunes and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the American Red Cross to aid in the recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.theboot.com/2012/11/06/sheryl-crow-woman-in-the-white-house-video/ |title=Sheryl Crow, 'Woman in the White House' Lyric Video |publisher=The Boot |date=November 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2013[/tpl]

In 2011, Crow separated from her label, Interscope Records.

==Personal life==

Crow has had a number of high-profile romantic relationships. She dated actor Owen Wilson; the song "Safe and Sound" on the album C'mon C'mon was dedicated to him and (according to the album's liner notes) was an account of their relationship. Crow began dating cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2003. The couple announced their engagement in September 2005 but separated in February 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1156475,00.html | title=Lance Armstrong and Sheryl Crow Split |publisher=People Magazine |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=August 24, 2012[/tpl]

In August 2008 Crow (in partnership with Western Glove Works) launched a jeans brand, Bootheel Trading Company. Her reported explanation was that "Denim has become so high-priced as of late, my friends back home don't want to spend $250 for a pair of jeans. I want them to be able to walk into a medium-priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks."[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-14/news-interviews/27915275_1_sheryl-crow-designer-label-jeans |title=Sheryl Crow launches designer label - The Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl]  The jeans are styled like the California hippie-style faded bootcut jeans that Crow prefers wearing.[tpl]cite web|author=Andy Knight |url=http://denimology.com/2008/08/bootheel_trading_co_by_sheryl_crow |title=Bootheel Trading Co By Sheryl Crow |publisher=Denimology |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl] Crow said that she owns dozens of pairs of jeans and "does almost everything in jeans except sleep".

Crow has practiced Transcendental Meditation for many years. On 4 April 2009 she took part in a benefit concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York organized by the David Lynch Foundation, supporting the Foundation’s goal of teaching one million at-risk students to meditate. She and Ben Harper performed George Harrison’s song “My Sweet Lord”. Other performers at the concert included Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Mike Love, Moby, Eddie Vedder and Donovan. Crow said: "This event is one of the most important events to happen at this moment in history. ... Peace is something deeper than that, it is tapping into something that exists in all of us and makes us unique, and that helps us to be pure.".[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://dlf.tv/2009/sheryl-crow/ |title=Sheryl Crow Interview from Change Begins Within | David Lynch Foundation Television |publisher=Dlf.tv |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/featured-past-events.html |title=Featured Past Events |publisher=David Lynch Foundation |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/arts/music/06mcca.html?_r=0|title=Just Say ‘Om’: The Fab Two Give a Little Help to a Cause|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl]
