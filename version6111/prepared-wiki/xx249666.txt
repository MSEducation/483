Abdul Halim ([tpl]lang-ar|عبد الحليم[/tpl]) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Halim. The name means "servant of the all-clement", Al-Halīm being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.[tpl]cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst & Company| location=London| year=1999[/tpl] [tpl]cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S.

The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part can be transliterated Halim, Haleem or Haliem, and the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
