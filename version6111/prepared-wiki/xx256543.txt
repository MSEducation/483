==Background==

Speaking to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis - Assistant Editor of Blues & Soul - in December 2010 Wretch stated: "'Traktor' is actually about a dad talking to his child. Like on the intro the dad is saying 'Hey, go get a job' and basically telling his son to get outta the house. Then the chorus is actually the son explaining what's going on in his life. Like he's quit school; he hasn't got a job yet; his  girl's upset 'cause she's pregnant and - though his daughter's on the way - he keeps on clubbing and raving... But yet through it all he knows that he rides the beat like a TRACTOR - that he's a great RAPPER! You know, though everything is so wild in his life he literally does know that he has got a talent and he wants to stick with it... So yeah, it's basically all about having a gift and taking a risk with the music and BELIEVING in it. Which is pretty much how it is for ME!"
