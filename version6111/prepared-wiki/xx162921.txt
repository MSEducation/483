A Social Forum is an open meeting place for civil society organizations and individuals opposed to neoliberalism and the domination of the world by capital and imperialism.WSF Charter of Principles, Article 1 The first Social Forum was the World Social Forum (WSF) held in January 2001 in Porto Alegre. It was designed as a counter forum to the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Davos at the same time. While the WEF is a meeting of the political and economic elite of the world, the WSF gathers social forces and promotes democratization and social justice.
After the first WSF, the Social Forum idea was replicated across the world in various transnational, national, and local Social Forums. Most, though not all, Social Forums adhere to the WSF Charter of Principles drawn up by the International Council of the WSF. The diversity of actors participating in the Social Forums has become iconic for the diversity of the Global Justice Movement (or Anti-Globalization Movement).
