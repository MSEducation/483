[[Ore sorting]]

CATEGORIES: Mining

Ore sorting refers to the process of separating an ore into separate constituent parts. Today, ore sorters are widely used in industrial mineral mines, diamond mines and base and precious metal mines.
Ores are typically sorted to increase the efficiency of other refining processes, by reducing the amount of material to be processed while simultaneously increasing its purity.

==Modern technologies==

Modern, automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum, near infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet), that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors, to control the mechanical separation of ore into two or more categories.
