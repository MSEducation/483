[[Suzuki Palette]]

CATEGORIES: Suzuki vehicles, Kei cars

The Suzuki Palette is a kei car produced by Suzuki since January 2008. The Suzuki Palette has twin sliding rear doors, and competes directly with the Daihatsu Tanto. During 2009 the higher spec Suzuki Palette S models were replaced by the Suzuki Palette SW, whose revised frontal design is positioned to better compete with the Daihatsu Tanto Custom. Since the addition of the SW, the Suzuki Palette range has generally performed well in the sales charts. 
On December 1, 2009 the Nissan Roox was released, an OEM version of the Suzuki Palette that was first shown at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. The Nissan Roox Highway Star is a rebadged Suzuki Palette SW. On June 26, 2012 the Mazda Flair Wagon was released, another OEM version of the Palette.
The Palette was replaced in February 2013 by the Suzuki Spacia, with a corresponding new Mazda Flair Wagon launched simultaneously. The Nissan Roox was discontinued pending replacement by a new model designed with Mitsubishi Motors.
