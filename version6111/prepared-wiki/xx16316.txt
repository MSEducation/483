Michael Rubens Bloomberg (born February 14, 1942) is an American business magnate, politician and philanthropist. He served as the 108th Mayor of New York City, holding office for three consecutive terms beginning with his first election in 2001. With a net worth of $33 billion, he is the eleventh-richest person in the United States and the sixteenth-wealthiest in the world.
He is the founder and 88% owner of Bloomberg L.P., the global financial data and media company notable for its Bloomberg Terminal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.bloomberg.com/company.html |title=Bloomberg's website |publisher=About.bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/54/400list08_Michael-Bloomberg_C610.html |title= The 400 Richest Americans: #8 Michael Bloomberg |date= September 17, 2008 |accessdate= September 17, 2008 |work=Forbes[/tpl]

He defeated opponent Mark Green in a close election held just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Bloomberg won a second term in 2005 and left the Republican Party two years later. He campaigned to change the city's term limits law and was elected to his third term in 2009 as an independent candidate on the Republican ballot line.
He was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. presidential elections in 2008 and 2012,[tpl]Cite news |url= http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/bloomberg-leaving-republican-party |title= City Room: Bloomberg Leaving Republican Party |work= The New York Times | author = Chan, Sewell |date= June 19, 2007[/tpl] and for New York Governor in 2010.

In 1981, Salomon Brothers was boughtBloomberg, Michael (1997). Bloomberg by Bloomberg, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).Richard S.

==Elections==

===2001 election===

In 2001, the incumbent mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, was ineligible for re-election, as the city limited the mayoralty to two consecutive terms. Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, decided to run for mayor as a member of the Republican Party ticket.
Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former Congressman, to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green.
In the general election, Bloomberg received Giuliani's endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York City's campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html |title=Mike's Wrong, Campaign Fixes Make Sense |work= Daily News|location=New York|author= Russianoff, Gene |date=December 9, 2003 |archivedate=January 5, 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060105025803/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html[/tpl] One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering from the effects of the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.
In addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial Independence Party, in which "Social Therapy" leaders Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani exert strong influence. Some say that endorsement was important, as Bloomberg's votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New York's fusion rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, also had the ballot line of the Working Families Party. He also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line). Another factor was the vote in Staten Island, which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote there. Overall, Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent.
Bloomberg's election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws.
Despite the fact that 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.

===2005 election===

Bloomberg was re-elected mayor in November 2005 by a margin of 20 percent, the widest margin ever for a Republican mayor of New York.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/363961p-309955c.html |title= Bloomberg wins by a KO: Crushes Ferrer by nearly 20-point margin |work= Daily News|location=New York|date= November 9, 2005 |accessdate= November 12, 2008 |archivedate= November 26, 2005 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20051126142753/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/363961p-309955c.html[/tpl]
Bloomberg spent over $1 million on his campaign by late October 2005 and was projected to exceed the record of $74 million he spent on the previous election. In late 2004 or early 2005, Bloomberg gave the Independence Party of New York $250,000 to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for his re-election campaign.[tpl]Cite news | author = Haberman, Maggie; Saltonstall, David| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/268291p-229740c.html |title= Mayor Hires Indys To Hunt volunteers |work=Daily News|location=New York|date= January 5, 2005 |archivedate = January 5, 2005 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050105171254/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/268291p-229740c.html | accessdate = July 12, 2011[/tpl]

Wade.
In addition to receiving Republican support, Bloomberg obtained the endorsements of several prominent Democrats: former Democratic Mayor Ed Koch; former Democratic governor Hugh Carey; former Democratic City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, and his son, Councilman Peter Vallone, Jr.; former Democratic Congressman Floyd Flake (who had previously endorsed Bloomberg in 2001), and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/353944p-301791c.html |title= Mike Soaks Up 2 Big Nods: Vallones Cross Party Line for Mayor |work= Daily News|location=New York|date= October 9, 2005 |accessdate= November 12, 2008 |archivedate= January 4, 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060104155720/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/353944p-301791c.html[/tpl]

===2009 election===

On October 2, 2008, Bloomberg announced that he would seek to extend the city's term limits law and run for a third mayoral term in 2009, arguing that a leader of his field is needed during the Wall Street financial crisis. "Handling this financial crisis while strengthening essential services ... is a challenge I want to take on," Bloomberg said at a news conference. "So should the City Council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another term."[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0228265920081002 |title= NYC's Bloomberg Says To Seek Third Term as Mayor |date= October 2, 2008 | author = Honan, Edith |publisher= Reuters[/tpl] On October 23, 2008, the City Council voted 29–22 in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive four-year terms, thus allowing Bloomberg to run for office again.[tpl]cite news|url= http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/bloomberg.third.term.2.847239.html |title= [tpl]-'[/tpl]Aye' And Mighty: Bloomberg's Wish Is Granted |publisher= WCBS-TV |date= October 23, 2008,[/tpl] After two days of public hearings, Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/bloomberg-hears-opponents-of-term-limits-bill |title= City Room: After an Earful, Mayor Signs Term Limits Bill |work= The New York Times |authorlink=Sewell Chan|last=Chan|first=Sewell|last2=Chen|first2=David W.|date= November 3, 2008[/tpl]

 Well, no, no, I mean he's making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about. 

==Mayoralty==

Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2002. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled to gain high approval levels from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.
Bloomberg's re-election means the Republicans have won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg's decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party's losing the mayor's seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joins Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city. (John Lindsay was also elected mayor of New York twice while a registered Republican; however, Lindsay did not receive the Republican Party nomination during his 1969 campaign for re-election but ran successfully on the Liberal ticket and joined the Democratic Party during his second term.)
Bloomberg has said that he wants public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second."The Mayor's Legacy", Gotham Gazette, September 2006. Some[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] have alleged that he made certain decisions regarding the closure of seventeen day-care centers across the city for political reasons.[tpl]cite web |last= Billy |first= Rev |url= http://www.revbilly.com/chatter/blog/2009/11/where-the-city-begins |title= Where The City Begins | Reverend Billy & The Church of Life After Shopping |publisher= Revbilly.com |date= March 11, 2009 |accessdate= October 26, 2010[/tpl] According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002 through 2009 rose nationally by 11 points. However, on May 10, 2010, The New York Times reported: According to the test NAEP, New York City eighth graders have shown no significant improvement math or reading since they began taking it in 2003, mirroring the largely flat performance of American eighth graders as a whole during that period. In the city, the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lower-income students. 
Some[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] have seen this approach to the New York education system as largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers. Under the reformed approach, a school must do better than the previous year to receive funding. Because of this requirement, many successful schools were closed for being "unsuccessful" because of their inability to raise test scores, even though they were the top performing schools, while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly.[tpl]cite book |last= Ravich |first= Diane |title= The Death and Life of The Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education |publisher= Basic Books |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-465-01491-0[/tpl]
Bloomberg has chosen to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a "bullpen" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.Nagourney, Adam (December 25, 2001). "Bloomberg Vows to Work at Center of Things". The New York Times.
In efforts to create "cutbacks" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a remuneration of $1 annually for his services.Biographiq (March 2008). Michael Bloomberg – Billionaire Mayor, Biographiq. ISBN 1599860651, 978-1599860657 He maintains a public listing in the New York City phone directory,Mike McIntire "Who Has Bloomberg's Number? Anybody With a Phone Book", "The New York Times", July 13, 2005 and during his term as mayor, he lived not in Gracie Mansion – the official mayoral residence – but instead at his own home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, at 17 East 79th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues. He owns additional homes in London; Bermuda; and Vail, Colorado.Chris Smith, "The Mayor and His Money", "NY Mag", September 26, 2005
Bloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the New York City Subway on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at City Hall. An August 2007 story in The New York Times asserted that he was often seen chauffeured by two New York Police Department-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.Michael M. Grynbaum "Mayor Takes the Subway — by Way of S.U.V.", "The New York Times", August 1, 2007 He also supported the construction of the 7 Subway Extension and the Second Avenue Subway; on December 20, 2013, Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new 34th Street station to celebrate a part of his legacy as mayor.[tpl]cite news|title=Three cheers for the No. 7 extension| url=http://nypost.com/2013/12/20/mayor-mikes-hudson-yards-feat/|date=December 20, 2013 | work=New York Post[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-sneak-ride-7-line-extension-article-1.1554643 |title=Mayor Bloomberg gets ride on No. 7 subway line extension he championed |publisher=NY Daily News |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |location=New York[/tpl]

==Political stands==

Some of the policies Bloomberg advocates parallel those of either the Democratic or the Republican party platform. He is socially liberal or progressive, supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, some gun control measures, and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, for example. On economics, foreign, and domestic issues, Bloomberg tends to be conservative. He opposed a timeline for withdrawal from the Iraq War, and criticized those who favored one. Economically, he supports government involvement in issues such as public welfare, while being strongly in favor of free trade, pro-business, and describing himself as a fiscal conservative because he balanced the city's budget.Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks at 2007 Conservative Party Conference". The New York Times. July 2, 2007. Environmentally, he believes that man-made climate change is real. Bloomberg has been cited for not allowing many emergency officials who responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks to attend the tenth anniversary observation of that day.[tpl]cite web|author=By Jeff Stein, CNN |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-16/us/new.york.911.memorial_1_john-feal-responders-ground-zero |title=First responders decry exclusion from 9/11 ceremony |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] He also is at odds with many around the United States for not inviting any clergy to the ceremony marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.[tpl]cite web|title=Bloomberg: No Clergy, No FDNY|url=http://www.patheos.com/community/theanchoress/2011/08/25/bloomberg-no-clergy-no-|first=Elizabeth|last=Scalia|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2013|publisher=Patheos[/tpl]

Bloomberg supports abortion rights, stating: "Reproductive choice is a fundamental human right and we can never take it for granted. On this issue, you're either with us or against us."

Bloomberg supports the strict drug laws of New York City. He has stated that he smoked marijuana in the past, and was quoted in a 2001 interview as saying "You bet I did. I enjoyed it." This led to a reported $500,000 advertising campaign by NORML, featuring his image and the quote. Bloomberg stated in a 2002 interview that he regrets the remark and does not believe that marijuana should be decriminalized.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D6113DF933A25757C0A9649C8B63 |title= Bloomberg Says He Regrets Marijuana Remarks |work= The New York Times |author = Steinhauer, Jennifer  |date= April 10, 2002 |accessdate= January 11, 2008[/tpl]

As mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying: "Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear. We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Crime.htm |title= Mike Bloomberg on Crime |accessdate= August 2, 2007 |work=On The Issues[/tpl] He opposes the death penalty, saying he would "rather lock somebody up and throw away the key and put them in hard labor."

However, recent studies have shown that New York City high school graduates are not prepared to meet the challenges of college. Many take remedial courses for no credit in their first year.  These criticisms have put a dent in the Mayor's reputation on education. He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cell-phone ban in schools.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Education.htm |title= Mike Bloomberg on Education |accessdate= August 2, 2007 |work=On The Issues[/tpl]

===Economic issues===

Bloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the city's $6 billion deficit into a $3 billion surplus; however, conservative PAC Club for Growth has criticized him because he increased property taxes and spending while doing so.

Bloomberg has expressed a distaste of taxes, stating, "Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody's got to pay for them, so they're a necessary evil."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/authors/michael-bloomberg-quotes.htm |title= Michael Bloomberg Quotes |accessdate= August 2, 2007 |publisher= woopidoo.com[/tpl] As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007 he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear.

Bloomberg is in favor of providing tax breaks to big corporations for the good of the whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks.

Bloomberg has had a less cordial relationship with unions as mayor.

Bloomberg is a staunch advocate of free trade and is strongly opposed to protectionism, stating, "The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country...." He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries: "The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us.

===Preservation and development issues===

Bloomberg is a proponent of large-scale development. He has repeatedly come down in favor of projects such as the Atlantic Yards mega-development, the Hudson Yards redevelopment, and the Harlem rezoning proposal.Williams, Timothy (April 2, 2008). "Harlem Councilwoman Opposes Rezoning Plan". The New York Times. On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well.

"Bloomberg Insists He Will Not Be Running". The New York Times. many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.Roberts, Sam (December 31, 2007). "Bloomberg Moves Closer to Running for President". The New York Times.Broder, David S. (December 30, 2007).  "Bipartisan Group Eyes Independent Bid". The Washington Post. Other purported signs that he planned to run included:
In summer 2006, he met with Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, to talk about the logistics of a possible run.Heilemann, John. "His American Dream". New York.

CNN. Retrieved January 10, 2008. On January 16, 2008, it was reported that Bloomberg's business interests were placed in "a sort of blind trust" because of his possible run for the presidency. His interests were put under the management of Quadrangle Group, co-founded by reported Bloomberg friend Steven Rattner, though Bloomberg would "continue to have control of and access to certain investment decisions".Sorkin, Andrew Ross (January 16, 2008).

On January 18, 2008, the Associated Press reported that Bloomberg had a meeting in Austin, Texas, with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for Ross Perot's third party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign by him, stating "I'm not a candidate – it couldn't be clearer. Which of the words do you not understand?" On February 28, 2008, Bloomberg stated "I am not – and will not be – a candidate for president." He added that he is "hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.
At the same time that the presidential run was being considered, there was also some speculation that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, The Politico's Ben Smith asked the question of whether a vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0607/Mike_for_Veep.html |title= Mike for Veep? |work= Politico |author= Smith, Ben |date= June 21, 2007[/tpl] Many believed that Bloomberg would in fact be legally permitted to self-finance a campaign as the vice-presidential candidate.
Adding more fuel to the speculation that Bloomberg might consider a VP slot were a series of meetings he had in mid-August 2007 with former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn and later with Barack Obama on November 30, 2007. A May 17, 2008, breakfast meeting with John McCain led to speculation that Bloomberg might be on McCain's short list of possible VP candidates.[tpl]cite web |url= http://nymag.com/news/politics/powergrid/47200 |title= The Catch |date= May 22, 2007 |author= Heilemann, John[/tpl]

===Rumored gubernatorial campaign===

On November 6, 2007, the New York Post detailed efforts by New York Republicans to recruit Bloomberg to oppose then-incumbent Governor Eliot Spitzer in the 2010 election.
