Michelle Young is an American musician. She has performed on a wide variety of recordings and is probably best known for her work with the progressive rock group Glass Hammer. Citing Kate Bush as an influence, Young was professionally trained in classical voice at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. She left her job as a legal secretary and receptionist in 1996 to pursue her professional career as a female vocalist in progressive rock. A review of her album and a biography was published in the Fall 1996 issue of Progression magazine.
In 2013, she collaborated with Glass Hammer once again, performing backing vocals for their album Ode to Echo.https://www.facebook.com/glasshammerband/posts/10152037856334591
