At the "Golden Circle" Stockholm is a two-volume album by the Ornette Coleman Trio, documenting concerts on the nights of December 3 and 4, 1965, in the Gyllene Cirkeln club in Stockholm. It marked the beginning of Coleman's contract with Blue Note.
The music has been described as "brilliant, optimistic closely unified thematic improvisations".[tpl]cite book | author=Litweiler, John | title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 | publisher=Da Capo | year=1984|isbn=0-306-80377-1[/tpl] "Snowflakes and Sunshine" marked the introduction of his unconventional violin and trumpet playing.
