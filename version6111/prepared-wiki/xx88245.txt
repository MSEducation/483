The cytochrome P450  superfamily of monooxygenases (officially abbreviated as CYP) is a large and diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. The substrates of CYP enzymes include metabolic intermediates such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as xenobiotic substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals.  CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bioactivation, accounting for about 75% of the total number of different metabolic reactions.
The most common reaction catalyzed by cytochromes P450 is a monooxygenase reaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into the aliphatic position of an organic substrate (RH) while the other oxygen atom is reduced to water:

RH + O2 + NADPH + H+ → ROH + H2O + NADP+

Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) belong to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme cofactor and, therefore, are hemoproteins. CYPs use a variety of small and large molecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions.They are in general the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized  as P450-containing systems. The term P450 is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with CO.
CYP enzymes have been identified in all domains of life - animals, plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea, and even in viruses.Lamb DC, Lei L, Warrilow AG, Lepesheva GI, Mullins JG, Waterman MR, Kelly SL (2009). "The first virally encoded cytochrome P450". Journal of Virology 83 (16): 8266-9. PMID 19515774 However, the enzymes have not been found in E. coli.[tpl]cite book | author = Roland Sigel; Sigel, Astrid; Sigel, Helmut | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Ubiquitous Roles of Cytochrome P450 Proteins: Metal Ions in Life Sciences | edition = | language = | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-470-01672-8 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Danielson PB | title = The cytochrome P450 superfamily: biochemistry, evolution and drug metabolism in humans | journal = Curr.

Most CYPs require a protein partner to deliver one or more electrons to reduce the iron (and eventually molecular oxygen). Based on the nature of the electron transfer proteins CYPs can be classified into several groups:[tpl]cite journal|last1=Hanukoglu|first1=Israel|title=Electron Transfer Proteins of Cytochrome P450 Systems|journal= Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology | volume=14|year=1996|pages=29–56|issn=15692558|doi=10.1016/S1569-2558(08)60339-2 | url=http://www.science.co.il/hi/pub/1996-P450-Review.php[/tpl]

==Nomenclature==

Genes encoding CYP enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, are designated with the abbreviation CYP, followed by a number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene. The convention is to italicise the name when referring to the gene. For example, CYP2E1 is the gene that encodes the enzyme CYP2E1 – one of the enzymes involved in paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism. The CYP nomenclature is the official naming convention, although occasionally (and incorrectly) CYP450 or CYP450 is used. However, some gene or enzyme names for CYPs may differ from this nomenclature, denoting the catalytic activity and the name of the compound used as substrate. Examples include CYP5A1, thromboxane A2 synthase, abbreviated to TBXAS1 (ThromBoXane A2 Synthase 1), and CYP51A1, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, sometimes unofficially abbreviated to LDM according to its substrate (Lanosterol) and activity (DeMethylation).
The current nomenclature guidelines suggest that members of new CYP families share >40% amino acid identity, while members of subfamilies must share >55% amino acid identity. There are nomenclature committees that assign and track both base gene names (Cytochrome P450 Homepage) and allele names (CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee).

==Mechanism==

The active site of cytochrome P450 contains a heme iron center. The iron is tethered to the P450 protein via a thiolate ligand derived from a cysteine residue. This cysteine and several flanking residues are highly conserved in known CYPs and have the formal PROSITE signature consensus pattern FW - SGNH - x - GD - {F} - RKHPT - {P} - C - LIVMFAP - GAD.PROSITE consensus pattern for P450 Because of the vast variety of reactions catalyzed by CYPs, the activities and properties of the many CYPs differ in many aspects. In general, the P450 catalytic cycle proceeds as follows:
[tpl]cite journal | author = Meunier B, de Visser SP, Shaik S | title = Mechanism of oxidation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome p450 enzymes | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 104 | issue = 9 | pages = 3947–80 |date=September 2004 | pmid = 15352783 | doi = 10.1021/cr020443g | url =  [/tpl][/ref] and sometimes changing the state of the heme iron from low-spin to high-spin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Poulos TL, Finzel BC, Howard AJ | title = High-resolution crystal structure of cytochrome P450cam | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 195 | issue = 3 | pages = 687–700 |date=June 1987 | pmid = 3656428 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(87)90190-2 | url =  [/tpl] This gives rise to a change in the spectral properties of the enzyme, with an increase in absorbance at 390 nm and a decrease at 420 nm. This can be measured by difference spectrometry and is referred to as the "type I" difference spectrum (see inset graph in figure).  Some substrates cause an opposite change in spectral properties, a "reverse type I" spectrum, by processes that are as yet unclear.  Inhibitors and certain substrates that bind directly to the heme iron give rise to the type II difference spectrum, with a maximum at 430 nm and a minimum at 390 nm (see inset graph in figure).  If no reducing equivalents are available, this complex may remain stable, allowing the degree of binding to be determined from absorbance measurements in vitro[tpl]cite book | author = Ortiz de Montellano, Paul R.; Paul R.

S: An alternative route for mono-oxygenation is via the "peroxide shunt": Interaction with single-oxygen donors such as peroxides and hypochlorites can lead directly to the formation of the iron-oxo intermediate, allowing the catalytic cycle to be completed without going through steps 2, 3, 4, and 5.  A hypothetical peroxide "XOOH" is shown in the diagram.
C: If carbon monoxide (CO) binds to reduced P450, the catalytic cycle is interrupted. This reaction yields the classic CO difference spectrum with a maximum at 450 nm.

==P450s in humans==

Human CYPs are primarily membrane-associated proteinsBerka K et al. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2011 [tpl]doi|10.1021/jp204488j[/tpl] located either in the inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. CYPs metabolize thousands of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. Some CYPs metabolize only one (or a very few) substrates, such as CYP19 (aromatase), while others may metabolize multiple substrates. Both of these characteristics account for their central importance in medicine. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are present in most tissues of the body, and play important roles in hormone synthesis and breakdown (including estrogen and testosterone synthesis and metabolism), cholesterol synthesis, and vitamin D metabolism. Cytochrome P450 enzymes also function to metabolize potentially toxic compounds, including drugs and products of endogenous metabolism such as bilirubin, principally in the liver.
The Human Genome Project has identified 57 human genes coding for the various cytochrome P450 enzymes.

===Drug metabolism===

CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism, accounting for about 75% of the total metabolism.[tpl]cite journal | author = Guengerich FP | title = Cytochrome p450 and chemical toxicology | journal = Chem. Res. Toxicol. | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–83 |date=January 2008 | pmid = 18052394 | doi = 10.1021/tx700079z | url =  [/tpl] (Metabolism in this context is the chemical modification or degradation of drugs.) Most drugs undergo deactivation by CYPs, either directly or by facilitated excretion from the body. Also, many substances are bioactivated by CYPs to form their active compounds.

====Drug interaction====

Many drugs may increase or decrease the activity of various CYP isozymes either by inducing the biosynthesis of an isozyme  (enzyme induction) or by directly inhibiting the activity of the CYP (enzyme inhibition). This is a major source of adverse drug interactions, since changes in CYP enzyme activity may affect the metabolism and clearance of various drugs. For example, if one drug inhibits the CYP-mediated metabolism of another drug, the second drug may accumulate within the body to toxic levels. Hence, these drug interactions may necessitate dosage adjustments or choosing drugs that do not interact with the CYP system. Such drug interactions are especially important to take into account when using drugs of vital importance to the patient, drugs with important side-effects and drugs with small therapeutic windows, but any drug may be subject to an altered plasma concentration due to altered drug metabolism.
A classical example includes anti-epileptic drugs. Phenytoin, for example, induces CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Substrates for the latter may be drugs with critical dosage, like amiodarone or carbamazepine, whose blood plasma concentration may either increase because of enzyme inhibition in the former, or decrease because of enzyme induction in the latter.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

====Interaction of other substances====

Naturally occurring compounds may also induce or inhibit CYP activity. For example, bioactive compounds found in grapefruit juice and some other fruit juices, including bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and paradicin-A, have been found to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of certain medications, leading to increased bioavailability and, thus, the strong possibility of overdosing.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bailey DG, Dresser GK | title = Interactions between grapefruit juice and cardiovascular drugs | journal = Am J Cardiovasc Drugs | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–97 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15449971 | doi = 10.2165/00129784-200404050-00002 | url =  [/tpl] Because of this risk, avoiding grapefruit juice and fresh grapefruits entirely while on drugs is usually advised.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN00413 | title = Grapefruit juice: Can it cause drug interactions?  | author = Zeratsky K | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-11-06 | format = | work = Ask a food & nutrition specialist | publisher = MayoClinic.com | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-02-09[/tpl]

A subset of cytochrome P450 enzymes play important roles in the synthesis of steroid hormones (steroidogenesis) by the adrenals, gonads, and peripheral tissue:

===CYP families in humans===

Humans have 57 genes and more than 59 pseudogenes divided among 18 families of cytochrome P450 genes and 43 subfamilies.Nelson D (2003). Cytochromes P450 in humans. Retrieved May 9, 2005. This is a summary of the genes and of the proteins they encode. See the homepage of the Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature Committee for detailed information.

==P450s in other species==

===Animals===

Many animals have as many or more CYP genes than humans do. For example, mice have genes for 101 CYPs, and sea urchins have even more (perhaps as many as 120 genes).[tpl]cite journal | author = Goldstone JV, Hamdoun A, Cole BJ, Howard-Ashby M, Nebert DW, Scally M, Dean M, Epel D, Hahn ME, Stegeman JJ | title = The chemical defensome: Environmental sensing and response genes in the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome | journal = Dev. Biol. | volume = 300 | issue = 1 | pages = 366–84 |date=December 2006 | pmid = 17097629 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.08.066 | url =  | pmc = 3166225 [/tpl]
Most CYP enzymes are presumed to have monooxygenase activity, as is the case for most mammalian CYPs that have been investigated (except for, e.g., CYP19 and CYP5). However, gene and genome sequencing is far outpacing biochemical characterization of enzymatic function, although many genes with close homology to CYPs with known function have been found.
The classes of CYPs most often investigated in non-human animals are those either involved in development (e.g., retinoic acid or hormone metabolism) or involved in the metabolism of toxic compounds (such as heterocyclic amines or polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Often there are differences in gene regulation or enzyme function of CYPs in related animals that explain observed differences in susceptibility to toxic compounds (ex. canines inability to metabolize xanthines such as caffeine). Some drugs undergo metabolism in both species via different enzymes, resulting in different metabolites, while other drugs are metabolized in one species but excreted unchanged in another species. For this reason, one species reaction to a substance is not a reliable indication of the substances effects in humans. 
CYPs have been extensively examined in mice, rats, dogs, and less so in zebrafish, in order to facilitate use of these model organisms in drug discovery and toxicology. Recently CYPs have also been discovered in avian species, in particular turkeys, that may turn out to be a great model for cancer research in humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rawal S, Kim JE, Coulombe, R Jr | title = Aflatoxin B1 in poultry: toxicology, metabolism and prevention | journal = Res. Vet. Sci. | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–31 |date=December 2010 | pmid = 20462619 | doi = 10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.04.011 [/tpl] CYP1A5 and CYP3A37 in turkeys were found to be very similar to the human CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 respectively, in terms of their kinetic properties as well as in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rawal S, Coulombe, RA Jr | title = Metabolism of aflatoxin B1 in turkey liver microsomes: the relative roles of cytochromes P450 1A5 and 3A37 | journal = Toxicol.

CYPs have also been heavily studied in insects, often to understand pesticide resistance.  For example, CYP6G1 is linked to insecticide resistance in DDT-resistant Drosophila melanogaster[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1002/ps.1567|author=McCart C, Ffrench-Constant RH|title=Dissecting the insecticide-resistance- associated cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1|journal=Pest Manag Sci|volume=64|issue=6|pages=639–45|date=June 2008 |pmid=18338338[/tpl] and CYP6Z1 in the mosquito malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is capable of directly metabolizing DDT.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0709249105|author=Chiu TL, Wen Z, Rupasinghe SG, Schuler MA|title=Comparative molecular modeling of Anopheles gambiae CYP6Z1, a mosquito P450 capable of metabolizing DDT|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=105|issue=26|pages=8855–60 |date=1 Jul 2008|pmc=2449330|pmid=18577597|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.8855C [/tpl]

===Microbial===

Microbial cytochromes P450 are often soluble enzymes and are involved in critical metabolic processes. Three examples that have contributed significantly to structural and mechanistic studies are listed here, but many different families exist.

===Fungi===

The commonly used azole class antifungal drugs work by inhibition of the fungal cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase. This interrupts the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane.  (This is useful only because humans' P450 have a different sensitivity; this is how this class of antifungals work.)[tpl]cite journal | author = Vanden Bossche H, Marichal P, Gorrens J, Coene MC | title = Biochemical basis for the activity and selectivity of oral antifungal drugs | journal = Br J Clin Pract Suppl | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 41–6 |date=September 1990 | pmid = 2091733 | doi = | url =  [/tpl]
Significant research is ongoing into fungal P450s, as a number of fungi are pathogenic to humans (such as Candida yeast and Aspergillus) and to plants.
Cunninghamella elegans is a candidate for use as a model for mammalian drug metabolism.

===Plants===

Plant cytochromes P450 are involved in a wide range of biosynthetic reactions, leading to various fatty acid conjugates, plant hormones, defensive compounds, or medically important drugs. Terpenoids, which represent the largest class of characterized natural plant compounds, are often substrates for plant CYPs.

==P450s in biotechnology==

The remarkable reactivity and substrate promiscuity of P450s have long attracted the attention of chemists.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chefson A, Auclair K | title = Progress towards the easier use of P450 enzymes | journal = Mol Biosyst. | volume = 10 | issue = 10| pages = 462–9 | year = 2006 | month =  | pmid = 17216026 | doi = 10.1039/b607001a| url =  [/tpl] Recent progress towards realizing the potential of using P450s towards difficult oxidations have included: (i) eliminating the need for natural co-factors by replacing them with inexpensive peroxide containing molecules,[tpl]cite journal | author = Chefson A, Zhao J, Auclair K | title = Replacement of natural cofactors by selected hydrogen peroxide donors or organic peroxides results in improved activity for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 6 | issue = 6| pages = 916–9 | year = 2006 | month = | pmid = 16671126 | doi = 10.1002/cbic.200600006| url =  [/tpl] (ii) exploring the compatibility of p450s with organic solvents,[tpl]cite journal | author = Chefson A, Auclair K. | title = CYP3A4 activity in the presence of organic cosolvents, ionic liquids, or water-immiscible organic solvents | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 10 | issue = 10| pages = 1189–97 | year = 2007 | month = | pmid = 17526062 | doi = 10.1002/cbic.200700128| url =  [/tpl] and (iii) the use of small, non-chiral auxiliaries to predictably direct P450 oxidation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

==InterPro subfamilies==

InterPro subfamilies:
Clozapine, imipramine, paracetamol, phenacetin Heterocyclic aryl amines
Inducible and CYP1A2 5-10% deficient
oxidize uroporphyrinogen to uroporphyrin (CYP1A2) in heme metabolism, but they may have additional undiscovered endogenous substrates. 
are inducible by some polycyclic hydrocarbons, some of which are found in cigarette smoke and charred food. 
These enzymes are of interest, because in assays, they can activate compounds to carcinogens. 
High levels of CYP1A2 have been linked to an increased risk of colon cancer. Since the 1A2 enzyme can be induced by cigarette smoking, this links smoking with colon cancer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
