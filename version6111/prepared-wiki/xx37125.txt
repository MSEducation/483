CATEGORIES: Pejorative terms for people, Sex- or gender-related stereotypes

Trophy wife is an informal, derogatory term for a wife, usually young and attractive, who is regarded as a status symbol for the husband, who is often older and wealthy. The term trophy husband is the male equivalent.
Referring to a spouse as a trophy wife usually reflects negatively on the character or personality of the husband, and has a connotation of narcissism and desire to impress others, and that the husband would not be able to attract the sexual interest of the attractive woman but for his wealth or position.  It can also be used to imply that the trophy wife in question has little personal merit besides her physical attractiveness, and is sometimes synonymous with the term "gold digger."

==History==

The term's etymological origins are disputed. One claim is that trophy wife originally appeared in a 1950 issue of The Economist newspaper,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] referring to the historical practice of warriors capturing the most beautiful women during battle to bring home as wives.Linker, Harry. "Buying into the Hype: Trophy Antiques and Collectibles". 7 May 2010.. William Safire claimed that the term trophy wife was coined by Julie Connelly, a senior editor of Fortune magazine, in a cover story in the issue of August 28, 1989[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E6DA1031F932A35756C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=ON LANGUAGE; Trophy Wife|first=William|last=Safire|date=1 May 1994|work=The New York Times[/tpl] and immediately entered common usage.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Many sources claim the term was coined earlier (for example, the Online Etymology Dictionary cites 1984[tpl]OEtymD|trophy[/tpl]) but easy online access to William Safire's article about the term has led many (such as Oxford English Dictionary) to believe that August 28, 1989 was its first use.Oxford English Dictionary Addition Series 1997 However, the idiom is found in passing in a quote in a 1965 publication, apparently referring to the wife of Bernie Madoff. 
Considering the possible recent origins of the term it must be noted that the term in Latin, Tropaeum uxor, appears in many scripts of both Greek and Roman origin dating as far back as the first half of the first century, as far back as 50 AD.[tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl]  There is the example found in the Naturalis Historia (by Gaius Plinius Secundus); though the meaning was probably not close to today's meaning and referred to "trophy women" as part of the tribute to Roman conquerors by defeated opponents. http://books.google.com/books?id=9YsbAQAAMAAJ&q=%22trophy+wife%22
