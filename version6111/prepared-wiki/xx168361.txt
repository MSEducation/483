Dilettante only published three titles, but "their impact was considerable." Dilettanteâ€™s first book, The End Is Near! Visions of Apocalypse, Millennium and Utopia, won the Benjamin Franklin Award for Best First Book. Their subsequent titles included: Extreme Canvas: Hand-Painted Movie Posters from Ghana. By Ernie Wolfe, III and Starstruck: Photographs from a Fan by Gary Lee Boas, selected by Artforum Magazine as "Best of 2000".[tpl]Verify source|date=June 2008[/tpl]
