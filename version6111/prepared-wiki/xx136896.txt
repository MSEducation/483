==Series==

Four Master Series series of albums were released: from 1987–1990, 1996–1998, 1998–1999, and from 2003 onwards.
The covers of each series are visually unified:
The 1996 series represented various bands in eclectic genres (such as New Wave) with relatively small followings, and the 1998 series included hard rock/progressive rock musicians and bands. These series are branded with the international title Master Series. The French title Master série is used to brand the more traditional line with a strong focus on European pop singers, which are frequently issued in multiple volumes. Each subsequent series also reissued some albums from the previous series.
