==History==

===Early years===

Roanoke College was founded in 1842 as a boys' preparatory school by Lutheran pastors David F. Bittle and Christopher C. Baughmann.Guide to Historical Salem | Vol. 9 No. 1 Originally located in Augusta County near Staunton, the school was named Virginia Institute until chartered on January 30, 1845 as Virginia Collegiate Institute.http://www.historicmarkers.com/Virginia/Augusta_County_Virginia/Roanoke_College_I11A/ [tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] In 1847, the institute moved to Salem which was developing into a center of commerce and transportation in the region; the school moved all of its possessions in a single covered wagon.  The Virginia General Assembly granted a college charter on March 14, 1853 and approved the name Roanoke College, chosen in honor of the Roanoke Valley. Bittle then served as the college's first president.  
Roanoke was one of the few Southern colleges that remained open throughout the American Civil War.Guide to Historical Salem | Vol. 7 No. 2http://www.historicmarkers.com/Virginia/Salem_City_Virginia/Roanoke_College_BI11/ [tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] The student body was organized into a corps of cadets and fought with Confederate forces near Salem in December 1863."Dear Old Roanoke": a ... – Google Books The students were outmatched and quickly forced to surrender, but the Union commander allowed them to return to their studies in exchange for a promise to put down their arms. The college company was formally mustered into the Confederate Army, Virginia Reserves, on September 1, 1864, but the students did not see combat before the war ended. A monument honoring Salem's Confederate soldiers, dedicated in 1909 by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, is on the grounds of the former Roanoke County courthouse, which is now a college academic building.Salem Museum | Walking Tour

===International students===

Roanoke enrolled its first international students in the late 19th century; the first Mexican student in 1876 and the first Japanese student in 1888.http://www.roanoke.edu/portal/registrar/stuHndbk07-08.pdf [tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]"Dear Old Roanoke": a ... – Google Books The first Korean to graduate from an American college or university, Surh Beung Kiu, graduated in 1898."Dear Old Roanoke": a ... – Google Books

===Coeducation===

Roanoke became coeducational in 1930 when women were admitted to counter a decline in male enrollment caused by the Great Depression.  A small number of women were previously offered limited admission as non-degree seeking students – most from Elizabeth College, a sister Lutheran women's college destroyed by fire in 1921; the students finished the 1921–22 academic year at Roanoke.A Guide to Historical Salem | Vol. 4 No. 3 The first women's residence hall, Smith Hall, opened in 1941.  Roanoke's student body is now more than fifty percent female.
Roanoke adopted the alumnae of Marion College, a sister Lutheran women's college in Marion, Virginia, when it closed in 1967.  Marion Hall, a large residence hall constructed in 1968, honors the college and its alumnae.

===National championships===

Roanoke athletic teams have won two national championships: the 1972 NCAA Division II men's basketball championship and the 1978 Division II men's lacrosse championship.  Roanoke's third national championship occurred in 2001 when student Casey Smith won an individual championship in the Division III women's 10,000m track and field event.  In 2009, student Robin Yerkes secured Roanoke's fourth national championship when she won an individual championship in the Division III women's 400m track and field event.Roanoke College Athletics

===Sesquicentennial===

Roanoke experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s and 1990s.[tpl]cite book | first = George | last = Keller | authorlink = George Keller | title = Prologue To Prominence, A Half Century at Roanoke College | publisher = Lutheran University Press | isbn=978-1-932688-12-2[/tpl]Prologue to Prominence – George Keller – ISBN 978-1-932688-12-2 Two campaign plans, the 1992 Sesquicentennial Campaign and the 2002 Plan, also known as "The Difference", were successfully completed with over $150 million raised.  The campaigns financed the renovation and construction of numerous facilities including the library, the student center, and the arts and performance center.
Roanoke's tenth president, and first female president, Sabine O'Hara, took office in 2004.  O'Hara, an expert in sustainable economic development, was recruited to lead formulation of a new strategic plan, one that would advance the college into the next decade.  In 2006, Roanoke unveiled "The 2015 Plan",[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.roanoke.edu/x5864.xml |title=Roanoke College Unveils New Strategic Plan – Roanoke College – Salem, Virginia |publisher=Web.roanoke.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.roanoke.edu/About_Roanoke/Strategic_Plan.htm |title=2015 Strategic Plan – Roanoke College – Salem, Virginia |publisher=Web.roanoke.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl] which calls for expanded academic offerings, an increase in enrollment from 1,900 to 2,100 students, renovation and construction of facilities to support increased enrollment, and growth in endowment resources to support financial aid for more students.  O'Hara resigned in 2007 after unveiling the plan; her tenure was short, but productive with four new residence halls constructed, two academic buildings renovated, a new sports stadium completed, and records set for applications and enrollment.  

===President Michael C. Maxey===

Michael C. Maxey became Roanoke's eleventh president on July 1, 2007; he was unanimously elected by the board of trustees having served as Roanoke's vice president for college relations and dean of admissions and financial aid from 1992 until his selection as president.  He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Wake Forest University.
Maxey has provided dynamic leadership highlighted by Roanoke's current campaign plan – "Roanoke Rising" – that seeks to raise $200 million to finance facilities, endowment, and special projects; the college had already secured $130 million before the campaign was publicly launched on April 13, 2013.http://roanokerising.com/  The primary objectives of the campaign are a new athletics center and an expanded science complex.  Roanoke is completing its strategic plan as well; the student body now numbers over 2,100 students, several buildings have been renovated including Roanoke's first LEED certified building (Lucas Hall on the Turbyfill Quadrangle), and a new residence hall constructed, the fifth since 2005.  The residence hall is Roanoke's second LEED certified building (New Hall on the "Athletic" Quadrangle).http://roanoke.edu/Student_Life/Where_to_Live/Residence_Halls/New_Residence_Hall.htm

==Lutheran heritage==

Established in 1842, Roanoke is the second oldest (Gettysburg College is the oldest) Lutheran-affiliated college in the United States and is associated with three synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America:  the Virginia Synod, the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Synod, and the West Virginia–Western Maryland Synod.  The Virginia Synod is headquartered in Bittle Hall, the college's first library now occupied by the Bishop of the Virginia Synod.  
Historically, the college has had a small Lutheran population.  Roanoke's student body represents numerous religious denominations; Roman Catholic is the most prevalent, Lutherans total less than ten percent.  Roanoke has an active religious life program for students seeking that experience, but religion is not prominent; students are not required to attend religious services or to take classes in religion.  
Roanoke honors its Lutheran heritage with an independent board of trustees; the church does not control administration.  The dominant aspect of Roanoke's Lutheran heritage is the college's commitment to academic freedom.  Martin Luther encouraged freedom from oppression along with freedom for learning and freedom for service in the community.

===Teams===

Roanoke teams compete in the following sports:

===Football===

Roanoke's football program was discontinued during World War II after more than 60 years of competition.A Guide to Historical Salem | Vol. 3 No. 3 Initially a club sport, the first varsity game occurred in 1892 against Allegheny Institute. The final game was a 42–0 loss to Catawba College on November 13, 1942.
In 1985, the Salem city government constructed an 8,000 seat stadium adjacent to Roanoke's Elizabeth Campus, two miles from the main campus, location of athletic fields and residence halls.Salem Football Stadium  Constructed for Salem's public high school, many hoped the college would revive its football program and that the team would play in the stadium, but the college declined.  The stadium hosts the annual NCAA Division III football championship even though Roanoke does not compete in the sport.

===Rivalries===

Roanoke and Washington and Lee University have been rivals for more than a century.  The rivalry, strongest in men's lacrosse, is fueled by a long history of athletic contests; the schools have competed since the 1870s.  The rivalry is also influenced by conference affiliation and geography; the schools are charter members of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and are located within an hour drive of each other on Interstate 81.  Both schools traditionally have nationally ranked men's lacrosse teams and are usually ranked in the top ten when meeting late in the season.  In addition to Washington and Lee, contests with Hampden-Sydney College and Lynchburg College draw the most attention; both are members of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference.
Roanoke and Virginia Tech were rivals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Virginia Tech was a small college.  In 1877, the schools competed in Virginia Tech's first intercollegiate baseball game (Virginia Tech won 53–13), and in 1896, Virginia Tech first wore its current athletic colors – maroon and burnt orange – in a football game against Roanoke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/databook/text/chap2/2_8.htm |title=Historical Data Book, Section 2.8: Student Organizations |publisher=Spec.lib.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vt.edu/about/hokie.html |title=What is a Hokie? | Virginia Tech |publisher=Vt.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl] In 1895, Roanoke and Virginia Tech were charter members of the now defunct Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Association along with Randolph-Macon College, the University of Richmond, and the College of William and Mary, and in 1926, Roanoke and Virginia Tech played the inaugural football game at Virginia Tech's Miles Stadium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/databook/text/chap6/6_4.htm |title=Historical Data Book, Section 6.4: Athletic Facilities |publisher=Spec.lib.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl]

===School colors===

Roanoke has two sets of school colors, blue and gold for academic use and maroon and gray for athletic use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maroons.roanoke.edu/sports/2010/2/11/Maroons.aspx|title=Where did the name Maroons come from? – Roanoke College – Salem, Virginia|accessdate=February 1, 2013[/tpl] This dates to 1907 when the baseball team needed new uniforms, but could not obtain any in blue and gold.  Maroon and gray uniforms were purchased as a substitute.  Within a few years, maroon and gray were adopted as Roanoke's official athletic colors.  The college athletic nickname became Maroons as well.  In recent years, black has been added as an accent color so Roanoke athletic uniforms are often maroon, gray, and black.

===Nickname and mascot===

==Roanoke and the railway==

The Norfolk and Western Railway, now Norfolk Southern Corporation, has provided career opportunities for many Roanoke alumni; the NWR was headquartered in Roanoke until 1982 and is a major employer in western Virginia. Roanoke graduates who have advanced to leadership positions include Stuart T. Saunders and John P. Fishwick, former presidents of the NWR; John R. Turbyfill, retired vice-chairman, NSC; John S. Shannon, retired executive vice president, NSC; and William T. Ross, Sr., retired assistant vice president, NWR.
Roanoke has strong historic ties to the railway due in part to its alumni connections. The NWR named a Pullman car "Roanoke College" in honor of the college and Fishwick's Salem residence is now the college President's House. Saunders and Turbyfill served as chairman of Roanoke's board of trustees. In 2007, David R. Goode, retired chairman, NSC, endowed Roanoke's Center for Learning and Teaching in honor of his father, sister, and brother-in-law, all Roanoke graduates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.roanoke.edu/x11836.xml |title=Roanoke Establishes Goode-Pasfield Center for Learning & Teaching – Roanoke College – Salem, Virginia |publisher=Web.roanoke.edu |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008[/tpl]
