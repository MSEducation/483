CATEGORIES: Marketing analytics

Marketing Resource Management (MRM) provides the software infrastructure to support Marketing Operations Management. Marketing Operations Management is the alignment of people, process and technology to support marketing activities and improve marketing effectiveness. The growing importance of an effective MRM strategy is reflected by the number of leading organizations which are following this path, with implementations of software provided by some of the leading technology vendors operating in this space. This growth is also reflected in the growing importance of the marketing operations role in organizations.
MRM generally refers to technology for the areas of planning, design and production within marketing and MRM solutions do not provide the analytics, decisioning and automated execution capabilities for personalized marketing across channels. MRM is a subset of Enterprise Marketing Management (EMM) solutions which provide more complete capabilities for all of the functions and roles within the marketing.

==What MRM is, What it is not==

Marketing Resource Management platforms can be confused with "web-to-print" systems that house digital assets and send them to production with instructions.  These platforms have been around since the mid 1990s and have changed slightly to integrate other features associated with print like direct mail fulfillment and list purchasing. MRM platforms are fully integrated Marketing Automation Platforms for Brands to carry out marketing across print, digital, social, and mobile mediums in collaboration with their local affiliates.[tpl]cite web|last=Ritkes|first=Gary|title=Web to Print vs. Marketing Resource Management|url=http://www.sproutloud.com/resources/blog/web-print-vs-marketing-resource-management|work=http://www.sproutloud.com/|publisher=SproutLoud Media LLC|accessdate=25 October 2013[/tpl]
Brands also use these platforms to manage Market development funds for their affiliates.
