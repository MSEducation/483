==Musical style==

S.H.E has released eleven studio albums to date, including three compilation albums and one which is only digitally released. All of S.H.E's album covers display an oxalis, the symbol for the group. On some covers, the clover is easy to spot on the front (Girls Dorm, Together, Encore, Forever, Play) or on the back (FM S.H.E); on other covers, its appearance is more subtle (Super Star, Once Upon a Time). S.H.E's other contributions include songs in the soundtracks of Magical Love, The Rose, Reaching for the Stars, Tokyo Juliet, The Little Fairy, Hanazakarino Kimitachihe, and Bull Fighting. In 2008, they sang the ending theme for the film CJ7.

Most S.H.E songs fall into the category of pop music. Songs from this genre consist of light melodies,[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Singtao News. Kung Fu brings revival to the Mainland China music scene. March 24, 2006. Retrieved March 2, 2007. simple drum beats, and the occasional piano or synthesizer accompaniment. In Girls Dorm and Youth Society, acoustic guitar melody lines were used as well. While some slower songs, particularly those in Genesis, fall into the genre of R&B, high-tempo songs, such as "Beauty Up My Life", focus more on techno. S.H.E has also sung a few pop/rock songs, including "Piquancy" ([tpl]zh|c=痛快|links=no[/tpl]), "Super Star", and "Star Light" ([tpl]zh|c=星光|links=no[/tpl]). As their career progressed, S.H.E began mixing light-hearted pop ballads with elements of hip hop and dance. Attempts to fuse these genres started with songs such as "If You're Happy, Then I'll Be Pleased" ([tpl]zh|t=你快樂我隨意|links=no[/tpl]), which contained a short rap segment, and evolved into songs such as "Listen to Yüan Wei-Jen Play Guitar" ([tpl]zh|t=聽袁惟仁彈吉他|links=no[/tpl]), which is composed entirely of rap with the exception of the chorus.

===Lyrics===

Shi Rencheng ([tpl]zh|t=施人誠|links=no[/tpl]) serves as the group's main lyricist since the group's debut.

Selina was responsible for the lyrics of "Wifey" ([tpl]zh|t=老婆|links=no[/tpl]) and "Silenced" ([tpl]zh|t=安靜了|links=no[/tpl]).

===Covers===

S.H.E's albums contain quite a number of cover songs. Among the group's 90 songs, 28 are covers. Earlier albums often included cover songs; however, since 2004, the group has recorded no more than two covers per album. In most covers, the songs' original titles were kept. Other songs, such as Westlife's "Soledad", were simply given new Chinese titles. The lyrics are usually rewritten, but some songs, such as Charlene's "I've Never Been To Me", are sung in their original English. While the musical style is usually maintained, some covers, such as "Only Lonely" and "I.O.I.O", have a lighter, bubblegum pop feel.
Older pieces and nursery rhymes are occasionally parodied. "Don't Wanna Grow Up" is a parody of Mozart's 40th Symphony, and "London Bridge is Falling Down" ([tpl]zh|t=倫敦大橋垮下來|links=no[/tpl]) is based on the children's song of the same name. The verses of "Thanks for Your Gentleness" ([tpl]zh|t=謝謝你的溫柔|links=no[/tpl]) are original compositions, but the chorus is borrowed from Mayday's "Gentle and Soft".
S.H.E's covers have received less critical acclaim than their original works. During the group's career, original compositions have combined for nearly 20 awards, whereas covers have been lauded only twice.[tpl]ref label|G|g|none[/tpl]

==Criticism==

===Lack of originality===

A review of S.H.E's 2005 album Once Upon a Time described the majority of the songs as "mundane", "predictable" and no better than "mushy pop standards", indicating that little has changed over their career.Phipps, Gavin. CD Reviews December 1, 2005. Retrieved March 2, 2007.  Chris Taylor of the Taiwan Review stated that their songs are hardly artistic, and that the girls are merely "industry-created" idols.Taylor, Chris. An Industry on the Edge. May 1, 2004.

Johnny Neihu's NewsWatch: S.H.E looks like The Man to me. May 12, 2007. An article in Style Weekly, a Chinese fashion magazine, asserted that the trio's songs, compared to those of "talented musicians",[tpl]ref label|I|i|none[/tpl] are lyrically weaker because they only reflect the female view of love.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Style Weekly. Richie Ren and S.H.E to perform at Wulihe Stadium in November. September 2006. Retrieved April 5, 2007.
The group's regular covering of songs has also earned some ire over the years. After the release of the Reaching for the Stars soundtrack in 2005, there were accusations on Internet forums stating that the song "Star Light" sounded suspiciously similar to Ayumi Hamasaki's "About You". In response, S.H.E declared that "Star Light" and "About You" were completely different, and did not even sound similar to each other.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Performing aspects of sadist-masochist culture using closed cages, S.H.E spends 1 million to make hot music video[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] September 26, 2005.

However, S.H.E fans felt that the netizen was being slightly uptight about the issue, and stated that "as long as the song is nice, no point worrying about whether the song is a cover." Despite the trio's claims that their covers were merely products of company decisions, some critics feel that the trio is still oblivious to the concept of artistic integrity. The use of covers is controversial for other artists as well as for S.H.E; an article in the Beijing times in 2007 asserted that the frequent use of cover songs to stay successful indicates the declining originality and quality of Chinese popular music.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] The Beijing Times.

===Comparison with group Twins===

In a 2004 review of female artists in Greater China, S.H.E was given an 80% approval rating, while archrivals Twins received a mere 50%. The difference in quality was apparently so great that there was no reason for S.H.E to be concerned.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Epoch Times.

The rumor was denied by them and the representatives from their company but it spread so quickly that it resulted in temporary falling out of favour with the Chinese media. By 2006, S.H.E had lost several product endorsements, and an entertainment review in that year gave Twins the advantage over the trio in almost every category, from song quality to concert presence.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Tom.com.

==Influence and impact==

===Musical===

By 2001, the vast majority of notable singing groups in Taiwan[tpl]ref label|J|j|none[/tpl] were male. When S.H.E was formed, other girl groups were only beginning to earn their fame in the Taiwanese music industry, but few would last more than two years. Formed in 2000, 4 in Love had similar success to S.H.E during their first year in the entertainment business, but broke up less than two years later.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] aigo MUSIC. Rise and fall of singing groups - 4 in Love. September 7, 2006. Retrieved March 3, 2007. Among the former members of 4 in Love, Rainie Yang is the only member to have continued her singing career. Other groups, such as Walkie Talkie ([tpl]zh|t=錦繡二重唱|links=no[/tpl]), were formed as a result of talent competitions, but were less notable during the course of their careers.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Ke Erqin. S.H.E's Encore: determined to support girls.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] December 9, 2004. Retrieved February 28, 2007. Over a year after S.H.E's formation, the state of girl groups in Taiwan had changed little. In January 2003, radio station UFM1003 released a list of its Top 10 Taiwanese Pop Groups for the year 2002. Although S.H.E was ranked first, they were the only all-female group on the list.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Hong Minghua. Mainland and Taiwanese artists go head-to-head. January 8, 2003. Retrieved March 3, 2007.
During the course of S.H.E's career, a significant number of musical groups were introduced by their companies as "the next S.H.E" with hopes of emulating their success. When Warner Music Taiwan wanted to form a three-person boy band, they planned on marketing them as "the male version of S.H.E" before coming up with the name "G-Boys".[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Male version of S.H.E to be named "Yuanqi" (G-Boys) according to online fan voting.

[tpl]Wayback|url=http://ent.linktone.com/music/news/1400128048.shtml|date =20061010064125|bot=DASHBot[/tpl] Some groups were formed to topple S.H.E's standing as Taiwan's premier pop group. Jungiery Star manager Sun Derong stated that 7 Flowers was formed just to provide competition for S.H.E.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Secretive girl group, 7 Flowers, competes with S.H.E. March 24, 2004.

Despite the increase in competition, S.H.E maintains a definitive stranglehold on the Mandopop group awards, suggesting that the formation of these new groups has done little to ruffle the trio's feathers.

===Other===

According to Baidu's year-end Top Search Terms survey, the most-searched movie of 2004 was House of Flying Daggers ([tpl]zh|c=十面埋伏|links=no[/tpl]). The phrase logged more than 1.2 million searches, which was nearly twice as many as second place (Kung Fu Hustle). Baidu attributed this difference to the fact that S.H.E had released a song with the same name earlier that year. As a result, searches for the song were lumped together with the movie, thereby inflating the latter's search totals.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Baidu Top Search Terms 2004. December 31, 2004.
