Alfonso V (994 – 7 August 1028), called the Noble, was King of León from 999 to 1028. Enough is known of him to justify the belief that he had some of the qualities of a soldier and a statesman. Like other kings of León, he used the title emperor to assert his standing among the Christian rulers of Spain.[tpl]sfn|Sánchez Candeira|1951|p=16|ps=. In a letter to king Sancho III of Navarre, the Catalan bishop Oliva of Vic called Alfonso imperator. A document of the monastery of Celanova (1007) also refers to Alfonso V as rex imperator.[/tpl]
Alfonso was three years old when he succeeded his father, Bermudo II, in 999.[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=7[/tpl]  His mother, Elvira García, and count Menendo González, who raised him in Galicia,[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=7, 24, and 27[/tpl] acted as his co-regents until 1007, when the queen mother retired and became a nun.
Alfonso began the work of reorganizing the Christian kingdom of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula after a most disastrous period of civil war and Arab inroads. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
His name and that of his wife are associated with the grant of the first franchises of León (1017).[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=109[/tpl] On a Wednesday, 7 August 1028, Alfonso V was killed by an arrow while besieging the Muslim town of Viseu,[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|pp=8 and 223–226[/tpl][tpl]Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|p=155[/tpl] King Alfonso was buried next to his first wife Elvira, according to his wishes, at the Church of Saint John the Baptist and San Pelayo which later changed its name to the Basilica of San Isidoro when the latter saint's remains were transferred from Seville.[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=223 and 226[/tpl] The following epitaph was carved on his tomb:

Translation: "Here lies Alfonso, who re-populated León ... and gave good laws and made / this church clay and brick. He had battles with / the Saracens, and was killed with an arrow before Viseu / in Portugal. He was the son of Vermudo Ordóñez . . ."[/tpl][/tpl]

==Family==

Alfonso first married Elvira Mendes in 1013, daughter of his tutor Menendo González at whose house he was raised as a child, with whom he had two children.[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=214[/tpl]
After Elvira's death on 2 December 1022,[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=218[/tpl] Alfonso married Urraca Garcés, sister of King Sancho III of Navarre.[tpl]sfn|Sánchez Candeira|1951|p=34[/tpl] Before this marriage took place, the king of Navarre had sent Ponce, abbot at the Monastery of San Pedro de Tavèrnoles, later bishop of Oviedo, and a nobleman named Garcia, to intercede before Abbot Oliba, bishop of Vic, in favor of the marriage of his sister Urraca to the king of León, despite the impediments of consanguinity. Although Bishop Oliba did not authorize the marriage, describing it as incesti connubii in a letter dated 11 May 1023,[tpl]Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|pp=122–123[/tpl] the royal wedding was celebrated between the date of the bishop's letter and 13 November 1023 when Alfonso V and his new wife, who confirms as Urraka regina, appear together for the first time in a charter in the Cathedral of León.[tpl]Sfn|Fernández del Pozo|1999|p=218[/tpl][tpl]Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|pp=123 and 155[/tpl]
Urraca and her mother Jimena Fernández made a donation on 26 September 1028 to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela confirming as Scemena regina simulque et filia mea Urraca Regina (...) genitoris nostri Fredenandus Ueremudiz et domna Geloria, and a few years later, King Bermudo III on 6 August 1031 referred to his step-mother as Urraca regina Garseani regis filia.
Alfonso and Urraca had one daughter, who was named Jimena as attested in a charter dated 22 December 1036 in a donation made by Muniadona and her son Fernando Gundemáriz, son of Gundemaro Pinióliz, when she confirms as Jimena, daughter of King Alfonso.[tpl]Sfn|Fernández Conde et al|2007|p= 198[/tpl]
