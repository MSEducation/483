Until their first moult, nymphs have red and black exoskeletons that aid them in ant mimicry.  They are green and white starting at their second instar and adults are similar in size and appearance to Creobroter species. Adult females are up to 5 cm in length while males only grow to 3 cm in length due to the sexual dimorphism common in mantises.  Both sexes have green and white spots with bright orange hind wings and a large white transverse stripe on the forewings.http://www.phasmidsincyberspace.com/Mantids.html Phasmids in Cyberspacehttp://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Zoo/6118/Theopropus.html&date=2009-10-25+09:36:36 Theopropus elegans
