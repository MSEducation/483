CATEGORIES: Bitterns, Botaurus, Bird genera

Botaurus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae. It has a single representative species in each of North America, Central and South America, Eurasia and Australasia. The two northern species are partially migratory, with many birds moving south to warmer areas in winter.
The four Botaurus bitterns are all large chunky, heavily streaked brown birds which breed in large reedbeds. Almost uniquely for predatory birds, the female rears the young alone.[tpl]cite journal || last= Sibly | first= Richard M, | coauthors= Christopher C. Witt, Natalie A.

Like other bitterns, they eat fish, frogs, and similar aquatic life.
