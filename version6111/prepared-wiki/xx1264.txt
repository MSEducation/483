[[Chaos theory]]

CATEGORIES: Chaos theory

Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several disciplines including meteorology, sociology, physics, engineering, economics, biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—a paradigm popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.[tpl]cite book |last=Kellert |first=Stephen H. |title=In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-42976-8 |page=32 |ref=harv[/tpl] This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.[tpl]harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56[/tpl] In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.[tpl]harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Werndl, Charlotte |title=What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=195–220 |year=2009 |url=http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axn053[/tpl]  This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.  The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as follows:[tpl]cite web |url=http://mpe2013.org/2013/03/17/chaos-in-an-atmosphere-hanging-on-a-wall |title=Chaos in an Atmosphere Hanging on a Wall |last1=Danforth |first1=Christopher M. |date=April 2013 |work=Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013 |accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl]
 
 Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

Chaotic behavior can be observed in many natural systems, such as weather.[tpl]cite book|last=Ivancevic|first=Vladimir G.|title=Complex nonlinearity: chaos, phase transitions, topology change, and path integrals|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-79356-4|author2=Tijana T. Ivancevic[/tpl] This behavior can be studied through analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps.

==Chaotic dynamics==

In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".Definition of [tpl]linktext|chaos[/tpl] at Wiktionary; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although there is no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos, a commonly used definition says that, for a dynamical system to be classified as chaotic, it must have the following properties:[tpl]cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58750-6[/tpl]
The requirement for sensitive dependence on initial conditions implies that there is a set of initial conditions of positive measure that do not converge to a cycle of any length.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===

Sensitivity to initial conditions means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.
It has been shown that in some cases the last two properties in the list above actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions,[tpl]cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=1-58488-002-3 |page=117 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=0-471-68755-3 |page=42 [/tpl] and if attention is restricted to intervals, the second property implies the other two[tpl]cite journal |author=Vellekoop, Michel; Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629[/tpl] (an alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list).[tpl]cite book |author=Medio, Alfredo; Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-55874-3 |page=165 [/tpl] It is interesting that the most practically significant property, that of sensitivity to initial conditions, is redundant in the definition, being implied by two (or for intervals, one) purely topological properties, which are therefore of greater interest to mathematicians.
Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "butterfly effect", so called because of the title of a paper given by Edward Lorenz in 1972 to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. entitled Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?.[tpl]cite web|title=1972/Lorenz|url=http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=1972/Lorenz&oldid=761296|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=8 April 2014|author=Wikiversity|date=28 July 2011[/tpl] The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.
A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with only a finite amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system will no longer be predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.[tpl]cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 [/tpl] Of course this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; there are some restrictions on the system. With weather, we know that the temperature will never reach 100 degrees Celsius or fall to -130 degrees Celsius on earth, but we are not able to say exactly what day we will have the hottest temperature of the year.
where λ is the Lyapunov exponent.  The rate of separation can be different for different orientations of the initial separation vector. Thus, there is a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents — the number of them is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space. It is common to just refer to the largest one, for example, to the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.
There are also measure-theoretic conditions (discussed in ergodic theory) such as mixing or being a K-system which relate to sensitivity of initial conditions and chaos.

===Topological mixing===

Topological mixing (or topological transitivity) means that the system will evolve over time so that any given region or open set of its phase space will eventually overlap with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored dyes or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.
Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points will eventually become widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 will tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke[tpl]cite journal |last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A. Yorke[/tpl] (1975) proof that any one-dimensional system that exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===

Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional logistic map defined by x → 4 x (1 – x), are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an attractor, since then a large set of initial conditions will lead to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.
An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the basin of attraction of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the Lorenz weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern, that with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.
Unlike fixed-point attractors and limit cycles, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as strange attractors, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both continuous dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some discrete systems (such as the Hénon map). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a Julia set which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points – Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a fractal structure, and a fractal dimension can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their dimensionality. In contrast, for continuous dynamical systems, the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  Finite-dimensional linear systems are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it has to be either nonlinear or infinite-dimensional.
The Poincaré–Bendixson theorem states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed above is generated by a system of three differential equations with a total of seven terms on the right-hand side, five of which are linear terms and two of which are quadratic (and therefore nonlinear). Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the Rossler equations with seven terms on the right-hand side, only one of which is (quadratic) nonlinear. Sprott [tpl]cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=228|issue=4–5 |page=271|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S [/tpl] found a three-dimensional system with just five terms on the right-hand side, and with just one quadratic nonlinearity, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values. Zhang and Heidel [tpl]cite journal|last=Heidel |first=J. |last2=Fu |first2=Z.|year=1999|title=Nonchaotic behaviour in three-dimensional quadratic systems II. The conservative case|journal=Nonlinearity|volume=12|issue=3 |page=617|doi=10.1088/0951-7715/12/3/012|bibcode = 1999Nonli..12..617H [/tpl] showed that, at least for dissipative and conservative quadratic systems, three-dimensional quadratic systems with only three or four terms on the right-hand side cannot exhibit chaotic behavior.  The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.
While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem means that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean plane cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with non-Euclidean geometry can exhibit chaotic behavior.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite-dimensional.  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as functional analysis.

==Spontaneous Order==

Under the right conditions chaos will spontaneously evolve into a lockstep pattern. In the Kuramoto model, four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the coupled oscillation of Christiaan Huygens' pendulums, fireflies, neurons, the London Millenium Bridge resonance, and large arrays of Josephson junctions.Steven Strogatz, Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003. 

==History==

An early proponent of chaos theory was Henri Poincaré. In the 1880s, while studying the three-body problem, he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.[tpl]cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique. Divergence des séries de M. Lindstedt |journal=Acta Mathematica |volume=13 |pages=1–270 |year=1890 |doi=10.1007/BF02392506 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Diacu, Florin; Holmes, Philip |title=Celestial Encounters: The Origins of Chaos and Stability |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 [/tpl] In 1898 Jacques Hadamard published an influential study of the chaotic motion of a free particle gliding frictionlessly on a surface of constant negative curvature, called "Hadamard's billiards".[tpl]cite journal|first = Jacques|last = Hadamard|year = 1898|title = Les surfaces à courbures opposées et leurs lignes géodesiques|journal = Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|volume = 4|pages = 27–73[/tpl] Hadamard was able to show that all trajectories are unstable, in that, all particle trajectories diverge exponentially from one another, with a positive Lyapunov exponent.
Much of the earlier theory was developed almost entirely by mathematicians under the name of ergodic theory. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear differential equations, were carried out by George David Birkhoff,George D. Birkhoff, Dynamical Systems, vol. 9 of the American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications (Providence, Rhode Island: American Mathematical Society, 1927) [tpl]nowrap|Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov[/tpl],[tpl]cite journal| last=Kolmogorov | first=Andrey Nikolaevich | authorlink=Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov | year=1941 | title=Local structure of turbulence in an incompressible fluid for very large Reynolds numbers | journal=Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=301–5 |bibcode = 1941DoSSR..30..301K [/tpl] Reprinted in: [tpl]cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=434 |pages=9–13 |year=1991 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1991.0075 |title=The Local Structure of Turbulence in Incompressible Viscous Fluid for Very Large Reynolds Numbers |last1=Kolmogorov |first1=A.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that linear theory, the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the logistic map. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "noise" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.
The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated iteration of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in Chihiro Hayashi's laboratory at Kyoto University, Yoshisuke Ueda was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on Nov. 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.[tpl]harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=89[/tpl]
An early pioneer of the theory was Edward Lorenz whose interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)0202.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L[/tpl] Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He was able to do this by entering a printout of the data corresponding to conditions in the middle of his simulation which he had calculated last time. To his surprise the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the weather calculated before. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 was printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have had practically no effect. However Lorenz had discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in the long-term outcome.[tpl]cite book|title=Chaos: Making a New Science |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=0-434-29554-X[/tpl] Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.
In 1963, Benoît Mandelbrot found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.[tpl]cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4[/tpl] Beforehand, he had studied information theory and concluded noise was patterned like a Cantor set: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Berger J.M., Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = I.B.M. Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224[/tpl] Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).[tpl]cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 [/tpl]See also: [tpl]cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 [/tpl] This challenged the idea that changes in price were normally distributed. In 1967, he published "How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an infinitesimally small measuring device.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension |journal=Science |volume=156 |issue=3775 |pages=636–8 |date=5 May 1967 |doi=10.1126/science.156.3775.636 |pmid=17837158 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..636M [/tpl] Arguing that a ball of twine appears to be a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a fractal (examples include the Menger sponge, the Sierpiński gasket, and the Koch curve or "snowflake", which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a fractal dimension of circa 1.2619). In 1975 Mandelbrot published The Fractal Geometry of Nature, which became a classic of chaos theory. Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.[tpl]cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the New York Academy of Sciences organized the first symposium on Chaos, attended by David Ruelle, Robert May, James A. Yorke (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), Robert Shaw, and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently Pierre Coullet and Charles Tresser with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and Mitchell Feigenbaum with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.[tpl]cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F[/tpl]Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser.

In 1979, Albert J. Libchaber, during a symposium organized in Aspen by Pierre Hohenberg, presented his experimental observation of the bifurcation cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in Rayleigh–Bénard convection systems. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986 along with Mitchell J. Feigenbaum "for his brilliant experimental demonstration of the transition to turbulence and chaos in dynamical systems".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.[/tpl]
In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of Naval Research the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, Bernardo Huberman presented a mathematical model of the eye tracking disorder among schizophrenics.[tpl]cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H [/tpl] This led to a renewal of physiology in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological cardiac cycles.
In 1987, Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld published a paper in Physical Review Letters[tpl]cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld [/tpl] However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute.

See especially: [tpl]cite journal |author=Laurson, Lasse; Alava, Mikko J.; Zapperi, Stefano |title=Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=0511 |id=L001 |date=15 September 2005 [/tpl] describing for the first time self-organized criticality (SOC), considered to be one of the mechanisms by which complexity arises in nature.
Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile, many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display scale-invariant behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including earthquakes (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the Gutenberg–Richter law describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the Omori law[tpl]cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 [/tpl] describing the frequency of aftershocks), solar flares, fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in econophysics), landscape formation, forest fires, landslides, epidemics, and biological evolution (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "punctuated equilibria" put forward by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of wars. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.
In the same year, James Gleick published Chaos: Making a New Science, which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions[tpl]Citation needed|reason=please share missing contributions with "such as..."|date=May 2013[/tpl]. At first the domain of work of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of nonlinear systems analysis. Alluding to Thomas Kuhn's concept of a paradigm shift exposed in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.
The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory continues to be a very active area of research,Motter A. E. and  Campbell D. K., Chaos at fifty, Phys. Today 66(5), 27-33 (2013). involving many different disciplines (mathematics, topology, physics, social systems, population modeling, biology, meteorology, astrophysics, information theory, computational neuroscience, etc.).

==Distinguishing random from chaotic data==

It can be difficult to tell from data whether a physical or other observed process is random or chaotic, because in practice no time series consists of a pure "signal". There will always be some form of corrupting noise, even if it is present as round-off or truncation error. Thus any real time series, even if mostly deterministic, will contain some randomness.[tpl]cite journal |author=Provenzale, A., et al. |title=Distinguishing between low-dimensional dynamics and randomness in measured time-series |journal=Physica D |volume=58 |pages=31–49 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(92)90100-2 |bibcode = 1992PhyD...58...31P |last2=Smith |last3=Vio |last4=Murante [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Brock, W.A. |title=Distinguishing random and deterministic systems: Abridged version |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=40 |pages=168–195 |date=October 1986 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(86)90014-1 [/tpl]
All methods for distinguishing deterministic and stochastic processes rely on the fact that a deterministic system always evolves in the same way from a given starting point.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sugihara G., May R. | year = 1990 | title = Nonlinear forecasting as a way of distinguishing chaos from measurement error in time series | url = http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268| pages = 734–741 |doi=10.1038/344734a0 | pmid = 2330029|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..734S | last2 = May [/tpl] Thus, given a time series to test for determinism, one can
Define the error as the difference between the time evolution of the test state and the time evolution of the nearby state. A deterministic system will have an error that either remains small (stable, regular solution) or increases exponentially with time (chaos). A stochastic system will have a randomly distributed error.[tpl]cite journal |last=Casdagli |first=Martin |title=Chaos and Deterministic versus Stochastic Non-linear Modelling |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=303–328 |year=1991 |jstor=2346130[/tpl]
Essentially, all measures of determinism taken from time series rely upon finding the closest states to a given test state (e.g., correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). To define the state of a system, one typically relies on phase space embedding methods.[tpl]cite journal |author=Broomhead, D.S.; King, G.P. |title=Extracting qualitative dynamics from experimental data |journal=Physica D |volume=20 |issue=2–3 |pages=217–236 |date=June–July 1986 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(86)90031-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727898690031X|bibcode = 1986PhyD...20..217B |last2=King [/tpl]
Typically one chooses an embedding dimension and investigates the propagation of the error between two nearby states. If the error looks random, one increases the dimension. If the dimension can be increased to obtain a deterministically looking error, then analysis is done. Though it may sound simple, one complication is that as the dimension increases, the search for a nearby state requires a lot more computation time and a lot of data (the amount of data required increases exponentially with embedding dimension) to find a suitably close candidate. If the embedding dimension (number of measures per state) is chosen too small (less than the "true" value), deterministic data can appear to be random, but in theory there is no problem choosing the dimension too large – the method will work.
When a non-linear deterministic system is attended by external fluctuations, its trajectories present serious and permanent distortions. Furthermore, the noise is amplified due to the inherent non-linearity and reveals totally new dynamical properties. Statistical tests attempting to separate noise from the deterministic skeleton or inversely isolate the deterministic part risk failure. Things become worse when the deterministic component is a non-linear feedback system.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kyrtsou C | year = 2008 | title = Re-examining the sources of heteroskedasticity: the paradigm of noisy chaotic models | journal = Physica A | volume = 387 | issue = 27| pages = 6785–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2008.09.008 |bibcode = 2008PhyA..387.6785K [/tpl] In presence of interactions between nonlinear deterministic components and noise, the resulting nonlinear series can display dynamics that traditional tests for nonlinearity are sometimes not able to capture.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kyrtsou, C. |title=Evidence for neglected linearity in noisy chaotic models |journal=International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=3391–4 |year=2005 |doi=10.1142/S0218127405013964 |bibcode = 2005IJBC...15.3391K [/tpl]
The question of how to distinguish deterministic chaotic systems from stochastic systems has also been discussed in philosophy. It has been shown that they might be
observationally equivalent.[tpl]cite journal |author=Werndl, Charlotte |title=Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=40 |pages=232–242 |year=2009 |doi= 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VH6-4X1GG4G-1&_user=10&_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4433c2dcaed0b2a60cc7cbcfae7664ff&searchtype=a |issue=3[/tpl]

==Applications==

Chaos theory was born from observing weather patterns, but it has become applicable to a variety of other situations. Some areas benefiting from chaos theory today are geology, mathematics, microbiology, biology, computer science, economics,[tpl]cite journal | author = Kyrtsou C., Labys W. | year = 2006 | title = Evidence for chaotic dependence between US inflation and commodity prices | journal = Journal of Macroeconomics | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 256–266 |doi=10.1016/j.jmacro.2005.10.019 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Kyrtsou C., Labys W. | year = 2007 | title = Detecting positive feedback in multivariate time series: the case of metal prices and US inflation | doi =10.1016/j.physa.2006.11.002 | journal = Physica A | volume = 377 | issue = 1| pages = 227–229 |bibcode = 2007PhyA..377..227K | last2 = Labys [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Kyrtsou, C.; Vorlow, C. |chapter=Complex dynamics in macroeconomics: A novel approach |editor=Diebolt, C.; Kyrtsou, C. |title=New Trends in Macroeconomics |publisher=Springer Verlag |year=2005 [/tpl] engineering,Applying Chaos Theory to Embedded Applications finance,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hristu-Varsakelis, D.; Kyrtsou, C. |title=Evidence for nonlinear asymmetric causality in US inflation, metal and stock returns |journal=Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society |id=138547 |year=2008 |doi=10.1155/2008/138547 |volume=2008 |pages=1 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023939610962 | author = Kyrtsou, C. and M.

A few categories are listed below with examples, but this is by no means a comprehensive list as new applications are appearing every day.

===Computer Science===

Chaos theory is not new to computer science and has been used for many years in cryptography. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|author2=Zhao, Jianfeng|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul.|year=2012|volume=15|issue=12|pages=4052–4057|bibcode=2010CNSNS..15.4052W|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2010.02.014[/tpl] Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos, theory offers a more efficient way to encrypt images and other information.[tpl]cite journal|last=Babaei|first=Majid|title=A novel text and image encryption method based on chaos theory and DNA computing|journal=Natural Computing. an International Journal|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=101–107|doi=10.1007/s11047-012-9334-9[/tpl] Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a predictive model.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|author2=Keith Walker|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|date=Dec 2005|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009[/tpl]

===Biology===

For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are deterministic systems, but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214[/tpl] For example, a study on models of Canadian Lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \& Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9[/tpl] Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to be learned from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9[/tpl] Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a difficult balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0[/tpl]

===Other Areas===

In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing polymers, but models using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.[tpl]cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017[/tpl] In celestial mechanics, especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will come in range of Earth and other planets.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular & Chaotic Dynamics. International Scientific Journal|year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353[/tpl] In Quantum Physics and Electrical Engineering, the study of large arrays of Josephson junctions benefitted greatly from Chaos theory.Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Sciennce of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003 Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places with frequent natural gas leaks causing most of the deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dingqi|first=Li|author2=Yuanping Chenga|author3=Lei Wanga|author4=Haifeng Wanga|author5=Liang Wanga|author6=Hongxing Zhou|title=Prediction method for risks of coal and gas outbursts based on spatial chaos theory using gas desorption index of drill cuttings|journal=Mining Science and Technology|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=439–443[/tpl]
Chaos theory can even be applied outside of the natural sciences. By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G. L.|author2=Norman E. Aniundson|author3=Jim E. H. Bright|title=Probabilities and Possibilities: The Strategic Counseling Implications of the Chaos Theory of Careers|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|date=June 2008|volume=56|pages=309–318|doi=10.1002/j.2161-0045.2008.tb00096.x[/tpl] Economic models can also be improved through chaos; predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task. Many of the indicators of financial health are chaotic in nature, so including those characteristics lead to better overall estimations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161[/tpl] Traffic forecasting is another area that greatly benefits from applications of chaos theory. Better prediction of when traffic will appear would allow measures to be taken for it to be dispersed before the traffic starts, rather than after. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has lead to a more accurate short-term prediction model.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004[/tpl]

Chaos theory has been mentioned in movies and works of literature, including Michael Crichton's novels Jurassic Park and The Lost World, as well as their film adaptations; the films Chaos and The Butterfly Effect; the Indian movie "Dasavatharam" starring Kamal Hassan; the sitcoms Community and Spaced, Tom Stoppard's play Arcadia and the video games Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Assassin's Creed. In the computer game The Secret World the Dragon secret society uses chaos theory to achieve political dominance. Ray Bradbury's short story "A Sound of Thunder" explores chaos theory.  Chaos theory was the subject of the BBC documentaries High Anxieties — The Mathematics of Chaos directed by David Malone, and The Secret Life of Chaos presented by Jim Al-Khalili. Cultural permutations of chaos theory are explored in the book The Unity of Nature by Alan Marshall (Imperial College Press, London, 2002).
