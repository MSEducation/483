[[Metrication]]

CATEGORIES: Metrication

Metrication is the conversion to the metric system of weights and measures.[tpl]OED|Metrication[/tpl] This has involved a long process of independent and systematic conversions of countries from various local systems of weights and measures. Metrication began in France during the 1790s, and it spread widely during the following two centuries. The metric system became the internationally-dominant measurement system and legal standard. The overall process is sometimes called metricizing or metrification.

==Overview==

The 2006 CIA Factbook stated that the "U.S. is the only industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system", (in addition to the nonindustrialised countries of Burma and Liberia). Some countries, however, have residual usage of non-metric units. In the United Kingdom, for example, metric is the official system for most regulated trading by weight or measure purposes, but miles, yards, and feet remain the official units for road signage—though road design is metric. The Imperial pint (expressed in metric units) also remains a permitted unit for milk in returnable bottles and for draught beer and cider in British pubs.
Some sources identify Liberia as metric. In Burma on October 10, 2013, Dr. Pwint San, the Deputy Minister for Commerce, announced that the country is preparing to adopt the metric system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3684:myanmar-to-adopt-metric-system&catid=44:national&Itemid=384 |title=Myanmar to adopt metric system |author= |date=10 October 2013 |website=www.elevenmyanmar.com |publisher=Eleven Media Group |accessdate=12 October 2013[/tpl] Both Burma and Liberia are substantially metric countries, trading internationally in metric units. Visiting advocates of metrication have stated that they use metric units for many things internally with exceptions such as old petrol pumps in Burma, calibrated in British Imperial gallons. These and other countries have adopted metric measures to some degree through international trade and standardisation for example, Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011.[ref]

In 1971 the National Bureau of Standards completed a 3-year study of the impact of increasing worldwide metric use on the U.S. The study concluded with a report to the Congress entitled A Metric America – A Decision Whose Time Has Come. Since then metric use has increased in the U.S., principally in the manufacturing and educational sectors. Public Law 93-380, enacted 21 August 1974, states that it is the policy of the U.S. to encourage educational agencies and institutions to prepare students to use the metric system of measurement with ease and facility as a part of the regular education program. On 23 December 1975, President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94-168, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. This act declares a national policy of coordinating the increasing use of the metric system in the U.S. It established a U.S. Metric Board whose functions as of 1 October 1982 were transferred to the Dept of Commerce, Office of Metric Programs, to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the metric system.
A number of jurisdictions have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in some or all contexts, such as the United Kingdom, which still uses many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, road speed limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. Most countries have adopted the metric system officially over a transitional period where both units are used for a set period of time. Some countries such as Guyana, for example, have officially adopted the metric system, but have had some trouble over time implementing it.[ref]
