Kali Yuga (Devanāgarī: [tpl]lang|sa|कलियुग[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-sa|kəli juɡə|[/tpl], lit. "age of demon Kali", or "age of vice") is the last of the four stages the world goes through as part of the cycle of yugas described in the Indian scriptures. The other ages are Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga and Dvapara Yuga.
Kali Yuga is associated with the apocalyptic demon Kali, not to be confused with the goddess Kālī. The "Kali" of Kali Yuga means "strife", "discord", "quarrel" or "contention".

==Current Yuga==

The duration and chronological starting point in human history of Kali Yuga has given rise to different evaluations and interpretations.  According to the Surya Siddhanta, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCEThe Induand the Rg-Veda, Page 16, By Egbert Richter-Ushanas, ISBN 81-208-1405-3 in the proleptic Julian calendar, or 14 January 3102 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This date is also considered by many Hindus to be the day that Krishna left Earth to return to his abode.
Most interpreters of Hindu scriptures believe that Earth is currently in Kali Yuga. Other authors such as Swami Sri Yukteswar,The Holy Science, by Jnanavatar Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Yogoda Sat-Sanga Society of India, 1949 and Paramhansa Yogananda[tpl]cite book|last=Yogananda|first=Paramhansa|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|publisher=BiblioBazaar|pages=200–201|isbn=978-0-554-22466-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_R6B6e4l4_4C&pg=PA201[/tpl] believe that it is now an ascending Dvapara Yuga, indicating levels of cycles within each major Yuga period as each being a development, the smaller cycles within cycles eventually leading to full development of the qualities of the ages. The Kali Yuga is sometimes thought to last 432,000 years, although other durations have been proposed.See the article René Guénon, in particular the section on the Hindu doctrine of cosmic cycles: René Guénon#Hindu doctrine of cosmic cycles.

==Attributes of Kali Yuga==

Hindus believe that human civilization degenerates spiritually during the Kali Yuga,Dimitri Kitsikis, L'Orocc, dans l'âge de Kali, Editions Naaman,1985, ISBN 2-89040-359-9 which is referred to as the Dark Age because in it people are as far away as possible from God. Hinduism often symbolically represents morality (dharma) as a bull. In Satya Yuga, the first stage of development, the bull has four legs, but in each age morality is reduced by one quarter. By the age of Kali, morality is reduced to only a quarter of that of the golden age, so that the bull of Dharma has only one leg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03189.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Markandeya-Samasya Parva: Section CLXXXIX |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20[/tpl][tpl]IAST|Bhāgavata Purāṇa[/tpl] 1.16.20

===References in the Mahabharata===

The Mahabharata War and the decimation of Yadavas thus happened at the Yuga-Sandhi, the point of transition from one yuga to another. The scriptures mention Sage Narada to have momentarily intercepted the demon Kali on his way to the Earth when Duryodhana was about to be born in order to make him an embodiment of 'arishadvargas' and adharma in preparation of the era of decay in values and the consequent havoc.

====Prophesied events during a Kali Yuga====

A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of Kali Yuga. In relation to rulers, it lists:
With regard to human relationships, Markandeya's discourse says:

==10,000 year "Golden Age"==

The Brahma Vaivarta Purana (related to Rathantara kalpa) mentions a ten thousand year period, starting from the traditional dating of the Kali Yuga epoch (for this one it is January 14 or 2:27 AM on February 18, 3102 BCE), during which bhakti yogis will be present.Ramesh Chaturvedi, Shantilal Nagar. [tpl]cite book  | title = Brahmavaivarta Purana  | publisher = Parimal Publications | isbn = 81-7110-170-4[/tpl] Online Book 4, Chapter 129, versus 49–60
Lord Krishna foretold that Kali Yuga will be full of extreme hardships for people with ideals and values.
A special 10,000 year "Golden Age" period within Kali Yuga occurs only in this Maha Yuga Cycle.
In the Brahma-vaivarta Purana has words spoken by Lord Krishna to Mother Ganga just before the beginning of Kali yuga (the age of quarrel and strife). Kali yuga began approximately five thousand years ago, and it has a duration of 432,000 years, leaving us with 427,000 till the end of the present age. Within this 432,000 year period, there is a period of 10,000 years that will be a golden age. That golden age is being described below by Lord Sri Krishna. 
Predicted in Brahma-vaivarta Purana 4.129. The fourth part of the Brahma-vaivarta is called Kṛṣṇa-janma-khanda. Chapter 129 is called Golokarohanam, because it describes how Krishna returns to His abode. This specific dialogue is between Lord Krishna and Mother Ganga. Verse 49 is a question by Ganga, verses 50–60 are Lord Sri Krishna's answer.
This text is taken from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana 14
Text 59:
"For 10,000 years of Kali such devotees of Mine will be present on earth. After the departure of My devotees there will be only one varna, Outcaste."
The above is supported in 4.90.32–33:
"(Sri Krisna said:) Lord Hari will stay on this earth for the first ten-thousand years of Kali-yuga. Till then gods will be worshipped and the Puranas and scriptures will also be present."
The great Vaishnava Saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu exhorted, "Krishna Nama Sankirtan" i.e. the constant chanting of the Lord's name is the supreme healer in this age. It destroys sins and purifies the hearts through Bhakti ensures universal peace.
We are in the 10,000 year Golden period as stated by Bhagawan Krishna. 5116 years have elapsed as of 2014 AD taking  into account the start date of kaliyuga as 17th Feb 3102 BC which is also the day Lord Krishna left this material world for his vaikuntam (Spiritual abode). As Bhagawan pointed out that the 10,000 year golden years should begin after 5,000 years are completed in Kaliyuga which means that the Golden period started approximately 116 years back since 5116 years have elapsed, which makes the date of the Golden period as 1898 AD. So, the Golden Period ends at 6898 AD.

==Personification==

Kali is the reigning lord of Kali Yuga and his nemesis is Sri Kalki, the tenth and final Avatar of Lord Vishnu. According to the Vishnu Purana, Kali is a negative manifestation  working towards the cause of 'the end' or rather towards eventual rejuvenation of the universe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp041.htm#fr_212 |title=Chap. Vii |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20[/tpl] Kali also serves as an antagonistic force in the Kalki Purana. It is said that towards the end of this yuga, Kalki will return riding on a white horse to do battle with Kali and his dark forces. The world will suffer a fiery end that will destroy all evil, and a new age, Satya Yuga, will begin.

==In Sikhism==

In Sikhism, it is believed that one should meditate on God as much as possible because of the world being in Kali Yuga. Because of Kali Yuga, it is stressed that one should meditate as much as possible to reach the state of Nirvana and be liberated or be one with God. Guru Granth Sahib Ji on Ang:1185 says:
