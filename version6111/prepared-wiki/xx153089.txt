Mary Stewart, Duchess of Richmond and Duchess of Lennox (1622â€“1685), formerly Lady Mary Villiers, was the daughter of the 1st Duke of Buckingham.
On 8 January 1634, at the age of 12, she married the 15-year-old Charles, Lord Herbert, eldest son of the 4th Earl of Pembroke and 1st Earl of Montgomery, but was widowed in 1635 when her young husband died of smallpox.
On 3 August 1637, she married the 4th Duke of Lennox, who was created Duke of Richmond in 1641.
They had two children:
After the death of her son, sometime before 1664, Mary married Colonel Thomas Howard (d. 1678) about whom little is known.
Maureen E. Mulvihill has built a case for Mary Villiers as the author of the poems published under the pseudonym Ephelia, including Female Poems...by Ephelia (1679).
