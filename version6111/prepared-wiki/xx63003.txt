The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), also known as the dama wallaby or darma wallaby, is a small macropod native to South and Western Australia. Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation, the tammar remains common within its reduced range and it is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously eradicated. Skull differences distinguish tammars from Western Australia, Kangaroo Island and mainland South Australia, making them distinct populations groups or possibly different subspecies.
Around the size of a rabbit, the tammar is among the smallest of the wallabies. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrub. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.

==Taxonomy and classification==

The tammar wallaby was seen in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by survivors of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by François Pelsaert in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pearson, M. | year = 2005 | title = Great Southern Land: The maritime exploration of Terra Australis | publisher = Department of the Environment and Heritage, Government of Australia | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/great-southern-land.pdf | accessdate = 21 December 2007 | isbn = 0-642-55185-5[/tpl][tpl]rp|53[/tpl] It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, who gave it the name eugenii based on where it was found; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia which is now known as St Peter Island. The island's French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin, commander of the ship Naturaliste;[tpl]rp|333[/tpl] whose name is now the specific name of the tammar. The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as tamma (Allocasuarina campestris) that sheltered it in Western Australia. The tammar is classified together with the kangaroos, wallaroos and several species of wallaby in the genus Macropus, and in the subgenus Notomacropus with the other wallabies, all of which have a facial stripe.[tpl]cite journal |last=Dawson, L.; Flannery, T. |year=1985 |title=Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Status of Living and Fossil Kangaroos and Wallabies of the Genus Macropus Shaw (Macropodidae: Marsupialia), with a New Subgeneric Name for the Larger Wallabies |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=473–98 |doi=10.1071/ZO9850473[/tpl]
Fossil evidence of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains were found in the Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago,[tpl]rp|332[/tpl] while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population.[tpl]rp|333[/tpl] A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range, found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population.[tpl]cite journal |author=Poole, W. E.;  Wood, J. T.; Simms, N. G. |year=1991 |title=Distribution of the Tammar and relationships of populations as determined by cranial morphometrics |journal=Wildlife Research |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=625–39 |doi=10.1071/WR9910625[/tpl] The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation lists these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.

==Population dynamics and conservation==

The tammar wallaby is listed as of Least Concern by the IUCN, due to its abundance and presumably stable population. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and morphological abnormalities in some populations.[tpl]cite journal|author=Miller, E. J.; Eldridge, M. D. B.; Morris, K. D.; Zenger, K. R.; Herbert, C. A.|title=Genetic consequences of isolation: island tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) populations and the conservation of threatened species|journal=Conservation Genetics|volume=12|issue=6|pages=1619–31|doi=10.1007/s10592-011-0265-2[/tpl]
Since European occupation, tammar wallaby populations on both mainland Australia and some of the islands have been greatly reduced or even eradicated. In the early 20th century, the mainland population of tammars in Western Australia was described as numerous in much of the south-west, but declining in the cultivated areas, particularly to the north.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shortridge, G. C.|year=1909|title=An Account of the Geographical Distribution of the Marsupials and Monotremes of South-West Australia, having special reference to the specimens collected during the Balston Expedition of 1904–1907|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|volume=79|issue=4|pages=803–48|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1910.tb06974.x[/tpl] Clearings made for wheat and sheep caused the population to decline further.[tpl]cite book|author=Tyndale-Biscoe, Hugh|year=2005|title=Life of Marsupials|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=0-643-06257-2[/tpl][tpl]rp|332[/tpl] From the 19th century, tammars in the Eyre Peninsula and around Adelaide were decimated by mobs of hunters organised to protect crops and pastures. As a result, they were extinct in the areas around Adelaide by the 1920s, and in the Eyre Peninsula around the 1970s.[tpl]rp|332–33[/tpl] Tammars from Flinders Island and St Peter Island were eradicated in a similar manner.[tpl]rp|333[/tpl]  
Tammars from these areas were introduced to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since then, they have flourished to the point where their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate, a naturally occurring rodenticide, to control their populations,[tpl]cite journal|author=Warburton, B.|year=1990|title=Control of Bennett's and Tammar Wallabies in New Zealand Using Compound 1080 Gel on Foliage Baits|journal=Australian Wildlife Research|volume=17|issue=5|pages=541–46|doi=10.1071/WR9900541[/tpl] a practice which has been controversial due to its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shapiro, L.; Ross, J.; Adams, P.; Keyzer, R.; Hix, S.; MacMorran, D.; Cunningham, C.; Eason, C.|year=2011|title=Effectiveness of cyanide pellets for control of dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii)|journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=287–90|issn=01106465|url=http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/new_issues/NZJEcol35_3_287.pdf[/tpl] In 1985, tammars were introduced to the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Hansard/hansard.nsf/0/BC97B320B74018D1C825758A001A99C2/$File/C37%20S1%2020080219%20All.pdf | accessdate = 22 January 2012 | title = Wallabies — Culling | work = Minutes of the Western Australian Legislative Council, Tuesday 19 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]rp|82–83[/tpl] In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Yorke Peninsula in Innes National Park.[tpl]cite web|title= Tammar Wallaby Reintroduction: To breed and reintroduce tamar wallabies into their former range in Australia|publisher= World Association of Zoos and Aquariums|url= http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/overview/tamar-wallaby-reintroduction|accessdate= 10 January 2012[/tpl] Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals now exists.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-14/wallabies-mainland-tammar-warrawong/3828346 |title='Extinct' wallaby goes back on show |publisher=ABC News |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl] Tammars have also been successfully translocated to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park.

===Resistance to sodium fluoroacetate===

Different tammar populations have varying levels of resistance to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars appear to be the most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable.[tpl]cite journal|author= Oliver, A. J. |year=1979|title= Fluoroacetate Tolerance, a Genetic Marker in Some Australian Mammals|journal= Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=27|issue=3|pages= 363–72|doi= 10.1071/ZO9790363[/tpl] Tammars from New Zealand probably have a similar resistance level to the latter as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations.[tpl]rp|334[/tpl] Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.[tpl]rp|334[/tpl]

==Appearance and physiology==

One of the smallest wallaby species, the tammar wallaby features a small head and large ears with a long tail, thick at the base. It has dark grey-brown upperparts with paler grey highlights, rufous on the sides of the body and limbs, particularly in males, and pale grey-buff underparts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,133/Itemid,/|title= Wallaby|title=Tammar Wallaby|publisher= Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] The tammar wallaby exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, with the maximum recorded weight in males being [tpl]convert|9.1|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] and maximum recorded weight in females is [tpl]convert|6.9|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. The body length is [tpl]convert|59|to(-)|68|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in males and [tpl]convert|52|to(-)|63|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in females. Both males and females are about [tpl]convert|45|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in height. The tails of males range from [tpl]convert|34|to(-)|45|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] and those of females from [tpl]convert|33|to(-)|44|cm|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|author=Labiano-Abello, A.

===Locomotion===

As with most macropods, the tammar wallaby moves around by hopping. This species has a hopping frequency of 3.5 strides per second, with a stride length of 0.8–2.4 m (2.5–8 ft).[tpl]cite journal|author=Baudinette, R.V.; Gannon, B. J.; Runciman, W.B.; Wells, S.; Love, J. B.|year=1987|title=Do cardiorespiratory frequencies show entrainment with hopping in the tammar wallaby?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=129|pages=251–63|pmid=3585241|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/129/1/251.full.pdf|issue=1[/tpl] When hopping, proximal muscles at the knee and hip joints generate most of the power for each leap, which are delivered by multi-joint muscles at the ankle.[tpl]cite journal|author=McGowan, C. P.; Baudinette, R.V.; Biewener, A. A.|year=2005|title=Joint work and power associated with acceleration and deceleration in tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii)|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=208|pages=41–53|pmid=15601876|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/1/41.full.pdf|doi=10.1242/jeb.01305|issue=1[/tpl] As it lands, the energy of the jump is converted into strain energy made when its leg tendons are stretched. As it leaps back off the ground, the tammar can recover much of this energy for reuse though elastic recoil.[tpl]cite journal|author= Biewener, A. A; Baudinette, R. V.|year=1995|title= In vivo muscle force and elastic energy storage during steady-speed hopping of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii)|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=198|pages= 1829–41| pmid= 9319738|url= http://jeb.biologists.org/content/198/9/1829.full.pdf|issue=9[/tpl]  The amount of energy stored in the tendons increases with the animal's speed and the weight of the load it is carrying. This is particularly helpful for mothers carrying young,[tpl]cite journal|author=Baudinette, R. V.; Biewener, A. A.|year=1998|title=Young wallabies get a free ride|journal=Nature|volume=296|pages=653–54|doi=10.1038/27111[/tpl]  and explains why tammars can increase their hopping speed without using more energy.[tpl]cite journal|author=Baudinette, R. V.; Snyder, G. K.; Frappell, P. B.|year=1992|title=Energetic cost of locomotion in the tammar wallaby|journal=American Journal of Physiology|volume=262|issue=5 Pt 2|pages=R771–8|pmid=1590472[/tpl]  The tammar shares this characteristic with other plains-dwelling macropods like the red kangaroo. By comparison, rock wallabies, such as the yellow-footed rock-wallaby, have traded efficient energy saving for greater tendon thickness; an adaption for steep rocky terrain as it allows them to leap higher and lowers the risk of their tendons rupturing.[tpl]cite journal|author=McGowan, C. P.; Baudinette, R. V.; Biewener, A. A.|year=2008|title=Differential design for hopping in two species of wallabies|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=150|issue=2|pages=151–58|pmid=16861021|url=http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/McGowanLab/pubs/McGowan_CBP%202008.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.06.018[/tpl]

===Senses===

The tammar has 324° peripheral vision and 50° binocular vision.[tpl]rp|312[/tpl] It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths and in different light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless not as good as a cat or a human.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hemmi, J. M.; Mark, R. F.|year=1998|title=Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and retinal magnification in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii)|journal= Journal of Comparative Physiology A: Neuroethology, Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology|volume=183|issue=3|pages= 379–87|pmid= 9763704[/tpl] Tammars appear to have some colour vision:  its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the higher wavelengths in the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as [tpl]convert|20|nm|m|abbr=on[/tpl] apart.[tpl]cite journal|author= Hemmi, J. M.|year=1999|title=Dichromatic colour vision in an Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A: Neuroethology, Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology|volume=185|issue=6|pages=509–15|doi= 10.1007/s003590050411[/tpl] The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5 kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's hearing level quickly drops.[tpl]cite journal|author=Coles, R. B.; Guppy, A.|year=1986|title=Biophysical Aspects of Directional Hearing in the Tammar Wallaby, Macropus eugenii|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=121|pages=371–94|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/121/1/371.full.pdf|issue=1[/tpl] When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.[tpl]cite journal|author=Schneider, N. Y.; Fletcher, T. P.; Shaw, G.; Renfree M. B.|year=2009|title=The olfactory system of the tammar wallaby is developed at birth and directs the neonate to its mother's pouch odours|journal=Reproduction|volume=138|issue=5|pages=849–57|pmid=19638443|doi=10.1530/REP-09-0145[/tpl]

===Thermoregulation and water turnover===

Tammars lick their forearms and pant to keep cool in hot weather. They breathe more heavily and lose more water when the temperature is over [tpl]convert|30|C|F|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Tammars can't survive in temperatures above [tpl]convert|40|C|F|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and must get away from the heat.[tpl]cite journal|author=Dawson, T. J.; Denny, M. J, S.; Hulbert, A. J.|year=1969|title=Thermal balance of the macropodid marsupial Macropus eugenii (Desmarest)|journal= Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry|volume=31|issue=4|pages= 645–53|doi= 10.1016/0010-406X(69)90065-6[/tpl] To prevent dehydration, tammars urinate less and reabsorb water from the distal colon, which gives them relatively dry feces. Being able to concentrate more urine in their kidneys allows them to survive on seawater.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hum,  I. D.; Dunning, A.|year=1979|title=Nitrogen and electrolyte balance in the wallabies Thylogale thetis and Macropus eugenii when given saline drinking water|journal= Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|volume=63|issue=1|pages= 135–39|doi= 10.1016/0300-9629(79)90639-X[/tpl]

===Sudden deaths===

In late 1998, 120–130 tammar wallabies died suddenly in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome is known as tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae.[tpl]cite web|title=Tammar Wallaby Sudden Death Syndrome (TSDS) Fact Sheet|publisher=Australian Wildlife Health Network|date=22 February 2012|url=http://www.wildlifehealth.org.au/AWHN_Admin/ManageWebsite%5CFactSheets%5CUploadedFiles/119/Tammar%20Wallaby%20Sudden%20Death%20Syndrome%20(TSDS)%2022%20Feb%202012%20(1.3).pdf|accessdate=18 June 2012[/tpl] It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kirkland, P.

==Ecology and life history==

Mostly nocturnal, tammar wallabies spend much of their time foraging.[tpl]rp|335[/tpl] In winter their home ranges are about [tpl]convert|16|ha|abbr=on[/tpl], but in the dry summers they range further afield to search for quality food, needing about [tpl]convert|42|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] of space. Tammar home ranges overlap with those of conspecifics.
During the day, tammars stay close to scrub for shade and move out to more open grassland by nightfall.[tpl]rp|335[/tpl] Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs.[tpl]cite thesis |author=Lentle, R. G. |year=1998 |title=Feeding strategies of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii Desmarest) |publisher=Massey University |degree=Ph.D. |url=http://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/2869[/tpl][tpl]rp|116[/tpl] This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion.[tpl]rp|115–16[/tpl] Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.[tpl]rp|335[/tpl]
The tammar rests in two positions: a "sitting tail forward" position, in which the hind legs are outstreached with tail brought forward in between, the body prone and the head above ground; and a "lying" position, in which the animal lies on its side with the head touching the ground. The former position is typically used during the day for long periods, and the latter position is used at night for brief periods.[tpl]rp|217–19[/tpl] Tammars are known to live in stable groups,[tpl]cite journal|author=Russell, E. M.|year=1984|title=Social behaviour and social organization of marsupials|journal=Mammal Review|volume=14|issue=3|pages=101–54|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.1984.tb00343.x[/tpl] which lessens the chance of an individual being taken by a predator. As the group increases in size, tammars spend more time foraging, grooming and interacting and less time being vigilant and moving around.[tpl]cite journal|author=Blumstein, D. T.; Evans, C. S.; Daniel, J. C.|year=1999|title=An experimental study of behavioural group size effects in tammar wallabies, Macropus eugenii|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=58|issue=2|pages=351–60|issn=00033472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1156|pmid=10458887[/tpl] Predators of the tammar include dingos, feral cats, red foxes and wedge-tailed eagles. They may also have been preyed upon by the extinct thylacine. Tammars appear to respond more to the sight than the sound of predators. They can also use their acute sense of smell to detect a predator.[tpl]cite journal|author=Murchison, E. P.; Adams, D. J.|year=2011|title=Sequencing skippy: the genome sequence of an Australian kangaroo, Macropus eugenii|journal=Genome Biology|volume=12|issue=8|page=R81|pmid=21861852|doi=10.1186/gb-2011-12-8-123|pmc=3245606[/tpl] When a predator is detected, a tammar will alert others by thumping its foot.[tpl]cite journal|author=Blumstein, D. T.; Daniel, J. C.; Griffin, A. S.; Evans, C. S.|year=2000|title=Insular tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) respond to visual but not acoustic cues from predators|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=11|issue=5|pages=528–35|doi=10.1093/beheco/11.5.528[/tpl] When lost, young tammars are known to emit a coarse screeching call and adult females may respond with a similar call.

===Breeding and development===

The tammar wallaby has a promiscuous mating system.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rudd, C. D.|year=1994|title=Sexual behaviour of male and female tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) at post-partum oestrus|journal= Journal of Zoology |volume=232|issue=1|pages= 151–62|doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1994.tb01565.x[/tpl] It is a seasonal breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February.[tpl]rp|77[/tpl] During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, there does not appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Inns, R. W.|year=1982|title=Seasonal changes in the accessory reproductive system and plasma testosterone levels of the male tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, in the wild|journal= Journal of Reproduction and Fertility|volume=66|issue=2|pages= 675–80|doi= 10.1530/jrf.0.0660675[/tpl] Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status.[tpl]rp|78[/tpl] After giving birth, females enter estrous and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females.[tpl]cite book|author=Miller, E. J.; Eldrige, M. D. B.; Herbert, C. A.|contribution=Dominance and paternity in the tammar wallaby|pages=77–85|editors=Coulson, G.; Eldridge, M.|year=2010|title=Macropods: The Biology of Kangaroos, Wallabies and Rat-Kangaroos|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=0-643-09662-0[/tpl][tpl]rp|83[/tpl] Several males may pursue a single female. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young.[tpl]cite journal|author=Riedman, Marianne L.|year=1982|title=The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=57|issue=4|pages=405–435|jstor=2826887[/tpl]
The female tammar can conceive shortly after giving birth.[tpl]rp|335[/tpl] Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant for nearly a year. For the first half of the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later.[tpl]cite journal|author=Renfree, M. B.; Tyndale-Biscoe, C.

When it reaches the pouch, the underdeveloped joey suckles the teat of one of the four mammary glands while the others recede.[tpl]cite journal|author=Trott, J. F.; Simpson, K. J.; Moyle, R. L. C.; Hearn, C. M.; Shaw, G.; Nicholas, K. R.; Renfree, M.

The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the pouch, and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.
