Lacsamana also known as Ricky Laxamana,[tpl]cite news|url=http://lacsamana.homestead.com/page04.html|title=Laxamana's first one-man show|last=Perez|first=Carmen|date=1 January 1974|work=Bulletin Today|accessdate=11 May 2011|page=8[/tpl] is a painter in the Philippines. His works had been shown in various solo shows and mix shows in different galleries. His Paintings have been on collections in different places of the world. He graduated at the University of Santo Tomas, College of Fine Arts in the Philippines. He was a consistent winner in almost all competitions he entered that made him win an award as the Most Outstanding Atelier student in painting (ref. The Varsitarian, "The Thomasian as a Surealist" by Oscar T. Valeriano)
His first one-man show was at the Hidaldo Gallery in Makati Commercial Center, Philippines - January 2, 1974.  (ref. Manila Bulletin, Jan 1, 1974 issue, Home & Culture by Carmen Perez section).
His painted Pumpkin won best entry at the 1998 Annual Pumpkin Contest at the Westin Hotel & Resorts in San Francisco, California.  While some of his works were featured at the San Francisco State University's Literary Magazine, "From the Heart" or "Del Corazon".  He was a runner up at the Burlingame Art Society competition in 2002.  One of his old work was featured in the Encyclopedia of Philippine Art (ref. Encyclopedia of Philippine Art, Volume 1, pg 179).
The Florida Medical Journal has one of his composition on its cover in 1990 (ref. The Journal of Florida Medical, September 1990, Vol 77, No.9).  An abstract watercolor, metaphorically symbolizing the role of physicians in treating the sick.  According to artist Ricardo G. Lacsamana, the outstretched hands symbolize the healing power of physicians, manifest as a healthy tree providing protection and comfort to the sick and infirm who are aided by philanthropic groups, as symbolized by the crutch.  The dove and fish indicate that physicians do not escape criticism, while the central "internal" figures may connote the medical profession as a whole.  He created a painting entitled "Transition" in commemoration of the Peace and Freedom and People Power Revolution (also known as the EDSA Revolution and the Philippine Revolution of 1986), which at that time was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines.  The painting was featured in "The Manila Times" in August 1986 (ref. The Manila Times, August 1986 issue).
Lacsamana painted dreams draw admiration to art lovers.  His symbols and very fertile imagination produce fantastic images... that takes you in a horizon where you experience dreaming differently, you never thought you could.  He copes with contemporary problems such as flood, population explosion, Fil-American relations, women's liberation, poverty, the respective roles of the young and old in society, and with modern interpretations of the Bible.
Alejandro R. Roces (a Filipino fictionist, essayist, dramatist and a National Artist of the Philippines for literature) once said in his article that "he is the first truly surrealistic painter in the Philippines." (ref. The Manila Times, August 1986 issue)
