CATEGORIES: Cemeteries in Michigan, Protected areas of Kalkaska County, Michigan

Westwood Cemetery is one of the oldest cemeteries in Kalkaska County, Michigan, dating back to the early 19th century. While it appears abandoned, as of August 2008 it is still actively taken care of and the deceased are still sparingly buried in plots within Westwood. It is nowhere near as active as it was when first used as a cemetery.

==Location==

Westwood Cemetery is located on Westwood Road, right off of Cemetery Road. It is roughly 1/2 a mile (300 m) from Plum Valley Road, and roughly [tpl]convert|1+1/2|mi|km[/tpl] from US 131 in Kalkaska County in Kalkaska, Michigan. It was placed in such a scenic location in the early 19th century where only the Westwoods were laid to rest. It has since become a public cemetery, yet still remains a very scenic cemetery.

=="The Weeks of the Dead"==

Somewhat of a local myth, August 15 September 15 are known to locals as "The Weeks of the Dead". As legend has it, the 'spirits' of the historic Westwood family roam the cemetery to rid their former territory of unknowns. Few people have actually experienced "The Weeks of the Dead". Others that have lived nearby on Cemetery Road tell tales of ghostly figures walking the roads around the cemetery. It is not known whether "The Weeks of the Dead" are real, but if you ask the locals firmly maintain it is.
