Tavurvur is an active stratovolcano that lies near Rabaul in Papua New Guinea. It is a sub-vent of the Rabaul caldera and lies on the eastern rim of the larger feature. An eruption of the volcano largely destroyed the nearby town of Rabaul in 1994.
Mount Tavurvur is the most active volcano in Rabaul caldera, and erupted most recently in 2013.

==History==

In 1937, Tavurvur and another nearby volcano, Vulcan, erupted, killing 507 people.
On the 7th of October 2006 the volcano erupted again, and an initial blast shattered windows up to 12 kilometres away and sent an ash plume 18 km into the stratosphere.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1758072.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=Online News |title=Winds soften erupting volcano's impact |date=2006-10-08[/tpl] Winds blew most of the ash away from Rabaul.
