[[Cyrillic script]]

CATEGORIES: Cyrillic script, Alphabets

The Cyrillic script [tpl]IPAc-en|s|ɨ|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|ɪ|k[/tpl] is an alphabetic writing system employed across Eurasia. It is based on the  Early Cyrillic, which was developed  in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School.Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500–1250, Cambridge Medieval Textbooks, Florin Curta, Cambridge University Press, 2006, ISBN 0521815398, pp. 221–222.The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire, Oxford History of the Christian Church, J. M. Hussey, Andrew Louth, Oxford University Press, 2010, ISBN 0191614882, p. 100. It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, past and present, in parts of the Balkans and Northern Eurasia, especially those of Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. As of 2011 around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages. About half of them are in Russia.[tpl]cite web|author=Česky |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population |title=List of countries by population – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] Cyrillic is one of the most used writing systems in the world.
Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script, augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet, including some ligatures. These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek. The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers,Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05, s.v.

Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius.
With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts.

==Letters==

Cyrillic script spread throughout the East and South Slavic territories, being adopted for writing local languages, such as the Old East Slavic. Its adaptation to local languages produced a number of Cyrillic alphabets, discussed hereafter.
Capital and lowercase letters were not distinguished in old manuscripts.
Yeri ([tpl]script|Cyrs|Ы[/tpl]) was originally a ligature of Yer and I ([tpl]script|Cyrs|Ъ[/tpl] + [tpl]script|Cyrs|I[/tpl] = [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ы[/tpl]). Iotation was indicated by ligatures formed with the letter I: [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ꙗ[/tpl] (not ancestor of modern Ya, Я, which is derived from [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѧ[/tpl]), [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѥ[/tpl], [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ю[/tpl] (ligature of [tpl]script|Cyrs|I[/tpl] and [tpl]script|Cyrs|ОУ[/tpl]), [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѩ[/tpl], [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѭ[/tpl]. Many letters had variant forms and commonly used ligatures, for example [tpl]script|Cyrs|И[/tpl] = [tpl]script|Cyrs|І[/tpl] = [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ї[/tpl], [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѡ[/tpl] = [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѻ[/tpl], [tpl]script|Cyrs|ѠТ[/tpl] = [tpl]script|Cyrs|Ѿ[/tpl].
The letters also had numeric values, based not on Cyrillic alphabetical order, but inherited from the letters' Greek ancestors.
The early Cyrillic alphabet is difficult to represent on computers. Many of the letterforms differed from modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in manuscripts, and changed over time. Few fonts include adequate glyphs to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with Unicode policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or ligatures found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.
The Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern Church Slavonic language. In Microsoft Windows, Segoe UI is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.

==Letterforms and typography==

The development of Cyrillic typography passed directly from the medieval stage to the late Baroque, without a Renaissance phase as in Western Europe. Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many icon inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.
Peter the Great, Czar of Russia, mandated the use of westernized letter forms in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of serifs, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.
Cyrillic uppercase and lowercase letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially small capitals (with exceptions: Cyrillic [tpl]angle bracket|а[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|е[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|р[/tpl], and [tpl]angle bracket|у[/tpl] adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase [tpl]angle bracket|ф[/tpl] is typically designed under the influence of Latin [tpl]angle bracket|p[/tpl], lowercase [tpl]angle bracket|б[/tpl] is a traditional handwritten form), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.Bringhurst (2002) writes "in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,..." (p 32) and "in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps" (p 107).
Cyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have roman and italic types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words "roman" and "italic" in this sense.Name ital'yanskiy shrift (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family JPG, whereas rimskiy shrift (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet. Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:
As in Latin typography, a sans-serif face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (naklonniy shrift—"sloped", or "slanted type") instead of italic.
Similarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for hand-written or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic [tpl]angle bracket|т[/tpl] is the lowercase counterpart of [tpl]angle bracket|Т[/tpl] not of [tpl]angle bracket|М[/tpl].
A boldfaced type is called poluzhirniy shrift ("semi-bold type"), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century.
A bold italic combination (bold slanted) does not exist for all font families.
In Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian,Serbian Cyrillic Letters BE, GHE, DE, PE, TE, Janko Stamenovic (collection of selected commented answers received in Unicode mailing list (unicode@unicode.org) between 29.12.1999 and 17.01.2000). some italic and cursive letters are different from those used in other languages. These letter shapes are often used in upright fonts as well, especially for advertisements, road signs, inscriptions, posters and the like, less so in newspapers or books. The Cyrillic lowercase [tpl]angle bracket|б[/tpl] has a slightly different design both in the roman and italic types, which is similar to the lowercase Greek letter delta, [tpl]angle bracket|δ[/tpl].
The following table shows the differences between the upright and italic Cyrillic letters of the Russian alphabet. Italic forms significantly different from their upright analogues, or especially confusing to users of a Latin alphabet, are highlighted.
Note: in some fonts or styles lowercase italic Cyrillic [tpl]angle bracket|д[/tpl]  ([tpl]angle bracket|д[/tpl]) may look like Latin [tpl]angle bracket|g[/tpl] and lowercase italic Cyrillic [tpl]angle bracket|т[/tpl] ([tpl]angle bracket|т[/tpl]) may look exactly like a capital italic [tpl]angle bracket|T[/tpl] ([tpl]angle bracket|T[/tpl]), only small.
