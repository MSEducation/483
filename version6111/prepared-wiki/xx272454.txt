Redemption is a 1930 talking film directed by Fred Niblo, produced and distributed by MGM, and starring John Gilbert. Reportedly Lionel Barrymore filmed retakes in this picture. 
This film was actually Gilbert's first talking film but was released after the now infamous His Glorious Night, which garnered disastrous reviews. The film was based on a stage play, Redemption, adapted by Arthur Hopkins (who had seen the play in Europe) from the novel The Living Corpse by Leo Tolstoy. Hopkins produced the play in 1918 with the lead none other than John Barrymore in a winning and successful stage interpretation.The Barrymores by Hollis Alpert, c.1964 pgs. 178-179The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30 by The American Film Institute, c.1971Redemption as produced by Arthur Hopkins on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre October 3, 1918 to March 1919, also a 1928 revival at the Ambassador Theatre; IBDb.com
