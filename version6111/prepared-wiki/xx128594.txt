The Museum Abteiberg is a municipal museum for contemporary art in the German city Mönchengladbach.
Since the 1970s, the museum has been known for its experimental and avant-garde exhibitions, starting with director Johannes Cladders (1967-1985), and also its museum architecture, designed by Austrian architect Hans Hollein - a highpoint of postmodern design.
