==Transportation==

Nevada State Route 447 is the area's main highway and connects Gerlach to SR 427 at Wadsworth, Nevada, near Interstate 80.[tpl]cite web |date=January 2008 |title =Nevada State Maintained Highways: Descriptions, Index and Maps |publisher=Roadway Systems Division |url=http://www.nevadadot.com/reports_pubs/state_maintained/pdf/sm_book.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]  The desert's dirt roads are generally not usable in wet or snowy conditions.  Old Highway 34 provides access to the playa on the west side and to the Hualapai Flat. Old Highway 48 (dirt) connects the playa to Lovelock, and Old Highway 49 (Jungo Road, dirt) provides access to the lakebed from the Sulphur and Jungo ghost towns.
The Feather River Route uses the lakebed's east side between Sulphur and Gerlach.  Light aircraft have landed on the lakebed for events (the nearby Empire and Reno-Tahoe International Airports provide commercial service for the area).
