==History==

The Taíno people, the historic indigenous peoples who encountered European explorers and settlers, were the long time settlers in this area. The Spanish colonist Juan Ramírez de Arellano established Bayamón as a Spanish settlement on May 22, 1772. Two beliefs exist about the origin of name Bayamón.  According to one belief it was named after the local Taíno chief, Bahamon,. As per the other belief the name was derived from the Taíno word Bayamongo, which is a river that runs across this region. In turn implying that Bayamón is the area around this main river, which later on became the center of city's development.
In 1821, Marcos Xiorro, an ethnic African slave, planned to lead a revolt against the sugar plantation owners and the Spanish Colonial government in Puerto Rico. The slave conspiracy was revealed and suppressed, but Xiorro became a hero among the slaves. He is part of Puerto Rico's folklore. He was owned by Vicente Andino, a militia captain who owned a sugar plantation in Bayamón.Guillermo A.
