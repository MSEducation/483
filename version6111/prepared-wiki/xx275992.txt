==Racing career==

===1997: two-year-old season===

Embassy began her career as the odds-on favourite for a maiden race at Newmarket. Pat Eddery tracked the leaders on Embassy before sending her into the lead a furlong out and winning by one and a quarter lengths from a field that included the future May Hill Stakes winner Midnight Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=241215&r_date=1997-07-10&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Chippenham Lodge Maiden result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
Just over two weeks later, Embasssy was stepped up to Group Three level for the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot, for which she was made joint-favourite with Miss Zafonic. Embassy moved into the lead inside the last quarter mile and went clear to win by two lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=240807&r_date=1997-07-26&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Princess Margaret Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
For her next start Embassy was sent to York for the Group Two Lowther Stakes, in which she was matched against the Queen Mary Stakes winner Nadwah and the highly regarded Cape Verdi. Embassy took the lead, but drifted left inside the final furlong and was caught on the line and beaten a short head by Cape Verdi, who was receiving three pounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=240077&r_date=1997-08-21&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Lowther Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] Pat Eddery received some criticism from observers who felt that he had been too easy on Embassy in the closing stages.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-embassy-tipped-to-hold-cape-1242104.html |title=Embassy tipped to hold Cape |publisher=The Independent |date=1997-09-30 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
On her final start, Embassy met Cape Verdi again in the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket in which she was ridden by Kieren Fallon. Since the York race Cape Verdi had been bought by Godolphin, and she started the 11/8 favourite ahead of Embassy on 5/2. Fallon held his filly up in the early stages before bringing her up to challenge for the lead a furlong out. Embassy quickened well and pulled clear of the field to win by two and a half lengths from Crazee Mental, with Cape Verdi fourth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=240079&r_date=1997-09-30&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Cheveley Park Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] After the race Loder paid tribute to the filly's "tremendous acceleration" and the bookmakers made her 6/1 clear favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-embassy-raises-standard-1233353.html |title=Embassy raises standard  |publisher=The Independent |date=1997-10-01 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]

===1998: three-year-old season===

Embassy was transferred by Sheikh Mohammed to the Godolphin racing team and joined the stable of Saeed Bin Suroor. She spent the winter in Dubai and was returned to England the following spring. She was identified by Godolphin's racing manager, Simon Crisford as one of Godolphin's biggest hopes for 1998, despite a "minor scare" in training in March which required veterinary attention.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-embassy-heads-godolphin-team-1152730.html |title=Embassy heads Godolphin team |publisher=The Independent |date=1998-03-27 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] A disappointing performance in a private Godolphin trial in April saw her supplanted by Cape Verdi at the head of the betting for the Guineas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-cape-overshadows-embassy-in-desert-1156068.html |title=Cape overshadows Embassy in desert|publisher=The Independent |date=1998-04-13 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] Embassy was still expected to run in the 1000 Guineas, but a few days before the event it was announced that she had not made the expected progress and would miss the race.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-godolphin-delegation-drops-embassy-1161899.html |title=Godolphin delegation drops Embassy|publisher=The Independent |date=1998-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
