==History==

The museum is housed in the former city hall of Elberfeld, which in 1902 became a municipal museum.
The museum was named in 1961 after the Von der Heydt family. Banker August von der Heydt (1851–1929) and his son Eduard von der Heydt (1882–1964) were important patrons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vdh.netgate1.net/About_us.html|title=About us|accessdate=22 Mar 2012[/tpl]
