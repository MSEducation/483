Joanot Martorell ([tpl]IPA-ca|dʒuaˈnɔd maɾtoˈɾeʎ|va[/tpl]) (Gandia, south of Valencia, 1413 – 1468) was a Valencian knight and the author of the novel Tirant lo Blanch, which is written in Valencian (Martorell calls it "the Valencian popular" "vulgar llengua valenciana" spoken in the Kingdom of Valencia). Miguel de Cervantes praised the mellifluous beauty of both Valencian and Portuguese. First published in Valencia in 1490, some consider it the first modern novel in Europe. 
It deals with the adventures of a knight in the Byzantine Empire with echoes of the real-life Catalan Company. Miguel de Cervantes in the book burning scene of Don Quixote considers it the best chivalry novel. Martorell was a chivalrous man and suffered an early death due to court intrigue, leading to a colleague, Martí Joan de Galba, finishing the novel.
