[[55]]

CATEGORIES: 55

Year 55 (LV) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vetus (or, less frequently, year 808 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 55 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. It is also the sum of consecutive numbers from 1 to 10.
