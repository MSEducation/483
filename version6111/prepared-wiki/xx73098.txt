==Background==

The orchestra has promoted Hong Kong-based composers by commissioning and premiering numerous works of contemporary music, including the recent five-work cycle of Voices of Hong Kong, by John Chen, David Gwilt, Daniel Law, Law Ping-leung and Richard Tsang.
In February 1986, the HKPO made its debut tour of several cities in the People's Republic of China, with conductor Kenneth Schermerhorn and soloists Stephanie Chase (violin) and Li Jian (piano). In the autumn of 1995, the HKPO travelled to 9 cities in the United States and Canada in its North American début. In 2003, the orchestra made its European début with performances in London's Barbican Hall, Belfast, Dublin and Paris (Théâtre des Champs-Élysées).
Edo de Waart was the orchestra's Artistic Director and Chief Conductor, beginning with the 2004/2005 season, and he concluded his HKPO tenure after the 2011/2012 season.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.hkpo.com/eng/press_room/press_releases/2010/20100310.jsp | title=Edo de Waart steps down as Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra after 2011/12 Season | publisher=Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra | date=10 March 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-18[/tpl] Past Music Directors include David Atherton, who was the Conductor Laureate of the orchestra from 2000 to 2009.David Atherton did not appear again in the programme notes as Conductor Laureate of the opening concert of the 2009/10 season. http://download.hkpo.com/files/concert/hse_prog/20090904&05_Deborah_Voigt.pdf In January 2012, the HKPO announced the appointment of Jaap van Zweden as its next Music Director, as of the 2012/2013 season, with contract renewed in 2014 to 2019.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.hkpo.com/eng/press/press_releases/2012/20120116.jsp | title=HKPO Welcomes New Music Director – Maestro Jaap van Zweden Takes the Helm from Season 2012/13 | publisher=Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra | date=16 January 2012 | accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl]
