The North Hertfordshire League was a football competition based in England. It had two divisions including the North Hertfordshire League Premier Division, which sat at level 13 of the English football league system and was a feeder to the Hertfordshire Senior County League.
In the 2005/06 season, St Ippolyts were the Premier Division champions and Baldock Reserves were the winners of the first division.  In the summer of 2006 the league merged with the Mid-Herts Football League to form the new North & Mid-Herts Football League. http://football.mitoo.co.uk/ShowNews.cfm?LeagueCode=NMHL2006&SeasonName=2006-2007%20Season&LeagueName=North%20%26%20Mid%20Herts%20Football%20League
