Ala Moana Beach Park  is a free public park on the island of Oahu, U.S. state of Hawaii, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. This [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] park has a wide gold-sand beach that is over a half-mile (800 m) long. It is man-made and was created by the owner of the Dillingham Dredging Company, who was looking for a place to dispose of his dredged earth. So in the 1950s, sand was dumped at this park, which created the beach.
The water is almost always calm because the beach is protected by an outer reef. This makes it a good spot for long-distance swimmers and small children. There is a [tpl]convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep[/tpl] swimming channel and a former boat channel that was dredged out of the reef.
Ala Moana's ocean bottom drops quickly, so novice swimmers should use caution. Big grassy areas, banyans and palm trees make the park a good place to picnic, barbecue, play all kinds of ball games or go running. There are lifeguards, showers, restrooms, phones, tennis courts, picnic tables, food concessions and a music pavilion. Ala Moana Beach Park is a favorite among Honolulu residents. On the weekends, they come here with their whole ohana (family) to picnic, swim and spend time together.  It is right next to "Magic Island" where many cultural events are held.
