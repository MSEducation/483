FCSRs have been used in the design of stream ciphers (such as the F-FCSR generator), in the cryptanalyis of the summation combiner stream cipher (the reason Goresky and Klapper invented them), and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi-Monte Carlo (under the name Multiply With Carry (MWC) generator - invented by Couture and L'Ecuyer,) generalizing work of Marsaglia and Zaman.G.

l-sequences have many excellent statistical properties that make them candidates for use in applications,B. Schneier, Applied Cryptography. John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996 including near uniform distribution of sub-blocks, ideal arithmetic autocorrelations, and the arithmetic shift and add property.  They are the with-carry analog of m-sequences or maximum length sequences.
FCSRs and LFSRs are special cases of a very general algebraic construction of sequence generators called Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers (AFSRs) in which the integers are replaced by an arbitrary ring R and N is replaced by an arbitrary non-unit in R.A.
