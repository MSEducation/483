The long coast of the Gulf of Thailand has many sandy beaches, the most famous one being at Hua Hin, which has been a popular resort since King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) built a summer palace there. From the coast the land quickly rises into the Tanaosi Range, the mountain chain that forms the border with Myanmar, the highest elevation in the province being the 1494-metre-high Khao Luang. Due to this narrow watershed the rivers in the province are all small; the only bigger one is the Pran Buri River in the north of the province. Among the smaller rivers is the Khlong Kui.Geography of Thailand
Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park was established in 1966 to protect Thailand's largest freshwater marshes. The park contains some mangrove woods and mudflats. Most of the marshes were converted into shrimp farms, despite being in a national park.

==History==

The city of Muang Na Rang was reconstructed in 1845, after it had been abandoned during the fall of the Ayutthaya kingdom in 1767. The town was rebuilt at the mouth of the Ron River and renamed Prachuap Khiri Khan, which means the city in the mountains.
King Mongkut gathered the people of 3 towns—Bang Nangrom, Kui Buri and Khlong Wan—and had them settle the rebuilt city. At the same time, he renamed Koh Kong, a city on the opposite side of Gulf of Thailand, Prachanta Khiri Khet. Koh Kong is a now a province of Cambodia.
In 1868, King Mongkut invited foreign guests to watch a solar eclipse on September 18. He had predicted the event by himself, but the chosen observation point was at the marshes near Sam Roi Yot. He contracted malaria, which killed him just two weeks later.
Prachuap became a seaside resort during the reign of King Rama V. In the reign of King Rama II, a new city was established at the mouth of the I Rom Canal known as Muang Bang Nang Rom. 
At the beginning of World War II, Japanese troops invaded Thailand. On December 8, 1941, they struck first near the city of Prachuap Khiri Khan. After fighting valiantly in battle, the defenders were ordered to ceasefire by the government in Bangkok and decision to allied with Japan until the end of World War II.
