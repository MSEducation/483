Suffolk County Transit is the provider of bus services in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island in the United States and is an agency of the Suffolk County government. It was founded in 1980 as a county-run oversight and funding agency for a group of private contract operators which had previously provided such services on their own. While the physical maintenance and operation of the buses are provided by these providers, other matters ranging from bus purchases to route and schedule planning to fare rules are set by Suffolk Transit itself.
Though serving the entirety of Suffolk County, the one exception is in Huntington, located in the northwestern part of the county, where that town's private operator declined to join Suffolk Transit. Instead, Huntington took over that town's system which became Huntington Area Rapid Transit, or HART. Most of HART's routes do connect to both Suffolk Transit and Nassau Inter-County Express and one can transfer between HART and Suffolk Transit fairly easily.http://town.huntington.ny.us/department_details.cfm?ID=37 In addition, the village of Patchogue has its own local bus service.transportation

These transfers are valid for two hours after issue and can be used on Suffolk County Transit connecting routes, or to Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) connecting routes with a special transfer request slip (transfers to NICE require payment of a "step-up" fare).http://www.sct-bus.org/fares.html

==Routes==

Main routes are prefixed with a "S" to signify "Suffolk County" to fall in line with other nomenclature used by the MTA. Nonetheless the agency has no ties to the MTA, and in fact the "S" prefix is already  used for Staten Island routes. Feeder routes do not have the "S" prefix, however they have various letter suffixes.

==Suffolk County Accessible Transportation==

Suffolk County Accessible Transportation (SCAT) is Suffolk Transit's federally mandated paratransit service for ADA-eligible passengers with disabilities. SCAT service is available Monday through Friday, 6:00 AM to 8:30 PM and Saturday, 7:00 AM to 8:30 PM. The fare is $3.00.SCAT - Suffolk County Accessible Transportation.

==Future==

During his tenure as Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy proposed a takeover of Suffolk County Transit by the MTA.http://libn.com/politbureau/2009/05/17/mr-levy-heads-to-albany Mr. Levy Heads to Albany  In 2010 Suffolk Transit had ordered 81 Orion VII clean Diesel buses.http://www.dcbusna.com/dbusna/0-866-621715-1-1266199-1-0-0-0-0-1-10578-575577-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Daimler Buses North America Receives Orders for 92 Orion VII Transit Buses from New York State Agencies to replace all of their 1996 Gillig 35TB102 and 1997 Gillig 30TB96, as well as most of their 1999 Orion 05.503's.
In 2011 the Suffolk County Legislature authorized a fare hike from $1.50 to $2.00 on the S92 and 10C routes only. In return, service on those two routes was expanded to Sunday during the summer months. The fare hike took place on June 17, 2011, with Sunday service operating from July until September.[tpl]cite news|url=http://riverheadnewsreview.timesreview.com/2011/03/10856/sunday-bus-services-could-be-coming-to-the-east-end/|title=Officials rally Friday to bring Sunday buses to the East End|newspaper=Riverhead News-Review|first=Tim|last=Gannon|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://legis.suffolkcountyny.gov/Resos2010/i2092-10.pdf|title=Resolution No. 1238-2010|publisher=Suffolk County Legislator|date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2011|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Bus route assignments==

Rather than operate its services in-house like most transit agencies, Suffolk County Transit contracts all their routes to private contractors. The table below lists the private contractors hired to provide fixed-route services.  It does not include Suffolk County Accessible Transportation paratransit service.
Note: Twin Forks Transit is a joint venture of Hampton Jitney and Sunrise Coach Lines.

==Fleet==

Suffolk County Transit Bus Operations employs many makes and models of buses between 30 and 41 feet in length, and between 96 and 102 inches in width. This table shows all models currently used in revenue service by any contractor. Suffolk County Accessible Transportation paratransit service is not shown.

==Retired fleet==

All retired buses prior to 1981 were brought either secondhand by Suffolk County or the bus companies that operated for the county or brought by the operators and then by Suffolk County when they took over bus operations in 1980–1981. Some buses were renumbered after entering service; all fleet numbers listed are the numbers the buses were when they entered service.
