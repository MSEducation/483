The Miles M.100 Student was built as a lightweight trainer as a private venture by F.G. and George Miles with development started in 1953. Although not specifically a Miles product, it was promoted as a Royal Air Force trainer but failed to enter production.

==Design and development==

Building on the company's experience with the M.77 "Sparrowjet", the M.100 Student was a two-seat, side-by-side, all-metal jet trainer. The M.100 prototype was powered by a 400 kgf (882 lb) thrust Turbomeca Marbore turbojet and flew for the first time on 15 May 1957. Miles had hoped to secure an RAF order, but the contract went to the Jet Provost.  The Student was subsequently proposed for several training programmes, but without success.
G-APLK, the sole aircraft, was allocated XS941 when developed in the Mark 2 version as a prospective Counter-insurgency type. It was tested by the Royal Air Force but was not accepted. Therefore, in its M.100 Student 2 guise, it also did not go into production.
The M.100 Student 2 with registration G-MIOO is presently under restoration at the Museum of Berkshire Aviation where the airframe is displayed in a cutaway.
The Centurion 3, 4 and 5 were planned variants  with the RB.108, Gourdon and Arbizon engines respectively.Flight 30 August 1957 p316Flight 30 August 1957 p369
