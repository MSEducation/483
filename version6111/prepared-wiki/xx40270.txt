===Early career===

Jay-Z can briefly be heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including "The Originators" and "Hawaiian Sophie".Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. xi.

Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 316. although Kane explains that he didn't fill the traditional hype man role, instead "basically making cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unkut.com/2007/09/big-daddy-kane-the-unkut-interview/ |title=Big Daddy Kane – The Unkut Interview | unkut.com – A Tribute To Ignorance (Remix) |publisher=unkut.com |accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=131&csid2=946&fid1=37423 |title=Exclaim!

==Music career==

===1995–97: Reasonable Doubt and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1===

With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold his CDs out of his car and, with Damon Dash and Kareem Biggs, created Roc-A-Fella Records as their own independent label in 1995. After striking a deal with Priority to distribute his material, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G.. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics. This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" as No.248 and eventually reach platinum status.[tpl]cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=JAY-Z&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=100|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum|accessdate=August 22, 2009|publisher=RIAA[/tpl]
After reaching a new distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Executively produced by Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, it sold better than his previous effort. Jay-Z later explained that the album was made during one of the worst periods of his life, he was reeling from the death of his close friend The Notorious B.I.G. The album was a personal revelation for Jay-Z as he spun the tale of his hard knock upbringing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_60/82_jay_z.html |title=Jay-Z – |publisher=Askmen.com |date=December 4, 1969 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl] The album's glossy production stood as a contrast to his first release, and some dedicated fans felt he had "sold out". However, the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on Reasonable Doubt, namely DJ Premier and Ski. Like its predecessor, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 earned Platinum status in the United States.

===1998–2000: Vol. 2..., criminal charges and mainstream success===

In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland. Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included "Can I Get A...", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and "Nigga What, Nigga Who", also featuring Amil. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies. The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452653/20020227/jay_z.jhtml|title=Where's The Love?

In 1999, Jay-Z dueted with Mariah Carey on "Heartbreaker", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies. Vol. 3's most successful single was "Big Pimpin'", featuring UGK.
On December 1 of that year, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance "Un" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed Rivera at the release party for Q-Tip's album Amplified at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City. Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover when he supposedly stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade.Handlin, Sam.

Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded:
 One night I went to Q-Tip’s solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone’s been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, “No the fuck this nigga did not…” I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted.
 There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control…I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.[tpl]cite book|author=Jay-Z|title=Decoded|url=[tpl]Google books|l2i0F2kSwwUC|Decoded|page=162|plainurl=yes[/tpl]|page=162|year=2010|publisher=Spiegel & Grau[/tpl]

In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but somehow turned into a Jay-Z album.[tpl]cite news |first=Steve |last=Jones |title=Jay-Z's rap dominates |newspaper=USA Today |publisher=Gannett Company, Inc. |date=November 7, 2000 [/tpl] The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.

===2001–02: Feud with Nas, The Blueprint and The Blueprint2===

In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from "Money, Cash, Hoes" that he felt were subliminal shots at Mobb Deep and referenced Mobb Deep's beef with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song "Takeover", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451428/20011211/mobb_deep.jhtml|title=Mobb Deep Strike Back At Jay-Z On Infamy|accessdate=August 14, 2009|date=December 12, 2001|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|publisher=MTV[/tpl] A line at the end of "Takeover" referenced Nas, who criticized him on "We Will Survive".[tpl]cite web|first=Selwyn Seyfu |last=Hinds |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0203,hinds,31529,22.html |title=Kings of New York  |work=The Village Voice |date=January 15, 2002 |accessdate=September 4, 2010[/tpl] Nas responded with a diss track called "Ether" and almost instantly, Jay-Z added a verse to "Takeover" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. Jay-Z later released his sixth studio album The Blueprint which was later considered by many to be one of hip hop's "classic" albums, receiving the coveted 5 mic review from The Source magazine. Released during the wake of September 11 attacks, the album managed to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, selling more than 427,000 units;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78363/jay-z-draws-blueprint-for-chart-dominance|title=Jay-Z Draws 'Blueprint' For Chart Dominance |last=Martens |first=Todd |date=September 20, 2001|work=Billboard |accessdate=November 12, 2008[/tpl] the album's success was overshadowed by the tragic event. The Blueprint has been certified 2x Platinum in the United States. The Blueprint was applauded for its production and the balance of "mainstream" and "hardcore" rap, receiving recognition from both audiences. The Blueprint was written in only two days.Recounted by Jay-Z on the documentary Collision Course . Collision Course. Jay-Z and Linkin Park. Roc-A-Fella/Warner Bros./Machine Shop Recordings. 2004.

The Blueprint includes the popular songs "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)", "Girls, Girls, Girls", "Jigga That Nigga" and "Song Cry".
Jay-Z's next solo album was 2002's The Blueprint2: The Gift & the Curse, a double-album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units in the U.S. alone and surpassing The Blueprint.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73389/jay-z-scores-5th-chart-topper-with-blueprint|title=Jay-Z Scores 5th Chart-Topper With 'Blueprint'|last=Martens|first=Todd |date=November 20, 2002 |work=Billboard |accessdate=November 12, 2008[/tpl] It was later reissued in a single-disc version, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the tracks from the original. The album spawned two massive hit singles, "Excuse Me Miss" and "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", which featured Jay-Z's future wife Beyoncé. "Guns & Roses", a track featuring rock musician Lenny Kravitz, and "Hovi Baby" were two successful radio singles as well. The album also contained the tracks "A Dream", featuring Faith Evans and the late The Notorious B.I.G.; and "The Bounce", featuring Kanye West.

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans.

One of the more outspoken critics of his selection was Noel Gallagher of Oasis fame, who criticized the organizers of the festival for scheduling Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival, stating "I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury.

Controversy ensued in the months leading up to the event with artists, promoters and fans weighing in both for and against. Jay-Z responded to this saying, "We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression.

==Musical style==

===Influences===

Jay-Z that states his earliest exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says "I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1619380/20090824/jay_z.jhtml |title=A Young Jay-Z Describes His Early Influences |last=Anderson |first=Kyle |publisher=MTV News |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2010[/tpl] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West-productions included on The Blueprint.
