"But Seriously, Folks..." is the fourth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1978 (see 1978 in music). It included the satirical song "Life's Been Good". The original eight-minute album version of this track was edited down to 4½ minutes for single release and this became Walsh's biggest solo hit, peaking at #12 on the Billboard chart.
The album also features the other four members of the Eagles—which Walsh had joined two years earlier—as well as singer-keyboardist Jay Ferguson, a former member of the groups Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne (who co-wrote one track on the album), drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh's former band Barnstorm, and bassist Willie Weeks.
Original pressings of this record had text engraved on the carry-out grooves:
The leadout track after "Life's Been Good" has a recording of "A flock of wah-wahs" which is a minute of gibberish wah-wahs.
Walsh ran a mock campaign for President in 1980; one of the planks of his platform was to make "Life's Been Good" the new national anthem.

==Reception==

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote that, although Walsh has "a gift for tuneful guitar schlock", most of the album's songs fall "far short of the irreverent shuck-and-jive" of "Life's Been Good". In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Al Campbell said that the album is "Joe Walsh's most insightful and melodic", and "captures a reflective song cycle along the same thematic lines of Pet Sounds, only for the '70s".
