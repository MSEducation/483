CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Goncha Siso Enese is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Part of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Goncha Siso Enese is bordered on the south by Enarj Enawga, on the west by Hulet Ej Enese, on the north by the Abay River which separates it from the Debub Gondar Zone, and on the east by Enbise Sar Midir. The major town in Goncha Siso Enese is Gindo Weyin.
Rivers in this woreda include the Tammi, a tributary of the Abay.
In 2002, Goncha Siso Enese was judged to be one of four chronically food insecure woredas in this part of the Amhara Region, due to much of their farmland being "extremely depleted, deforested and eroded".Hugo RÃ¤mi, "Fewer surpluses in Gojam and Awi and Severe shortages in lowland areas of Abaye River Gorge", UN-OCHA Assessment Mission, October 2002 (accessed 23 April 2009)
