==Release==

"Baby Blue" was released as a single in the US on March 6, 1972, in a blue-tinted picture sleeve and featuring a new mix. Because Al Steckler, the head of Apple US, felt that it needed a stronger hook in the opening, he remixed the track with engineer Eddie Kramer in February 1972, applying heavy reverb to the snare during the first verse and middle eight. It would become the group's last Top 20 single, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.
However, the chaos that was enveloping the Apple UK operation at the time was strongly evident with regard to this song. While Apple US gave the song a picture sleeve and a remix to ensure that it was a hit, Apple UK remained unaware of its commercial potential. Although the single was even assigned a release number for the UK (Apple 42), "Baby Blue" was never actually released as a UK single.
Despite Badfinger's four top-20 Apple singles, Badfinger would only release one more single on Apple Records, "Apple of My Eye" in December 1973.
