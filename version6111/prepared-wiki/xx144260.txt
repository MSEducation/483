==Music video==

The music video is particularly noteworthy for its use of stop animation. The film was produced with heavy use of digital editing techniques and CGI. Some of these examples include rotoscoped patterns in the grass and the continuity of the sky and clouds between the frames. At many points CGI is used to enhance the landscape to a fantasy-like level, and by the end of the film the landscape is completely replaced by abstract blobs and cubes.
