Theodore Roosevelt High School is an educational institution of seven high schools (grades 9-12) located in the  Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles, California named for the 26th president of the United States.
Roosevelt is a public school in the Los Angeles Unified School District with an enrollment of 5,047 in 2007, making it one of the largest in the country, and second largest behind Belmont High School at the time. Up until the 2008-09 school year, the school followed a year-round calendar. In 2008, the school started to be managed by the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, which was started by Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. In 2010, the cohesive institution was split up into seven small schools, each with its own principal, CEEB code (used by SAT, colleges, etc.), students and staff. The outcomes of this have been debated by students and administrators.http://www.boyleheightsbeat.com/reform-at-roosevelt-verdict-is-still-out-674http://www.boyleheightsbeat.com/roosevelt-high-school-directed-to-restructure-current-system-2023

==History==

Roosevelt was founded in 1922, but opened in 1923 in Boyle Heights to the east of the Los Angeles River.
During World War II the Japanese were removed to internment camps. Many returned after the war. A Japanese garden that had been destroyed was restored in 1996 with funds raised by alumni and students.
As the population grew in the area, Roosevelt sought expansion.[tpl]when|date=July 2012[/tpl] The R-Building (R for Roosevelt) was the main building and faced Fickett Street. The street was vacated and a new administration (A-Building for administration) was constructed. Many new buildings were created and added to campus.  The R-building  has an interesting history and distinct architecture. There was a fourth floor to the building which had to be closed due to damage from  a fire. The basement was built with a shooting range for the Junior ROTC (JROTC), although only air rifles may be used now.
Roosevelt was one of the five schools to initiate the student walkouts in 1968, and contributed to the walkouts in 2006, in protest to the HR 4437 bill.  Roosevelt also has been recently[tpl]when|date=July 2012[/tpl] criticized http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/06/05/LAUSD-Planned-Parenthood for opening a Planned Parenthood clinic on campus grounds.
In 2009 the opening of the Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez Learning Centers helped to expand Roosevelt."2. Proposed Changes to Lincoln High School Area Schools, School Year 2009-2010." Los Angeles Unified School District. Retrieved on March 17, 2010.
