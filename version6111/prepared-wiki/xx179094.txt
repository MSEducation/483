==Coat of Arms==

The gmina was named Jednorożec (meaning “unicorn”) based on the local legend of a beekeeper who saw a unicorn in the area which was, at the time, a royal hunting preserve. According to the legend, Prince Janusz III Mazowiecki ordered the building of a hunting lodge on the spot, which he named Jednorożec (unicorn).http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pl&u=http://www.jednorozec.pl/&ei=NQrcTKrKKcX_lgf4lMHTCQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFkQ7gEwCQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3DJednoro%25C5%25BCec%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ACEW_enUS373US373%26prmd%3Div
The coat of arms and the municipal flag consists of a unicorn,  a mythical beast symbolizing wisdom, intelligence, courage, speed, nobility, and peace,  accompanied by two bees. The unicorn is shown in the position of a Polish “battle” horse. The color green symbolizes the area’s forested Kurpie past, as well as the current  “green” values of the local inhabitants, and the green color also refers to the area as part of what was once “Poland’s Green Lungs.”http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pl&u=http://www.jednorozec.pl/&ei=NQrcTKrKKcX_lgf4lMHTCQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFkQ7gEwCQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3DJednoro%25C5%25BCec%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ACEW_enUS373US373%26prmd%3Div
