Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic volcanic island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at [tpl]coord|54|25.8|S|3|22.8|E|type:isle_region:BV|display=inline,title[/tpl]. It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately [tpl]convert|2200|km[/tpl] south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately [tpl]convert|1700|km[/tpl] north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.
The island has an area of [tpl]convert|49|km2|sp=eu[/tpl], of which 93 percent is covered by a glacier. The centre of the island is an ice-filled crater of an inactive volcano. Some skerries and one smaller island, Larsøya, lie along the coast. Nyrøysa, created by a rock slide in the late 1950s, is the only easy place to land and is the location of a weather station.
The island was first spotted on January 1, 1739, by (and was later named for) Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier. He recorded inaccurate coordinates and the island was not sighted again until 1808, when the British whaler captain James Lindsay named it Lindsay Island.http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=James+Lindsay+Bouvet&source=bl&ots=hcE3ANBtqd&sig=TQN5iHGaChzt-Nul5bB8zPpF3F0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gkneUJ7-EqSx0QXx-IHgCg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg The first claim of landing, although disputed, was by Benjamin Morrell. In 1825, the island was claimed for the British Crown by George Norris, who named it Liverpool Island. He also reported Thompson Island as nearby, although this was later shown to be a phantom island. The first Norvegia expedition landed on the island in 1927 and claimed it for Norway. After a dispute with the United Kingdom, it was declared a Norwegian dependency in 1930. It became a nature reserve in 1971.

==History==

===Discovery and early sightings===

The island was discovered on 1 January 1739 by Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, commander of the French ships Aigle and Marie.Mills (2003): 96 This was the first time that land had been spotted south of the 50th parallel south. Bouvet, who was searching for a presumed large southern continent, spotted the island through the fog and named the cape he saw Cap de la Circoncision. He was not able to land and did not circumnavigate his discovery, thus not clarifying if it was an island or part of a continent.Barr (1987): 62 His plotting of its position was inaccurateMill (1905): 47 leading several expeditions to fail to find the island again.Barr (1987): 58 James Cook's second voyage set off from Cape Verde on November 22, 1772 to find Cape Circoncision, but was unable to find the cape.Hough (1994): 248
The next expedition to spot the island was in 1808 by James Lindsay, captain of the Samuel Enderby & Sons' (SE&S) whaler Snow Swan.Burney (1817): 35 They reached the island and recorded its position, though they were unable to land.Mills (2003): 434–35McGonigal (2003): 135 Lindsay could confirm that the "cape" was indeed an island. The next expedition to arrive at the island was American Benjamin Morrell and his seal hunting ship Wasp. Morrell, by his own account, found the island without difficulty (with "improbable ease", in the words of historian William Mills) before landing and hunting 196 seals. In his subsequent lengthy description, Morrell does not mention the island's most obvious physical feature, its permanent ice cover.Mill (1905): 106–107 This has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited the island.Simpson-Housley (1992): 60
On 10 December 1825, SE&S's George Norris, master of the Sprightly, landed on the island, named it Liverpool Island and claimed it for the British Crown and George IV on 16 December.Barr (1987): 63 The next expedition to spot the island was Joseph Fuller and his ship Francis Allyn in 1893, but he was not able to land on the island. German Carl Chun's Valdivia expedition arrived at the island in 1898. They were not able to land, but dredged the seabed for geological samples.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/documents/bas_bulletins/bulletin13_06.pdf | title=Historical and Geological Notes on Bouvetøya | author=P.

Norris also spotted a second island in 1825, which he named Thompson Island, which he placed [tpl]convert|72|km|sp=eu[/tpl] north-northeast of Liverpool Island. Thompson Island was also reported in 1893 by Fuller, but in 1898 Chun did not report seeing such an island, nor has anyone since. However, Thompson Island continued to appear on maps as late as 1943.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.2307/1789367 |title= Review: A New Chart of the Antarctic | author=A. R. H. and N. A.

===Norwegian annexation===

In 1927, the First Norvegia Expedition[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]led by Harald Horntvedt and financed by Lars Christensen[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]was the first to make an extended stay on the island. Observations and surveying were conducted on the islands and oceanographic measurements performed in the sea around it. At Ny Sandefjord, a small hut was erected and, on 1 December, the Norwegian flag was hoisted and the island claimed for Norway. The annexation was established by a royal decree on 23 January 1928. The claim was initially protested by the United Kingdom, on the basis of Norris' landing and annexation. However, the British position was weakened by Norris' sighting of two islands and the uncertainty as to whether he had been on Thompson or Liverpool (i.e. Bouvet) Island. Norris' positioning deviating from the correct location combined with the island's lack of a natural harbour and small size made the UK accept the Norwegian claim.Kyvik (2008): 52 This resulted in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and in November 1929, Britain renounced its claim to the island.
The Second Norvegia Expedition arrived in 1928 with the intent of establishing a manned meteorological radio station, but a suitable location could not be found. By then both the flagpole and hut from the previous year had been washed away. The Third Norvegia Expedition, led by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, arrived the following year and built a new hut at Kapp Circoncision and on Larsøya. The expedition carried out aerial photography of the island and was the first Antarctic expedition to use aircraft.Barr (1987): 64 The Dependency Act, passed by the Parliament of Norway on February 27, 1930, established Bouvet Island as a dependency, along with Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land.[tpl]Cite web|title=Lov om Bouvet-øya, Peter I's øy og Dronning Maud Land m.m.

Since the 1970s, the island has been frequently visited by Norwegian Antarctic expeditions. In 1977, an automated weather station was constructed, and for two months in 1978 and 1979 a manned weather station was operated. The Vela Incident took place on 22 September 1979 in the sea between Bouvetøya and Prince Edward Islands when the American Vela Hotel satellite registered an unexplained double flash, variously interpreted as a nuclear test, meteor, or instrumentation glitch.Hersh (1991): 271Rhodes (2011): 164–169[tpl]cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Leonard |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/23198/Weiss_IsraelNuclearTest.pdf |title=Israel’s 1979 Nuclear Test and the U.S. Cover-Up |journal=Middle East Policy |year=2011 |volume=18 |issue=4[/tpl]
In March 1985, a Norwegian expedition experienced sufficiently clear weather to allow the entire island to be photographed from the air, resulting in the first accurate map of the whole island, 247 years after its discovery.Barr (1987): 59 In the mid-1980s, Bouvetøya, Jan Mayen, and Svalbard were considered as locations for the new Norwegian International Ship Register, but the flag of convenience registry was ultimately established in Bergen, Norway in 1987.Kyvik (2008): 189 Several amateur radio DX-peditions have been conducted to the island.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/4073/ftr_cty.html |title=Bouvet Island 1990 |date=19 December 2007 |publisher=NØHR |accessdate=12 January 2008 |archivedate=12 January 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112115930/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/4073/ftr_cty.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.n0hr.com/hamradio_blog/2007/12/19/dxpedition-to-bouvet3y0e// |title=DXpedition to Bouvet/3Y0E |date=19 December 2007 |publisher=NØHR |accessdate=9 May 2012 |archivedate=9 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67WzjUcD5 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The Norwegian Polar Institute established a [tpl]convert|36|m2|sqft|adj=on|sp=eu[/tpl] research station, made of shipping containers, at Nyrøysa in 1996.

It is a triple junction between the South American Plate, the African Plate and the Antarctic Plate, and of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Southwest Indian Ridge and the American–Antarctic Ridge.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Neil C. |last2=Livermore |first2=Roy A. |last3=Fabretti |first3=Paola |last4=Carrara |first4=Gabriela |year=2000 |title=The Bouvet triple junction, 20 to 10 Ma, and extensive transtensional deformation adjacent to the Bouvet and Conrad transforms |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=105 |issue=B4 |pages=8279–8296 |publisher= |doi=  10.1029/1999JB900399|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/neil.mitchell/pubs/2000JGRBouvet.pdf |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archivedate=11 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67aA83KA8 |deadurl=no|bibcode = 2000JGR...105.8279M [/tpl]

==Climate==

The island is located south of the Antarctic Convergence, giving it a marine Antarctic climate dominated by heavy clouds and fog. It experiences a mean temperature of [tpl]convert|−1|C[/tpl], with January average of [tpl]convert|1|C[/tpl] and September average of [tpl]convert|−3|C[/tpl]. The monthly high mean temperatures fluctuate little through the year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/bouvet-island/celsius/bouvet-island.htm | title= Monthly Averages for Bouvet Island | publisher=Climate Zone | accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] The peak temperature of [tpl]convert|14|C[/tpl] was recorded in March 1980, caused by intense sun radiation. Spot temperatures as high as [tpl]convert|20|C[/tpl] have been recorded in sunny weather on rock faces. The island predominantly experiences a weak west wind.

==Nature==

The harsh climate and ice-bound terrain limits vegetation to fungi (ascomycetes including lichens) and non-vascular plants (mosses and liverworts). The flora is representative for the maritime Antarctic and is phytogeographically similar to the South Sandwich Islands and South Shetland Islands. Vegetation is limited because of the ice cover, although snow algae are recorded. The remaining vegetation is located in snow-free areas such as nunatak ridges and other parts of the summit plateau, the coastal cliffs, capes and beaches. At Nyrøysa, five species of moss, six ascomycetes (including five lichens), and twenty algae have been recorded. Most snow-free areas are so steep and subject to frequent avalanches that only crustose lichens and algal formations are sustainable. There are six endemic ascomycetes, three of which are lichenized.
The island has been designated as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding ground for seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of Macaroni Penguin and, to a lesser extent, Chinstrap Penguin and Adélie Penguin , although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern Fulmar is by far the most common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape Petrel, Antarctic Prion, Wilson's Storm Petrel, Black-bellied Storm Petrel , Subantarctic Skua , Southern Giant Petrel , Snow Petrel, Slender-billed Prion  and Antarctic Tern . Kelp Gull  is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the King Penguin, Wandering Albatross, Black-browed Albatross, Campbell Albatross, Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross, Sooty Albatross, Light-mantled Albatross, Northern Giant Petrel, Antarctic Petrel, Blue Petrel, Soft-plumaged Petrel, Short-billed Minivet, White-headed Petrel, Fairy Prion, White-chinned Petrel, Great Shearwater, Common Diving Petrel, South Polar Skua and Parasitic Jaeger.
The only non-bird vertebrates on the island are seals, specifically the Southern Elephant Seal and Antarctic Fur Seal, which both breed on the island. In 1998–99, there were 88 Elephant Seal pups and 13,000 Fur Seal pups at Nyrøysa. Humpback whale and killer whale are seen in the surrounding waters.

==Politics and government==

Bouvetøya is one of three dependencies of Norway.Gisle (1999): 38 Unlike Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land, which are subject to the Antarctic Treaty System,Barr (1987): 65 Bouvetøya is not disputed. The dependency status entails that the island is not part of the Kingdom of Norway, but is still under Norwegian sovereignty. Specifically, this implies that the island can be ceded without violating the first article of the Constitution of Norway. Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, located in Oslo.[tpl]Cite web|title=Polar Affairs Department|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/About-the-Ministry-of-Justice-and-the-Po/Organization/Departments/The-Polar-Affairs-Department.html?id=1447|publisher=Norwegian Ministry of the Environment|accessdate=29 August 2011|archivedate=29 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61Ime20Bt[/tpl]
The annexation of the island is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933. It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the island, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on the island. It further establishes that all land belongs to the state, and prohibits the storage and detonation of nuclear products.
