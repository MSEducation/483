Germanske SS Norge (GSSN) was a military organization established in Norway in July 1942. GSSN was at the same time a Norwegian branch of Germanic-SS, and a sub organization of Quisling's Nasjonal Samling. Leader of the organization was Jonas Lie, and second-in-command was Sverre Riisnæs. The number of members reached a maximum of about 1,300 in 1944. A large part of the members were recruited from the police, and about fifty percent served at the Eastern Front.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Sørensen |first=Øystein | encyclopedia=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940–1945 |title=Germanske SS Norge (GSSN) |language=Norwegian |editor=Dahl, Hjeltnes, Nøkleby, Ringdal, Sørensen |url=  |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=133–134 [/tpl][tpl]cite book| title=Himmlers Norge.
