[[Constant of integration]]

==Origin of the constant==

It turns out that adding and subtracting constants is the only flexibility we have in finding different antiderivatives of the same function.  That is, all antiderivatives are the same up to a constant.  To express this fact for cos(x), we write:

==Necessity of the constant==

At first glance it may seem that the constant is unnecessary, since it can be set to zero.  Furthermore, when evaluating definite integrals using the fundamental theorem of calculus, the constant will always cancel with itself.
So setting C to zero can still leave a constant.  This means that, for a given function, there is no "simplest antiderivative".

==Reason for a constant difference between antiderivatives==

Even if it is assumed that F and G are everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable the theorem still fails.  As an example, take F to be the Cantor function and again let G = 0.
