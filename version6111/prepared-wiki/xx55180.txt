==Residences and offices==

The Governor of Illinois resides in the Illinois Executive Mansion at 410 East Jackson in Springfield.  Its first occupant was Governor Joel Aldrich Matteson.  He took residence at the mansion in 1855.  It is one of three oldest governor's residences in continuous use in the United States.
The governor is also given the use of an official residence on the state fair grounds, also located in Springfield.  Governors have traditionally used this residence part of the year.
However, some governors, such as Rod Blagojevich, have chosen to not use the governor's homes as their primary residence, instead commuting either by car or plane to Springfield from their home cities.[tpl]cite news |title=Illinois Governor Has Pricey Commute |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/22/politics/main2968669.shtml |accessdate=14 December 2011 |publisher=CBS News |date=11 February 2009[/tpl] Many Chicago-based governors also have done much of their business out of the governor's office in Chicago's James R. Thompson Center, an office building owned by the state named for the governor who served through the 1980s.

==Corruption==

Six Illinois governors have been charged with crimes during or after their governorships; four were convicted, and of those, one (Blagojevich) was the first to be impeached and removed from office.
