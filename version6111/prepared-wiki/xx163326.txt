4chan is an English-language imageboard website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines.  Registration is not required, nor is it possible (except for staff).
Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for the posting of pictures and discussion of manga and anime, as the site was modelled on Japanese imageboards. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan's content still features otaku, anime and other Japanese cultural influences.
The site has been linked to Internet subcultures and activism, most notably Project Chanology. 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of Internet memes such as lolcats, Rickrolling, "Chocolate Rain", Pedobear and many others. The site's "Random" board, also known as "/b/", was the site's first forum, and is the one that receives the most traffic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf | title=4chan and /b/: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community | publisher=Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence | work=MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lboratory | year=2011 | accessdate=February 27, 2014 | author=Bernstein, M.

Gawker once jokingly claimed that "reading /b/ will melt your brain". The site's anonymous community and culture have often provoked media attention. For media planners, this enterprise is "further proof that creativity is everywhere and new media is less accessible" to advertisement agencies.[tpl]cite news|author=Unattributed|title=It's all about the money, stupid, not the latest online technology|newspaper=Marketing Week|page=13|date=August 7, 2008|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|accessdate=February 4, 2009|postscript=[/tpl]
4chan has been instrumental in hijacking Internet destinations for pranks, so that, for example, images of Rick Astley appeared instead of the page that was searched for; the coordination of attacks against other websites and Internet users; and reactions to threats of violence that have been posted on the site. The Guardian once summarized the 4chan community as "lunatic, juvenile... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming."

==Background==

4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of a then-15-year-old student from New York City named Christopher Poole, who posts as "moot". Prior to starting 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums. He intended 4chan to be a place to discuss Japanese comics and anime, an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel ("2chan") imageboard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0502/1209632797289.html|title=Tuning into innovation outside the confines of English-speaking web|work=The Irish Times |date=May 2, 2008|author=Danny O'Brien|accessdate=January 17, 2009[/tpl] Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's Babelfish online translator. When he first created the website, it had only two boards: "/a/ – Anime/General" and "/b/ – Anime/Random"; over time more boards were created, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply "/b/ – Random".As explained by Poole during a live-video online interview with Hiroyuki Nishimura, founder of 2channel, on the Japanese website Nico Nico Douga during his trip to Japan in 2011. Recording of video feed available at: July 27, 2011, Moot x Hiroyuki Social Media Talk Session (ID: 57271090).
The activity of 4chan takes place on message boards and imageboards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#what4chan|title=FAQ – What is 4chan?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 15, 2008[/tpl] The website is split into six categories: Japanese culture, Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). These provide for on-topic boards to discuss anime, manga, technology, sport, photography, music, hentai, torrents, travel, physical fitness, as well as a random board. 4chan originally hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called "world4ch", but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#were|title=FAQ – What were 4channel and world4ch?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 15, 2008[/tpl] The site has had at least one employee, a programmer whom Poole met via online Tetris. All other moderators are volunteers. The boards that attract the largest amount of traffic, from greatest to least, are /b/ (Random), /v/ (Video games), /a/ (Anime and Manga), and /s/ (board intended for sharing explicit images).
During the early days of 4chan, the boards that originally existed were the anime, random, cute, hentai, and yaoi boards; a lolicon board also existed at /l/,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news/?all#20 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011[/tpl] but after being disabled for a week around the turn of the year 2004 it was removed in October 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jonnydigital.com/4chan-history |title=4chan history | Jonathan's Reference Pages |publisher=Jonnydigital.com |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl] The /g/ board also was initially dedicated to guro, before it was deleted and later remade as the "technology" board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news/?all#11 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011[/tpl] During 2004, 4chan briefly went offline,June 20, 2004, Poole, DING DONG, 4CHAN IS DEAD, 4chan News then returned fully online a few months later.August 11, 2004, "The Team", WE'RE BACK!, 4chan News Following 4chan's return, non-anime related boards, such as the weapons, automobile, and video games boards, were introduced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news/?all#59 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011[/tpl] In 2008, the "Japan/General" board at /jp/ was created for topics that did not fit under the anime and manga category of /a/; /jp/ was later renamed to "Otaku Culture".
4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to the Los Angeles Times. 4chan's Alexa rank is generally around 700,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/4chan.org|title=4chan.org — Site Information|publisher=Alexa|accessdate=August 26, 2010[/tpl] though it has been as high as number 56 at times. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#95|title=The long and short of it|publisher=4chan| author=moot| date=February 12, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008[/tpl] However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money.[tpl]cite news|last=Hesse|first=Monica|title=A Virtual Unknown; Meet 'Moot,' the Secretive Internet Celeb Who Still Lives With Mom|work=The Washington Post|pages=23–24|date=February 17, 2009|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html|accessdate=April 16, 2009[/tpl] The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.moot, August 6, 2012, BEYOND ONE BILLION, 4chan News

In January 2011, Poole announced the deletion of the /r9k/ ("ROBOT9000") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose of being a test implementation of xkcd's ROBOT9000 script.January 19, 2011, Why were /r9k/ and /new/ removed? – Statement by him regarding the removal of /r9k/ and /new/.

4chan has been the target of occasional denial of service attacks.  For instance, on December 28, 2010, 4chan went down due to a such an attack.  Christopher Poole said on his blog "We now join the ranks of MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, et al.—an exclusive club!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245|title=Web attack takes Anonymous activists offline|publisher=BBC News|date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=December 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101230083125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245| archivedate= December 30, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 2010 4chan implemented reCAPTCHA in an effort to thwart spam arising from JavaScript worms. Later in November 2011, 4chan made the transition to utilising CloudFlare following a series of distributed denial of service attacks. The 4chan imageboards were rewritten in valid HTML5/CSS3 in May 2012 in an effort to improve client-side performance.
As of September 28, 2012, 4chan introduced a "4chan pass",[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news#110 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl] which when purchased "allows users to bypass typing a reCAPTCHA verification when posting and reporting posts on the 4chan image boards".[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/pass |title=Pass |publisher=4chan |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl] The money raised from the passes will go towards supporting the site.

===Christopher Poole===

Christopher Poole kept his real life identity hidden until it was revealed on July 9, 2008, in The Wall Street Journal.  Before that time he had used the alias "moot".[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121564928060441097.html|title=Modest Web Site Is Behind a Bevy of Memes|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Jamin Brophy-Warren|date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080829174144/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121564928060441097.html| archivedate= August 29, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The same day, Lev Grossman of Time published an interview describing Poole's influence as a non-visible administrator as "one of the most significant" on the evolution of content collaboration. Although Grossman's article began with the confession that "I don't even know his real name", he claimed to identify moot as Christopher Poole.[tpl]cite news| last = Grossman| first = Lev| author-link = Lev Grossman| title = The Master of Memes| newspaper = Time| place = United States | volume = 172| issue = 3| pages = 50–51| date = July 9, 2008| url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html| accessdate =July 24, 2008| postscript = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080724092400/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html| archivedate= July 24, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Later, on July 10, Grossman admitted that there was an outside chance that Christopher Poole was not moot's real name, rather an obscure reference to a 4chan inside joke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://time-blog.com/nerd_world/2008/07/now_in_papervision_the_4chan_g.html|title=Now in Paper-Vision: The 4chan Guy|work=TIME|author=Lev Grossman|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080828040709/http://www.time-blog.com/nerd_world/2008/07/now_in_papervision_the_4chan_g.html| archivedate= August 28, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Washington Post concurred that "Christopher Poole" could be "all a big hoax, a 'gotcha'. It would be just what you'd expect from the creator of 4chan." In March 2009, Time backpedaled somewhat on the issue by placing the moot persona on the 2009 Time 100 finalists list.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1883653_1885481,00.html |title=moot – The 2009 TIME 100 Finalists |work=TIME |date= March 19, 2009|accessdate=September 2, 2009[/tpl]
Prior to the Wall Street Journal and Time interviews, Poole deliberately kept his real identity separate from 4chan. He told Grossman "my personal private life is very separate from my Internet life ... There's a firewall in between." As moot, he has spoken at conferences at Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A 2008 article in The Observer had him down as "the most influential web entrepreneur you've never heard of", though he has since been described in more limited terms such as "benefactor".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/20/internet.google|title=The 20-year-old at heart of web's most anarchic and influential site|work=The Observer |author=David Smith|date=July 20, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080723175539/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/20/internet.google?| archivedate= July 23, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Cohen|first=Stefanie|title=Grosses and 'Nets|work=The New York Post|page=25|date=February 22, 2009|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02212009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/the_dark_heart_of_the_internet_156297.htm|accessdate=April 16, 2009[/tpl]
In February 2009, The Washington Post reported that Poole had attended Virginia Commonwealth University for a few semesters before dropping out. It reported that Christopher Poole was living with his mother while looking for a way to make money from owning 4chan.
In April 2009, Poole was voted the world's most influential person of 2008 by an open Internet poll conducted by Time magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1894028,00.html |title=The World's Most Influential Person Is... |work=TIME |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 2, 2009[/tpl] The results were questioned even before the poll completed, as automated voting programs and manual ballot stuffing were used to influence the vote.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345987,00.asp | title = 4Chan Followers Hack Time's 'Influential' Poll | last = Heater | first = Brian | publisher = PC Magazine | date = April 27, 2009 | accessdate =April 27, 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090430151912/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345987,00.asp| archivedate= April 30, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/21/AR2009042101864.html | last = Schonfeld | first = Erick | title = 4Chan Takes Over The Time 100 |work=Washington Post | date = April 21, 2009 | accessdate =April 27, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/ |title=moot wins, Time Inc. loses « Music Machinery |publisher=Musicmachinery.com |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 2, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090803110422/http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/| archivedate= August 3, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] 4chan's interference with the vote seemed increasingly likely, when it was found that reading the first letter of the first 21 candidates in the poll spelled out a phrase containing two 4chan memes: "mARBLECAKE.

On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a "Meme Factory" at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site ("The site has no memory.").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paraflows.at/index.php?id=131 |title=Paraflows 09, Program for Saturday, Sep 12 2009 |publisher=Paraflows.at |accessdate=May 18, 2010[/tpl]Herwig, Jana Partial transcript: Moot on 4chan and why it works as a meme factory, Digiom Blog, 2010-04-06, accessed 2010-04-07

In 2010, Poole was reported to have raised $625,000 to create a new online enterprise, called "Canvas". The website opened on January 31, 2011, and features digitally modified images uploaded by users who are required to self-identify using Facebook Connect. However, Facebook Connect is no longer required and users can post anonymously.
In April 2010, Poole gave evidence in the trial United States of America v.

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with Project Chanology, a worldwide protest against the Church of Scientology held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants "do something big" against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan memes including rickrolls and Guy Fawkes masks. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.

==/b/ imageboard==

The "random" board, /b/, follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board. It was the first board created, and is by far 4chan's most popular board, with 30% of site traffic.[tpl]cite web | url = http://fimoculous.com/archive/post-5738.cfm | title = An Interview With The Founder of 4chan | last = Sorgatz | first = Rex | publisher = Fimoculous.com | date = February 18, 2009 | accessdate =May 18, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#101|title=/b/|publisher=4chan|author=moot|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008[/tpl] Gawker.com's Nick Douglas summarized /b/ as a board where "people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other."[tpl]cite web|url=http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b|title=What The Hell Are 4chan, ED, Something Awful, And "b"?|publisher=Gawker.com|author=Nick Douglas|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080724081826/http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b| archivedate= July 24, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] /b/ has a "no rules" policy, except for bans on certain illegal content, such as child pornography, invasions of other websites (posting floods of disruptive content), and under-18 viewing, all of which are inherited from site-wide rules. The "no invasions" rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer "invading" Habbo Hotel. The "no rules" policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.4chan.org/rules.php#b|title=4chan — Rules – /b/ – Random|publisher=4chan|accessdate=August 18, 2006[/tpl] Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/. Christopher Poole told The New York Times, in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that "the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards" and that site staff simply provided a framework.

They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls, who regularly act with the intention of "doing it for the lulz": a corruption of "LOL" used to denote amusement at another's expense.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=94f40e62-2db2-4917-8e21-e17b9a25b2db&p=1|title=You'll miss us when we're gone|work=National Post |location=Canada |publisher=The National Post|author=Jonathan Kay|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=August 6, 2008[/tpl] The New York Observer has described posters as "immature pranksters whose bad behavior is encouraged by the site's total anonymity and the absence of an archive".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.observer.com/2011/tech/creator-4chan-comes-more-mature-canvas|title=From the Creator of 4chan Comes the More Mature Canvas|first=Adrianne|last=Jeffries|journal=The New York Observer|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] Douglas said of the board, "reading /b/ will melt your brain", and cited Encyclopedia Dramatica's definition of /b/ as "the asshole of the Internets". Mattathias Schwartz of The New York Times likened /b/ to "a high-school bathroom stall, or an obscene telephone party line", while Baltimore City Paper wrote that "in the high school of the Internet, /b/ is the kid with a collection of butterfly knives and a locker full of porn." Wired describes /b/ as "notorious".
Each post is assigned a post number. Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to "GET" them. A "GET" occurs when a post's number ends in a special number, such as 12345678, 22222222, or every millionth post.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#get|title=FAQ on GETs|publisher=4chan|accessdate=March 14, 2007[/tpl] A sign of 4chan's scaling, according to Poole, was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks. He estimated /b/'s post rate in July 2008 to be 150,000–200,000 posts per day.

==Internet memes==

Internet memes are catchphrases or images that spread quickly, peer to peer, across the Internet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology|title=It's all in the memes|work=The Guardian |author=Karl Hodge|date=August 10, 2000|accessdate=September 13, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080814103615/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology| archivedate= August 14, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Many Internet memes have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, crowd psychology nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.
Other memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include "So I herd u liek mudkipz"[tpl]Sic[/tpl], which involves a phrase based on Pokémon and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos, and the term "an hero"[tpl]Sic[/tpl] as a synonym for suicide, after a misspelling in the MySpace online memorial of seventh grader Mitchell Henderson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|title=The Trolls Among Us|author=MATTATHIAS SCHWARTZ|publisher=The New York Times[/tpl] 4chan, and other websites, such as the satirical Encyclopedia Dramatica, have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of leetspeak.[tpl]cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece|title=Scientology: the Anonymous protestors|work=The Times |author=Caitlin Moran|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=August 25, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080905163346/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece| archivedate= September 5, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Adult fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic are also known to frequent 4chan, having had a board dedicated to their interest.[tpl]cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203707504577012141105109140.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_RIGHTTopCarousel_1# | title = Hey, Bro, That's My Little Pony!

===Lolcats===

A lolcat is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect.  In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of "Caturday". Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with image macros relating to that day's theme.[tpl]cite web| url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2007/11/iz_not_cats_everywhere_online_trend_spreads_across_campus|title = Iz not cats everywhere?

===Rickrolling===

In 2005, a meme known as the "duckroll" began, after Poole used a word filter to change "egg" to "duck" across 4chan. Thus, words such as "eggroll" were changed to "duckroll". This led to a bait-and-switch in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html|title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008[/tpl]
In March 2007, the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was released. Its immense popularity caused publisher Rockstar Games' website to crash. An unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to what appeared to be a link to the trailer on YouTube, but instead showed the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up". Thus, the "rickroll" was born. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Astley said he found the meme "bizarre and funny".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news|title=Taking the Rick|work=The Guardian |author=Sean Michaels|date=March 19, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080727172939/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news| archivedate= July 27, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html|title=Web Scout exclusive!

On January 21, 2014, an anonymous poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently went to the same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said "if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up", referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School in Fairview, Kentucky. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI. The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony in Kentucky.

==ISP bans==

===AT&T temporary ban===

On July 26, 2009, AT&T's DSL branch temporarily blocked access to the img.4chan.org domain (host of /b/ and /r9k/), which was initially believed to be an attempt at Internet censorship, and met with hostility on 4chan's part.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/att-blocks-4chan-this-is-going-to-get-ugly/ |title=AT&T Reportedly Blocks 4chan. This Is Going To Get Ugly. |publisher=TechCrunch |date=July 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centralgadget.com/att-blocking-access-to-portions-of-4chan-2336/|title=AT&T Blocking Access to Portions of 4chan (Updated Again)|date=July 26, 2006|publisher=CentralGadget|accessdate=July 26, 2006|work=Christopher Price[/tpl]
On July 27, 2009, AT&T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT&T customer was affected by a denial-of-service attack originating from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org, and was an attempt to "prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&T customer, and... our other customers." AT&T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350814,00.asp/|title=AT&T Confirms 4chan Block After DoS Attack|date=July 27, 2009|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=July 27, 2009|work=Chloe Albanesius[/tpl]
4chan's founder Christopher Poole responded with the following:[tpl]cite web|url=http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2174049422947602936/|title=4chan Status|date=July 27, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2009[/tpl]
 In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate intend the consequences of doing so.
 We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.
Major news outlets have reported that the issue may be related to DDoSing of 4chan and that the suspicions of 4chan users fell on the person who owned Swedish-based Anontalk.com at that time for doing this.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Feared Hackers Call Off Attack on AT&T | date=July 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=The Bryant Park Project |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92767742 |title=When Your Pedicurist Is A Fish |publisher=NPR |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl]
Concerning the AT&T claims of DDoS attacks originating from 4chan, Poole confirmed it was due to a network error:
 For the past three weeks, 4chan has been under a constant DDoS attack. We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that was more or less transparent to the end user.
 Unfortunately, as an unintended consequence of the method used, some Internet users received errant traffic from one of our network switches. A handful happened to be AT&T customers

===Verizon ban===

On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. After investigating, Poole found out that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading members to believe that the block was intentional.http://status.4chan.org/index.html#7155425685835498189
On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan was "explicitly blocked".http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2310965532000217917  The block was lifted several days later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wirelessfederation.com/news/21888-verizon-wireless-restores-4chan-traffic-2/ |title=Verizon Wireless restores 4Chan traffic |publisher=Wirelessfederation.com |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl]
