Rajiv Ratna Gandhi ([tpl]IPAc-en|'|r|ɑː|dʒ|iː|v|_|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|d|iː|audio=Hi-RajivGandhi.ogg[/tpl]; 20 August 1944 – 21 May 1991) was the sixth Prime Minister of India, serving from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, his mother, to become the youngest Indian premier.
A scion of the politically powerful Nehru–Gandhi family associated with the Indian National Congress party, for much of Rajiv's childhood his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was prime minister. For his college education, he went to Britain where he met and began dating Antonia Maino, an Italian waitress. Rajiv returned to India in 1966 and became a professional pilot for the state-owned Indian Airlines. In 1968, he married Maino—who changed her name to Sonia Gandhi—and the couple settled down in Delhi to a domestic life with their children Rahul and Priyanka. Although for much of the 1970s his mother was prime minister, and his brother Sanjay wielded significant unofficial power, Rajiv remained apolitical. After Sanjay's death in a plane crash in 1980, Rajiv reluctantly entered politics at the behest of Indira. The following year he won his brother's Amethi seat and became a member of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament). As part of his political grooming, Rajiv was made a general secretary of the Congress and given significant responsibility in organising the 1982 Asian Games.
On the morning of 31 October 1984, his mother was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge Operation Blue Star; later that day, Rajiv Gandhi was appointed Prime Minister. His leadership was put to the test over the next few days as organised mobs rioted against the Sikh community, resulting in the death of thousands in Delhi alone. Nevertheless, that December, a nationwide sympathy vote for Rajiv's Congress party helped it win the greatest Lok Sabha majority (411 seats out of 542) in history.
Rajiv Gandhi was also mired in many controversies: the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Bhopal disaster and Shah Bano case. In 1988, Gandhi reversed the coup in Maldives antagonising militant Tamil groups such as PLOTE. He was also responsible for first intervening and then sending Indian Peace Keeping Force troops for peace efforts in Sri Lanka in 1987, which soon ended in open conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In mid-1987, the Bofors scandal damaged his honest, corruption-free image and resulted in a major defeat for his party in the 1989 elections.
Rajiv Gandhi remained Congress President until the elections in 1991. While campaigning for the elections, he was assassinated by a suicide bomber from the LTTE. His widow Sonia became the president of Congress party in 1998, and led the party to victory in the 2004 and 2009 parliament elections. His son Rahul is a Member of Parliament and Vice President of the Congress. Rajiv Gandhi was posthumously awarded the highest civilian award by the government of India, Bharat Ratna in 1991.

==Early life and career==

Rajiv Gandhi was born into India's most famous political family. His maternal grandfather was the Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who was India's first Prime Minister after independence. His father, Feroze, was one of the younger members of the Indian National Congress party, and had befriended the young Indira, and also her mother Kamala Nehru, while working on party affairs at Allahabad. Subsequently, Indira and Feroze grew closer to each other while in England, and they married, despite initial objections from Jawaharlal due to his religion (Zoroastrianism).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/flair/20020120/1.html|title=We aren't family|accessdate=19 February 2011|date=20 January 2002|work=The Indian Express[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
He was born in 1944 in Mumbai, during a time when both his parents were in and out of British prisons. In August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru became the prime minister of independent India, and the family settled in Allahabad, and then at Lucknow, where Feroze became the editor of the National Herald newspaper (founded by Motilal Nehru). The marriage was faltering and, in 1949, Indira and the two sons moved to Delhi to live with Nehru, ostensibly so that Indira could assist her father in his duties, acting as official hostess, and helping run the huge residence. Meanwhile, Feroze continued alone in Lucknow. Relations were strained further when Feroze challenged corruption within the Congress leadership over the Haridas Mundhra scandal. After Feroze Gandhi had a heart attack in 1958, the family reconciled briefly before Feroze died from a second heart attack in 1960.
Rajiv first studied at Welham Boys' School in Dehra Dun, and then went on to the Doon School. He was sent to London in 1961 to study his A-levels. In 1962, he was offered a place at Trinity College, Cambridge, to study engineering. Rajiv stayed at Cambridge until 1965, but did not complete his degree.Law and The Celebrity - Rajiv Gandhi LU June 2012. Lawyersupdate.co.in. Retrieved on 10 July 2013. In 1966, he was offered and took up a place at Imperial College London, but after a year left that course without a degree.
Rajiv began working for Indian Airlines as a professional pilot while his mother became Prime Minister in 1966. He exhibited no interest in politics. He married a waitress at a Greek restaurant Albina Màino who later became known as Sonia Gandhi. In 1970, his wife gave birth to their first child Rahul, and in 1972, to Priyanka, their second.

==Entry into politics==

Following his younger brother Sanjay Gandhi's death in 1980, Gandhi was pressured by Congress politicians and his mother to enter politics. He and Sonia were both opposed to the idea, and he even publicly stated that he would not contest for his brother's seat. Nevertheless, he eventually announced his candidacy for Parliament. His entry was criticized by many in the press, public and political opposition. Rajiv also became a member of the Asian Games Organizing Committee in 1982 with his close friend and then sports minister Sardar Buta Singh as president of the committee. He fought his first election from Sanjay's erstwhile Amethi Lok Sabha seat, a Nehru–Gandhi bastion, and defeated Sharad Yadav. It was widely perceived that Indira Gandhi was grooming Rajiv for the prime minister's job, and he soon became the president of the Indian Youth Congress, the Congress party's youth wing.

==Prime Minister of India==

Rajiv Gandhi was in West Bengal when his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, to avenge the military attack on the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star. Sardar Buta Singh, as well as President Zail Singh pressed Rajiv to become India's prime minister, within hours of his mother's assassination. Commenting on the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi said, "When a giant tree falls, the earth below shakes";[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1504/15040190.htm |title=Back to the dynasty |work=Frontline |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=6 March 1998 |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] a statement for which he was widely criticized. Many Congress politicians were accused of orchestrating the violence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4130962.stm |title=World | South Asia | Leaders 'incited' anti-Sikh riots|publisher=BBC News  |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl] Soon after assuming office, Rajiv asked President Zail Singh to dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections, as the Lok Sabha completed its five-year term. Rajiv Gandhi also officially became the President of the Congress party. The Congress party won a landslide victory with the largest majority in history of Indian Parliament—giving Gandhi absolute control of government. He also benefited from his youth and a general perception of being free of a background in corrupt politics.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2701/stories/19910621009.htm | title=End of the road | accessdate=19 February 2011 | date=2 January 2005 | publisher=Frontline[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===Economic policy===

He increased government support for science and technology and associated industries, and reduced import quotas, taxes and tariffs on technology-based industries, especially computers, airlines, defence and telecommunications. In 1986, he announced a National Policy on Education to modernise and expand higher education programs across India. He founded the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya System in 1986 which is a Central government based institution that concentrates on the upliftment of the rural section of the society providing them free residential education from 6th till 12 grade.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.basearticles.com/Art/65874/216/Rajiv-Gandhi-aimed-at-value-based-education-in-rural-India-through-JNVs.html | title=Rajiv Gandhi aimed at value based education in rural India through JNVs | accessdate=19 February 2011 | publisher=Pressbrief[/tpl] His efforts created MTNL in 1986, and his public call offices, better known as PCOs, helped spread telephones in rural areas.[tpl]cite web | url=http://meachq.in/html/rahul_memo.pdf | title=MTNL Letter | accessdate=19 February 2011 | date=16 September 2009[/tpl] He introduced measures significantly reducing the Licence Raj, in post-1990 period, allowing businesses and individuals to purchase capital, consumer goods and import without bureaucratic restrictions.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/pubpapers/ABRZ_AER_Sept2008.pdf|title=Unequal effects of Liberalisation – Dismantling the license raj in India[/tpl]

===Foreign policy===

Rajiv Gandhi began leading in a direction significantly different from his mother's socialism. He improved bilateral relations with the United States – long strained owing to Indira's socialism and friendship with the USSR — and expanded economic and scientific cooperation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/leaders/rajiv-gandhi.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi Biography – Rajiv Gandhi Life & Profile |publisher=Culturalindia.net |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl] During his state visit to the Soviet Union he met with Premier Nikolai Tikhonov, Andrey Gromyko of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mikhail Gorbachev.

===Security policy===

Rajiv authorised an extensive police and army campaign to contain terrorism in Punjab. A state of martial law existed in the Punjab state, and civil liberties, commerce and tourism were greatly disrupted.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-6398483.html | title=Bad to Worse | accessdate=19 February 2011 |work=The Economist[/tpl] There are many accusations of human rights violations by police officials as well as by the militants during this period. It is alleged that even as the situation in Punjab came under control, the Indian government was offering arms and training to the LTTE rebels fighting the government of Sri Lanka. The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed by Rajiv Gandhi and the Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene, in Colombo on 29 July 1987. The very next day, on 30 July 1987, Rajiv Gandhi was assaulted on the head with a rifle butt by a young Sinhalese naval cadet named Vijayamunige Rohana de Silva,[tpl]cite news|agency= Associated Press |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-30/news/mn-453_1_sri-lankan |title=Sri Lankan in Honor Guard Attacks Gandhi |work=Los Angeles Times|date=30 July 1987 |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nation.lk/2007/07/29/special5.htm |title=Nation special |publisher=Nation |date=30 July 1987 |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] while receiving the honour guard.

With his speech while addressing the Joint Session of the US Congress and India, he said,
"India is an old country, but a young nation; and like the young everywhere, we are impatient. I am young and I too have a dream. I dream of an India, strong, independent, self-reliant and in the forefront of the front ranks of the nations of the world in the service of mankind."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.congresssandesh.com/june-2005/june2005.pdf |title=Untitled-6 |format=PDF |date = June 2005|accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Anti-Sikh riots===

At a Boat Club rally 19 days after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv said: "Some riots took place in the country following the murder of Indiraji. We know the people were very angry and for a few days it seemed that India had been shaken. But, when a mighty tree falls, it is only natural that the earth around it does shake a little".[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101082805/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071031/nation.htm#top|title=84 Anti-Sikh riot Probes: Book presents gloomy picture of justice denied|publisher=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India|author=S.S. Negi|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
This statement sent a wrong signal to the authorities, who adopted a callous approach of not allowing the truth to come out despite the government setting up probe panels one after the other, including two full fledged judicial commissions (the first headed by retired Chief Justice of India Ranganath Misra and the second by former apex court judge G.T. Nanavati). As mentioned in the book 'When a Tree Shook Delhi' by senior advocate H.S. Phoolka and journalist Manoj Mitta (who have based the details of the book mainly on evidence produced before the nine panels and trial courts and high courts in the form of affidavits by witnesses), the police ironically cracked down on the Sikh victims, who had been defending their properties when they were attacked by hooligans led by local Congress leaders.

===Bofors scandal===

Rajiv Gandhi's finance minister, V. P. Singh, uncovered compromising details about government and political corruption, to the consternation of Congress leaders. Transferred to the Defence ministry, Singh uncovered what became known as the Bofors scandal, involving tens of millions of dollars – concerned alleged payoffs by the Swedish Bofors arms company through Italian businessman and Gandhi family associate Ottavio Quattrocchi, in return for Indian contracts. Upon the uncovering of the scandal, Singh was dismissed from office, and later from Congress membership. Rajiv Gandhi himself was later personally implicated in the scandal when the investigation was continued by Narasimhan Ram and Chitra Subramaniam of The Hindu newspaper. This shattered his image as an honest politician; he was posthumously cleared over this allegation in 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3458319.stm |title=Rajiv Gandhi cleared over bribery |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 February 2004 |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl]
Opposition parties united under Singh to form the Janata Dal coalition. In the 1989 election, the Congress suffered a major setback. With the support of Indian communists and the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh and his Janata Dal formed a government. Rajiv Gandhi became the Leader of the Opposition, while remaining Congress president. While some believe that Rajiv and Congress leaders influenced the collapse of V. P. Singh's government in October 1990 by promising support to Chandra Shekhar, a high-ranking leader in the Janata Dal, sufficient internal contradictions existed, within the ruling coalition, especially over the controversial reservation issue, to cause a fall of government. Rajiv's Congress offered outside support briefly to Chandra Sekhar, who became Prime Minister. They withdrew their support in 1991, and fresh elections were announced.
In his book, Unknown Facets of Rajiv Gandhi, Jyoti Basu and Indrajit Gupta, released in November 2013, former CBI director Dr A P Mukherjee wrote that Rajiv Gandhi wanted commission paid by defence suppliers to be used exclusively for the purpose of meeting expenses of running the Congress party.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rajiv-gandhi-told-me-to-use-arms-deal-payoffs-for-party-funds-excbi-chief/1194313/ Mukherjee said Gandhi explained his position in a meeting on 19 June 1989, during a meeting between the two at the Prime Minister's residence.[tpl]cite news|title=Rajiv Gandhi wanted Bofors money to run Congress: Ex-CBI chief|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rajiv-Gandhi-wanted-Bofors-money-to-run-Congress-Ex-CBI-chief/articleshow/25720914.cms|newspaper=The Times of India|date=14 November 2013[/tpl]

===Sri Lanka policy===

Then Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord, but accepted it due to pressure from then President Junius Richard Jayewardene. In 1987, When he was inspecting guard of honour in Sri Lanka, he was assaulted by a Sri Lankan sailor[tpl]cite news|title=Reincarnation/Rebirth of the Indo-Lanka Accord|url=http://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/reincarnationrebirth-of-the-indo-lanka-accord/|newspaper=Colombo Telegraph|date=9 August 2012|location=Srilanka[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://sangam.org/taraki/articles/2006/07-28_JVP_Rajiv.php?uid=1862|title=The Botched JVP Hit on Rajiv Gandhi Revisited |author=Sachi Sri Kantha|date=28 July 2006|publisher=Ilankai Tamil Sangam|accessdate=29 October 2012[/tpl] Vijitha Rohana de Silva of Naval rating.[tpl]cite news|title=Lankan sailor who attacked Rajiv Gandhi sells Hindi music|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/7/17577_space.html|newspaper=Lanka Newspapers|date=31 July 2007|location=Colombo, Srilanka[/tpl] His own agility and Indian Special Protection Group saved Rajiv from that brutal attack.[tpl]cite news|title=When Rajiv was attacked in Srilanka|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/11bg.htm|newspaper=Rediff|date=11 October 2005|location=India[/tpl] In January 1989 Premadasa was elected President and on a platform that promised that the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) leave within three months.Sri Lanka Truth[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] In the 1989 elections, both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and United National Party wanted the IPKF to withdraw, and they got 95 percent of the vote.
The police action was unpopular in India as well, especially in Tamil Nadu, as India was fighting the Tamil separatists. Rajiv Gandhi refused to withdraw the IPKF, believing that the only way to end the civil war was to politically force Premadasa and militarily force the LTTE to accept the accord. Gandhi had concluded a visit to Sri Lanka; this was just after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (a contingent of India armed forces sent to Sri Lanka to help with their battle against Tamil insurgents) had been recalled and there was a good deal of resentment that Indian troops had been deployed there.
In December 1989, Singh was elected Prime Minister and completed the pullout. The IPKF operation killed over 1100 Indian soldiers, 5000 Tamil civilians and cost over 100 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF08Df01.html |title=Sri Lanka: The Untold story Chapter 43: Aftermath of the Indian withdrawal |author=K T Rajasingham |work=Asia Times Online |publisher=Atimes.com |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl]BBC India's Sri Lankan predicament

===Shah Bano case===

In 1985, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of Muslim divorcee Shah Bano, declaring that her husband should give her alimony. A section of Muslims in India treated it as an encroachment in Muslim Personal Law and protested against it. Gandhi agreed to their demands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/sb-rajiv.htm |title=Shah Bano – Rajiv Gandhi |publisher=Homepages.uc.edu |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl]
In 1986, the Congress (I) party, which had an absolute majority in Parliament at the time, passed an act that nullified the Supreme Court's judgement in the Shah Bano case. This was viewed in India that it is against the fundamental rule of the constitution that the law does treat everyone equal and was seen as a strategy to appease Muslims and garner their votes.

===Allegations of black money===

In November 1991, the Schweizer Illustrierte (Swiss Illustrated page) magazine published an article on black money held in secret accounts by Imelda Marcos and 14 other rulers of Third World countries. Citing McKinsey as a source, the article stated that Rajiv Gandhi held 2.5 billion Swiss francs in secret Indian accounts in Switzerland.[tpl]cite web |last=Jethmalani | first=Ram |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dacoits+have+looted+india/1/123602.html|title=Dacoits have looted India|date=17 December 2010|publisher=India Today|accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Gisler|first=Daniela|date=11 November 1991|title=Fluchtgelder – Die Schweizer Konten der Diktatoren|trans_title=Flight capital – the Swiss accounts of the dictators|journal=Schweizer Illustrierte|language=German|publisher=Ringier AG|location=Zürich, Switzerland|issue=46|pages=38–41|url=http://www.schweizer-illustrierte.ch/sites/default/files/SI-46-1991-Seiten-38-41.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] Several leaders of opposition parties in India have raised the issue citing the Schweizer Illustrierte article. In December 1991, Amal Datta raised the issue in the Indian Parliament  – the then speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shivraj Patil, expunged Rajiv Gandhi's name from the proceedings. In December 2011, Subramanian Swamy wrote a letter to the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation which cited the article, asking him to take action on black money accounts of the Nehru-Gandhi family.[tpl]cite news |date=7 December 2011 |url=http://www.moneylife.in/article/dr-subramanian-swamy-asks-cbi-to-take-action-on-gandhi-familys-black-money-accounts/22045.html |title=Dr Subramanian Swamy asks CBI to take action on Rajiv Gandhi's family's black money accounts|work=Moneylife|accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] On 29 December 2011, Ram Jethmalani made an indirect reference to the issue in the Rajya Sabha, calling it a shame that one of India's former Prime Ministers was named by a Swiss magazine.

===Funding from KGB===

In 1992, two Indian newspapers, the Times of India and The Hindu, published reports alleging that Rajiv Gandhi had received funds from the KGB.[tpl]cite web |last=Gurumurthy | first=S |url=http://newindianexpress.com/opinion/article402584.ece|title=Zero tolerance, secret billions|date=30 January 2011|work=The New Indian Express |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] The Russian government confirmed this disclosure and defended the payments as necessary for the Soviet ideological interest. In their 1994 book The State Within a State, the journalists Yevgenia Albats and Catherine Fitzpatrick quoted a letter signed by Viktor Chebrikov, the head of the KGB, in the 1980s. The letter says that the KGB maintained contact with Rajiv Gandhi, who expressed his gratitude to the KGB for benefits accruing to his family from commercial dealings of a controlled firm, and a considerable portion of funds obtained from this channel were used to support his party.[tpl]cite book | first1=Yevgenia | last1=Albats | first2=Catherine | last2=Fitzpatrick | year=1999 | origyear=1994 | title =The State Within a State: The KGB and its Hold on Russia-Past, Present, and Future | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=9780374527389 | location =London, United Kingdom | page=223 | quote=A letter signed by Viktor Chebrikov, who replaced Andropov as the KGB head in 1982 noted: "the USSR KGB maintains contact with the son of the Premier Minister Rajiv Gandhi India ...

In December 2001, Subramanian Swamy filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, acting on which the court ordered CBI to ascertain the truth of the allegations in May 2002. After two years, the CBI told the Court that Russia would not entertain such queries without a registered FIR.

==Assassination==

Rajiv Gandhi's last public meeting was at Sriperumbudur on 21 May 1991, in a village approximately 40 km (30 miles) from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, where he was assassinated while campaigning for the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha Congress candidate.
At 10:10 pm, a woman (later identified as Thenmozhi Rajaratnam) approached Rajiv Gandhi in public and greeted him. She then bent down to touch his feet and detonated a belt laden with 700 grams of RDX explosives tucked under her dress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/01021999/rdx.html |author=Ramesh Vinayak |title=The Nation: Terrorism: The RDX Files |publisher=India-today.com |date=1 February 1999 |accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl] The explosion killed Rajiv Gandhi, his assassin and at least 25 other people. The assassination was caught on film through the lens of a local photographer, whose camera and film were found at the site. The cameraman died in the blast but the camera remained intact.

Today, the site where he was cremated is known as Vir Bhumi.

===Aftermath===

The Supreme Court judgement, by Judge Thomas, confirmed that the killing was carried out due to personal animosity of the LTTE chief Prabhakaran towards Gandhi arising out of his sending the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka and the alleged IPKF atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils.State of Tamil Nadu through Superintendent of Police, CBI/SIT vs. Nalini & 25 Ors., Death Ref. Case No. 1 of 1998 (@ D.No.1151 of 1998) per K.T. Thomas, para. 163 The Rajiv Gandhi administration had already antagonised other Tamil militant organisations like PLOTE for reversing the military coup in Maldives back in 1988. The judgement further cites the death of Thileepan in a hunger strike and the suicide by 12 LTTE cadres in a vessel in Oct 1987.
