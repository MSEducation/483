Dynamic Stillness is a 2-disc album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach, released in 2009.

==Production==

Dynamic Stillness is composed of pieces created in solitude over a period of three years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=PRO00228|title=Roach, Steve: Dynamic Stillness|publisher=Projekt|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl] The resulting pieces emote the slow, powerful energies of expanding cloud formations and the silence of the sprawling land beneath.
Immediately after the release of Dynamic Stillness, Steve Roach commenced with a continuation of the atmospheric theme, creating the long-form piece, Afterlight.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=TIM00021 |title=Roach, Steve: Afterlight |publisher=Projekt |accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]]

==Album artwork==

The photographs used in the artwork were created by Michal Karcz, whose imagery is nearly achromatic in nature.  The six-panel digipack album opens to reveal stark imagery of perfect desolation beneath foreboding clouds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michalkarcz.com/galeria/foto/dynamicstillnes.jpg|title=Dynamic Stillness Artwork|last=Karcz|first=Michal|publisher=MichalKarcz.com|accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl] This magnificent contrast is, of course, observed in the album's title.
The artwork played an integral part in the creation of the music.  Steve Roach and Michal Karcz traded music and artwork for nearly two years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.steveroach.com/news/newsletter/newsletter.php?id=20090407000000 |title=Steve Roach Update: Stillness is Near |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=SteveRoach.com |accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl]  Roach's pieces evolved with the imagery, as Karcz's graphic work evolved with the music, resulting in one of the most integrated releases of Roach's career.
