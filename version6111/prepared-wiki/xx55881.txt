==History==

Yoo-hoo originated in New Jersey in the 1920s, when Italian-American Natale Olivieri sold "Tru-Fruit" soft drinks in his small store. Olivieri discovered a process to produce a chocolate soft drink that would not spoil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yoo-hoo.com/about/default.aspx |title=About Yoo-hoo |publisher=Yoo-hoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22[/tpl] The name Yoo-hoo, already being used for Olivieri's other fruit drinks, was applied to the chocolate-flavored drink as well.
A bottling plant was opened up in Batesburg, South Carolina by Tommy Giresi in the 1940s.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Yoo-hoo went through a large promotional campaign that included Yogi Berra and the New York Yankees officially sponsoring the drink. The image of Berra drinking a bottle of Yoo-hoo while wearing a suit, in particular, became famous. The ads featured Berra holding the bottle next to his face and saying with a smile, "It's Me-He for Yoo-Hoo!"
Also during the 1950s, B.B.C. Industries took over Yoo-hoo. They held ownership until 1976, when it was bought by Iroquois Brands. Yoo-hoo was sold again in 1981 to a group of private investors, which in turn sold Yoo-hoo to Pernod Ricard in 1989.
In 2001, Pernod Ricard sold Yoo-hoo to Cadbury-Schweppes, with production responsibilities falling to CS's Mott's group, and marketing and advertising responsibilities under Snapple. This led to an increased awareness of the once-popular beverage.
The soft drink company's headquarters are in Rye Brook, New York, with plants in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and Opelousas, Louisiana. Yoo-hoo owns other chocolate drink brands, which include Choc-Ola, Brownie, Cocoa Dusty and Chocolate Soldier.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In May 2008, Cadbury-Schweppes split into Cadbury and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, of which Yoo-hoo is now part.
According to a February 2009 ABC News report, "Pope Loves Yoohoo!" headlines flooded the wires after a Vatican spokesman accompanying Pope Benedict XVI on a U.S. tour casually mentioned to reporters having to pick up "a couple of cases of that American chocolate drink he likes." As Popes do not give commercial endorsements, a subsequent statement denied that the Pontiff had any particular preference among American soft drinks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=4647693 |date=2009-02-11|title=Does the Pope Wear Prada? |work=ABC News|first1=Bill|last1=Blakemore|accessdate=2013-11-29[/tpl]
