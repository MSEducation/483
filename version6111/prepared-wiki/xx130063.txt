[[GlobalHell]]

CATEGORIES: Hacker groups

globalHell was a group of hackers, composed of about 60 individuals. The group disbanded in 1999, when 12 members were prosecuted for computer intrusion and 30 for lesser offences.  These members were known to congregate on the Eris Free IRC Network, especially in the channel #eleet. One of the members was thought to be KMS, who was involved in the 2010 media outrage under the Skype handle "pastorhoudaille".
The members of the group were responsible for over a hundred website defacements, trafficking stolen personal and financial information and illegally accessing numerous teleconferences over which they co-ordinated their efforts. A few of the systems they broke into include those of United States Army, the White House, United States Cellular, Ameritech and the US Postal Service.
It has been said that Nostalg1c (famous for having a relationship with female virus writer Gigabyte) was a part of globalHell before its disbandment.http://yzyy.ru/hacker-nostalg1c-any-system-is-strong-enough-how/
