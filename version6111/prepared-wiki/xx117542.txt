Transport Phenomena  is the first textbook that is about transport phenomena. It is specifically designed for chemical engineering students. The first edition was published in 1960, two years after having been preliminarily published under the title Notes on Transport Phenomena based on mimeographed notes prepared for a chemical engineering course taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison during the academic year 1957-1958.

==History==

As the chemical engineering profession developed in the first half of the 20th century, the concept of "unit operations" arose as being needed in the education of undergraduate chemical engineers. The theories of mass, momentum and energy transfer were being taught at that time only to the extent necessary for a narrow range of applications. As chemical engineers began moving into a number of new areas, problem definitions and solutions required a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of transport phenomena than those provided in the textbooks then available on unit operations. 
In the 1950s, R. Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart and Edwin N. Lightfoot stepped forward to develop an undergraduate course at the University of Wisconsin–Madison to integrate the teaching of fluid flow, heat transfer, and diffusion. From this beginning, they prepared their landmark textbook Transport Phenomena.Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot Programs

==Subjects covered in the book==

The book is divided into three basic sections, named Momentum Transport, Energy Transport and Mass Transport:

==Word play==

Transport Phenomena contains many instances of hidden messages and other word play.
For example, the first letters of each sentence of the Preface spell out "This book is dedicated to O. A. Hougen." while in the revised second edition, the first letters of each paragraph spell out "Welcome". The first letters of each paragraph in the Postface spell out "On Wisconsin".  In the first printing, in Fig. 9.L (p. 305) safely outside the furnace wall is typeset "Bird".
