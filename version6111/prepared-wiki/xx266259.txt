Fourth edition print of one of the many LOVE IS.... books written and drawn by Kim Grove, published by Signette. The frontispiece carries the message “FOR MY MOTHER”.]]
Casali's obituary published in The Times related that after she and Roberto became engaged, Casali took a job as a receptionist for a design company, "and made up little booklets of her winsome cartoons, which she sold for a dollar apiece. Word soon spread and the demand for Love is... escalated. Roberto recognised their commercial potential and showed them to an American journalist." Although other sources differ regarding whether it was Roberto or Casali herself who first showed the cartoons to an acquaintance working for the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper picked them up for publication and published the first of the series on 5 January 1970, under the pen name "Kim".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19770711&id=jwQqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UCkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4961,105430|title=For Widowed Cartoonist, Love Is a Baby Boy|work=Milwaukee Journal|location=Milwaukee|date=11 July 1977|accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Love Is Artist Will Be Bride|date=22 July 1971|work=The Modesto Bee|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19710722&id=SmwuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g38FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5014,1505009|location=Modesto|accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] The cartoon's release coincided with the wave of success of the novel Love Story (1970) by Erich Seagal, and the subsequent movie of the same name starring Ali MacGraw as a girl dying of an incurable disease and Ryan O'Neal as the student who worshiped her. The film's slogan was: "Love is never having to say you're sorry." Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: "Love is... being able to say you're sorry."[tpl]Cite news|title=Love is never having to say it's so all over|last=McIlwaine|first=Eddie|work=Belfast Telegraph|location=Belfast|date=22 November 2008|page=24[/tpl]
While the cartoons proved to be very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple "found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us one step ahead of the Immigration Department'". By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936. Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon. Casali said of the marriage: "My father had died when I was young, so when Roberto asked me to get married I agreed, but said, 'Whatever you do, don't die on me.' He laughed and promised to stick around." In January 1972, with Love is... by now a successful and lucrative product licensed for reproduction on mugs, T-shirts, calendars, T-shirts, posters and greetings cards, they moved to Weybridge, England, and bought a second home in Los Angeles. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, the cartoons were earning Casali £4–5 million annually.[tpl]Cite news|title=Obituary: Kim Casali|work=The Times|location=London|issue=65921|date=20 June 1997|page=23[/tpl]

==Bereavement and 'miracle' baby==

By 1974 the couple had two sons, Stefano and Dario, and planned to have two more children. In 1975 Roberto was diagnosed with testicular cancer and doctors described his condition as "extremely grave." Casali said: "I spent the next year fighting for a cure and trying to keep the bad news from him." Casali commissioned London-based English cartoonist Bill Asprey to take over the writing and drawing of the daily cartoons for her, under her signature.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.artfulaspreycartoons.co.uk/about-me/|year=2011|title=Bill Asprey|work=The Cartoon Art of Bill Asprey|accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] Asprey has produced the cartoon continuously since 1975.[tpl]Cite web|title=How I came to draw Love is...|url=http://www.artfulaspreycartoons.co.uk/love-is/|work=The Cartoon Art of Bill Asprey|year=2011|accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl]
Roberto opted for surgery at the end of 1975 in order to prolong his life. Casali said: "We were talking about Christmas presents and I told Roberto I didn't want another diamond ring, I wanted another baby." They decided "...that we would store some sperm just in case I didn't get pregnant before Roberto died. I knew he had only a few months to live, so we stored some sperm immediately." Roberto died in March 1976, aged 31. Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977.[tpl]Cite news|title=Cartoonist's baby is dead husband's 'gift of love'|work=Lawrence Journal-World|date=12 July 1977|location=Lawrence, Kansas|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19770712&id=6LgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AeYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6753,1352531|accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] She said at the time: "Roberto and I were very anxious to provide a brother or sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made possible for me to have another reminder of my wonderful husband." British newspapers called Milo the "miracle baby" The birth announcement consisted of a simple card drawn by Casali with the Love is... girl pushing a pram on the front, with the inscription inside: "Proudly presenting Milo Roberto. Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)".[tpl]Cite news|date=28 March 1999|work=New York Times|title=The Sperminator|first=Lori B.|last=Andrews|accessdate=2011-09-22|url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/cogito/Gr11/sperminator.html[/tpl]
Responding to criticism of her choice to go through with the procedure, Casali said: "Milo is here because of the love of his mother and father. If that is judged wrong, the world has lost its sense of proportion. We tried to have a baby by artificial insemination before Roberto died. If we had been successful, Milo would have been conceived during matrimony. What difference does it make that the conception occurred after Roberto's death?" The press focused on Milo for much of his early life, reporting on 'milestones' such as his first birthday and first day at school. After his mother's death, Milo revealed: "Mum collected all the newspaper articles I appeared in."

==Later life==

In the mid-1980s Casali moved the family to New South Wales, Australia, and bought a farm north of Sydney where she bred Arabian horses for several years. In 1990 she returned to England and settled in Leatherhead, Surrey. In 1996 Diane Blood, a widow, sought impregnation with her husband's sperm, and Casali gave a rare interview in which she "deplored the courts' involvement in Mrs Blood's case: such matters, she said, should be dealt with privately." Casali died due to cancer of the bone and liver in 1997.[tpl]Cite web|title=Myself|work=dcasali.com|accessdate=2011-09-22|url=http://www.dcasali.com/myself.html[/tpl]
