==Career==

Osment's acting career began at the age of four, when his mother took him to a new Ikea store and they encountered a talent scout looking for new actors. Osment put his name down and got called back for an audition. Asked to describe the biggest thing he had ever seen, Osment described an IMAX theater screen and won the part in a Pizza Hut TV commercial, advertising their "Big Foot" pizza. The commercial launched his career, and later that year he starred in the ABC TV sitcom Thunder Alley, his first role in series television.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/090299/ent_rave.shtml|title=Young actor receives rave reviews|last=King|first=Susan|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1999-09-02|accessdate=2008-10-02[/tpl] His first feature film role was as Forrest Gump's son, also named Forrest Gump, in the 1994 film of the same name.[tpl]cite news|title='Something Special' About Haley Joel Osment|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=2001-06-30[/tpl] He also had a small part in another 1994 film, Mixed Nuts.
