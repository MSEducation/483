Stereophonic Musical Listenings That Have Been Origin in Moving Film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" is the soundtrack to the 2006 mockumentary film Borat, released by (the heretofore nonexistent) "Kuzçek Records" in association with Downtown and Atlantic Records. The soundtrack was released digitally through the iTunes Store on October 24, 2006, and in stores and through other online music stores on Tuesday, October 31, 2006.

==Overview==

The folk music included in the soundtrack has no connection to the authentic music of Kazakhstan. The album features songs mainly by Gypsy artists and includes music by Erran Baron Cohen, founding member of ZOHAR Sound System and brother of Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen, as well as songs sung by Sacha Baron Cohen himself in character as Borat.
In 2006, Macedonian Romani singer Esma Redžepova planned to file a lawsuit against the producers of the movie together with Naat Veliov from Kočani Orkestar (BBC in Macedonian language). She claims that her song Chaje Šukarije, which is featured in the film, was used without authorization. She demanded a 800,000 euro ($1,000,000) compensation from the producers of the film, otherwise she claimed she would bring the case to court and demand a much higher amount.IMdb FAQ
O Kazakhstan is the fictional national anthem for Kazakhstan used in the movie.  It was composed by Erran Baron Cohen.  The tune of the song is similar to that of a military march.  The actual Kazakh anthem is "My Kazakhstan", the tune of which is not similar to O Kazakhstan.
In March 2012, the parody national anthem was mistakenly played at the H.H. The Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix in Kuwait. The Gold Winning medalist, Maria Dmitrienko, stood on the dais while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was re-staged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the Internet.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/borat-anthem-played-mistake-medals-ceremony-112050453.html|title=Borat anthem played by mistake at medals ceremony|work=Eurosport Yahoo!

==Usage of music in the film==

The album does not contain all songs used in the film. When Borat comes to New York, we briefly hear Harry Nilsson singing "Everybody's Talkin'"; when Borat sees Pamela on TV for the first time, we hear Berlin's "Take My Breath Away"; on the road we hear Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild"; when Borat says goodbye to Luenell we hear Bijelo Dugme's "Uspavanka za Radmilu M."; in a RV there is an excerpt of "U Can't Touch This". And some tracks on the official album are not used in the film, including the heavily altered version of "Born to Be Wild" by the Romanian brass band Fanfare Ciocărlia, and Borat's "You Be My Wife" and "In My Country There Is a Problem".
