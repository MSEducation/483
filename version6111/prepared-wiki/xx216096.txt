The West Port Book Festival is a book festival which is held in Edinburgh. It was run during the busy Edinburgh Festival season for its first years, but it now takes place at different times every year.
The festival was first run in 2008 for a four day stretch from 14–17 August.West Port Book Festival websiteScotland on Sunday 27 July 2008 - The Best Alternative The 2009 festival took place between 13–16 August.Scotland on Sunday, The Browser, 12 July 2009 It is of note due to its use of many working second-hand book shop venues in the West Port for most of the events, and its insistence on free tickets for entry. Although the West Port Book Festival has received some coverage claiming it was a formal rival to the much larger Edinburgh International Book Festival, the organisers stated that it was designed to complement rather than to challenge its much more famous cousin.Sunday Herald 6 August 2008
