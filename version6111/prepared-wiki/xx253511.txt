==Reception==

The film was not a commercial success, failing to make the Variety list of films that earned $1 million or more in rentals for 1959."1959: Probable Domestic Take", Variety, 6 January 1960 p 34 Fox executives later put this down to public rejection of Fabian, in particular the fact that his fans were very young and not ticket-buying teenagers. However Fox later found Fabian could be effective in supporting roles of major stars for the studios, such as John Wayne in North to Alaska and Bing Crosby in High Time.
