Rent is a rock musical with music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson[tpl]cite book | title=Rent| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl] based on Giacomo Puccini's opera La bohème. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York City's Lower East Side in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.
The musical was first seen in a limited three-week workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1994. This same off-Broadway theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official January 25, 1996 opening. The show's creator, Jonathan Larson, died suddenly the night before the off-Broadway premiere. The show won a Pulitzer Prize, and the production was a hit. The musical moved to Broadway's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.[tpl]cite book | title=Rent ("Glory")| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=54–64| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl]
On Broadway, Rent gained critical acclaim and won a Tony Award for Best Musical among other awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008 after a 12-year run of 5,123 performances, the tenth longest-running Broadway show at the time. The production grossed over $280 million.Time Magazine, March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66
The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions.  In 2005 it was adapted into a motion picture featuring most of the original cast members.

==Concept and genesis==

In 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create "a musical based on Puccini's La Bohème, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York."[tpl]cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith")| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=18–37| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl] In 1989 Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed a few songs together, including "Santa Fe", "Splatter" (later re-worked into the song "Rent"), and "I Should Tell You". Larson suggested setting the play in the East Village, the artsy avant-garde neighborhood of Manhattan down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment, and also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that "rent" also means torn apart.). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera "to bring musical theater to the MTV generation."[tpl]cite journal | last=Tommasini| first=Anthony| title=The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to Rent| journal=The New York Times| date=1996-03-17| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260| pages=Section 2 Page 7 | nopp=true[/tpl] Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds.
Jonathan Larson focused on composing Rent in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of seven years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.
As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of Rent featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as "You're A Fool", "Voice Mail #4", "Come To The Meeting", "Open Road", the predecessor of "What You Own"; "He Says", "On The Street #1-3", "You'll Get Over It", the predecessor of "Tango: Maureen," featuring Mark and Maureen; "Right Brain", later rewritten as "One Song Glory", featuring Roger; "Do A Little Business", the predecessor of "You'll See," featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins, and Angel; "Female to Female A & B," featuring Maureen and Joanne; and "Real Estate", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking. This workshop version of Rent starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on Rent, gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.[tpl]cite book|author=Rapp, Anthony|title=Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent|year=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster |ISBN=0-7432-6976-4[/tpl]
On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see Rent's success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. The first preview of Rent was canceled and instead, friends and family gathered at the theater where the actors performed a sing-through of Rent in Larson's memory.  The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop.  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, Rent moved to Broadway's recently remodeled Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.

==Sources and inspiration==

Larson's inspiration for Rent[tpl]'[/tpl]s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La bohème, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before Rent[tpl]'[/tpl]s premiere. La bohème was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rent[tpl]'[/tpl]s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Bohème, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La bohème is the opposite sex.
Other examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song "Light My Candle", which draws melodic content directly from "Che gelida manina";[tpl]cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=Ian|title=Transposition in Jonathan Larson's RENT|journal=Studies in Musical Theatre|date=2012|volume=5|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.1386/smt.5.3.225_1|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=12998/|accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl] "Quando me'n vo'" ("Musetta's Waltz"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and "Goodbye Love", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm|title=La bohème —Libretto in English|accessdate=|publisher=Kernkonzepte: Impresario|author=Puccini, Giacomo|authorlink=Giacomo Puccini[/tpl] "Quando me'n vo'" is paralleled in the first verse of "Take Me or Leave Me," when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, "Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song..."  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, "...that  doesn't remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'."
Rent is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in "Rent") made their way into the play.[tpl]cite journal|author=Beals, Gregory|title=The World of Rent|journal=Newsweek|date=1996-05-13|volume=CXXVII|issue=20|pages=58–59[/tpl] (Abstract) Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.
Playwright Sarah Schulman alleged that Rent bore striking similarities to her novel People in Trouble.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131017|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Sarah Schulman: the writer Rent ripped off|date=November 23, 2005|first=June|last=Thomas|publisher=Slate.com[/tpl]
The line, "I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films Mannequin (1987) and Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing, although Angel is a trans woman and Hollywood is a homosexual man; however, the line was originally in the film Car Wash (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.
The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like "Real Estate", which was later cut.SiteforRent.com accessed April 15, 2007.
Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. The Life Café, where the "La Vie Boheme" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml|title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|accessdate=2007-01-05|publisher=Life Cafe|year=2005, 1998|author=Ben Lerman; Andrew Jacobs|work=Life Press[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Rent ("Connection")| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=138–141| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl] The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village conflicts of the late 1980s that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.
"Will I?", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line in the single stanza of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali, and Pam carry the names of Larson's friends who died of AIDS. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) are changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who are living with or have died from AIDS.[tpl]cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed")| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=21| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl]
The scene and song "Life Support" was also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the "forget regret" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, "Then why choose fear?" Gordon says, "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life."

===Lynn Thomson controversy===

Lynn Thomson was a dramaturg who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework Rent. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a "new version" of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for $40 million USD and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the "new version" of Rent.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
During the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created. The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to Rent. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.dramaturgy.net/RENT/|title=The Rent Lawsuit Transcript Website |accessdate=2008-01-01|publisher=Dramaturgy.net|year=1998[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

On Christmas Eve 1987, Mark Cohen, an aspiring filmmaker, begins a new documentary, as his roommate, Roger Davis, tunes up his guitar ("Tune Up #1") but they are quickly interrupted by a call from Mark's mother, who claims she was sorry to hear about his break-up with Maureen Johnson ("Voicemail #1"). Roger and Mark's friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist and college professor, arrives at their building but is mugged. Meanwhile, Roger and Mark receive a call from their former friend and roommate Benjamin "Benny" Coffin III. Benny bought Mark and Roger's apartment building, as well as the lot next door after marrying into a wealthy family. He has plans to evict the homeless from the lot and build a Cyber Studio in its stead. He tells them last year's rent is due ("Tune Up #2").  The electrical power goes out.  Mark and Roger refuse to pay their rent ("Rent").  Meanwhile, a drag queen named Angel Dumott Schunard finds Collins on the street and gets him on his feet ("You Okay Honey?").  The two are immediately attracted to each other, and learn that they are both HIV positive.
Mark tries to get Roger out of the apartment. Mark reveals that Roger has been living in withdrawal for the past year due to his girlfriend April's suicide after discovering they both had HIV. Mark leaves to find Collins after reminding Roger to take his AZT ("Tune Up #3"). Roger attempts to write a great song to make his mark on the world before he dies ("One Song Glory"). Their downstairs neighbor, an exotic dancer named Mimi Marquéz walks in, asking Roger to light a candle for her, only to continually blow it out as she flirts with him ("Light My Candle"). Though he feels attracted to her, Roger is reluctant to begin a new relationship.
Joanne Jefferson, a lawyer and Maureen's new girlfriend, receives a phone call from her parents, wondering why she is stage managing for Maureen's protest against Benny's new Cyber Studio ("Voicemail #2"). Angel, now in drag, and Collins arrive at the apartment bearing gifts. Collins introduces Angel to his friends and Angel tells how she earned $1,000 by causing a noisy Akita to jump to its death ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives with an offer: if they convince Maureen to cancel her protest, he'll let them live in his new studio project, rent-free ("You'll See"). However, the two rebuff his offer. After Benny leaves, Angel and Collins invite Mark and Roger to attend a local HIV support group meeting.
Mark hurries off to help fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, only to run into Maureen's new girlfriend Joanne.  They overcome the awkwardness of their meeting and connect over their feelings for Maureen ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark then enters into the support group meeting ("Life Support"). Meanwhile, Mimi attempts to seduce Roger ("Out Tonight") but Roger harshly rebuffs her ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger admits to an empty apartment his fears about dying from AIDS while the life-support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I?").
Collins, Mark and Angel help a homeless woman who is being harassed by police officers. She then mocks Mark for trying to assuage his guilt ("On the Street"). Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York and opening up a restaurant in Santa Fe ("Santa Fe"). Soon after, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other ("I'll Cover You"). Joanne exasperatedly prepares for Maureen's show ("We're Okay").
Roger intercepts Mimi and apologizes for his behavior. He invites her to come to the protest and dinner with them, to which she agrees. Meanwhile, cops, vendors, and the people from the streets gather to watch the protest ("Christmas Bells").
Maureen arrives and begins her performance ("Over The Moon"). At the Life Café after the show, Benny criticizes the protest and the group's Bohemian lifestyle. Mark and all the bohemians in the café rise up and celebrate the Bohemian lifestyle ("La Vie Boheme A").
Benny tries to plant doubts in Mimi's mind about Roger. Mimi confronts Roger about ignoring her during dinner. Then, as Mimi's beeper goes off (reminding her to take her AZT) she and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and decide to move forward with their relationship ("I Should Tell You"). Joanne returns, explaining that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out. As the first act closes, Mark reveals that amidst the riot, Roger and Mimi share their first kiss ("La Vie Boheme B").

===Act II===

Opening with "Seasons of Love" the second act takes place over the course of the year following the first act ("Seasons of Love").
Having been locked out of their apartment by Benny; Mark, Roger, and the Bohemians gather to break-in ("Happy New Year A"). We learn through a series of voicemails ("Voicemail #3") that Mark had filmed the riot which had made the nightly news, and that he has a job offer from Alexi Darling at Buzzline, a tabloid news program.
The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives. He says he's there to call a truce. He reveals that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind by making sexual advances on him. Mimi denies seducing Benny, but the revelation that they had once been together upsets Roger. Roger and Mimi both apologize, but Mimi remains upset, and turns to the drug dealer for a fix ("Happy New Year B").
Maureen and Joanne have a fight, giving each other relationship ultimatums. Maureen's flirtatious ways and Joanne's controlling behavior are too much for the other to take, so they break up ("Take Me Or Leave Me"). The company sings a reprise of "Seasons of Love", as time passes and seasons change ("Seasons of Love B"). By spring, Roger and Mimi's relationship has become strained. Roger keeps talking about moving out of town. Mimi comes home late again, causing Roger to believe that she is cheating on him with Benny. Roger jealously storms out, Mimi stops him and tries to tell him the truth, that she is not cheating and that she is still using drugs, but can't get the words out, and Roger leaves. Alone in the apartment, Mimi sings of her love for Roger, and elsewhere, Roger sings of his love for Mimi ("Without You"). Collins continues nursing Angel, whose health is declining as AIDS begins to overtake her. Mark continues to receive calls from Alexi Darling ("Voicemail #4").  Eventually, Roger and Mimi, and Joanne and Maureen, reconcile.
A dance is performed representing the couples' sex-lives ("Contact"). At the climax of the number, Joanne, Maureen, Roger and Mimi break up again. At the same time, Angel passes away, leaving Collins heartbroken.  At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories of Angel, with Collins being the last to speak ("I'll Cover You Reprise").  Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS or break up ("Halloween"). He finally accepts the job offer from Buzzline. Roger reveals that he is leaving New York for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral. Maureen and Joanne realize their fighting is petty, and they reconcile. Mimi tries to go to Roger, but he turns away. After everyone leaves, Mark confronts Roger about his behavior towards Mimi. As the two friends fight, Mark reveals that Roger's feelings aren't jealousy towards Benny, but fear of losing Mimi to AIDS. As Roger leaves, he runs into Mimi, who tells him that she heard everything and just wanted to say goodbye to Roger ("Goodbye Love").  Benny and Mark offer to take Mimi to a rehab center, but she trails off on her own.  Collins is forcibly evicted from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral. Benny shows some compassion and pays for it himself.  Admitting that even he felt affection for Angel, Benny and Collins go to a bar to get drunk.
Feeling alone and conflicted, Roger and Mark separately reflect on their lives and on the past year with their friends.  Both reach an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory. Roger returns to New York just in time for Christmas, and Mark quits Buzzline to work on his own film ("What You Own").
Worried about their children not answering their calls, the cast's parents leave several messages on their phones ("Voicemail #5"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year after the start of the first act, Mark has finished his film and is ready to screen it. Roger has written his song but can't find Mimi anywhere. It is revealed that Benny's wife, finding out about Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code (A-N-G-E-L).  Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who is very weak and close to death. She begins to fade, but not before telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale A"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, which reveals the depths of his feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but suddenly awakens. She says that she was heading into a light, but Angel told her to go back. The surviving Bohemians gather together to rejoice and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other and reaffirm that there is "no day but today" ("Finale B").[tpl]cite book | title=Rent (no day but today)| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=188–189| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 [/tpl]

==Productions==

===New York workshops and off-Broadway production===

Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993.  A further two-week New York Theatre Workshop version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on January 25, 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews.  The New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley called it an "exhilarating, landmark rock opera" with a "glittering, inventive score" that "shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical."Brantley, Ben. "Rock Opera A la 'Boheme' And 'Hair'", The New York Times, February 14, 1996  Another reviewer wrote, "Rent speaks to Generation X the way that the musical Hair spoke to the baby boomers or those who grew up in the 1960s, calling it 'a rock opera for our time, a Hair for the 90s.'"[tpl]cite journal|title=The Birth of a Theatrical Comet|journal=The New York Times|date=1996-03-17|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B10F83D5D0C748DDDAA0894DE494D81|pages=Section 2 page 1|nopp=true[/tpl]  The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.

===Original Broadway production===

Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, Rent moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.  On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Rodney Hicks and Fredi Walker.
The production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation.[tpl]cite journal | author=Marks, Peter| title=Looking on Broadway For Ramshackle Home | journal=The New York Times | date=February 26, 1996| page=C9| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop[/tpl]  The production was nominated for ten Tony Awards in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?year=1996&show=Rent|title=Past Winners Search|accessdate=November 30, 2006 |publisher=IBM Corp., Tony Award Productions|work=The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards[/tpl]
On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, Friends In Deed and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of "Seasons of Love" as the finale of the performance.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|title=Rent's 10th Anniversary Celebration Will Reunite Past Bohemians, for Three Good Causes|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=2006-03-30|author=Jones, Kenneth |accessdate=November 30, 2006 [/tpl]

Original cast ensemble members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song "Seasons of Love". In addition, actress Tracie Thoms joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version.  The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.

===Early North American tours===

Successful United States national tours, the "Angel Tour" and the "Benny Tour", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-Equity tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the "Collins Tour").

The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, "They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity."Rent | Theatre story|Guardian Unlimited Arts  The production closed on February 2, 2008.Playbill News: New London Production of Rent to Close in February 2008

===RENT-heads===

Rent gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as "RENT-heads."  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show.Adams, Bob.  "Time for 'Rent'", The Philadelphia Gay News, August 14, 1998  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show.[tpl]cite journal|author=Riedel, Michael|title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office|date=1997-03-03|pages=27|url=http://www.nydailynews.com[/tpl] New York Daily News  Other Broadway shows have followed Rent's example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.
The term originated in Rent's first months on Broadway. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the Nederlander Theater - which is on 41st Street, just outside Times Square - to buy these tickets.[tpl]cite journal | author=Riedel, Michael | authorlink=| title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office| journal=| date=March 3, 1997| pages=27[/tpl] New York Daily News http://www.nydailynews.com/ Many RENTheads have seen the show dozens of times, some in various cities.[tpl]cite book | last = Larson  | first = Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Larson  | coauthors = Evelyn McDonnell with Katherine Silberger | title = RENT  | publisher = Rob Weisbach Books  | year = 1997  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-688-15437-9  | page = 133[/tpl]  At least one person has seen the show more than 1100 times over the course of the show's nearly 12 year run.
