==History==

===Formation===

ANA's earliest ancestor was [tpl]nihongo|Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane|日本ヘリコプター輸送|Nippon Herikoputā Yusō[/tpl], an airline company founded on 27 December 1952.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/corporate/history/main.html |publisher=ANA's history|title=All Nippon Airways|accessdate=September 20, 2008[/tpl] Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANA's IATA airline code, NH.
NH began helicopter services in February 1953. On 15 December 1953, it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove, JA5008. This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan. Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954, and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/ana-info/ana/ana_history/menu/chrono-52.html|title=企業情報 ANA history 1950's|publisher=www.ana.co.jp|accessdate=2009-12-10[/tpl] In 1955, the Douglas DC-3 plane began flying for NH as well, by which time the airline's route network extended from northern Kyūshū to Sapporo.
ANA's other ancestor was [tpl]nihongo|Far East Airlines|極東航空|Kyokutō Kōkū[/tpl]. Although it was founded on 26 December 1952, one day before NH, it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954, when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo, also using a de Havilland Dove. It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957, by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima.
FEA merged with NH in March 1958. The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen, and was Japan's largest private airline.  The merged airline, called All Nippon Airways, received a new Japanese name (全日本空輸 Zen Nippon Kūyu; Japan Air Transport). The company logo of the larger NH was selected as the logo of the new combined airline, and the new carrier operated a route network combined from its two predecessors.

===Domestic era===

ANA grew through the 1960s, adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961. October 1961 marked ANA's debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange.  1963 saw another merger, with Fujita Airlines, raising the company's capital to 4.65 billion yen.  In 1965 ANA introduced jets with Boeing 727s on the Tokyo-Sapporo route. It also introduced Japan's first homegrown turboprop airliner, the YS-11 in 1965, replacing Convair 440s on local routes. In 1969, ANA introduced Boeing 737 service.
As ANA grew it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region.   Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals. Some of these relationships continue today in different forms: for instance, Nagoya Railroad, which handled ANA's operations in the Chūbu region along with other partnerships,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200807.html |title=boeing | 1996 | 0807 | Flight Archive |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01[/tpl] maintains a permanent seat on ANA's board of directors.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/corporate/ir/pdf/gov/gov_091019.pdf |publisher=All Nippon Airways, Co. Ltd|title=Corporate Governance|accessdate=2012-10-01[/tpl] By 1974, ANA had Japan's largest domestic airline network.
While ANA's domestic operations grew, the Ministry of Transportation had granted government-owned Japan Airlines (JAL) a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986. ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights: its first was a 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on February 21, 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/ana-info/ana/ana_history/menu/chrono-70.html|title=企業情報 ANA history 1970's|publisher=www.ana.co.jp|accessdate=2009-12-10[/tpl]
ANA bought its first widebody aircraft, six Lockheed L-1011s, in November 1971, following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon, Japanese premier Kakuei Tanaka and UK premier Edward Heath (lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce). Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910475,00.html|title=Somebody Up There Likes Lockheed|publisher=Time|date=November 13, 1972|accessdate=2012-10-01[/tpl] The aircraft entered service on the Tokyo-Okinawa route in 1974. The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed. It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch: the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption.[tpl]cite news|title=Lockheed President A.

Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/corporate/galleryclassi/1983/762.html|title=ANA SKY WEB|publisher=www.ana.co.jp|accessdate=2009-08-19[/tpl] on Shikoku routes. The carrier's first 747s were the short-range SR variant, designed for Japanese domestic routes.

===International era===

In 1986, ANA began to expand beyond Japan's key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well. On 3 March 1986, ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam.'The History of ANA's 20 years of international flight Service', ANA Sky Web (June 2006)[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]. Retrieved 2 September 2006. Flights to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. followed by year's end, and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carrier's new flights to Narita.
ANA expanded its international services gradually: to Beijing, Dalian, Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987; to Seoul in 1988; to London and Saipan in 1989; to Paris in 1990 and to New York in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/ana-info/ana/ana_history/menu/chrono-80.html|title=企業情報 ANA history 1980's|publisher=www.ana.co.jp|accessdate=2009-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/ana-info/ana/ana_history/menu/chrono-90.html|title=企業情報 ANA history 1990's|publisher=www.ana.co.jp|accessdate=2009-12-10[/tpl] Airbus equipment such as the A320 and A321 was added to the fleet in the early 1990s, as was the Boeing 747-481 jet.

2004 saw ANA's profits exceed JAL's for the first time. That year, facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport, ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nb20041001a2.htm|publisher= Japan Times|title=??|date=1 October 2004|accessdate=2 September 2006[/tpl]

===Fleet history===

Originally, there was more than one YS-11 in the All Nippon Airways fleet, although most of the YS-11's were used under the name of ANK, or Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways.  The final YS-11 in operation was retired in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/tabi/news/20061001tb01.htm|title=国産旅客機ＹＳ―１１、惜しまれながら引退 : 旅得NEWSBOX : 旅ゅーん : YOMIURI ONLINE（読売新聞）|publisher=www.yomiuri.co.jp|accessdate=2009-12-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] A number of YS-11's are in museums, or otherwise scrapped or taken apart. After a final retirement process through September 2006, all YS-11's were downed, obligated to retire, unless privately owned and were privately renovated. The YS-11 was a big part of All Nippon Airways back in the 1970s to the early 1990s, when it was used as a domestic carrier throughout the Japanese industry of flight.
ANA flew their last flight of their Airbus A321 on February 29, 2008, which was flight 864 from Hakodate to Tokyo Haneda, arriving at Haneda at 20:25 (8:25 p.m.).

ANA is the launch customer for the new Boeing widebody, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ordering 50 examples with an option for 50 more during April 2004. Deliveries began in late 2011 when ANA received its first Dreamliner on 21 September 2011, the first ever Dreamliner to be delivered in the world. ANA split the order between 30 of the short-range 787-3 and 20 of the long haul 787-8, and during October 2004 announced it had selected Rolls-Royce to supply the engines. However, ANA later converted their -3 orders to the -8 variant. The aircraft will allow new routes to be opened to mid-sized cities not previously served, such as Barcelona, Boston, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Charlotte, Düsseldorf, Denver, Madrid, Miami and Montreal.

ANA reportedly considered purchasing 5 Airbus A380's according to Nikkei Business Daily. As surging fuel prices pressured airlines, ANA's fuel-saving options included possibly using the A380, which can carry more passengers on fewer flights; delays in the delivery of Boeing 787 also led ANA to consider purchasing A380s.All Nippon Airways to buy five A380s - Nikkei– July 4, 2008.

===New cabin===

Introduced in 2009, the "Inspiration of Japan" cabin features included fully-lie-flat-bed business class seats (the first for a Japanese airline[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]), nearly enclosed first class suite seats, fixed shell back seats in both of its economy classes (42-inch pitch in premium economy, which is shared for the largest pitch in its class along with its fellow Star Alliance member Thai Airways International on its Airbus A340-500s; 34-inch pitch in economy, above average than most airlines[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the entire sentence|date=December 2013[/tpl]), a new AVOD in-flight entertainment system (based on Panasonic Avionics Corporation's eX2 IFE system with iPod connectivity, in-seat shopping and meal ordering as well as cabin touchscreen consoles) as well as improvements to its in-flight service[tpl]Examples|date=December 2013[/tpl]. ANA will also introduce a new lounge (which opened on February 20, 2010, supposed to be in coincidence with the introduction of new aircraft interiors but delayed below) and check-in concept (later in autumn 2010) at Narita for first class and ANA Mileage Club's Diamond Service elite members.
The introduction of the concept also discontinued the use of the name "Club ANA", which was used for its international business class seats (changing into a generic business class name) as well as the name of the lounges (all lounges for both first class and business class are named "ANA Lounge", with the first class lounge called the "ANA Suite Lounge" and its arrival lounge the "ANA Arrival Lounge").
This "Inspiration of Japan" concept was originally set to debut on February 20, 2010 with the delivery of its new Boeing 777-300ER prior to that date, followed by the introduction of the concept on that date on the Narita-New York route. However, due to delays to the new premium economy seats, the debut was pushed back to April 19. (The delay was due to the failure of a safety test in Japan of a new seat design axle, made by seat manufacturer Koito Industries Ltd. This safety test failure also affected deliveries of aircraft to be operated by three other fellow Star Alliance members - Singapore Airlines for its A380s, Thai Airways' A330s, and Continental Airlines for new 737-800 deliveries.Singapore Air A380 Delivery Delayed on Lack of Seats[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gweeZMvDtADt1iX4UjL-uC3EzGCA|title=AFP: Japanese plane seat maker admits falsifying seat data|date=2010-02-09|publisher=AFP|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl])
