The Tombstone Western Film Festival and Symposium founded in 2001 is held in July in Tombstone, Arizona, a historic western mining town (and later ghost town) in the USA celebrated in western films as the site of the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral between Wyatt Earp and the Clantons and McLaurys.
The program in the first year was devoted to retellings of tales from Tombstone, the second year to classic TV Western.
