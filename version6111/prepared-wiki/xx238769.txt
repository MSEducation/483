==History==

Job Francis Dye (1807–1883) was born in Allen County, Kentucky. In 1830, he joined a party of trappers heading west from Fort Smith. After wintering and spending most of 1831 in Taos, New Mexico, Dye joined another band of trappers which arrived in Pueblo de Los Angeles early in 1832. After a year of sea otter hunting, he worked for Captain John B.R. Cooper on his Rancho El Sur from 1833-35. Moving north again, Dye rented a portion of Joaquin Buelna’s Rancho Zayante near Santa Cruz, and built a small grist mill and a distillery.Job F.

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.  As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Primer Cañon o Rio de Los Berrendos was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 12 ND and the grant was patented to Job Francis Dye in 1871.Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886
In 1857 Dye sold [tpl]convert|8000|acre|km2|1[/tpl] at the southern end of his grant to F.W. Fratt and T.K. King.  The boundary between Rancho Primer Cañon o Rio de Los Berrendos and Toomes Rancho Rio de Los Molinos grants was roughly Dye Creek.  However the location of the exact boundary was the cause of several lawsuits.F.W. Fratt vs R.B.Woodward, 1867, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the state of California, Volume 32, pp219-230, Bancroft-WhitneyF.W. Fratt vs A.C. Toomes, 1874, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the state of California, Volume 48, pp28-35, Bancroft-Whitney   In 1871, Robert Hurd Blossom (b. 1829) purchased F. W. Fratt's portion of the Dye Grant.  In 1882 Blossom sold it to Major Joseph Spencer Cone (1822–1894), who owned the greater portion of the Dye Grant, reuniting that rancho.  Cone also bought the northern half of the Toomes Grant.   Cone's widow, Anna R. Cone, sold Cone Ranch sold to the Los Molinos Land Company in 1905.Margaret Bauer, 1992,History of the Los Molinos Land Company and of Early Los Molinos, Tehama County Museum, Tehama, CA.
Dye was moderately successful in gold mining in 1848, and in 1853, he married Sarah Adeline Herrall (1826–1862).   After the death of his wife and daughter in 1862, he joined the Silver rush in Idaho and then Nevada.  Later, he moved to Santa Cruz County, California where he married Jemima Boyce (b. 1813), in 1873, and died there March 4, 1883.
