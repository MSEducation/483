==Education==

The Majority of schools follow either the Kenyan Curriculum or the British Curriculum. There is also International School of Kenya which follows the North American Curriculum and the German school in Gigiri.

===Higher education===

Multimedia University of Kenya or MMU is a university located 25 KM South of Nairobi in the rich and leafy suburb of Karen area adjoining CUEA. MMU is the top ranking public university in Kenya in ICT excellence. It is also the training centre for the Kenya ICT Board for SAP Skills and for the Africa program whose main purpose is to train African university graduates in software engineering.MMU is going to be involved in the development Konza Technology City.MMU Kenya is to accelerate the development of Kenya's Information and Knowledge sectors.
Nairobi is home to several universities.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

Major plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, Thika Road Bypass) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.
Kenya has signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.
Similarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.
The development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.

====Airports====

Nairobi is served primarily by Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. It is the largest airport in East and Central Africa.[tpl]cite web |last=Kenya Airports Authority|title=Welcome to Jomo Kenyatta Intl. Airport|publisher=kenyaairports.com|date= |url=http://www.kenyaairports.com/jkia/IndexJkia.php|accessdate=2007-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614042730/http://www.kenyaairports.com/jkia/IndexJkia.php  |archivedate = 14 June 2007[/tpl] The airport served 5,803,635 passengers in 2011, making it the ninth-busiest airport in Africa by total passengers.The airport is a major transit hub for passengers flying to East Africa's natural attractions, and other smaller cities in East and Central Africa. The airport is situated [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Nairobi's Central Business District. The airport directly serves intercontinental passengers from Europe and Asia. Recently, the airport was upgraded by the world aviation regulatory body, ICAO, and major plans are underway to expand the airport to accommodate growing air traffic and to cater for direct flights to far flung destinations such as the United States and Canada. Also, a debate is underway in government for a plan to add a second runway at the airport. However, this idea has not yet been ratified and approved by the Cabinet of the Kenya government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/jomo-kenyatta/ |title=JKIA Airport Expansion Plans |publisher=Airport-technology.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl]
Wilson Airport is a smaller and busy general aviation airport located in a south-central suburb of Nairobi West. It handles small aircraft that generally operate within Kenya, although some offer services to other East, Central and North-east African destinations.
Eastleigh Airport was the original landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was used as a landing point in the 1930s and 1940s British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south. The airport is now a military base.

====Matatu====

Matatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.
Matatu, which literally translates to "three cents for a ride" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport,[tpl]cite web |last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org|date= |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html|accessdate=2007-07-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070617215009/http://interns.unon.org/index+6.1.html |archivedate = 17 June 2007[/tpl] and generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus ama (or) mathree operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's destination is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Matatu drivers are pressured to make as many round trips as possible to maximise profits for their operator. Due to the intense competition between matutus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.
However, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe.[tpl]cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|accessdate=2006-07-03 [/tpl] At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to [tpl]convert|80|km/h|mph[/tpl].
In December 2010, the Government embarked on a policy to phase out matatus as a means of public transport. Consequently no new matatus are licensed to operate from January 2011 while the current ones will be allowed to live out their lifespan; a move aimed at enhancing the safety of citizens and visitors as well.

====Buses====

Buses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.
Companies such as; Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania,the Guardian Angel,Spanish and Mash Poa run
scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.

====Smartbus====

Smartbus-Kenya is the latest bus operator in Kenya and serves Nairobi and the areas around it. Presently, the company operates buses to Kitengela, Kiserian, Rongai, and Ngong. Passengers have a smartcard which they must swipe to gain access to the vehicle. Passengers top up their smartcard and the fare is deducted from the amount of money in the account. The fare is determined by the point at which the passenger enters and the point at which the passenger exits the bus.

====Trains====

Nairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic, but regular nightly passenger trains connect Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line.
The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country.
The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half.
Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses.
After the completion of the Syokimau Station, focus will be put on building other nine modern stations including those on Jogoo Road, Imara Daima and Makadara Estate.

====Taxi====

Taxis are available in most parts of the city. They are costly in comparison to matatus and buses but are a safer and more convenient form of transport. They park outside most hotels, at taxi ranks in the city centre, and at shopping malls.

====Roads====

Nairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, Westlands, etc. are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.
Highways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi,(A109), Kisumu, Nakuru, Eldoret, Namanga Border Tanzania(A104) etc.
Nairobi is currently undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now, though, are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.
The proposed Nairobi Bypasses are currently under construction by the Kenyan government and financed by Chinese Government. Their construction seeks to ease congestion in Nairobi's downtown area and the surrounding suburbs.
The Bypasses will comprise the:

===Water supply and sanitation===

94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses – technically called non-revenue water – are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence. In the middle of a severe drought, the board of the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company was sacked July 2009 for "malpractices", following the publication of a report by Transparency International-Kenya and the Kenyan NGO Maji Na Ufanisi (Water and Development). The report had found cases of bribery for illegal connections, tampering with meter readings, and diversion of water from domestic users to industries in five cities, with the highest incidence of bribery in Nairobi.[tpl]cite web|last=IRC E-source|title=Kenya: Nairobi water board sent packing following reports on malpractices|url=http://www.source.irc.nl/page/49480|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=7 August 2009[/tpl]

===Housing===

There is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are average and poor. Half of the population have been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/Issue1PIMag05/Sheehan%20article.htm |title=Where the Sidewalks End |publisher=Globalurban.org |date=11 September 2001 |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl] The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa,[tpl]cite news |last=BBC News |title=Living amidst the rubbish of Kenya's slum |publisher=http://news.bbc.co.uk/ |date= 20 September 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4261846.stm |accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl] and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning "forest" or "jungle").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=62409 |title=IRIN In-Depth | KENYA: Kibera, The Forgotten City | East Africa | Kenya | Environment Urban Risk | In-Depth |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl] The slums cover two square kilometres[tpl]cite web |last=CSG Kibera |title=What is Kibera? |publisher=http://www.csgkibera.org/ |date= |url=http://www.csgkibera.org/ |accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl] and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.
Other notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.[tpl]cite web |last=High Beam Encyclopedia |title=The slums of Nairobi: explaining urban misery |publisher=encyclopedia.com |date= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-150852093.html |accessdate=2007-07-02[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.
To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities.[tpl]cite web |last=Kenya Engineer |title=Housing estate being developed at Stoney Athi |publisher=kenyaengineer.com |date= |url=http://www.kenyaengineer.com/newsdetails.php?NewsID=314&AuthorID=45&CountryID=7&NewsTypeID=16&IssueID=36 |accessdate=2007-07-02[/tpl] The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, June 2011, and various others.

==Crime and law enforcement==

Throughout the 1990s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname "Nairobbery". In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as "status C". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DE143DF93AA15752C1A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=U.N.

However, many claim[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
In 2006, crime decreased in the city,[tpl]cite web |last=Kenya Police|title=Comparative Crime Figures for the Year 2005 and 2006 |publisher=http://www.kenyapolice.go.ke/ |date= |url=http://www.kenyapolice.go.ke/resources/com_2.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl] due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department has announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years.OSAC – Kenya 2007 Crime & Safety Report[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.

==Media==

Nairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to East Africa's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.
Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi.
