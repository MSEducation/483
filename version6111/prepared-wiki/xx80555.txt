[[Drider]]

CATEGORIES: Dungeons & Dragons aberrations, Dungeons & Dragons standard creatures

In the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game, a drider is an aberration that was formerly a drow (dark elf). Driders are centaur-like creatures in the game, appearing as drow from the waist up, with their lower portions replaced by the abdomen and legs of immense spiders. They are most commonly found in the Underdark.

==Publication history==

The drider was introduced to the D&D game in the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. In the game, they are drow which have been transformed from the waist down so they have the lower body of a spider. The transformation is typically a punishment for offending their goddess, Lolth, or failing one of her tests.

==Ecology==

In Dungeons & Dragons, only high-level priestesses in good standing with Lolth are able to initiate the transformation of a dark elf into a drider. This transformation is very painful, and lasts at least 12 hours. Driders develop a poisonous bite. Their digestion changes and they must drink blood of living creatures for sustenance. Driders still maintain the spells and special abilities they had developed as a drow. There can exist any character class of drider. They retain intelligence and memories. This usually makes them bitter, spiteful creatures. Some hunt for magic powerful enough to undo the transformation.
In previous editions, driders appear sexless due to bloating, but able to magically reproduce. In Dungeons & Dragons edition 3.5, driders seem to retain their gender and characteristics after the transformation, but fertility is debatable.

==Society==

In the Dungeons & Dragons world, driders play many roles in drow society. The dark elves both fear and are revolted by driders. After transformation, they are usually pushed to the wild area around a drow city. Driders are usually found in company with tiny, huge and giant spiders. Driders speak Common, Elvish, and Undercommon. In the first and second editions of the game, Driders spoke Drow. Driders are almost always Chaotic Evil.
In the Fourth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, becoming a drider is actually considered holy and a blessing from Lolth.

==In other campaign settings==

In the Eberron campaign setting, driders exist as creatures independent from the drow society. Because Vulkoor, the principle drow deity in Eberron, has an affinity for scorpions rather than spiders, the conceptual role occupied by driders in other settings is instead filled with the scorrow, a tauric race hybridizing drow with scorpions. Primary differences lie in that scorrow are not outcasts, instead they are revered by the drow, but form independent communities, rather than scavenging on the fringes of drow society as in driders. They are also a true-breeding race.[tpl]cite web |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer) |title=Scorpions |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/eo/20040709a |date=2004-07-09 |accessdate=2006-12-11[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Baker |first=Keith |title=Secrets of Xen'drik |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |year=2006 |isbn=0-7869-3916-8[/tpl]  Scorrow also replace the similarly centauroid scorpionfolk within the setting.[tpl]cite book |last=Wyatt |first=James |authorlink=James Wyatt (game designer) |title=Player's Guide to Eberron |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |year=2005 |isbn=0-7869-3912-5[/tpl]
In the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting, the campaign setting used by Paizo Publishing's Pathfinder products, driders are not drow punished by any deity but have instead been punished by other drow through a method known as "fleshcrafting."Paizo blog, September 2008.

==Driders in other media==

In the Drowtales universe, driders come in three "breeds":	
Driders also appear in the popular webcomic series Spinnerette in the role of supervillains.
