The Queensland Nurses' Union, officially the Queensland Nurses' Union of Employees, (QNU) is a trade union that represents nurses and midwives in both the public and private sectors of Queensland, Australia. It was formed on 8 November 1921 under the name of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association (Queensland Branch) Union of Employees . Its current incarnation began in 1982 when the union broke away from the then Royal Australian Nursing Federation, now simply known as the Australian Nursing Federation (ANF).
Before being known as officially the  Queensland Nurses' Union of Employees, the QNU went under the name of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation, Queensland Branch, Union of Employees. This royal title was assumed, like other branches of the federation, in 1956 to mark the Queen's visit to Australia.
The QNU is affiliated with the Queensland Council of Unions, and in the late 1980s signed a "harmonisation" agreement with the ANF which recognises members of the QNU as members of the Queensland Branch of the ANF.
On 20 September 2010 the union announced it was going to sever official ties with the Australian Labor Party from 2011.QNU and the ALP Affiliation statement (press release), 20 September 2010, QNU website.
