Get Carter is a 1971 British crime film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Michael Caine, Ian Hendry,[tpl]cite web|title=Official Website of Ian Hendry|url=http://www.ianhendry.com|accessdate=6 July 2013[/tpl] Britt Ekland, John Osborne and Bryan Mosley. The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis' 1969 novel Jack's Return Home. Producer Michael Klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio to finance and release the film, bringing in Hodges and Caine. Caine became a co-producer of the film. Get Carter was Hodges' first feature film as director, as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong. MGM was scaling back its European operations and the film became the last project approved before the American company closed its Borehamwood studios. The film is set in North East England and was filmed in and around Newcastle Upon Tyne, Gateshead, and County Durham.
The story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), who travels back to his hometown to discover more about the events surrounding his brother Frank's supposedly-accidental death. Suspecting foul play, he investigates and interrogates, getting a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element; with vengeance on his mind, the situation builds to a violent conclusion.[tpl]cite web|last=M|first=Dawson|title=British Masterpiece: Get Carter|url=http://www.leftfieldcinema.com/british-masterpiece-get-carter|work=Left Field Cinema|publisher=Left Field Cinema 2008 – 2009|accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl]
Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of on-screen violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film. Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter. Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film. This, combined with Hodges' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the one-armed bandit murder) and use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes. The shoot was incident free and progressed speedily, despite a one day strike by the Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with location shooting lasting 40 days.
Get Carter suffered in its promotion, firstly from MGM's problems and secondly due to the declining British film industry of the period, which relied increasingly on US investment. Initial UK critical reaction to the film was mixed, with British reviewers grudgingly appreciative of the film's technical excellence, but dismayed by the complex plotting, the excessive violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse at his actions.[tpl]cite book |last=Mayer|first=Geoff|title=Guide to British Cinema (Reference Guides to the World's Cinema)|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-30307-4 |page=149 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7FOX_OWDyHEC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=get+carter+budget+mgm#v=onepage&q=get%20carter%20budget%20mgm&f=false[/tpl] Despite this the film did good business in the UK and produced a respectable profit. Conversely, US critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film, but it was poorly promoted in the States by United Artists and languished on the drive in circuit while MGM focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation remake, Hit Man. On its release the film received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered. However, despite its lack of availability on home media until 1993 it always maintained a cult following. Endorsements from a new generation of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie[tpl]cite news |last=Crossan |first=Rob|title=Defining Moment: ‘Get Carter’ rewrites the gangster movie, March 1971 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25adefe8-9c0f-11de-b214-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1pJXFzqcD |accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=Financial Times Magazine|date=12 September 2009[/tpl] led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognised as one of the best British movies of all time. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time.[tpl]cite web|title=Get Carter tops British film poll |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3711460.stm |accessdate=6 April 2012 |publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2004[/tpl] Get Carter was remade in 2000 by Warner Bros. under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter, while Caine appears in a supporting role. This remake was not well received by critics in the USA and was not given a UK theatrical release.

==Plot==

Newcastle-born gangster Jack Carter has lived in London for years in the employ of organised crime bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher. Jack is sleeping with Gerald's girlfriend Anna and plans to escape to South America with her. But first he must return to Newcastle and Gateshead to attend the funeral of his brother Frank, who died in a purported drunk-driving accident. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral, Jack meets with his teenage niece Doreen and Frank's evasive mistress Margaret. It is later implied that Doreen might actually be Jack's daughter.
Jack goes to Newcastle Racecourse seeking old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother's death. Swift evades him, but he encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who is now employed as a chauffeur and refuses to tell Jack who his employer is. Tailing Eric to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear, Jack bursts in on Kinnear playing poker, and meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. Having learned little, Jack leaves. Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone. He is given the name "Brumby".
Jack knows Cliff Brumby as a businessman with controlling interests in local seaside amusement arcades. Visiting Brumby's house, Jack discovers the man knows nothing about him; believing he has been set up, he leaves. Next morning, two of Jack's London colleagues arrive, sent by the Fletchers to take him back, but he escapes. Jack meets Margaret to talk about Frank, but Fletcher's men are waiting and pursue him. He is rescued by Glenda who takes him in her sports car to meet Brumby at his new restaurant development at the top of a multi-storey car park. Brumby identifies Kinnear as Frank's killer, explaining that Kinnear is trying to take over his business. He offers Jack £5,000 to kill the crime boss, which he refuses.
Jack has sex with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches a pornographic film. The participants are Doreen, Glenda, Margaret, and Albert. Doreen is forced to have sex with Albert. Overcome with emotion, Jack becomes enraged and half drowns Glenda as she is taking a bath. She tells him the film was Kinnear's and she thinks Doreen was 'pulled' by Eric. Forcing Glenda into the boot of her car, Jack drives off to find Albert.
Jack tracks Albert down in a betting shop. Albert confesses that he told Brumby that Doreen was Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear. Eric and two of his men arranged Frank's death. Information extracted, Jack fatally knifes Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. Jack shoots one of them dead; Eric and the others escape, then push the sports car into the river, with Glenda trapped inside. Returning to the car park, Jack finds Brumby, beats him senseless, and throws him over the side to his death. He then posts the pornographic film to the Vice Squad at Scotland Yard in London.
Jack abducts Margaret at gunpoint. He telephones Kinnear in the middle of a wild party, telling him he has the film and making a deal to give him Eric in exchange for his silence. Kinnear agrees, sending Eric to an agreed location; however, he simultaneously phones a hitman to dispose of Jack. Jack drives Margaret to the grounds of Kinnear's estate, kills her with a fatal injection and leaves her body there. He then calls the police to raid Kinnear's party.
Jack chases Eric along a beach. He forces Eric to drink a full bottle of whisky as he did to Frank, then beats him to death with his shotgun. As Jack is walking along the shoreline, he is shot through the head by the hitman with a sniper rifle.

==Casting==

There was pressure from MGM to have more big-name American stars in the film, which was successfully resisted by Hodges. As well as Telly Savalas, names posited by Klinger and studio executives were Joan Collins, and someone Hodges described as "the Canadian lead actress in TV's Peyton Place", which most probably means Barbara Parkins. The production also utilised a large number of extras, most of whom were locals who just happened to be on scene when filming was happening. Others were sourced from local casting company Beverley Artistes, which sent everyone registered with it for audition, one of these being Deana Wilde, who was cast as the pub singer. Several of the company's actors were also in background shots in the film including the casino, streets, bars and the police raid scene.[tpl]cite news|title=Get Carter celebrates its 40th anniversary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/front_page/newsid_9421000/9421191.stm|accessdate=20 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 March 2011[/tpl]
Mike Hodges recruited a band of experienced character actors to play the small supporting roles. Kevin Brennan appears as Harry the card-player. Godfrey Quigley was cast as Eddie, a work colleague of Frank Carter's. Rosemarie Dunham plays Edna Garfoot, in her (credited) film debut.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] Ben Aris, who plays the architect, is better known for British situation comedies.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Carl Howard's character of the assassin, "J", is only identified by the initial on his ring, in his only film role, and an appropriate mystery surrounds his real identity. His name does not appear on the credits of some prints. Mike Hodges explained that Howard was an extra on his TV film, Rumour, and the director gave him a line to say, but another extra was wrongly credited. Hodges promised he would make it up to him and cast him in Carter, but his name was missed off some of the original prints. When the film credits were printed in the Radio Times and TV Times Howard was also trimmed. Hodges said in 2002 "Carl and credits don't seem destined for each other".Chibnall, p. 35

==Production==

===Development===

In the late 1960s film censorship relaxation produced an increase in dark, uncompromising films, with many directors pushing the boundaries of acceptability. Get Carter was a film which explored this freedom.[tpl]cite web|last=Good|first=Oliver|title=The crime-genre game-changer Get Carter turns 40. Mar 20, 2011|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/the-crime-genre-game-changer-get-carter-turns-40|work=The National|publisher=Abu Dhabai Media|accessdate=10 March 2012[/tpl] The film went from concept to finished film in just 10 months.
In 1969 producer Michael Klinger devised plans for a gangster film to capitalise on public interest in the British criminal underworld after the Kray Twins' convictions. Klinger was invited to view a first print of Peter Walker's Man of Violence (1969) and was unimpressed, telling the director "I'm going to make a gangster film, but it's going to cost a lot more than this and it's going to be better".Chibnall, p. 21
After searching many publishers for material to adapt into a film, Klinger purchased the rights to Ted Lewis's novel Jack's Return Home. Andrew Spicer has written that "he Klinger sensed its potential to imbue the British crime thriller with the realism and violence of its American counterparts".[tpl]cite web|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=The Creative Producer – The Michael Klinger Papers|url=http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/pub2.htm|work=Andrew Spicer, University of the West of England: The Creative Producer – The Michael Klinger Papers; • Paper Given at the University of Stirling Conference, Archives and Auteurs – Filmmakers and their Archives, 2–4 September 2009|publisher=uwe|accessdate=20 February 2012|archiveurl=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/pub2.htm|archivedate=24 February 2012[/tpl]
Klinger had been approached in 1969 by another producer Nat Cohen to make a couple of films for MGM.Steve Chibnall, Robert Murphy (eds.) British Crime Cinema, London: Routledge, 1999, p.128 In financial trouble and in shutting down its British operations, MGM was in the process of closing its British studios at Borehamwood[tpl]cite book|last=Murphy|first=Robert|title=British Crime Cinema (British Popular Cinema) |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=UK |isbn=978-0-415-16870-0|page=128|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_--Ebdp6mwAC&lpg=PA128&ots=XKjz5nYrQ6&dq=michael%20klinger%20mgm&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q=michael%20klinger%20mgm&f=false|coauthors=Steve Chibnall[/tpl] and was looking to make smaller-budget films to turn a profit. At this time Klinger's friend Robert Littman had been appointed head of MGM Europe and so Klinger took his proposal to him.Chibnall, p. 21 MGM agreed a reasonable but below average of 750,000 (there is some dispute as to whether it was dollars or pounds[tpl]cite web|last=Klinger|first=Tony|title=Interview with Mike Hodges|url=http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/mhodges.htm|work=The Michael Klinger Papers|publisher=University of West England|accessdate=10 March 2012|coauthors=Andrew Spicer[/tpl]) for the production.[tpl]cite book|last=Mayer|first=Geoff|title=Encyclopedia of film noir|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=England |isbn=978-0-313-33306-4|page=195|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RsBHnZoyO4kC&lpg=PA193&ots=BMMmVy4AyE&dq=michael%20klinger%20mgm&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q=michael%20klinger%20mgm&f=false[/tpl] Within months of agreeing the deal MGM had pulled out of the UK.Chibnall, p. 21 Klinger had seen Mike Hodges' television film Suspect (1969) and immediately decided he was the ideal candidate to direct his new project. Hodges had also previously worked on current affairs programme World in Action, the arts programme Tempo and a 1968 children's television serial, The Tyrant King, and all these past experiences informed his approach to his film debut.[tpl]cite journal|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Great Directors: Mike Hodges|journal=Senses of Cinema|year=2006|issue=40|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/great-directors/hodges/|accessdate=11 March 2012[/tpl]
Klinger contacted Hodges on 27 January 1970 with a copy of Jack's Return Home and contracted him[tpl]cite web|last=Jakubowski|first=Maxim|title=A Conversation with Writer/Director Mike Hodges|url=http://www.mulhollandbooks.com/2010/11/01/an-interview-with-writerdirector-mike-hodges/|work=Mulholland Books|publisher=Mulholland Books|accessdate=9 March 2012[/tpl] to direct and adapt the screenplay, paying him a flat fee of £7,000 for his services. Hodges' original working title for the film was Carter's The Name.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b3uW92r5gB0C&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Get Carter |page=23 |first=Steve |last=Chibnall|publisher=I.B.Tauris|date= July 2003 |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] Steve Chibnall writes: "his treatment retained the essential structure of Lewis's novel with its strong narrative drive, but introduced some minor changes to characterisation and more fundamental alterations to narratology". As Ted Lewis had not specified where his novel was set, Hodges felt free to relocate the story[tpl]cite news|last=Hodges|first=Mike|title=Mike Hodges: A concrete monstrosity, but it was perfect for my film|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/mike-hodges-a-concrete-monstrosity-but-it-was-perfect-for-my-film-2035420.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=26 July 2010[/tpl] to a place he was familiar with, considering Grimsby, Lowestoft, Hull and North Shields before deciding on Newcastle Upon Tyne. Hodges said he was influenced in his writing by the works of Raymond Chandler and Hollywood B-movies such as Kiss Me Deadly as they showed "how to use the crime story as an autopsy on society's ills". He did not however employ a traditional noir motif of using a voiceover to expose the characters inner feelings. He also dispensed with flashbacks to Carter's youth featured in the novel which explored his relationship with his brother Frank, streamlining the plot to a linear narrative spanning a single weekend. As Chibnall writes [tpl]cquote|The immediate consequence was the loss of the insights into Carter's motivations provided by his memories of boyhood and his relationships with brother Frank and delinquent gang leader Albert Swift. Also lost was the backstory of Carter's dealings with Eric Paice during their time as rival gangsters in London, in particular, Eric's violent treatment of Carter's lover Audrey (Anna in the screenplay) the memory of which fuels Carter's hatred.[/tpl]
 The significance of the double barrel shotgun as Carter's choice of weapon (which in the novel symbolises family ties and Carter's memories of more innocent times hunting with his brother) was lost in the film adaptation.
Carter's killing of BrumbyChibnall, 2003, p. 81 and his own assassination were further alterations from the novel, emphasising the film's parallels with revenge tragedy and Carter's role as what Geoff Mayer calls "the moral agent... a "knight" forced to dispense his own sense of justice in a corrupt world".[tpl]cite book|last=Mayer|first=Geoff |title=Encyclopedia of FIlm Noir|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-313-33306-4 |page=195 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RsBHnZoyO4kC&lpg=PA195&ots=BMMoYybBxx&dq=carter%20knifed%20by%20eric&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q=carter%20knifed%20by%20eric&f=false|edition=1st|coauthors=Bill McDonnell|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] However in his DVD commentary Hodges implies that he did not see Carter as morally any more justified than those he kills, and his death is intended to present his actions to the audience as morally bankrupt and futile; "I wanted him to be dealt with in exactly the same way he dealt with other people. Now that's a sort of Christian ethic in a way ... That was a prerequisite of the film for me, that the hitman should go click and that's it".Chibnall, 2003, p. 88

===Pre-production===

Locations along the east coast of England had been scouted by Hodges and Klinger in the spring of 1970, to find a landscape that suggested a "hard, deprived background". Newcastle was selected after Hodge's first choice of Hull proved to be unsuitable. Hodges thoroughly researched the local Newcastle crime scene, adapting the script to make use of settings and incorporating elements of his research into the story. His background at World in Action had made him accustomed to making films based on hard investigation and this informed his approach to Get Carter. One of the first locations which attracted Hodge's attention was the Trinity Square multi-storey car park, which dominated the centre of Gateshead. To Hodges, the car park and the cast iron bridges over the Tyne, "seemed to capture the nature of Jack Carter himself". The car park symbolises one of the films more subtle themes, which is the destruction of an old cityscape and its rebuilding in line with modern brutalism.[tpl]cite news|last=Harris|first=John|title=Get Carter: In search of lost Tyne|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/mar/03/get-carter-40th-anniversary|accessdate=27 February 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 March 2011[/tpl] Hodges described how wandering alone through the upper structure, he realised how the different levels could be used to reveal the hunter, Carter, and the hunted, Brumby, simultaneously but without either being aware of the other – adding to the suspense. The shopping centre and car park were closed in early 2008, and demolished in late 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=Demolition of Gateshead Get Carter car park starts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-10759090|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=26 July 2010[/tpl]
The location for Cyril Kinnear's house, Dryderdale Hall, near Hamsterley, Bishop Auckland, provided a real-life connection with organised crime.[tpl]cite news|title=Get Carter mansion up for sale|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7325054.stm|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 April 2008[/tpl] It was the recently vacated country house of North East fruit machine businessman Vince Landa, who had fled the country in 1969 after the murder of his right hand man Angus Sibbett, the so-called One-armed bandit murder. Many believed the crime was part of a failed attempt by the Kray twins to gain control of the Newcastle underworld;[tpl]cite web|title=Michael Luvaglio / Dennis Stafford 12 years in prison, released on licence in 1979 |url=http://www.innocent.org.uk/cases/staffordluvaglio/luvaglio_stafford.pdf |work=Innocent.org |publisher=Innocent |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Hildred|first=Stafford|title=I'll prove I was framed says gangster jailed for Get Carter murder|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-557457/Ill-prove-I-framed-says-gangster-jailed-Get-Carter-murder.html#ixzz1nRY485FK|accessdate=26 February 2012|newspaper= The Daily Mail|date=6 April 2008[/tpl] Michael Klinger and the MGM publicity spokesman dismissed the use of the location as mere coincidence; however Hodges was aware of the significance of the house and chose it deliberately. Steve Chibnall writes "It proved a perfect location, wreaking [tpl]sic[/tpl] of authenticity and full of useful details such as the cowboys and indians wallpaper...the African shield and crossed spears on the wall of the crime lord's living room". The Landa case also is referenced at the start of the film with a shot of a newspaper bearing the headline "Gaming Wars".[tpl]cite news|last=Wilson|first=Bill|title=Chequered career of 'human rights' convict|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2012084.stm|accessdate=26 February 2012|newspaper= BBC News|date=28 May 2002[/tpl] Other locations in Newcastle and Gateshead, Northumberland and County Durham were also used.[tpl]cite web|title=Film Locations for Get Carter|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/g/getcarter.html|work=The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations|publisher=The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations|accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Walker/Wallsend – Hebburn FerrY|url=http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/walker.html|work=Bridges on the Tyne|publisher=Bridges on the Tyne 2006|accessdate=20 March 2012[/tpl]

===Filming===

Principal photography took place in the North-East from 17 July – 15 September 1970. Hodges favoured the use of long-distance lenses (as he had used previously on Rumour) in many scenes to create a naturalistic documentary feel, especially in crowd scenes. The film was shot in "Metrocolor", which was MGM's trade name for films processed at its Eastmancolor laboratory. This lab processed Kodak's Eastman Color Negative, so it is most likely the film was shot on this stock.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hanson|first= Wesley T. Jr.|title= Color Negative and Color Positive Film for Motion Picture Use.|journal= Journal of the SMPTE|date= March 1952|volume= 58|pages= 223–238[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Pomerance|first=Murray|title=Notes on Some Limits of Technicolor: The Antonioni Case|journal=Senses of Cinema |year=2009 |issue=53 |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2009/feature-articles/notes-on-some-limits-of-technicolor-the-antonioni-case/ |accessdate=16 March 2012|authorlink=Murray Pomerance |editor1-first=Caputo|editor1-last=Rolando|publisher=Senses of Cinema Inc|location=Australia[/tpl] Asked to comment on what he was aiming for in the look of the film, cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky said "The camera work on it... it was very influenced by Mike Hodges who has a very good eye for setups and he of course conferred with his operator and myself, but he influenced all of us, and much of the good look is due to him, I confess. My main task was lighting on location, very moderately, and waiting for the right daylight and setting the exposure on the lens".[tpl]cite web|last=Donat|first=Misha|title=Wolfgang Suschitzky: "Get Carter" with Mike Hodges and Michael Caine|url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/22808?o=MS|work=Web of stories 06 August 2009|publisher=webofstories|accessdate=21 February 2012[/tpl] On the first week of shooting in Newcastle, the ACTT called the crew out on one day strike.[tpl]cite web|last=Cairns|first=David|title=An interview with Mike Hodges, April 10, 2010|url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/2010/04/10/an-interview-with-mike-hodges/|work=Britmovie.com|publisher=britmovie.co.uk|accessdate=9 March 2012[/tpl] At the advice of Richard Lester, Hodges and his assistant director stayed at a separate hotel to the rest of the cast and crew, which enabled him to have some respite from the production after the shooting day was done. Klinger was present on set for much of the film shoot. However Hodges said he encountered very little interference by the producer. At one point Klinger and Caine asked if Hodges might work in a "chase sequence" but he persuaded them that it would draw too many comparisons with Bullitt.(a chase sequence between Carter and the London gangsters is mentioned in the shooting script)Chibnall, 2003, p. 80 Hodges tried to rehearse the racecourse scene between Caine and Hendry in their hotel the night before but "Hendry's drunken and resentful state forced Hodges to abandon the attempt" (Chibnall 2003).Chibnall, 2003, p. 56 Hodges described Caine as "a complete dream to work with". Caine only lost his temper once on set, during the very tense and emotional day filming in Glenda's flat, when the focus puller ruined his first take. Caine apologised immediately.
The most complicated scene to shoot was Kinnear's game of cards. There are four simultaneous conversations, with a lot of plot exposition and the introduction of two important characters, Kinnear and Glenda. The technical complexity was compounded by the variation in light coming through the windows and Osborne's whispered delivery,Chibnall, p. 57 which made microphone placement difficult. Hodges moved the camera and the boom closer to Osborne as the scene progressed. Chibnall says that Hodges regretted not rehearsing the scene more thoroughly.
In shooting the scene in which Carter throws Brumby to his death from the multi-storey car park, Hodges used four shots: one of the pair struggling high up on the stairs; one from the lowest level of the stairwell where Caine actually threw Bryan Moseley over the side onto mattresses; one shot of a dummy falling; and one of the body of Brumby on top of a crushed car.
Carter's climactic pursuit of Eric used an amalgamation of two locations spaced [tpl]convert|35|mi|km[/tpl]apart: Blyth staithes and Blackhall Beach near Blackhall Colliery."The 50 best beach scenes in the movies", The Daily Telegraph, 23 August 2008[tpl]cite news|title=Hoping to get Caine for coastal spectacle|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2000/08/28/The+North+East+Archive/7131798.Hoping_to_get_Caine_for_coastal_spectacle/|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Northern Echo|date=28 August 2000[/tpl] The chase scene was shot in reverse, with Hodges filming Eric's death scene first because of Hendry's poor condition, Hodges being worried that he would be too out of breath to play the death scene after running. Hodges chose the beach for its bleak, dark atmosphere but when he returned to shoot the scene he found it bathed in bright sunshine, unsuitable for the sombre conclusion he was hoping for. He waited hours until the sun began setting to capture the overcast shadowy lighting seen in the film.Chibnall, 2003, p. 86 The film shows the beach black with coal spoilings, dumped there by the mine's conveyor system. The conveyor system, a common sight on the East Durham coast, was known locally as 'The Flight'. In the early 2000s, £10 million was spent removing these conveyors and the concrete towers, and cleaning tons of coal waste from the beaches of East Durham. The cleaning programme was known as 'Turning the Tide'.[tpl]cite news|last=Nelson|first=Richard |title=Northern revival |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/feb/16/walkingholidays.unitedkingdom.guardiansaturdaytravelsection |accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 February 2002[/tpl]

===Post production===

Klinger was a very hands-on producer and was present during shooting and in post production. He suggested Hodges use John Trumper as editor. Hodges said that he and Trumper argued and disagreed constantly, but he still thought he was a "brilliant, brilliant editor" and was "very grateful to him for ...how much he contributed". Sound editing and dubbing was done by Jim Atkinson, who Hodges described as "so obsessive about the job". He gave Hodges multiple possibilities of how the sound could be dubbed and explored every angle. Klinger was worried that the debut director may be overwhelmed with too many options, but Hodges said he and Atkinson got on very well.

===Music===

The majority of the music in the film was composed by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who had previously worked on soundtracks for Soldier Blue and Flight of the Doves. Budd composed 13 distinct pieces for the film,[tpl]cite web|title=Roy Budd – Get Carter (An Original Soundtrack Recording)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Roy-Budd-Get-Carter-An-Original-Soundtrack-Recording/release/607106|work=Discogs|accessdate=19 March 2012[/tpl] including three songs, Looking For Someone, Love Is A Four Letter Word (with lyrics by Jack Fishman) and Hallucinations. The theme, (otherwise known as Carter Takes a Train) which is the best known music from the film, was played by Budd and the other members of his jazz trio, Jeff Clyne (double bass) and Chris Karan (percussion) and was recorded on a budget of £450. The musicians recorded the soundtrack live, direct to picture, playing along with the film.[tpl]cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Phil|title=Film Music|journal=The New Statesman|date=5 March 1999 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/199903050039|accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl] To save time and money Budd did not use overdubs, simultaneously playing a real harpsichord, a Wurlitzer electric piano and a grand piano.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bryce|first=Allan|title=A Conversation with Roy Budd|journal=Soundtrack Magazine |year=1984 |volume=3 |issue=11 |url=http://www.runmovies.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77:roy-budd-a-talented-and-likeable-man-&catid=35:interviews |accessdate=1 March 2012 |editor1-first=Luc |editor1-last=Van de Ven[/tpl]Get Carter DVD, Warner Archive, 2000 Budd described the experience as "uncomfortable, but it sounded pleasant". The theme tune features the sounds of the character's train journey from London to Newcastle.
The theme was released as a 7" vinyl single by Pye Records in 1971, titled simply Carter and backed with "Plaything", another piece composed for the soundtrack. Original copies of the record are much sought after by collectors and sell for around £100.[tpl]cite web|title=ROY BUDD CARTER GET CARTER UK SOUNDTRACK 7" SINGLE PYE MICHAEL CAINE COVER NM |url=http://www.popsike.com/ROY-BUDD-CARTER-GET-CARTER-UK-SOUNDTRACK-7-SINGLE-PYE-MICHAEL-CAINE-COVER-NM/310350106840.html |publisher=popsike |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] The soundtrack, including pieces not used in the film, was originally only available in its entirety in Japan where it was released on Odeon Records.[tpl]cite web|title=Soundtracks from other Countries >> Japanese Soundtracks: Get Carter cover |url=http://www.italiansoundtracks.com/soundtracks/japanese/japgetcarter.html|work=Italian SOundtracks. com|publisher=italian soundtracks|accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl] It was released in the UK in 1998 by the Cinephile label (a subsidiary of Castle Communications).

The pub singer (played by Denea Wilde) performs a cover of How About You? by Burton Lane and Ralph Freed, a song more associated with glamorous Hollywood films than the backrooms of Newcastle pubs.
The local juvenile jazz band and majorette troupe the Pelaw Hussars also appear and perform two numbers, When The Saints Go Marching In and Auld Lang Syne.

==Releases==

The film's premiere was held in Los Angeles on 3 February 1971, with a preview held in New York on 3 March that year.[tpl]cite web|title=Get Carter: release dates|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067128/releaseinfo|work=Internet Movie Database|publisher=IMDb.com,Inc.|accessdate=21 February 2012[/tpl] The film finally opened for general release across the UK on 10 March 1971 and in the USA on 18 March, where it was rated 'X' for violence and female nudity, meaning it was for adults only.[tpl]cite news|last=Erickson|first=Hal|title=Get Carter- Trailer|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/92874/Get-Carter/overview#|work=New York Times movies|publisher=Rovi|accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] It was later reclassified as 'R', meaning children under the age of 17 had to be accompanied by an adult. A censored edited version was released in West Germany on 6 August 1971, with a running time nine minutes shorter than the original.
Michael Klinger was involved in promotion of the film in the UK, using the experience from his background as a distributor to conduct a strong advertising campaign. Teaser posters for the film appeared on the front of every London bus, with the tag-line 'Caine is Carter'.
The original British quad poster with artwork by Arnaldo Putzu, in common with many film posters, has aspects or images that differ from the finished screen version. Carter is depicted wearing a gaudy floral jacket, as opposed to the dark raincoat and mohair suit he wears in the film. Asked in 2006, Putzu could not remember his artistic rationale for painting the floral jacket, but said he was painting a lot of flowers in designs at that time.[tpl]cite web|last=Branaghan|first=Sim|title=Transcript of 'British Film Posters' podcast, Talk given in August 2007 at the Walker Art Gallery|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/podcasts/transcripts/british_film_posters.asp|work=Liverpool Museums British Film Posters|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] Chibnall describes the flower power imagery as "what seems like a desperate and misguided attempt to suggest the hipness of a genre which had largely fallen out of favour".Chibnall, p. 90 However, movie poster expert Sim Branaghan liked its eccentricity, calling it was "that kind of quirkiness you wouldn't get these days". Jonny Trunk of Trunk Records (a long time aficionado of the film and its history) has observed that the floral pattern of Carter's jacket is taken from the distinctive pillow and matching sheet design from the bed in the scene where Britt Ekland writhes naked on the phone to Jack. The poster also places Carter's shotgun in Eric's hands, and features a grappling man and woman who seem to belong to a different film.Chibnall, p. 133, footnote 1
Promotional shots and poster artwork exist from the film showing Carter holding a pump action shotgun; in the finished film the only shotgun used by Carter is a double-barrelled shotgun which Carter finds on top of his brother Frank's wardrobe.
MGM sold distribution rights to the film in the U.S.A. to United Artists, which promoted it poorly, amidst worries the cockney dialogue in the opening scene would be unintelligible to US audiences. The film's release was delayed while parts of the film were redubbed (with no great improvement). In the process of redubbing the opening, the version of the film with the original dialogue was lost. For years the version shown on British television was the redubbed American cut.[tpl]cite news|title=Entertainment Get Carter: Original and best|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/365620.stm|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 June 1999[/tpl] UA placed the film on the then-in-decline drive-in movie circuit, where it played at the bottom of a double bill with Frank Sinatra vehicle Dirty Dingus Magee.[tpl]cite web|last=Kornbluth|first=Jesse|title=Get Carter directed by Mike Hodges|url=http://headbutler.com/movies/drama/get-carter|work=Head Butler, 2005|publisher=Head Butler, Inc.|accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Monahan|first=William|title=Top 5 British Crime and Suspense Films from the ’60s and ’70s|journal=Slate|date=11 November 2011|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/11/11/william_monahan_picks_his_favorite_british_crime_films.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|authorlink=William Monahan[/tpl] In 1974 Michael Klinger complained to president of UA Eric Pleskow about the lacklustre promotion of Carter, and tried to get him to relinquish the US rights to the film, so Klinger could find a better distributor.[tpl]cite web|last=Klinger|first=Michael|title=Promotion problems in America for 'Get Carter' and 'Pulp'|url=http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/docs1/getcarter.pdf|work=The Michael Klinger Papers: DocumentsThe University of West England website|publisher=uwe.ac.uk|accessdate=20 February 2012[/tpl]
The film did not encounter many censorship problems, although the scene where Carter knifes Albert Swift caused concern for the censor John Trevelyan.Chibnall, 2003, p. 76 In South Africa the censor cut out Britt Ekland's phone sex scene, shortening her already brief role; her name was still left on the poster, leaving filmgoers to wonder why she was advertised as appearing.Chibnall, p. 61

A resurgence of critical and public interest in the film in the 1990s led to the British Film Institute releasing a new print of the film in 1999. It worked with Hodges to restore the film, with Hodges sourcing another set of negatives of the original opening, which were found in the archives of the BBC. The team then spliced the beginning segment onto a high quality print of the film. The reissue premiered at the National Film Theatre[tpl]cite web|last=Film|first=Total|title=Get Carter BFI reissue review|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/get-carter|work=Total Film 1999|publisher=Future Publishing, Ltd.|accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] and went on general release on 11 June 1999, showing at the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle.

===Home media===

Chibnall has established that the film was shown on LWT in 1976 and 1980 "in a bowdlerised version", (which edited out Britt Ekland's phone sex scene) and once on Westward Television, but it was not shown nationally and in its entirety until a post-watershed BBC broadcast in 1986.Chibnall, p. 99 It was finally released on home media in 1993 by MGM/UA as part of its "Elite Collection". Chibnall says "There was no advertising to suggest a significant event had occurred. It was simply a part of the long process of exploiting MGM's back catalogue in the run-up to Christmas". Despite this the release was given a five star review in Empire where it was described as "one of the best British films of the 70s". Chibnall notes "it did not, however, find a place in Empire's top fifty videos of the year".
Warner Brothers reissued the film in a special edition on DVD in October 2000 in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Extras included three trailers; the international trailer, an introduction by Michael Caine to the people of Newcastle, and a third featuring Roy Budd playing the opening theme. Also included was commentary from Caine, Hodges and Suschitzky, constructed from separate interviews with the three. The soundtrack was presented in 1.0 mono Dolby Digital[tpl]cite web|last=Haflidason|first=Almar|title=Get Carter DVD review (2000)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/10/17/get_carter_1971_dvd_review.shtml|work=BBCi Films review|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2012[/tpl]

==Reception==

===Critical response===

Describing the initial critical response to the film, Steve Chibnall wrote "Initial critical vilification or indifference establishes the conditions in which a cult can flourish. Get Carter had to make do with ambivalence".Chibnall, p. 91 He thought the general stance of British critics "was to admire the film's power and professionalism while condemning its amorality and excessive violence".Chibnall, p. 92 Geoff Mayer observed that "Mainstream critics at the time were dismayed by the film's complex plotting and Carter's lack of remorse".[tpl]cite book|last=Mayer|first=Geoff|title=Encyclopedia of Film Noir|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=England|isbn=978-0-313-33306-4|page=195|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RsBHnZoyO4kC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=get+carter+budget+mgm#v=onepage&q=get%20carter%20budget%20mgm&f=false|coauthors=McDonnell, Brian|accessdate=20 February 2012[/tpl]
In Sight and Sound, Tom Milne said the film was well constructed and had good characterisation, but lacked the mystery and charisma of the earlier American crime films it attempted to emulate. He found Carter's motivations were inconsistent – either being an avenging angel or an "authentic post-permissive anti-hero, revelling in the casual sadism".[tpl]cite web|title=Gangsters: Get Carter|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/publications/16+/pdf/gangsters.pdf|work=16+ source guides: Gangsters (2002)|publisher=BFI|accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Milne|first=Tom|title=Get Carter|journal=Sight & Sound|date=Spring 1971|volume=40|issue=2|page=107[/tpl]
In contrast Nigel Andrews found the characters to be clichéd archetypes of the criminal underworld, such as the "homosexual chauffeur, bloated tycoon, glamorous mistress", describing the film as "perfunctory".[tpl]cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Nigel|title=Get Carter|journal=Monthly Film Bulletin|date=April 1971|volume=38|issue=447|page=73[/tpl]

Roger Ebert was less reserved in his praise, writing that "the movie has a sure touch". He noted the "proletarian detail" of the film which is "unusual in a British detective movie.

He's tough and ruthless, but very quiet and charged with a terrible irony".

He also noticed a substantial increase in women voting on the film in the eight months leading up to April 2002. However, although by 2012 the number of votes cast had increased tenfold, the ratio of female to male voters had not changed greatly, falling slightly from 2002, dropping to nearly 5% (526 out of 9566 voters who gave their gender were women).

===Box office===

Get Carter was a financial success, and according to Steve Chibnall its box office takings were "very respectable". On its opening week at ABC2 cinema at Shaftesbury Avenue, London, it broke the house record, taking £8,188. It out-performed Up Pompeii which was showing in the larger ABC1. It also performed strongly when moved to the ABCs in Edgware and Fulham Road. On its general release in the North of England, Chibnall notes it had a "very strong first week", before an unseasonal heatwave damaged cinema attendance. Chibnall writes that "Interestingly, although film's downbeat and unsentimental tone is now thought to express the mood of its times, the mass cinema audience preferred Love Story (Arthur Hiller 1970), which remained the most popular film in Britain throughout Get Carter's run". It was the sixth most popular "general release" movie at the British box office in 1971.Peter Waymark. "Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas". Times England 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.

===Accolades===

At the time of its release the only recognition the film received was a 1972 BAFTA Awards nomination for Ian Hendry as Best Supporting Actor.
In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time.

==Remakes==

Warner Bros., now in possession of the pre-1986 MGM library, decided to produce a remake in 2000 under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter. As with Hit Man, the film credited Ted Lewis's Jack's Return Home as its source, not Hodges' film, and again it contains scenes which are directly borrowed from the original, such as the opening train ride.[tpl]cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|title=Movie Review Get Carter (2000) FILM REVIEW; Slimline Stallone, With a Bruising Touch and a Gentle Mutter|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CE5DE153CF934A35753C1A9669C8B63&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 October 2000[/tpl] Michael Caine appears as Cliff Brumby in what Elvis Mitchell described as "a role that will increase regard for the original", speculating that "maybe that was his intention".

His son brought him a DVD of the film back from Hong Kong and he tried to watch it, but the region format was incompatible "so we put it in the dustbin".[tpl]cite news|last=Brooks|first=Xan|title=So macho: interview with Mike Hodges|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/15/edinburghfilmfestival2003.edinburghfilmfestival|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 August 2003[/tpl] In 2004 the film was voted the worst remake of all time by users of British DVD rental website ScreenSelect (precursor of Lovefilm).[tpl]cite news|title=Get Carter is 'worst film remake'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3969245.stm|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=31 October 2004[/tpl]
Another film based on Lewis's book, Hit Man, directed by George Armitage and starring Bernie Casey and Pam Grier, was released in 1972, taking some plot details and treatments, such as a sniper shooting Carter on a rocky beach, from Hodges' film.[tpl]cite book|last=Chibnall|first=Steve|title=Get Carter: The British Film Guide 6|year=2003|publisher=I.B.

Tom Cox writes that many British filmmakers "have stolen from Hodges without matching the cold, realistic kick" of Carter.[tpl]cite news|last=Cox|first=Tom|title=Get Hodges|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1999/may/28/features.tomcox|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 May 1999[/tpl] Films such as The Long Good Friday, Face and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels borrow from the Carter blueprint.
Steven Soderbergh's 1999 film The Limey is a homage to Carter and other British gangster films, and contains similar plot elements and themes of revenge, family and corruption. Soderbergh said he envisioned The Limey as "Get Carter made by Alain Resnais".[tpl]cite book|last=Palmer|first=R.

Phil Daniels considers Get Carter one of the greatest British films, ranking it as one of Caine's finest performances and describing it as a "mad, violent but hugely influential British gangster film without which there would never have been a Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels".[tpl]cite news|title=Get Carter to Withnail And I: Ten of the greatest British films chosen by Phil Daniels|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1388331/Get-Carter-Withnail-And-I-Ten-greatest-British-films-chosen-Phil-Daniels.html|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=21 May 2011|author=Membery, York[/tpl]
The film's music also enjoyed its own resurgence in popularity, as it tapped into a 1990s interest in vintage film soundtracks. Portishead's Adrian Utley explained that they found the music to Get Carter inspiring as "it was done quickly and cheaply with only a few instruments, and it had to be intensely creative to disguise its limitations".
The Human League album Dare contains a track covering the Get Carter theme, although it was only a version of the sparse leitmotif that opens and closes the film as opposed to the full-blooded jazz piece that accompanies the train journey. Stereolab also covers Roy Budd's theme on their album Aluminum Tunes, although they call their version "Get Carter", as opposed to its proper title, "Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)". This Stereolab version was subsequently used as a sample in the song "Got Carter" by 76. The Finnish rock band Laika & the Cosmonauts cover the film's theme on their 1995 album The Amazing Colossal Band.
BB Davis & the Red Orchidstra released a version of the film's title theme in 1999.
