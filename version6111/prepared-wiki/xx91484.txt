Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) (formerly known as Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU)) is the governing body for the sport of cricket in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Cricket is a full member of the International Cricket Council, and operates the Zimbabwean cricket team, organising Test tours, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket, including the Stanbic Bank 20 Series, the Coca-Cola Metbank Pro50 Championship and Castle Logan Cup in Zimbabwe. It is one of the most developing cricket-playing nations. It is ranked at No. 11 in the ICC ODI Cricket rankings; it is not currently ranked on the ICC's Test Cricket rankings due to its suspension from that form of the game. 

==History==

Zimbabwe cricket went through major upheaval during the 2000s. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, senior team members Andy Flower and Henry Olonga staged their "black armband protest" at the "death of democracy" in Zimbabwe, a reference to the country's political situation. Both players subsequently retired from international cricket. In 2004, the majority of the remaining senior players quit the international game following a player protest triggered by the removal of then-captain Heath Streak, resulting in a very young and inexperienced side being fielded in subsequent series against Sri Lanka and Australia. Zimbabwe's resounding defeats in those series led to the withdrawal of Test status that, apart from a brief resumption in 2005 with series against South Africa, New Zealand and India, remained in place until early 2011. Recent improvements in Zimbabwe's on-field performances, including a notable victory over Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 group stages and an overhaul of coaching staff has, however, led to the side's Test status being reinstated, with matches now planned against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand in late 2011.http://sandbox.zimcricketnews.com/?q=2006/06/14/upcoming-fixtures
