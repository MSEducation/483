Badu filmed the video for her song "Window Seat", at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Lyrically Badu expresses a deeper message, as opposed to common R&B music. The majority of Badu’s music is greatly influenced by her beliefs of the Nation of Gods and Earths and her exploration of her African heritage.Marlo David, African American Review, Vol. 41, No. 4, "Afrofuturism and Post-Soul Possibility in Black Popular Music", Post-Soul Aesthetic (Winter, 2007), pp. 695-707. The songs in Badu’s album, “Baduizm” express her personal take on life. Her philosophy is influenced by African ideology, African-centered and Five Percent theologies and Southern African-American folk traditions. Mama's Gun has an confessional lyrical theme by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, social issues and personal relationships.

In a 2010 article for PopMatters, music writer Tyler Lewis elaborated on the term in retrospect, stating: "The term 'neo-soul' has been the subject of intense debate ever since Kedar Massenburg coined it as a way to market Erykah Badu's Baduizm 13 years ago. Given the way black music has been named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, the reaction to the name by artists who ostensibly fit into the 'neo-soul' category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination in an industry that is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks."Lewis, Tyler (September 28, 2010).

==Controversy==

In April 2014, Badu came under fire by the US-based Human Rights Foundation, for performing at the birthday celebration of Swaziland's ruler and monarch, King Mswati III.  Mswati, credited as Africa's last absolute monarch, is considered to be a serial human-rights abuser, ruling in luxury in a country famed for its poverty and spiralling HIV rates.
Badu presented Mswati with a $100 bill, and a good-luck stone.[tpl]cite web|title=Erykah Badu under fire for singing to King Mswati III|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/celebrity/2014/04/30/erykah-badu-under-fire-for-singing-to-king-mswati-iii|publisher=Times Live|accessdate=1 May 2014[/tpl]
