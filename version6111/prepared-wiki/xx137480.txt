==History==

The airfield in Tezpur was constructed by the British Royal Indian Air Force during World War II in 1942. It was used by the United States Army Air Forces Tenth Air Force as a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber base by the 7th Bombardment Group.   After the war, it was subsequently developed into a full-fledged air force base in 1959. Since its inception, it has been one of the most active bases in the Northeast of India with a variety of fixed and rotary wing aircraft operating from there.
The first aircraft that flew at this base were Vampires and Toofani 101 reconnaissance squadron. In fact, in the last 25 years, it was home to the IAF MiG-21 fleet which was used extensively to train rookie pilots for the Indian Air Force. The aircraft continues to serve the air force, operating from other bases in the Northeast.
