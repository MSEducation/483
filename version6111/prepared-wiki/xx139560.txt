[[Guantanamo detainees who officially reported abuse]]

CATEGORIES: Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, Lists of Guantanamo Bay detainees

Some Guantanamo detainees are known to have officially reported abuse.
Many Guantanamo detainees are known to have reported abuse when they appeared before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, their Administrative Review Board hearings, or the Guantanamo military commissions of the ten detainees who have been charged.
Some detainee's transcripts record that they reported abuse, without recording any reaction from the field grade officers they addressed.
Some detainee's transcripts record that they reported abuse, and record the Tribunal or Board's President asking whether the abuse was at the hands of American soldiers, or whether it took place in Guantanamo.
In some cases, when the detainee reported abuse, while at Guantanamo, the transcripts record that the Presidents then promised to forward the reports of abuse to an appropriate authority.
Presidents never named the authority who might investigate the abuse.  And they never told the detainee how that authority would decide whether to initiate an investigation.  They never told the detainees what measures that authority would take if they initiated an investigation and determined the detainee's report was credible.
The Department of Defense has yet to release any reports of any investigations following up the reports of abuse addressed to the officers staffing Combatant Status Review Tribunal or Administrative Review Boards.

According to the BBC when he told his Board: ''"...some of the evidence presented to the board - especially evidence kept from detainees - is false or was taken under pressure or psychological torture."
The BBC reported that: ''"The ARB's chief promised to investigate this."
