This is a  list of National Parks of Canada. Canadian National Parks preserve both spectacular and representative areas of the country, located in every one of the nation's 13 provinces and territories. The goal of the national park service is to create a system of protected areas which represent all the distinct natural regions of the country. Parks Canada[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]the governing and administration body for the system[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]has developed a plan identifying 39 different regions it aims to represent. In 2005, Parks Canada reported that the system was more than 60% complete.  Canada's parks are managed primarily to protect the ecological integrity of the park, and secondarily to allow the public to explore, learn about and enjoy Canada's natural spaces.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/np-pn/intro/index_e.asp |title=National Parks of Canada - Introduction|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl] Feasibility studies are currently underway for establishing further national parks in several areas, including Wolf Lake in Yukon, South Okanagan-Lower Similkameen in British Columbia and the Manitoba Lowlands (north-western Lake Winnipeg).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/np-pn/cnpn-cnnp/index_e.asp |title=National Parks of Canada - Creating New National Parks of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]
As of 2014, there are 37 National Parks and 8 National Park Reserves (Kluane National Park and Reserve is two units). This page also includes the country's four National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs), the lone National Landmark, and three proposed parks. National Parks currently cover an area of 303,571 km², or about 3.0% of the total land area of Canada. Rounding out the national park system is a collection of National Historic Sites, listed separately.

==National Parks and National Park Reserves==

A National Park Reserve is an area that has been set aside with the intention of becoming a national park, pending the settlement of native land claims. Until then, they are managed as national parks under the National Parks Act.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/cp-nr/release_e.asp?bgid=972&andor1=bg |title=Backgrounder - Working toward the creation of Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve |publisher=Parks Canada|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]

==National Marine Conservation Areas==

National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are a relatively new addition to the park system.  These areas have a different mandate than their terrestrial counterparts. They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect ecological integrity.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/amnc-nmca/intro/index_e.asp |title=National Marine Conservation Areas of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl] The government has announced plans to add five more Marine parks to the system as part of the Marine Conservation Areas Act. The first to be officially announced was Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, although a date of opening has not yet been revealed. Other areas under negotiation are the southern Strait of Georgia and Gwaii Haanas in British Columbia and there are discussions to study the feasibility of an area on the southern coast of Newfoundland.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/270200|title=PM expected to unveil marine conservation area|last=Ditchburn|first=Jennifer|publisher=Toronto Star|date=2007-10-24|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]

==National Landmark==

In addition to national parks, a National Landmarks program was established in 1978 but has not yet been expanded beyond a single property. Landmarks were intended to protect specific natural features considered "outstanding, exceptional, unique, or rare to this country. These natural features would typically be isolated entities and of scientific interest."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/v-g/pingo/sec6/index_e.asp|title=Pingo Canadian Landmark - Park Management|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]
