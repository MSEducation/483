Charippus is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species, C. errans, is endemic to Burma.
The species was described from a single male in 1895. Thorell put it close to Euophrys. A redescription of this male, together with drawings of pedipalp, chelicerae and habitus, was provided by Fred Wanless in 1988.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 271
The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek Χάριππος, (literally, "graceful rider"), according to Thorell taken from Persian mythology.
