 [[Seiseki Abe]] said: <blockquote>"As far as the Aikido [O'Sensei] practiced in his later years, even young girls, old people and children could do [the techniques]. That is a big difference. I suppose you could say that it was a difference in the severity or the strictness of the training. Before the war, it was severity and strong technique, as opposed to the (kind of) techniques that invigorate our partners as we have now."<ref>[http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=151 Interview with Seiseki Abe] by Stanley Pranin (February 1982)</ref></blockquote>
Kazuo Chiba has implied that the style of training in Hombu concentrated less on physical rigor because of its demographic:  "A large portion of the membership at Iwama Dojo consisted of local farmers, hard workers who spent all day in the fields. They had thick bones and great physical strength, combined with a peculiar local character known as “Mito kishitsu,” a type of manliness close to gallantry.
 Altogether, it was quite an opposite culture from Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. Because it is in the capital of Japan, Hombu’s membership consists of white-collar workers, intellectuals, businessmen, politicians and university students."T.K. Chiba, Memorial Address for Saito Sensei, Aikido Journal.
