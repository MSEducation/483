[[Egerton Dock]]

CATEGORIES: Birkenhead docks

Egerton Dock, is a dock at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. Named after Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton who laid the foundation stone in October 1844, the dock was completed in 1847. This was just prior to a suspension of the dock scheme, due to a financial crisis affecting the Birkenhead Dock Company.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.merseysideviews.com/Merseyside%20Docks/Birkenhead/|title=Birkenhead Docks (page1)|publisher=Merseyside Views|accessdate=12 October 2007[/tpl]
The dock was originally accessible to shipping from the Great Float and via the Morpeth Dock entrance from the River Mersey.  Both these passages have since been filled in, making both docks effectively landlocked.[tpl]citation|title=Birkenhead Docks|first=Ian|last=Collard|publisher=Tempus Publishing|date=2007|page=73|isbn=978-0-7524-4259-4[/tpl]

==Egerton Bridge==

Egerton Bridge is situated between Egerton Dock and Morpeth Dock and is a working example of a bascule bridge. It was built between 1928 and 1931, as one of four similar bascule bridges in the Merseyside docks, replacing an earlier swing bridge. The bridge and the machine house were completely restored in 1993 and opened to the public in 1995.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.wirral-mbc.gov.uk/art/insideoutside/project3.doc|title=The Birkenhead Dock System (art project)|publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|accessdate=12 October 2007[/tpl]
