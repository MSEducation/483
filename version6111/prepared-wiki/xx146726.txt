Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, also known as FACTNet, co-founded by Robert Penny and Lawrence Wollersheim, is a Colorado-based organization committed to educating and facilitating communication about destructive mind control. Coercive tactics, or "coercive psychological systems", are defined on their website as "unethical mind control such as brainwashing, thought reform, destructive persuasion and coercive persuasion".  While this appears to cover a massive array of issues, in practice FACTNet's primary dedication is to the exposure and disruption of cult activity.[tpl]cite web |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51853609.html?dids=51853609:51853609&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+3%2C+1994&author=WAYNE+GARCIA&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&edition=&startpage=12.A&desc=Network+gives+voice+to+former+Scientologists |title = Network gives voice to former Scientologists |accessdate = 2007-08-03 |last = Garcia |first = Wayne |date = 1994-08-03 |work = St. Petersburg Times[/tpl]

==Conflict with Church of Scientology==

In 1995 FACTNet was featured in the news due to a lawsuit regarding the seizure of FACTNet servers and files by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), a sub-organization of the Church of Scientology created to oversee the protection of its trademarks and copyrights. In August 1995 RTC lawyers went to a Denver judge alleging copyright infringement and illegal use of Scientology documents by FACTNet, a vocal critic of the organization's practices.  A raid of two directors' homes was conducted on August 21, 1995 by two U.S. marshals and six RTC representatives, with the actual search for incriminating documents conducted by the RTC alone.[tpl]cite web |url = http://edition.cnn.com/US/9508/scientology/index.html |title = Church of Scientology protects secrets on the Internet |accessdate = 2007-08-04 |date = 1995-08-26 |work =CNN |publisher = Time Warner |quote = [/tpl]  Witnesses of the searches testified that the marshals allowed the RTC representatives to go far beyond the scope of the order in their search for information.  The marshals also failed to search the representatives before or after the search, making it possible for them to carry off disks and other documents containing critical information.  FACTNet immediately accused the Church of Scientology of attempting to silence their voice by stealing and contaminating information vital to their continued attacks and lawsuits against the Church.[tpl]cite news | author = Wendy M.

FACTNet filed a lawsuit, and on September 14, 1995 a Federal judge ruled the seizure illegal because it violated FACTNet's right to free speech on the internet, and ordered the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized.  In his ruling in United States District Court, Judge John Kane stated: "The public interest is best served by the free exchange of ideas."[ref]
