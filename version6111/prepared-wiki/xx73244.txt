[[The Soft Machine]]

CATEGORIES: 1961 novels, Novels by William S. Burroughs

The Soft Machine is a novel by William S. Burroughs, first published in 1961, two years after his groundbreaking Naked Lunch. It was originally composed using the cut-up and fold-in techniques from manuscripts belonging to The Word Hoard. It is part of The Nova Trilogy.

==Title and structure==

The title The Soft Machine is a name for the human body, and the main theme of the book (as explicitly written in an appendix) concerns how control mechanisms invade the body.
The book is written in a style close to that of Naked Lunch, employing third-person singular indirect recall, though now using the cut-up method.
After the main material follow three appendices, the first explaining the title (as mentioned above) and two accounts of Burroughs' own drug abuse and treatment using apomorphine. Here Burroughs clearly states that he considers drug abuse a metabolic disease and writes about how he finally escaped it.

==Plot summary==

The main plot appears in linear prose in chapter VII, The Mayan Caper. This chapter portrays a secret agent who has the ability to change bodies or metamorphose his own body using "U.T." (undifferentiated tissue). As such an agent he makes a time travel machine and takes on a gang of Mayan priests who use the Mayan calendar to control the minds of slave laborers used for planting maize. The calendar images are written in books and placed on a magnetic tape and transmitted as sounds to control the slaves. The agent manages to infiltrate the slaves and replace the magnetic tape with a totally different message: "burn the books, kill the priests", which causes the downfall of their regime.

==Characters==

The characters of the Soft Machine fall into three categories:

==Editions==

The Soft Machine has been printed in three different editions, each time revised by the author.
Burroughs himself was very displeased with the first edition and this was the main reason for rewriting it so thoroughly: in 1961 he wrote to his friend Allen Ginsberg that he rewrote it extensively while he was working on Dead Fingers Talk, mostly because he was displeased with bad cut-ups and introduced linear material to replace it.

==Cultural references==

British progressive rock band Soft Machine took their name from the novel.

==Obscenity controversy==

The novel was subject to an obscenity trial in Turkey in 2011. Sel Publishing House and the novel's Turkish translator faced obscenity charges after the release of the book, due to alleged "incompliance with moral norms" and “hurting people’s moral feelings.”[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/17/william-burroughs-publisher-obscenity-charges-turkey | title=William Burroughs publisher faces obscenity charges in Turkey | publisher=The Guardian | date=May 17, 2011 | accessdate=February 18, 2013 | author=Flood, Alison[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/16/william-s-burroughs_n_862406.html | title=Istanbul Publisher Faces Obscenity Trial For Releasing William S.

Meanwhile the judge warned that if either of the publishing houses or the translators were foolish enough to publish further ‘obscene’ works, these cases would be added to the charge sheet.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/02/william-burroughs-turkish-publishers-obscenity-trial | title=William Burroughs' Turkish publishers' obscenity trial postponed | publisher=The Guardian | date=August 2, 2012 | accessdate=February 18, 2013 | author=Flood, Alison[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://gundem.milliyet.com.tr/mustehcenlik-davasi-guardian-a-tasindi/gundem/gundemdetay/04.08.2012/1576142/default.htm | title=Müstehcenlik davası Guardian’a taşındı (The obscenity trial was carried out to The Guardian) | publisher=Milliyet | date=August 4, 2012 | accessdate=February 18, 2013 | language=Turkish [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= Cut-Ups in memory of William S.
