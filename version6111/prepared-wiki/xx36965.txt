==Origin and etymology of the surname Colbert==

They remain unclear. In France, the name is already mentioned in Champagne, in the 15th century. It seems to be a reduced form of Colibert, which is mentioned early in Champagne too. Colibert was originally a nickname from Latin Collibertus "freed slave". If not, it can be originally a Germanic given name *Colberht or the gallicized form of the Flemish surname Koelbert (ancient given name, mentioned as Colobert in the 7th century).Albert Dauzat, Noms et prénoms de France, Librairie Larousse 1980, édition revue et commentée par Marie-Thérèse Morlet. p. 140b.
