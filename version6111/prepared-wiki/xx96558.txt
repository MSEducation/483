==Early years==

In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[tpl]cite news |first=Peter J. |last=Boyer |title=The Deliverer |work=The New Yorker |page= |date=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/02/19/070219fa_fact_boyer [/tpl] The deal was secured by a $75 down payment and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store. Eight months later, James traded his half of the business to Tom for a used Volkswagen Beetle. In 1965, Monaghan renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. In 1967, the first Domino's Pizza franchise store opened in Ypsilanti.www.dominosbiz.com - Making Pizza Since 1960 The company logo was originally planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.

In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-criticizing ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.http://www.pizzaturnaround.com/ PizzaTurnAround.com (2010).

In 2012, Domino's Pizza removed the word "Pizza" from their logo, to emphasize their non-pizza products. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[tpl]cite web|last=Peterson|first=Kim|title=Domino's gets a makeover, loses the 'Pizza'|url=http://money.msn.com/top-stocks/post.aspx?post=da2437ae-f1de-4e61-9d33-d9183f9c4dbf|work=MSN Money|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=21 March 2013[/tpl]

==Menu==

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dominos.com/home/main_servlet?COMMAND_MENU |title=Our Menu |author= |date= |work=Dominos.com |publisher=Domino's Pizza |accessdate=April 2, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches.

==Beverages==

Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2012 and 2007, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a lifetime contract to sell Pepsi products. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Pakistan is with Pepsi as well.
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://beta.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/09/23/dominos-pan-pizza-hut-home-delivery/1580991/|title=Domino's to roll out pan pizza|publisher=USA Today|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=September 24, 2012[/tpl]

===Charitable activities===

In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort. In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising more than $1.3 million in 2006.[tpl]cite web |title=2007 St. Jude Thanks and Giving Campaign |url=http://www.dominos.com/Public-EN/Site+Content/Secondary/Inside+Dominos/Domino's+Cares/St.+Jude+Children's+Research+Hospital/ |year=2007 |work= |publisher=Domino's Pizza, Inc. |accessdate=August 31, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Advertising and sponsorship==

In the 1980s, Domino's Pizza was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid."
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated though and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009 and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shebar, Alex | title = Free pizza deal was tasty accident | date = April 2, 2009 | url = http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090402/NEWS01/904020345/1168/NEWS0101 [/tpl]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[tpl]cite press release |title=Oh Yeah!

===30-minute guarantee===

Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid 1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million, but accepted a payout of $15 million. The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan."End of Domino's Pizza Delivery Guarantee". The Urban Legends Reference Library. Accessed July 8, 2011
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes", alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in a half hour.[tpl]cite news |first=Janet |last=Adamy |title=Will a Twist on an Old Vow Deliver for Domino's Pizza? |work=Wall Street Journal |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119784843600332539-oueLUGs3hGQrgDILS9KzspIC8Rk_20081216.html [/tpl]
The company continues to offer the 30 minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, India, Vietnam, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".Domino's Pizza Malaysia – Unique Selling Prepositions (USPs), Retrieved October 23, 2012.Domino's Pizza Singapore – About Us., Retrieved October 23, 2012.
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
