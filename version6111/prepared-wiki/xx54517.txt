[[Gδ set]]

CATEGORIES: General topology, Descriptive set theory

In the mathematical field of topology, a Gδ set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets. The notation originated in Germany with G for Gebiet (German: area, or neighborhood) meaning open set in this case and δ for Durchschnitt (German: intersection). 
The term inner limiting set is also used.  Gδ sets, and their dual Fσ sets, are the second level of the Borel hierarchy.

==Definition==

==Examples==

A more elaborate example of a Gδ set is given by the following theorem:

==Properties==

The notion of Gδ sets in metric (and topological) spaces is strongly related to the notion of completeness of the metric space as well as to the Baire category theorem. This is described by the Mazurkiewicz theorem:

==Gδ space==

A Gδ space is a topological space in which every closed set is a Gδ set [tpl]harv|Johnson|1970[/tpl]. A normal space which is also a Gδ space is perfectly normal.  Every metrizable space is perfectly normal, and every perfectly normal space is completely normal: neither implication is reversible.
