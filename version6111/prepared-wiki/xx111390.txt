==Writing and composition==

Regarding the song's conception and its position as The Sophtware Slump's opening track, Jason Lytle noted, "It was definitely a struggle to get all the three parts to actually sound like they were intended to live together. I usually get into this space where, once the album starts to come together, I start to figure out what’s missing or what needs to be added, and I realised that it really needed something like that to set it off in a certain direction. It’s just a struggle putting something like that together and making it not sound forced, y’know?"[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/i-think-my-brain-is-working-on-another-level-grandaddys-jason-lytle-revisits-the-sophtware-slump-67011 |title=Grandaddy's Jason Lytle revisits The Sophtware Slump |first=Alex |last=Wisgard |work=thelineofbestfit.com |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]
