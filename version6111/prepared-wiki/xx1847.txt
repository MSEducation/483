In mathematics, the commutator gives an indication of the extent to which a certain binary operation fails to be commutative. There are different definitions used in group theory and ring theory.

==Group theory==

The commutator of two elements, g and h, of a group G, is the element
The above definition of the commutator is used by some group theorists, as well as throughout this article. However, many other group theorists define the commutator as

===Identities (group theory)===

Commutator identities are an important tool in group theory.[tpl]harvtxt|McKay|2000|p=4[/tpl] The expression ax denotes the conjugate of a by x, defined as x−1a x.
Identity 5 is also known as the Hall–Witt identity.  It is a group-theoretic analogue of the Jacobi identity for the ring-theoretic commutator (see next section).
A wide range of identities are used that are true modulo certain subgroups.  These can be particularly useful in the study of solvable groups and nilpotent groups.  For instance, in any group second powers behave well
If the derived subgroup is central, then

==Ring theory==

The commutator of two elements a and b of a ring or an associative algebra is defined by
It is zero if and only if a and b commute. In linear algebra, if two endomorphisms of a space are represented by commuting matrices with respect to one basis, then they are so represented with respect to every basis.
By using the commutator as a Lie bracket, every associative algebra can be turned into a Lie algebra. 
The anticommutator of two elements a and b of a ring or an associative algebra is defined by
Sometimes the brackets + are also used.[tpl]harvtxt|McMahon|2008[/tpl] The anticommutator is used less often than the commutator, but can be used for example to define Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras and is utilised to derive the Dirac equation in particle physics.
In physics, this is an important overarching principle in quantum mechanics. The commutator of two operators acting on a Hilbert space is a central concept in quantum mechanics, since it quantifies how well the two observables described by these operators can be measured simultaneously. The uncertainty principle is ultimately a theorem about such commutators, by virtue of the Robertson–Schrödinger relation.[tpl]harvtxt|Liboff|2003|pp=140–142[/tpl] 
In phase space, equivalent commutators of function star-products are called Moyal brackets, and are completely isomorphic to the Hilbert-space commutator structures mentioned.

===Identities (ring theory)===

The commutator has the following properties:
Lie-algebra relations:
The second relation is called anticommutativity, while the third is the Jacobi identity.
Additional relations:
The following identity ("Hadamard Lemma") involving nested commutators, underlying the Campbell–Baker–Hausdorff expansion of  log (exp A exp B), is also useful:
Use of the same expansion expresses the above Lie group commutator in terms of a series of nested Lie bracket  (algebra) commutators,
These identities differ slightly for the anticommutator (defined above)

Especially if one deals with multiple commutators, another notation turns out to be useful involving the adjoint representation:
