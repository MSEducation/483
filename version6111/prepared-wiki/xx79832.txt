==History==

They formed in 1979 in the Hakata ward of Fukuoka. Although there were four different lineups throughout the life of the band—all centered around guitarist Hiroyuki Hanada--Shinya Ohe was the band's first frontman. Ohe not only sang lead vocals, but also dominated the writing of lyrics and music for the group for the first three albums. In addition to Ohe's contributions, the first two albums were made up of several cover songs. Their third album Insane was a step in a new direction, it was not only the first original Roosters album, but it also featured the first Roosters song not written and composed by Ohe: 'Baby Sitter', written and composed by bassist Tomio Inoue. This was the first sign of a more democratic Roosters, and it paved the way for Hanada to compose songs for their fourth album Dis.
The Roosters' sixth album φPHY was Ohe's last with the group, with only about half of the record credited to him. The rest of the album is credited to Toshiyuki Shibayama (柴山 俊之) for his lyrics and Hanada for his musical compositions. Shibayama continued to write a large portion of the lyrics for the group until they broke up, but never played with them or was an official member.  The band appeared, along with other Japanese rock bands, in the 1982 Sogo Ishii film Burst City. In 1985 Shinya Ohe decided to take an indefinite break from making music and left the band. Despite losing an integral member of the band the Roosters pressed on and released their seventh album Neon Boy less than nine months after Ohe's departure. A single track on Neon Boy, 'Out Land', was Jun Shimoyama's first contribution as a songwriter and composer for the group. Shimoyama continued to write lyrics and music for the band along with Hanada until the band's dissolution in 1988.
In March 1999 a tribute album entitled Respectable Roosters was released and featured bands influenced by The Roosters such as the pillows, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, Kemuri and others performing covers of songs by the Roosters.
In the year 2002, four of the original Roosters from various incarnations came together to form the Rock'n'Roll Gypsies.
In 2004 Ohe Shinya ended his lengthy musical hiatus to reunite with the original lineup of the Roosters to perform at the 2004 Fuji Rock Festival.
