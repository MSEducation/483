==History==

Bursa Malaysia ([tpl]myx|1818[/tpl]) previously known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE, Bursa Saham Kuala Lumpur in Malay) dates back to 1930 [tpl] cite web| title=Bursa Malaysia history| url=http://www.klse.com.my/website/bm/about_us/the_organisation/history.html[/tpl] when the Singapore Stockbrokers' Association was set up as a formal organisation dealing in securities in Malaya. 
The first formal securities business organisation in Malaysia was the Singapore Stockbrokers' Association, established in 1930. It was re-registered as the Malayan Stockbrokers' Association in 1937. The Malayan Stock Exchange was established in 1960 and the public trading of shares commenced. The board system had trading rooms in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, linked by direct telephone lines.
In 1964, the Stock Exchange of Malaysia was established. With the secession of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965, the Stock Exchange of Malaysia became known as the Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore. In 1973, currency interchangeability between Malaysia and Singapore ceased, and the Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore was divided into the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Berhad and the Stock Exchange of Singapore. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange which was incorporated on December 14, 1976 as a company limited by guarantee, took over the operations of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Berhad in the same year.
In 1998, as one of the attempts to weather the 1997 Asian financial crisis, it fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately US$4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BI02Ae05.html|title=INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA|publisher=Asia Times|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/business/international-business-malaysia-extends-deadline-in-singapore-exchange-dispute.html|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Malaysia Extends Deadline in Singapore Exchange Dispute|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=1 January 2000[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/221572|title=Malaysia’s stockmarket; Daylight Robbery|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=10 July 1999[/tpl]
On April 14, 2004, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was renamed Bursa Malaysia Berhad, following the demutualization exercise, the purpose of which was to enhance competitive position and to respond to global trends in the exchange sector by making themselves more customer-driven and market-oriented.  It consisted of a Main Board, a Second Board and MESDAQ with total market capitalisation of MYR700 billion (US$189 billion).
Bursa Malaysia has since then focused on various initiatives aimed at improving its product and service offerings, increasing the liquidity and velocity of its markets, improving the efficiency of its businesses and achieving economies of scale in its operations.
On 18 March 2005, Bursa Malaysia was listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad with a 17% or RM0.50 premium over its retail price of RM3.00.

==Events==

On 18 April 2005, Bursa Malaysia introduced CBRS, a scheme which allows all investors to access research reports of Bursa-listed companies free-of-charge.
In June 2006, a new index series jointly developed by Bursa Malaysia and FTSE Group was introduced which is FTSE Bursa Malaysia Index. On November 7, 2006, the index finally passed the 1,000 mark hurdle and closed at 1,003.28. It was partly boosted by the strong overnight close in the Wall Street.
On March 10, 2008, trading on the exchange was suspended for one hour due to composite index fall by more than 10 percent or 130 points to 1166.32 points. This was largely by combination of factors such as the United States Subprime mortgage crisis and the political uncertainty caused by the 12th General Election. Dealers expected the move was an overreaction to the election results and the market will correct itself.[tpl]cite news |title=Trading on Bursa suspended | publisher=Business Times | author = | url = http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/Monday/Latest/20080310155236/Article/[/tpl] The index gained 2.1% the next day on the morning session as investor reinvest in plantation stocks and blue chips.[tpl]cite news | author = Surin Murugiah | title=KLCI best performer among regional indices at midday| publisher=The Edge| url = http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/content.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_9c3e82e0-cb73c03a-9db99200-678c2fc2[/tpl]

Operating round the clock, the CME Globex trading system is at the heart of CME. Proposed in 1987, it was introduced in 1992 as the first global electronic trading platform for futures contracts. This fully electronic trading system allows market participants to trade from booths at the exchange or while sitting in a home or office thousands of miles away. When Globex was first launched, it used Reuters' technology and network. September 1998 saw the launch of the second generation of Globex using a modified version of the NSC trading system, developed by Paris Bourse for the MATIF (now Euronext). To connect to CME Globex, traders connect via Market Data Protocol (MDP) and iLink 2.0 for order routing.
