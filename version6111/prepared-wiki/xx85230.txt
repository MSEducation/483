20 km north of Sanjiang, toward Hunan province, lies the Dong district, Chengyang (程阳) which is becoming a popular tourist destination with backpackers. The district comprises eight traditional Dong minority villages. The houses are all made of wood. Inside the villages you will find traditional drum towers, which were used to announce important things or simply to perform plays to entertain the villagers. Crossing the river is the best preserved Wind and Rain Bridge (程阳风雨桥, chéng yáng fēng yǔ qiáo) which has five parts. The bridge dates  to the 1920s and is for many people the main reason to visit the village.
North of Chengyang lies the tiny village of Linxia which is interesting because of the local market. There are no places to stay in Linxia, but a taxi from Sanjiang or Chengyang brings you there easily.
