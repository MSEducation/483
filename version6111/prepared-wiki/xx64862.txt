William Barret Travis (August 1, 1809 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American lawyer and soldier. At the age of 26, he was a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army. He died at the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution.

==Early life==

===Ancestry, early years, and education===

Travis's grandfather, Berwick Travis, came to the British Colonies of North America at the age of 12, being stuck in indentured servitude for more than a decade. A descendant of the Travers of Tulketh Castle in Preston, England, Berwick had a life that hardly resembled his ancestor's glory. After working his period of servitude, he traveled south to the colony of South Carolina, where he received a grant of over 100 acres of land in present day Saluda County, South Carolina.Davis, William, "Three Roads to the Alamo" 1998, pg. 189 A year later he married Anne Smallwood, and the couple lived out their lives there. They had seven children (four daughters and three sons), including Mark Travis and the Baptist missionary Alexander Travis.
Mark Travis married Jemima Stallworth on June 1, 1808,Davis, pg. 190 and she gave birth to William Barret Travis on August 1, 1809. Records differ as to whether his date of birth was the first or ninth of August, but his youngest brother James C. Travis, who was in possession of the Travis family Bible at the time of his statement, indicated that William was born on the first. Mark and Jemima had nine other children over the next twenty years.
Travis's uncle Alexander migrated to the new territory of Alabama following the War of 1812, settling in modern day Conecuh County. He urged his brother and family to come join him, as the land was cheap and easy to receive. Mark took his family, including young Travis, then age 9, to Alabama. They settled in the newly forming town of Sparta, where Mark Travis purchased the very first certificate from the Sparta Land.Alabama Territory. A List of Taxable Property Taken in the County of Conecuh Young Travis grew up here. While his father tended to the farming, his uncle Alexander became prominent in the town, organizing the Old Beulah Church (among other churches), preaching in neighboring counties and in nearby Evergreen, Alabama, leaving a strong influence on Travis.Riley, B.F., Makers and Romance of Alabama History, 1951, pg. 98
During this same time Alexander founded the Sparta Academy and served as superintendent. Travis received his first formal education at Sparta, studying subjects ranging from Greek and Latin to history and mathematics. After a few years, Travis moved to the academy of Professor William H. McCurdy in Claiborne, Alabama.
After completing his education at the age of 18, Travis gained a position as an assistant teacher in Monroe County, a position he held for less than a year.William Travis Autobiography, 1833. There is no mention that Travis was given a position at the same academy. As McCurdy's academy opened when Travis was 16 and he changed schools to one in Monroe County at 16, it can be assumed that he went there, as well as taught there. He met a student, Rosanna Cato, whom he immediately felt an attraction to and began a relationship with.Davis, pg. 193

==Life in Claiborne, ensuing debt and troubles==

Eager to get away from farm life, Travis made his move to Claiborne permanent and began studying law. Famed lawyer James Dellet accepted Travis as his apprentice.McMillan Papers; Letford, "Story of William B. Travis". There is no firm evidence Travis studied under Dellet, though members of his family claimed so as well as a former probate judge of Monroe County At the time, Claiborne was a major city in Alabama set right along the Alabama River, where trade and social life seemed miles ahead of the still-growing community of Sparta.

===Mounting debt and failure===

Travis and Cato married on October 26, 1828. Cato gave birth to their first son, Charlie, a year later, though there is evidence to support Charlie was born out of wedlock or possibly even a year beforehand Travis Family Bible. Travis wrote in his own handwriting that Charlie was born in 1828, though this has been modified in someone else's handwriting to say 1829. This was a common practice in the 18th and 19th centuries to purify marriages and family bibles from children being born before a wedding or before nine months had passed.
While still studying law under Dellet, Travis was eager to begin his career and join the high ranks of Claiborne society. Travis Started a newspaper,the Claiborne Herald, which like many other newspapers of the day, published stories ranging from activities in Congress to stories of adventures across the world, local notices, advertisements and more. Travis essentially operated the newspaper himself, and while it provided a modest income during the first few months of operation, it was hardly enough to support himself, Rosanna and young Charlie. The financial stress led to carelessness at the "Herald", where advertisements were accidentally printed upside down and the type wasn't set properly in the printing press, letting words fall out of line. Advertisements that had expired were still being published. He struggled to continue the paper, and though he asked for help,Claiborne Herald, February 27th, 1829 he received none.
On February 27, 1829, Travis passed his law examination and received permission to legally practice. He borrowed $55.37 to open a law office.Davis, pg. 199 as well as $90 earlier in the year to help pay for the "Herald".Davis, pg. 90 Now in debt and with no practical income, he took in three boarding students. To help Rosanna with the workload, he purchased two slaves. Maintaining the slaves increased his expenses, pushing Travis into further debt.
In 1829, the "Herald" declined, hardly getting out six issues in the fall when it was intended to be published weekly. It went from a paper to a two-sided sheet. Still, no one had replied to help Travis with publishing, and by the end of the year, the "Herald" had gone out of print.
With hardly any law business coming in, the debts continued to mount. The earlier loans had never been paid, and more came - $192.40 in May 1829, $50.12 in June, and $50.00 in July.Davis, pg. 201 His law practice failed to attract any significant clients as men like Dellet continued to be trusted more than Travis. By the end of his law practice in Claiborne, he had only six cases, taking in less than $4.00 total. By the spring of 1831, his debt was $834.Davis, pg. 203
Dellet, along with others Travis owed money to, had no choice but to file suit for the debts to be repaid. At one point during the suit, Travis filed a plea that the case be dismissed on the grounds of infancy (he was still considered a minor in many parts of Alabama). Dellet responded by forcing Travis to stand, yelling at the courtroom "Gentlemen, I make 'proofest' of this infant!".Davis, pg. 204 Travis stood humiliated in a courtroom roaring with laughter. The clerk issued orders for his arrest on March 31, 1831.Davis, pg. 205
At some point during his time in Claiborne, Travis had heard stories of Texas, then an outlying state in the Republic of Mexico. In Texas, there was a massive amount of land speculation, immigration, and settlers coming in from the United States and Europe. There was also a strong demand for lawyers to deal with the influx of immigrants and land dealings. Quickly, he made the decision to go to Texas. He promised Rosanna (now pregnant with a second child) to make enough there to pay back his debts. Rosanna trusted him to eventually return or send for her and the family. Travis managed to avoid arrest and leave for Texas.

==Texas and the Alamo command==

In May 1831, upon his arrival in Mexican Texas, a part of northern Mexico at the time, Travis purchased land from Stephen F. Austin, who appointed him consul from the United States.[tpl]cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Gregory|title=The First Texas|journal=Texas Monthly|date=January 1986|pages=26, 88–89|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5isEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=south+carolina+%22william+barret+travis%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=i5F_Uo-eJNHbiwK6qYEo&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=south%20carolina%20%22william%20barret%20travis%22&f=false|accessdate=November 10, 2013[/tpl] He set up a law practice in Anahuac and helped start a militia to oppose Mexican rule.[tpl]cite web|title=The Turtle Bay Resolutions|url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/turtle/turtle-01.html|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|accessdate=November 10, 2013[/tpl] He subsequently became a pivotal figure in the Anahuac Disturbances and was imprisoned for his involvement.[tpl]sfn|Davis|1966|page= xiv[/tpl]
Travis was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Cavalry and became the chief recruiting officer for a new regular Texan army. Governor Henry Smith ordered Travis to raise a company of professional soldiers to reinforce the Texans under James C. Neill at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio.[tpl]cite web|last=McDonald|first=Archie P.|title=William Barret Travis|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ftr03|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=November 10, 2013[/tpl]
Travis considered disobeying his orders, writing to Smith: "I am willing, nay anxious, to go to the defense of Bexar, but sir, I am unwilling to risk my reputation ... by going off into the enemy's country with such little means, so few men, and with them so badly equipped."[tpl]sfn|Hardin|1994|page=117[/tpl] James Bowie arrived at the Alamo with 30 men on January 19, 1836. On February 3, Travis arrived in San Antonio with eighteen regulars as reinforcements. A compromise was reached between Bowie and Travis for command of the Alamo, with Bowie in command of the volunteers and Travis in command of the regulars.[tpl]sfn|Davis|1966|page= xiv[/tpl] When Bowie's health began to fail, it became irrelevant, and Travis became the official commander of the Alamo garrison. On March 6, 1836, following a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna ordered the assault on the Alamo during the predawn hours. Travis died fighting to the end, and his remains were burned along with the other Alamo defenders.

==Travis's "Victory or Death" letter from the Alamo==

On February 24, 1836, during Santa Anna's siege of the Alamo, Travis wrote a letter addressed "To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World":
He gave this letter to courier John William Smith to deliver. The envelope that contained the letter was labeled "Victory or Death".[tpl]sfn|Hardin|1994|page=117[/tpl]
The letter, while unable to bring aid to the garrison at the Alamo, did much to motivate the Texian army and helped to rally support in America for the cause of Texan independence. It also cemented Travis's status as a hero of the Texas Revolution.

==Family==

Travis married one of his former students, 16-year-old Rosanna Cato (1812–1848), on October 26, 1828. The couple stayed in Claiborne and had a son, Charles Edward, in 1829 and a daughter, Susan, in 1831.[tpl]sfn|Davis|1966|page= xii[/tpl] They were officially divorced by the Marion County courts on January 9, 1836, by Act no. 115. Rosanna married Samuel G. Cloud in Monroeville, Alabama, on February 14, 1836. However, they both died of Yellow Fever during an epidemic which afflicted the state in 1848.
Charles Edward Travis (1829–1860) was raised by his mother and her second husband. He won a seat in the Texas legislature in 1853. In 1855, he enlisted in the United States Army as a captain in a cavalry regiment (which was later renamed the 5th Cavalry Regiment (United States) commanded by Albert Sidney Johnston) but was discharged in May 1856 for "conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman" following an allegation that he had cheated at cards.[tpl]cite web|last=Cutrer|first=Thomas W|title=Charles Edward Travis|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ftr04|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=November 10, 2013[/tpl] He appealed the decision to no avail. He then turned to studying law, earning a degree from Baylor University in 1859. He died of consumption (tuberculosis) within a year and is buried beside his sister.[tpl]cite web|title=Chappell Hill, TX|url=http://texasescapes.com/TOWNS/Chappell_Hill/town_chappell_hill.htm|work=Texas Escapes|publisher=Blueprints For Travel, LLC|accessdate=November 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Find a Grave|27394043|Charles Edward Travis[/tpl]
Susan Isabella Travis was born in 1831, after Travis had departed for Texas. Although her paternity has been questioned, Travis did name her as his daughter in his will. In 1850, she married a planter from Chapell Hill,[tpl]Find a Grave|27746571|Susanna Isabella Travis Grissett[/tpl] and their son was William Barret Grissett.[tpl]Find a Grave|92596070|William Barret Grissett[/tpl]
