Queluz ([tpl]IPA-pt|kɛˈluʃ[/tpl]) is a civil parish in the municipality (concelho) of Sintra, in the Portuguese district of Lisbon. The population in the parish of Queluz in 2001 was 27,913, in an area of approximately [tpl]convert|2.93|km2|sqmi[/tpl] (about 9527 inhabitants per square kilometre).

==History==

The origin of Queluz derives itself from the Arab, which meant a "thin valley" or "river margin", and simultaneously, an almond orchard. It was a rural territory of fertile parcels and potable water, that would evolve to an mainly urban area, within the municipality of Sintra.
Queluz is mainly known for the 18th-century Royal Palace, one of the most representative of the rococo buildings in Europe.
On 29 June 1925, Queluz was deannexed from the parish of Belas (article 1, Decree 1:790, 29 June 1925). By the mid-20th century, its importance within the municipality had grown to the point, that the town (elevated to this status on 18 September 1961) was elevated to the status of city (on 20 June 1997), constituted from the parishes of Queluz, Massamá and Monte Abraão (which were de-annexed from the parish of Queluz, to become their own administrative authorities).
Since 29 June 2001, the parish council was installed on Rua Conde de Almeida Araújo, while the former installations were remodelled, resulting in the Sala Multiusos Fernando Ribeiro Leitão (which received artists' expositions, cultural events and meetings of the parish).
The parish council remodelled the historical public washing-house, a protocol signed between the 23 Group of the Associação de Escuteiros de Portugal and the Grupo Coral de Queluz (the two entities that now occupy the edifice). In 2004, a shop along Avenida da República, was acquired to decentralize services.

==Geography==
