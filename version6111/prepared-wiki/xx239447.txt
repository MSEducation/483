The Consortium for Strategic Communication (or CSC) is a think-tank at Arizona State University.

==History==

The Consortium for Strategic Communicationhttp://www.comops.org/index.php is an initiative of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. It was formed in 2005 to apply communication research to combating terrorism, promoting national security, and engaging in public diplomacy worldwide. It is composed of interdisciplinary scholars at ASU and partner institutions who are interested in applying knowledge of human communication to issues of countering ideological support for terrorism (CIST), diplomacy and public diplomacy.http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/consortium.shtml The CSC offers undergraduate and graduate class, as well as, public lectures. COMOPS is the official journal of the Consortium for Strategic Communication (CSC) that provides nonpartisan commentary on current issues in terrorism/counter-terrorism, public diplomacy, and security from a human communication perspective. Each journal or blog post outlines a current issue of interest and analyzes the issue using principles from rhetoric, persuasion, organizational, political, and intercultural communication. The site is updated on a weekly basis in order to maintain its integrity of addressing current topics. Authors of this website are made up of faculty, graduate students of the CSC, and their invited guests.http://comops.org/journal/about/
