CATEGORIES: Irregular military, Paramilitary organizations, Military terminology

A paramilitary is a militarised force or other organization whose organizational structure, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not considered part of a state's formal armed forces.[tpl]cite book| chapter=paramilitary| title=Oxford English Dictionary| publisher=Oxford University Press| edition=3rd| date=June 2005; online version June 2011| url=http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&q=paramilitary| accessdate=2011-09-13| quote=Designating, of, or relating to a force or unit whose function and organization are analogous or ancillary to those of a professional military force, but which is not regarded as having professional or legitimate status.[/tpl] The assigned role, function, equipment and primary purpose of a paramilitary may also strongly differ from that of a professional military. The comparison of a military to a paramilitary can be likened to that of a comparison between a medic and a paramedic.   
Under the Law of Armed Conflict, a state may incorporate a paramilitary organization or armed agency (such as a national police or a private volunteer militia) into its armed forces. The other parties to a conflict have to be notified thereof.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_nl_rule4_sectionb |title=Customary IHL - Section B.

The use of the term paramilitary is debated, with different groups differently classifying groups as paramilitary or not based on disagreements as to what constitutes the correct standards as to what is similar to a military force and what is the correct method for deciding if a group meets those standards. The evaluation of the nature of a paramilitary force varies depending the nature on the individual group, the standards use to discern the list of groups that are paramilitary, and the list of groups that have been categorized as paramilitary.Organizations that have been described as paramilitary are as diverse as the Minutemen, youth groups (from Scouting to the Pioneer movement), and even martially themed boarding schools.
