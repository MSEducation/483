==Critical Reception==

Synchronised Swimmers has received mixed reviews from music critics. Samantha Hatfield of BuzzleGoose wrote that "Hafdis Huld has produced a really strong album that is upbeat and will appeal to fans of 90s era chick rock music. Her folksy and eccentric way of constructing Synchronised Swimmers has certainly paid off."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.buzzlegoose.com/music/review-synchronised-swimmers-by-hafdis-huld/ |title=Review: 'Synchronised Swimmers' by Hafdís Huld |author=Samantha Hatfield |date=26 April 2011 |work=BuzzleGoose |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl] Michael Cragg of The Guardian meanwhile gave the album a rating of 2/5, nothing that "as the album progresses, however, Huld's need to appear kooky becomes cloying."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jun/24/hafdis-hild-synchronised-swimmers-cd-review |title=Hafdís Huld: Synchronised Swimmers |author=Michael Cragg |date=24 June 2010 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl]
