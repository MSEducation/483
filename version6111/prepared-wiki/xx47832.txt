==Millennium Prize Problems==

Of the seven Millennium Prize Problems set by the Clay Mathematics Institute, six have yet to be solved:
The seventh problem, the Poincaré conjecture, has been solved. The smooth four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture is still unsolved. That is, can a four-dimensional topological sphere have two or more inequivalent smooth structures?
