==History==

In 1995 Deutsche Telekom renamed the BTX service as "T-Online". On Spring 2000 T-Online becomes the first major ISP in Germany to offer a flat-rate dialup plan for consumers.  This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including dialup access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis.  The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with ISDN connections at the same price as for analog service. On Spring 2001: T-Online announced the demise of the flat-rate dialup plan but offered a flat-rate DSL plan in its place.
Deutsche Telekom (T-Online) was the monopoly Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the German Internet until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter.[tpl]cite book | title= Internet Entrepreneurship in Europe: Venture Failure and the Timing of Telecommunications Reform | first= Niko Marcel | last= Waesche | pages= 162â€“164 | year= 2003 | publisher= Edward Elgar Publishing | isbn= 978-1-84376-135-8 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=n10s8DoD7U4C&pg=PA162[/tpl] Until the 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany.
