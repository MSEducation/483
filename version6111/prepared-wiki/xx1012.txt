===Radio===

Columbus is home to the 36th largest radio market.Arbitron Radio Market Rankings: Spring 2010, Arbitron, Spring 2010, Retrieved May 2, 2010 The following box contains all of the radio stations in the area, as well as their current format:

==Transportation==

===Grid and address system===

The city's street plan originates downtown and extends into the old-growth neighborhoods, following a grid pattern with the intersection of High Street (running north–south) and Broad Street (running east–west) at its center. North-South streets run 12 degrees west of due North, parallel to High Street; the Avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on.) run east–west.Moore, p. 127 The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered Avenues begin with First Avenue, about [tpl]convert|1.25|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered Streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about [tpl]convert|1|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] (along the same street). For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately [tpl]convert|.5|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north–south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes ‘N’ and ‘S’ indicate whether that distance is to measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.
This street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east–west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north–south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north–south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east–west, perpendicular to High Street.
The addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.
Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road (SR-161), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road (SR-3), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue.

===Highways===

Columbus is bisected by two major Interstate Highways, Interstate 70 running east–west, and Interstate 71 running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about [tpl]convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in an area locally known as "The Split", which is a major traffic congestion point within Columbus, especially during rush hour. U.S. Highway 40, aka National Road, runs east–west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. It is also widely recognized as the nation's first highway. U.S. Highway 23 runs roughly north–south, while U.S. Highway 33 runs northwest-to-southeast. The Interstate 270 Outerbelt encircles the vast majority of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the Interstate 670 spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), State Route 315 on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2 or 3 hour drive of Columbus.

===Bridges===

The Columbus riverfront hosts a few notable bridges which have been built since 2000. The [tpl]convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Main Street Bridge opened on July 30, 2010 and is the first bridge of its kind in North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge |title=Main Street Bridge: Steel Structure Makes Dramatic Visual Impact on Downtown Columbus Skyline |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=Downtown Columbus | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106135608/http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge | archivedate = January 6, 2009[/tpl] The bridge is located directly south of COSI on the Scioto river, featuring three lanes of traffic (one westbound and two eastbound) and another separated lane for pedestrians and bikes. The Rich Street Bridge opened in July 2012 and is adjacent to the Main Street Bridge connecting Rich Street on the east side of the river with Town Street on the west.[tpl]cite web|author=The Columbus Dispatch |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/07/02/fireworks-spectators-get-to-use-bridge-first.html |title=Fireworks spectators first to use Rich Street bridge | The Columbus Dispatch |publisher=Dispatch.com |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://pubserv.ci.columbus.oh.us/transportation/Document_Library/PROJECTS/Rich_Street_Bridge.pdf |title=Rich Street Bridge Replacement |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=City of Columbus |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091222051818/http://pubserv.ci.columbus.oh.us/transportation/Document_Library/PROJECTS/Rich_Street_Bridge.pdf | archivedate = December 22, 2009[/tpl] The Lane Avenue Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that opened on November 14, 2003 in the University District and spans the Olentangy river with three lanes of traffic each way.

===Airports===

The city's primary airport, Port Columbus International Airport, is located on the east side of the city, with several smaller airports in the region as well. Port Columbus provides service to Toronto, Canada and Cancun, Mexico (on a seasonal basis), as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs except San Francisco, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. Port Columbus was a hub for discount carrier Skybus Airlines and continues to be a home to NetJets, the world's largest fractional ownership air carrier. According to a 2005 market survey, Port Columbus International Airport attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its [tpl]convert|60|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] radius primary service region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://columbusairports.com/files/about-us/craa-eia-full-brochure1.pdf|title=Regional Airports economic impact study, Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc., January 2005, Chap 1 pp2-4|accessdate=July 5, 2012[/tpl] Port Columbus is currently the 52nd-busiest airport in the United States by total passenger boardings.Columbus Dispatch, February 26, 2012: "Can't get there from here (At least, not without a layover"), pp. D1-2 (By Steve Wartenberg) Rickenbacker International Airport, in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility and is utilized by the Ohio Air National Guard. Allegiant Air offers nonstop service from Rickenbacker to various Florida destinations. OSU Don Scott Airport and Bolton Field are significant general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area.

===Mass transit===

Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA).
Currently, Columbus does not have any type of passenger rail service.
Columbus used to have a major train station downtown called Union Station, most notably as a stop along Amtrak's National Limited train service until 1977. The station itself was razed in 1979,[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028014238/http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archivedate=October 28, 2006|title=Columbus Union Station|date=October 13, 2006[/tpl] and the Greater Columbus Convention Center now stands in its place. The station was also a stop along the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. Columbus is now the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. without either a local rail or intercity rail connection (Phoenix opened a light-rail system in 2008, but still lacks an Amtrak connection.  Other metro areas larger than Columbus also lack local rail systems.);[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak|date=November 23, 2006|accessdate=May 2, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix|title=Phoenix debuts light-rail system|date=December 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl] however studies are underway towards reintroducing passenger rail service to Columbus via the Ohio Hub project. Plans are in the works to open a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to the proposed hub in Cleveland which offers rail service to the East Coast, including New York and Washington, DC.Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail Retrieved July 26, 2009.

===Bicycle===

Bicycling as transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population, and off-road bike paths. The city has put forth the 2012 Bicentennial Bikeways Plan as well as a move toward a Complete Streets policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altaprojects.net/columbus/ |title=Columbus (OH) Bikeways Plan |publisher=Altaprojects.net |accessdate=May 5, 2009[/tpl] Grassroots efforts such as Bike To Work Week, Consider Biking, Yay Bikes,[tpl]cite web|author=Michael Reed |url=http://yaybikes.com/about-us/ |title=About Us | Yay Bikes! | Columbus, Oh |publisher=Yay Bikes! |accessdate=July 5, 2012[/tpl] Third Hand Bicycle Co-op, Franklinton Cycleworks, and Cranksters, a local radio program focused on urban cycling,[tpl]cite web|author=WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |url=http://wcrsfm.org/cranksters |title=Cranksters | WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |publisher=Wcrsfm.org |date=November 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2009[/tpl] have contributed to cycling as transportation.
Columbus also hosts urban cycling "off-shots" with messenger-style "alleycat" races as well as unorganized group rides, a monthly Critical Mass ride,[tpl]cite web|url=http://comacrew.homestead.com/criticalmass.html |title=Critical Mass Columbus |publisher=Comacrew.homestead.com |accessdate=May 5, 2009[/tpl] bicycle polo, art showings, movie nights, and a variety of bicycle-friendly businesses and events throughout the year. All this activity occurs despite Columbus's frequently inclement weather.
The new Main Street Bridge features a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane separated from traffic, as does the Rich Street Bridge.

==Notable people==

==Sister cities==

Columbus has eight sister cities,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sister-cities.org/directory/index.cfm|title=SCI: Sister City Directory|publisher=Sister Cities International|accessdate=February 28, 2012[/tpl] as designated by Sister Cities International. Columbus established its first Sister City relationship in 1955 with Genoa, Italy. To commemorate this relationship, Columbus received as a gift from the people of Genoa, a bronze statue of Christopher Columbus. The statue, sculpted by artist Edoardo Alfieri, overlooks Broad Street in front of Columbus City Hall.[ref]
