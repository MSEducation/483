Coast to Coast Carpet of Love is singer-songwriter Robert Pollard's 8th solo release. It was released October 9, 2007 alongside Standard Gargoyle Decisions. In addition, the album was pressed on 180Â gram vinyl in a limited edition of 1,500.  The album leaked September 24, 2007.
At the December 1st, 2007 show at Southgate House supporting the album, Pollard claimed he talked to Tommy Keene on the phone and told him the new album was Coast to Coast Carpet of Blood, though Keene misheard "Blood" for "Love." When Pollard corrected him, he claimed it should be "Love" because it was "groovier." The title stuck.
