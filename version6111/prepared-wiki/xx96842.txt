[[Acidic oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Acidic oxides

Acidic oxides are inorganic chemicals that react with water to form an acid; or react with a base to form a salt. Acidic oxides are oxides of either nonmetals or of metals in high oxidation states.  They are formed when a nonmetal burns. Their chemistry can be systematically understood by taking an oxoacid and removing water from it, until only the oxide is left. The resulting oxide belongs to this group of substances.
Acidic oxides are not Arrhenius acids, nor are they Brønsted–Lowry acids, since they neither accept protons, nor do they increase the hydrogen ion concentration of water. However, they are Lewis acids, since they accept electron pairs from certain Lewis bases, most notably Base anhydrides.Principles of Modern Chemistry, 7th Edition. David Oxtoby, H. P.
