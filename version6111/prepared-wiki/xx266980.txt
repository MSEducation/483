Bessie Lee Mauldin (Bessie Lee "The Carolina Songbird" Mauldin; [tpl]nowrap|December 28, 1920[/tpl], Norwood, North Carolina - [tpl]nowrap|February 8, 1983[/tpl]) was an American bluegrass bassist.
She was the third of four girls. Bessie first met Bill Monroe in 1938, and a few years later  went on to became his bass player with the Bluegrass Boys, from 1953â€“1964. She played in many recording sessions of the band. Her love affair with Bill Monroe  began around 1941 and carried on largely while Bill was touring with the Bluegrass Boys.

Monroe and Mauldin wrote a few songs together, one of which was a gospel song, A Voice From On High, which was performed by Bob Dylan as his opening number in August 2002.
