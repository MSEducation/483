The ACA Cyclone is an outdoor warning siren built by Alerting Communicators of America (ACA) — now American Signal Corporation — in 1968.

==History==

The Cyclone was designed in 1968, by Jim Biersach, as a siren with a 40 horsepower motor and sound output of 120 dB at a distance of 100 ft.  It was intended for civil defense, but many communities have employed it for other purposes. In 1980, the P-50 was designed, using the same rotor as the Cyclone. The Cyclone was redesigned in 1980, and through the use of a 50 horsepower motor, raised its sound output to 125 dB at 100 feet.
