Ntfsprogs is a collection of free Unix utilities for managing the NTFS filesystem used by the Windows NT operating system (since version 3.1) on a hard disk partition. 'ntfsprogs' was the first stable method of writing to NTFS partitions in Linux.
All NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. ntfsprogs remains a popular way of interacting with NTFS partitions and is included by most Linux distributions and on Live CDs. There are also versions that have been compiled for Windows.
On April 12, 2011 Tuxera announced that Ntfsprogs project was merged with NTFS-3G.Release: NTFS-3G + NTFSPROGS 2011.4.12
