Vinnie Roe is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. He won the Irish St. Leger for four years in succession (2001-2004) and was named European Champion Stayer in the Cartier Racing Awards for 2002. He also became known internationally for his three attempts to win the Melbourne Cup in which he finished fourth, second and eighth. He was officially rated the best stayer in the world on three occasions (2002, 2003, 2004). He was retired from racing in 2005 and is currently at stud in County Cork, Ireland.

As a foal, Vinnie Roe was sent to the Goffs November sale and bought for 48,000 gns. A year later, he was sent to the Goffs Orby sale, where he was sold for IRÂ£50,000[tpl]note label|guineas|1|1[/tpl] to Dermot Weld[tpl]cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/dam/dam_home.sd?horse_id=418684#damTabs=dam_progeny_sales |title=Kayu (GB) statistics |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] on behalf of the film director Jim Sheridan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racenewsonline.co.uk/newslink/archive/901/200901.htm |title=Racenews Newslink 2001 |publisher=Racenewsonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] who named the horse after his nephew.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Irish+leger%3A+Vinnie+Roe+attempts+to+gallop+into+history.-a0107725825 |title=Vinnie Roe attempts to gallop into history|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=2003-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Sheridan owned the horse in partnership with Antonio Balzarini, and over the course of his career, Vinnie Roe was variously described as being owned by Sheridan, Balzarini or both.
Vinnie Roe was trained throughout his racing career by Dermot Weld at the Curragh and was ridden in all but one of his races by Pat Smullen. He was an easily recognisable runner, usually racing in blinkers and a sheepskin noseband. Because of the differences in breeding seasons between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Australian sources often describe Vinnie Roe as being a year older than his "official" age.

==Racing career==

===2000: two-year-old season===

Vinnie Roe made a winning debut in a maiden race at Leopardstown in June, staying on strongly to get up on the line and beat the filly Affianced by a head. In October, he was stepped up to Group Three class and finished third behind two Aidan O'Brien-trained runners in the Beresford Stakes at The Curragh. On his final start of the year, he returned to Leopardstown to record his first important win in the Listed Eyrefield Stakes, beating  the future Tattersalls Gold Cup winner Rebelline by one and a half lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=293741&r_date=2000-11-12&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Eyrefield Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]

===2001: three-year-old season===

Vinnie Roe was campaigned over middle distances in the early part of his three-year-old season. He finished behind Galileo in the Ballysax Stakes, the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and the Irish Derby and was also sent to Rome, where he finished fourth to Morshdi in the Derby Italiano.
He was then moved up to staying (Extended) distances and was unbeaten in his remaining four races. Three weeks after his run in the Irish Derby, he was driven clear in the closing stages to win the Listed Challenge Stakes at Leopardstown by four lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=304479&r_date=2001-07-21&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Irish Challenge Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] A month later, he stayed on  to take the Ballycullen Stakes at the Curragh by a head from the John Oxx-trained favourite Pugin, who was receiving three pounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=305843&r_date=2001-08-25&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Ballycullen Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] The race illustrated Vinnie Roe's aptitude for longer distances, as Pugin had finished three lengths in front of him at level weights in the Irish Derby.
In the Irish St Leger in September, he faced a strong field headed by the 2000 English St Leger winner Millenary, the future Arc winner Marienbard and the double Champion Stayer Persian Punch. Pat Smullen held up Vinnie Roe in the early stages as Persian Punch set the pace from Millenary  before making his challenge in the straight. Millenary took the lead, but Smullen brought Vinnie Roe through to overtake him inside the final furlong and win by two lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=306400&r_date=2001-09-15&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Irish St Leger 2001|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Vinnie Roe was then sent to Longchamp for the Prix Royal-Oak and secured his second successive Group One win, this time over two miles. Smullen took him into the lead two furlongs out and he won by two and a half lengths, despite hanging to the right in the closing stages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=308589&r_date=2001-10-28&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Prix Royal-Oak result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Dermot Weld decided not to send Vinnie Roe for the Melbourne Cup in 2001, as he believed that the journey would be too difficult for the three-year-old.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingandsports.com.au/racing/mcup2001news1.htm |title=Melbourne Cup Feature |publisher=Racingandsports.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]

===2002: four-year-old season===

Vinnie Roe began 2002 by taking his fifth race in succession, winning the Listed Saval Beg Stakes "easily" by four lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=317872&r_date=2002-05-30&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Saval Be Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] He was then sent to race in England for the first time and was made favourite for the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup. He made a strong challenge in the straight to briefly take the lead, but although he stayed on "gamely" he was headed again in the closing stages and beaten a neck by the gelding Royal Rebel[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=314768&r_date=2002-06-20&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Ascot Gold Cup result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] in what the BBC described as a "thrilling" race.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/royal_ascot_2002/2053596.stm |title=Royal Rebel retains Gold Cup |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-20 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Two months later, he won the Listed Ballyroan Stakes at Leopardstown, holding off Millstreet by half a length while carrying a weight of 10-0 (140 pounds).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=321345&r_date=2002-08-18&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Ballyroan Stakes 2002 result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] In September, he won his second Irish St Leger, beating Pugin by one and a half lengths, with Millenary and Warrsan among the beaten horses. After the race, Dermot Weld called him "a very brave horse, one of the toughest I have ever trained."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2258160.stm |title=Vinnie Roe claims Irish Leger |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Vinnie Roe was then sent to Australia for the Melbourne Cup. He was allotted a weight of 59 kgs, three kilograms more than any other runner, but was nevertheless made favourite at 9/2. According to The Age, he was the "centre of attention" before the race and impressed observers including Bart Cummings with a "brilliant" exercise gallop.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/29/1035683411655.html |title=Vinnie Roe steals the show |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2002-10-30 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=Melbourne[/tpl] In the race, he settled well and was moved up to take the lead two furlongs out, but was then challenged and overtaken by his stable companion Media Puzzle. He ran on under pressure, but was passed by Mr Prudent and Beekeeper in the closing stages to finish fourth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=324741&r_date=2002-11-05&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Melbourne Cup 2002|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Weld described the performance as "a big run on a track that was too firm for him" and added, "he'll be back."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/racing-puzzle-triumphs-as-europe-holds-sway-603387.html |title=Puzzle triumphs as Europe holds sway  |publisher=The Independent |date=2002-11-06 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=London[/tpl]

===2003: five-year-old season===

After his run in Melbourne, Vinnie Roe was off the course for nine months. He returned in August 2003 to win his second Ballyroan Stakes, winning by a head from Carpanetto, who was receiving seventeen pounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=337934&r_date=2003-08-17&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Ballyroan Stakes 2003 result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] In his attempt to win a third Irish St Leger, he was opposed by five runners including the English St Leger winner Bollin Eric and the improving Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old Powerscourt. Vinnie Roe was sent into the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and stayed on to win by a length from the English four-year-old Gamut.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=339058&r_date=2003-09-13&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Irish St Leger 2003 |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Although there was much speculation about a return to Australia,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/18/1061059775357.html |title=Weld may put Arc ahead of cup for Vinnie Roe |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2003-08-19 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=Melbourne |first=Andrew |last=Eddy[/tpl] Vinnie Roe was sent to Paris, rather than Melbourne, for his remaining two starts of 2003. He moved back down to one and a half miles for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and finished fifth behind Dalakhani, then was fourth to Westerner when favourite for the Prix Royal-Oak.

===2004: six-year-old season===

In the Saval Beg Stakes, the outsider Windermere was allowed to open up a huge lead ("a furlong" according to RTÃ),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2004/0526/leopardstown.html |title=Murtagh steals a march to defeat Vinnie |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2004-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] and Vinnie Roe, the odds-on favourite, was only able to close the gap to four and a half lengths by the finish. In August, he stayed on strongly in the closing stages of the Ballyroan Stakes but was beaten a neck by the English-trained Foreign Affairs.
In the Irish St Leger, which was run in cold, wet conditions, he was made 7/2 joint favourite  with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Brian Boru the winner of the 2003 English St Leger. Smullen tracked the leaders before moving  into the lead at the start of the straight. Vinnie Roe went clear and stayed on through driving rain[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/19/1095532175469.html |title=Vinnie Roe a cup hope after fourth St Leger|publisher=www.theage.com.au |date= 2004-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=Melbourne[/tpl] to win by two and a half lengths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=358687&r_date=2004-09-18&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Irish St Leger 2004|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] His performance was greeted with loud applause throughout the final furlong and he was given a "hero's welcome" as he returned to the winner's enclosure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/19/1095532176928.html |title=Vinnie Roe looks better for Big One  |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=2004-09-20 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Smullen commented that Vinnie Roe had "annihilated them" and that "he loves it when there is a bit of cut in the ground."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/3668494.stm |title=Vinnie wins fourth Leger |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
He returned to Flemington for a second attempt at the Melbourne Cup in November and, as in 2002, he was given top weight. On this occasion, he was given 58Â kg, which required him to give at least 2.5Â kg to the rest of the field, which included the 2003 winner Makybe Diva. Before the race, Weld expressed concern that the conditions would be too firm but decided to run after heavy rainfall softened the ground.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/racing-vinnie-roe-to-reinforce-welds-melbourne-team-535596.html |title=Racing: Vinnie Roe to reinforce Weld's Melbourne team  |publisher=The Independent |date=2004-11-01 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=London |first=Stephen |last=Lyle[/tpl] Smullen produced Vinnie Roe with a strong run in the straight and took him into the lead a furlong out, but he was almost immediately overtaken by Makybe Diva racing on the inside  and finished second, beaten by one and a quarter lengths. After the race, Weld said that the conditions had been ideal for his horse but that "the weight just caught him out."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-11-02/vinnie-roe-caught-out-by-weight/578848 |title=Vinnie Roe caught out by weight|publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2004-11-02 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]

===2005: seven-year-old season===

Vinnie Roe began 2005 by winning a second Saval Beg Stakes at the Curragh in May  before being sent to England for a second attempt at the Gold Cup, run that year at York as Ascot was being renovated. He ran prominently but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished third of the seventeen runners behind Westerner. Both Weld and Smullen felt that the two and a half mile distance had been slightly too far for Vinnie Roe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0616/goldcup1.html |title=French victory as Westerner takes Gold |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
He finished third in the Ballyroan Stakes and then attempted to win a fifth Irish St Leger, despite having his preparation interrupted by a minor injury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thoroughbrednews.com.au/international/Default.aspx?id=20063 |title=Collier Hill defeats Vinnie Roe |publisher=Thoroughbrednews.com.au |date=2005-09-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] He took the lead in the straight but could find no extra in the closing stages and finished third, beaten a length behind the English challengers Collier Hill and The Whistling Teal.
On his final start, Vinnie Roe made a third attempt at the Melbourne Cup. Again he was given top weight, although on this occasion he was joined on 58Â kg by Makybe Diva. His task was made more difficult after he endured a "nightmare" journey, having to receive veterinary treatment for colic on the flight[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/racing-vinnie-roe-back-in-work-after-arduous-trip-510662.html |title=Vinnie Roe back in work after arduous trip  |publisher=The Independent |date=2005-10-13 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=London |first=Keith |last=Hamer[/tpl] and there were the usual fears about the possibility of firm ground.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/horse-racing/if-tracks-hard-no-vinnie/2005/10/29/1130400403072.html |title=If the track is hard, no Vinnie |publisher=theage.com.au |date= 2005-10-30|accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=Melbourne |first=Andrew |last=Eddy[/tpl] In the race, he was settled in the middle of the field before staying on strongly in the straight, but could never reach the leaders and finished eighth of the twenty-four runners. After the race, Smullen, who knew that it would be Vinnie Roe's last run, said that the horse "ran his heart out" and that it was "the end of an era."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/vinnies-brave-fight-to-the-end/2005/11/01/1130823206999.html |title=Vinnie's brave fight to the end|publisher=smh.com.au |date= 2005-11-02|accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
