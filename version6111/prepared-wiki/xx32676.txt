Mount Tahan ([tpl]lang-ms|Gunung Tahan[/tpl]), at 2,187 m, is the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia. It is located within the Taman Negara national forest, in the state of Pahang. The mountain is part of the Tahan Range in the Tenasserim Hills and is popular with local climbers.
In the Malay language, "gunung" means "mountain," while "tahan" means "endure". Thus, the name of the mountain suggests that a certain level of physical endurance is required to conquer it. Gunung Tahan is considered by many to be one of the toughest treks in Peninsular Malaysia.

==Trails==

There are three trails to the summit, commonly referred to as:
1) Kuala Tahan-Kuala Tahan
2) Merapoh-Kuala Tahan or Kuala Tahan-Merapoh
3) Merapoh-Merapoh
The Kuala Tahan classic trail is the oldest and most scenic trail. A return trip on this trail typically takes seven days. Climbers have to trek across undulating ridges and make several river crossings before finally reaching the foot of the mountain to make the final ascent. Climbers without adequate physical fitness or training are not advised to attempt Gunung Tahan.
The other two trails are from Merapoh (Sungai Relau). The Merapoh-Merapoh trail is significantly shorter than the other two. A return trip on the Merapoh trail takes 3â€“4 days. A traverse from Kuala Tahan to Merapoh (or the other way around) takes around 5 days.
