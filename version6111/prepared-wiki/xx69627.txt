==History==

Before and during the American Revolutionary War, the Catholics in Great Britain's thirteen colonies in America (and also its colonies in Canada) were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of the London District, in England. The war was formally ended by the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on September 3, 1783, and was ratified by the Congress of the Confederation (of the newly independent United States of America) on January 14, 1784, and by the King of Great Britain on April 9, 1784. The ratification documents were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784.
A petition was sent by the Maryland clergy to the Holy See, on November 6, 1783, for permission for the missionaries in the United States to nominate a superior who would have some of the powers of a bishop. In response to that, Father John Carroll — having been selected by his brother priests — was confirmed by Pope Pius VI, on  June 6, 1784, as Superior of the Missions in the thirteen United States of North America, with power to give the sacrament of confirmation. This act established a hierarchy in the United States and removed the Catholic Church in the U.S. from the authority of the Vicar Apostolic of the London District.
The Holy See then established the Apostolic Prefecture of the United States on November 26, 1784. Because Maryland was one of the few regions of the colonial United States that was predominantly Catholic, the apostolic prefecture was elevated to become the Diocese of Baltimore"Our History".

The newly established "Province of Baltimore" — whose metropolitan was the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore — comprised all of the states and territories of the nation.
The Archdiocese however, again lost territory with the creation of the Diocese of Richmond  (Va.)http://www.richmonddiocese.org/about/index.htm on July 11, 1820, and the Diocese of Wilmington (Del.)http://www.cdow.org/cdowhistory.html on March 3, 1868. In 1850, the Diocese of Wheeling (then in Va.; now Wheeling-Charleston, W. Va.) http://www.dwc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=28&id=66&Itemid=106 was erected, from the Diocese of Richmond. In 1974, the Diocese of Arlington (Va.)http://www.arlingtondiocese.org/bishop/history.php was erected, from the Diocese of Richmond.
On July 22, 1939, the see was renamed the Archdiocese of Baltimore-Washington, in recognition of the nation's capital. Eight years later, on November 15, 1947, the District of Columbia and the five southern counties of Maryland became the Archdiocese of Washington (D.C.)http://www.adw.org/home.asp, resulting in the present-day Archdiocese of Baltimore, which consists of the City of Baltimore and nine counties of central and western Maryland.
From 1808 until 1847, Baltimore was the only archdiocese and therefore the entire country was one ecclesiastical province.http://www.archbalt.org/our-history/history-catholic-church.cfm As the nation's population grew and waves of Catholic immigrants came from Europe, the Holy See continued to erect new dioceses and elevate others to metropolitan archdioceses, which simultaneously became metropolitan sees of new ecclesiastical provinces. Thus, the Province of Baltimore gradually became smaller and smaller. In 1847, the then-Diocese of Saint Louis was elevated to an archdiocese and metropolitan see of the new Province of Saint Louis. In 1850, the Diocese of New York was raised to an archdiocese. Also in 1850, the Diocese of Oregon City (now Portland) was raised to an archdiocese. In 1875, the dioceses of Boston and Philadelphia were likewise elevated.

==Prelature==

===In general; "Prerogative of Place"===

The Archdiocese of Baltimore is led by the prelature of the Archbishop of Baltimore and a corps of auxiliary bishops who assist in the administration of the archdiocese as part of a larger curia. Sixteen people have served as Archbishop of Baltimore; the current Archbishop is William E. Lori.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28950.php?index=28950&lang=en|title=NOMINA DELL’ARCIVESCOVO DI BALTIMORE (U.S.A.)|publisher=Holy See Press Office|date=2012-03-20|language=Italian[/tpl]
In 1858, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide), with the approval of Pope Pius IX, conferred "Prerogative of Place" on the Archdiocese of Baltimore.  This decree gave the archbishop of Baltimore precedence over all other archbishops of the United States (but not cardinals) in councils, gatherings, and meetings of whatever kind of the hierarchy (in conciliis, coetibus et comitiis quibuscumque), regardless of the seniority of other archbishops in promotion or ordination.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.archbalt.org/our-history/index.cfm |title=Archdiocese of Baltimore - Our History |accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Cathedrals===

The archbishop is concurrently the pastor of the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the co-cathedral; the bishop appoints the cathedral and co-cathedral's rectors.  The Basilica, built in 1806–1821, is the first cathedral and parish in the United States within its boundaries at the time. It is considered the mother church of the United States.
The Archdiocese of Baltimore is one of only four United States dioceses that has two churches serving as cathedrals in the same city — the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace and Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus in the Diocese of Honolulu share the distinction.  The Diocese of Burlington and The Diocese of Brooklyn also have this in common.  Other dioceses with two cathedrals have their churches in separate cities.[ref]
