Damrosch (foaled in 1913) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1916 Preakness Stakes. Bred by August Belmont, Jr. at his Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky, he was sired by the 1903 English Triple Crown winner, Rock Sand. Damrosch was out of the mare Dissembler, a daughter of the four-time Leading sire in North America, Hanover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equineline.com/Free-5X-Pedigree.cfm?page_state=ORDER_AND_CONFIRM&reference_number=5357106&registry=T&horse_name=Damrosch&dam_name=Dissembler&foaling_year=1913&nicking_stats_indicator=Y |title=Damrosch pedigree |publisher=equineline.com |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl]
Captain W. Fred Presgrave of Kentucky, who had trained the winner of the 1904 Preakness Stakes winner, Bryn Mawr, purchased Damrosch from August Belmont, Jr. on behalf of Canadian businessman J. K. L. Ross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DEED81239E333A2575AC1A9679D946496D6CF |title=BELMONT SELLS THREE RACE HORSES |publisher=New York Times |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl] Presgrave trained the colt part way into his three-year-old campaign when Albert Weston took over his conditioning. In the Preakness Stakes, the colt was ridden to victory by Linus McAtee and led from the start to win from Greenwood.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1769851232.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=May+16%2C+1916&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&desc=FINE+RACE+BY+DAMROSCH&pqatl=google |title=Fine Race By Damrosch |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date=1916-05-16 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl]
