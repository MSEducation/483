[[Xuriella]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Xuriella is a small spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).
The female of Heliophanus pygmaeus was incorrectly associated with the male of X. prima. Both species are beetle-like in appearance. Beetle mimicry is rather common in spiders (including salticids), and has probably developed independently several times.Wesolowska 2004
