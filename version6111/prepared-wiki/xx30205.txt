A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.
Mermaids are associated with the mythological Greek sirens as well as with sirenia, a biological order comprising dugongs and manatees. Some of the historical sightings by sailors may have been misunderstood encounters with these aquatic mammals. Christopher Columbus reported seeing mermaids while exploring the Caribbean, and sightings have been reported in the 20th and 21st centuries in Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe.  The U.S. National Ocean Service stated in 2012 that no evidence of mermaids has ever been found.
Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics.

==Etymology and related terms==

The word mermaid is a compound of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman).[tpl]cite web| title= Mermaid | publisher = Oxford | work = Dictionaries | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mermaid?q=mermaid | accessdate= 16 April 2012[/tpl] The equivalent term in Old English was merewif.[tpl]cite web| title= Mermaid | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=mermaid&searchmode=none[/tpl] They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femme fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sirenian.org/sirenians.html |title=What are Sirenians? | publisher =Sirenian International |accessdate= 2012-07-21[/tpl]

===Sirenia===

Sirenia is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, including manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) in the form of two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=05297681013 |title=Experts: Sea cow 'sirens' fuel mermaid mythology; sailors' deprivation sparked images |date=December 25, 2005 |work= Underwater times |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl]

===Sirenomelia===

Sirenomelia, also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare congenital disorder in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and small genitalia. This condition is about as rare as conjoined twins, affecting one out of every 100,000 live births[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Kallen | first1 = B | last2 = Castilla | first2 = EE | last3 = Lancaster | first3 = PA | last4 = Mutchinick | first4 = O | last5 = Knudsen | first5 = LB | last6 = Martinez-Frias | first6 = ML | last7 = Mastroiacovo | first7 = P | last8 = Robert | first8 = E |title=The cyclops and the mermaid: an epidemiological study of two types of rare malformation |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |year=1992 |pages=30–5 |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pmid = 1552541 | doi =10.1136/jmg.29.1.30 |pmc=1015818[/tpl] and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of kidney and bladder complications.

==Folklore==

===Near East, Ancient Greece===

The first known mermaid stories appeared in Assyria c. 1000 BC.  The goddess Atargatis, mother of Assyrian queen Semiramis, loved a mortal (a shepherd) and unintentionally killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake and took the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid — human above the waist, fish below — although the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as a fish with a human head and arm, similar to the Babylonian god Ea. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo. Sometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.
A popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid after her death,[tpl]Citation | publisher = MPT | format = PDF | url = http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf | title = Alexander | contribution = Teacher's Guide[/tpl].[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] living in the Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she would encounter only one question: "Is King Alexander alive?" ([tpl]lang-el|"Ζει ο Βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος[/tpl];"), to which the correct answer was: "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" (Greek: "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμο κυριεύει").  This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell.  Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.[tpl]Citation | title = Mermaids and Ikons: A Greek Summer | year = 1978 | page = 73 | first = Gwendolyn | last = MacEwen | author-link = Gwendolyn MacEwen | ISBN = 978-0-88784-062-3[/tpl][tpl]Citation | title = Folktales from Greece | page = 96 | ISBN = 1-56308-908-4[/tpl].

===One Thousand and One Nights===

The One Thousand and One Nights collection includes several tales featuring "sea people", such as "Djullanar the Sea-girl".[tpl]Cite book|title= One Thousand and One Nights: A Companion|first = Robert | last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks| year=2003| isbn=1-86064-983-1| page = 209[/tpl] Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater.  In the tale "Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land.  The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. In "The Adventures of Bulukiya", the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, where he encounters societies of mermaids.

Mermaids have also been described as able to swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. In one story, the Laird of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.[tpl]Citation | first = KM | last = Briggs | title = The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature | page = 57 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | place = London | year = 1967[/tpl].

According to legend, a mermaid came to the Cornish village of Zennor where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella.  The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at Pendour Cove.  On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together.  At the Church of Saint Senara in Zennor, there is a famous chair decorated by a mermaid carving which is probably six hundred years old.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.zennor.org/church.html|title= St. Senara's Church | publisher=Zennor Parish Council|accessdate= 2012-06-16[/tpl]

===Western Europe===

A freshwater mermaid-like creature from European folklore is Melusine. She is sometimes depicted with two fish tails, or with the lower body of a serpent.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.archive.org/details/melusine00jeanuoft | title=Melusine, Compiled (1382–1394 A.D.) by Jean D'Arras, Englisht About 1500 | publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner | year=1895 | accessdate=November 20, 2012 | last = Donald | first = A.K.[/tpl]
Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a bowdlerized plot.  In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul.[tpl]cite web|url= http://hca.gilead.org.il/li_merma.html | first = Hans Christian | last = Andersen | title=The Little Mermaid |publisher= Gilead | location = IL |date=2007-12-13 | accessdate = 2012-07-21[/tpl]

The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, but according to ethnologist D.K. Zelenin they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead.  They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, perhaps by murder or suicide, and especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers.  They appear as beautiful young women with long green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in southern Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus, and was emphasized by 19th-century Russian authors.[tpl]cite book | last =Illes|first= Judika|title= The encyclopedia of spirits: the ultimate guide to the magic of fairies, genies, demons, ghosts, gods, and goddesses|year= 2009|publisher= HarperOne | location =New York|isbn = 978-0-06-135024-5 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=jDr51XX_YjEC&pg=PA871&lpg=PA871&dq=rusalka+drown&source=bl&ots=0MFIzDmK4i&sig=bdtBRmnMDWwchtPbYSGyrHVaXHM&sa=X&ei=uLgPUOD0NoHr6wHks4GoCQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=rusalka%20drown&f=false | page=871[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Warner|first = Elizabeth |title=Russian myths | year = 2002|publisher=Univ. of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX |isbn = 978-0-292-79158-9 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_PoesCeU0iUC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=rusalka&source=bl&ots=zHh74rzOSB&sig=FXVJze7xu6zJsthwkwAu1_7Ghs8&sa=X&ei=mgESUPeCH6SU6wHOnYHYBA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=rusalka&f=false | page = 42[/tpl][tpl]cite book| editor-last= Kelly | editor-first = Katherine E.|title = Modern drama by women 1800s–1930s: an international anthology|year= 1996 | publisher = Routledge| location = London |isbn = 978-0-415-12493-5 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=HCcl02qHH70C&pg=PA326&dq=rusalka+mermaid+translation+russian&sa=X&ei=jLETUPLtD4jm6wHS64GwCw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=rusalka%20mermaid%20translation%20russian&f=false | accessdate= 28 July 2012| page= 326[/tpl] The best-known of the great Czech nationalist composer Antonín Dvořák's operas is Rusalka.

In July 2012 in response to public inquiries, the National Ocean Service (a branch of NOAA) stated that "no evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found".[tpl]cite web|title=No evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mermaids.html|publisher=National Ocean Service|accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=No evidence of mermaids, says US government|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18692830|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=3 July 2012[/tpl]

===Hoaxes===

In the middle of the 17th century, John Tradescant the elder created a wunderkammer (called Tradescant's Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a "mermaid's hand".[tpl]cite book|last=Yanni|first= Carla | title =Nature's Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display|year=2005|publisher= Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56898-472-3|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=nT3hJxTKoeEC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=mermaid+tradescant&source=bl&ots=xV4GdYjHBp&sig=9TMOR8a6-F3A04H93Jy1VyAQEaA&sa=X&ei=_l8OUKmaCuW26wHIvICoCg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mermaid%20tradescant&f=false |edition=1st pbk. | accessdate =24 July 2012|page=20[/tpl] In the 19th century, P. T. Barnum displayed a taxidermal hoax called the Fiji mermaid in his museum. Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually papier-mâché fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, pictures of Fiji "mermaids" circulated on the Internet as supposed examples of items that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp | title = Urban Legends Reference Pages: Mermaid to Order |publisher=Snopes |accessdate= 2012-04-24[/tpl]

==Symbolism==

According to Dorothy Dinnerstein’s book The Mermaid and the Minotaur, human-animal hybrids such as mermaids and minotaurs convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals:
[tpl]Quote | Human nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here."[tpl]Citation | first = Dorothy | last = Dinnerstein | author-link = Dorothy Dinnerstein | title = The Mermaid and the Minotaur | place = New York | publisher = Harper & Row | year = 1963[/tpl].

==Art and literature==

Famous in more recent centuries is the fairy tale The Little Mermaid (1836) by Hans Christian Andersen, whose works have been translated into over 100 languages.[tpl]cite book|title=Biographical dictionary of literary influences: the nineteenth century, 1800–1914|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Westport, CT| isbn= 978-0-313-30422-4|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=3N3uj_wo-_kC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=andersen+%22little+mermaid%22+translated+into+languages&source=bl&ots=MnwImPqFB_&sig=ICuBzR9rcDs1YLT6krsYYkH0tlc&sa=X&ei=lrEUULHrFsnY6wHyk4GwBw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=andersen%20%22little%20mermaid%22%20translated%20into%20languages&f=false| editor-first =John | editor-last = Powell | accessdate =29 July 2012|page= 20[/tpl] The mermaid (as conceived by Andersen) is similar to Undine, a water nymph in German folklore who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human being.[tpl]cite book| last= Brandes|first= George Morris Cohen|title= The Romantic School in Germany (1873) | year =1902|publisher=The Macmillan Co |location=New York|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=UUbZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=undine+little+mermaid+andersen&source=bl&ots=66GT6bQ0Ib&sig=McP-QvpE8McHeAhIAfbAifwNZYI&sa=X&ei=MFoOULyhCpT46QGRm4H4CQ&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=undine%20little%20mermaid%20andersen&f=false |accessdate=24 July 2012|page=301[/tpl] Andersen's heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in Copenhagen harbour and influenced Western literary works such as Oscar Wilde's The Fisherman and His Soul and H.G.

Sculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 public art mermaid statues across the world.  Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Cayman Islands, Mexico, the United States (including Hawaii and Virgin Islands) and Canada.[tpl]Citation | type = map | title = Mermaids of Earch | url = http://www.mermaidsofearth.com/[/tpl].  Some of these mermaid statues have become icons of their city or country, and have become major tourist attractions in themselves.  The Little Mermaid (statue) in Copenhagen is an icon of that city as well as of Denmark. The Havis Amanda statue symbolizes the rebirth of the city of Helsinki, capital of Finland.  The Syrenka (mermaid) is part of the Coat of Arms of Warsaw, and is considered a protector of Warsaw, capital of Poland, which publicly displays statues of their mermaid.
Musical depictions of mermaids include those by Felix Mendelssohn in his Fair Melusina overture and the three "Rhine daughters" in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.  Lorelei, the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the Heinrich Heine poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren.  The Weeping Mermaid is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer Fan-Long Ko.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phesha0822/13941275 | first =Felicity Fei-Hsien | last = Chiu |title=Taiwan New Sound Concert–Requiem for the 228 Incident |publisher=Wretch |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate= 2012-07-24[/tpl]
An influential image was created by John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, entitled A Mermaid. An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the Royal Academy), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy's collection.[tpl]Citation | author-link = Elizabeth Prettejohn | last = Prettejohn | first = Elizabeth | others = et al | year = 2008 | title = J. W. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite | page = 144 | publisher = Thames & Hudson | place = London | ISBN = 978-90-8586-490-5[/tpl]. Mermaids were a favorite subject of John Reinhard Weguelin, a contemporary of Waterhouse.  He painted an image of the mermaid of Zennor as well as several other depictions of mermaids in watercolour.
Film depictions include the romantic comedy Splash (1984) and Aquamarine (2006). A 1963 episode of the television series Route 66 entitled "The Cruelest Sea" featured a mermaid performance artist working at Weeki Wachee aquatic park.  Mermaids also appeared in the popular supernatural drama television series Charmed, and were the basis of its spin-off series Mermaid. In She Creature (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland c. 1900 and attempt to transport her to America. The film Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides mixes old and new myths about mermaids: singing to sailors to lure them to their death, growing legs when taken onto dry land, and bestowing kisses with magical healing properties. Animated films include Disney's musical version of Andersen's tale, The Little Mermaid, and Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo. The Australian teen dramedy H2O: Just Add Water chronicles the adventures of three modern-day mermaids along the Gold Coast of Australia.

===Heraldry===

==Mermaid fandom==

Interest in mermaid costuming has grown alongside the popularity of fantasy cosplay as well as the availability of inexpensive monofins used in the construction of mermaid costumes. These costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/aug/14/photos-mermaid-convention-and-awards-silverton-cas/ |title=Photos: Mermaid convention breaks record(s), returns to L.V. next year |first1=Don |last1=Chareuncy |first2=Robin |last2=Leach |authorlink2=Robin Leach |date=August 14, 2011 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/os-merpalooza-convention-pictures-20120811,0,6329605.photogallery |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |title=Photos: Mer-Palooza Mermaid Convention in Orlando |last=Cruey |first=Joshua C. |date=August 11, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl]

==Human divers==

The Ama are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for shellfish and seaweed wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years.[tpl]cite journal | title = Physiology of Breath-Hold Diving and the Ama of Japan|date=1 September 1965|volume= Publication 1341 | accessdate = 26 July 2012|editor1-first=Herrman|editor1-last= Rahn|page= 25|publisher= US National Research Council | lccn = 65-62909| url = http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3279[/tpl] Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction.[tpl]cite journal |title=Physiology of Breath-Hold Diving and the Ama of Japan|date=1 September 1965|volume= Publication 1341 |accessdate=26 July 2012|editor1-first=Herrman|editor1-last=Rahn|page=41|publisher=US National Research Council |lccn= 65-62909|url= http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3279[/tpl] They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest.
