==Career==

===Radiohead===

Greenwood is the only member of Radiohead to have been classically trained on any instrument, and the only band member without a university degree; he was three weeks into a degree in music and psychology at Oxford Brookes University when Radiohead, then known as On a Friday, signed a recording contract with EMI in 1991, and left soon after. Greenwood stated that hearing Krzysztof Penderecki during that time had a significant influence on his perception of modern classical music.http://www.ateaseweb.com/2010/10/18/jonny-greenwood-on-penderecki-messiaen-and-the-bbc-concert-orchestra/
Greenwood's influence on Radiohead's recording and writing can be heard in many songs, as he usually takes the traditional lead guitarist role. In the 1990s, Greenwood wore an arm brace due to a repetitive strain injury attributed to his aggressive playing, saying "it's like taping up your fingers before a boxing match."[tpl]cite web| last = Randall | first = Mac | title = The Golden Age of Radiohead | date = April 1998 | url = http://www.greenplastic.com/coldstorage/articles/guitarworld0498.html| accessdate = 22 March 2009[/tpl]
Greenwood is often credited as the second major influence on songwriting in Radiohead, next to Thom Yorke. He wrote the music for the closing track of OK Computer, ("The Tourist"), and the intro, chorus and outro sections of the song "Subterranean Homesick Alien" from the OK Computer album, as well as the "rain down" section of "Paranoid Android". According to Yorke, the track "Just" from The Bends was "a competition by me and Jonny to get as many chords as possible into a song". An example of Greenwood's versatility is his use of the Ondes Martenot, which is featured on songs such as "The National Anthem" and "How to Disappear Completely" from the album Kid A, and "Pyramid Song" from the album Amnesiac. The song "Where I End and You Begin" from Hail to the Thief, which also features the instrument, was dedicated to the memory of Jeanne Loriod, a pioneer of the Ondes.
Greenwood and Yorke also collaborated on the song "Arpeggi" which is a piece in a classical style centred around arpeggios for voice, Ondes, and orchestra. It was performed with the London Sinfonietta and Arab Orchestra of Nazareth at the Ether Festival in March 2005;[tpl]cite news | title = BBC – Radio 3 – Hear And Now – Ether Festival| publisher = BBC| date = 25 June 2005| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/hearandnow/pip/qya4l/index.shtml| accessdate = [/tpl] the song would later be adapted for the full band to play in 2006, rearranged for guitar.  A studio version (closer to the full band version than the orchestral version) appeared on the album In Rainbows as "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi".
Greenwood is a computer programmer and builds software used in Radiohead's music. He became interested in programming when he was young, "playing around first with BASIC, then these primitive hex assemblers. Just simple bits of machine code – the closer I got to the bare bones of the computer, the more exciting I found it." At the suggestion of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Greenwood began using the music programing language Max, and said: "I got to reconnect properly with computers ... I didn't have to use someone else's idea of what a delay, or a reverb, or a sequencer should do, or should sound like – I could start from the ground, and think in terms of sound and maths. It was like coming off the rails."[tpl]cite web| last = Pask|first = Andrew| title = Mini Interview: Jonny Greenwood | date = 2 January 2014| url = http://cycling74.com/2014/01/02/mini-interview-jonny-greenwood/| accessdate = 4 January 2014[/tpl] Greenwood wrote the software Radiohead used to sample their playing for their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011).'[tpl]cite journal|author=David Fricke |title=Radiohead Reconnect – How the most experimental band in music learned to rock again|date = 26 April 2012|journal=Rolling Stone|issue=115[/tpl]

In February 2010, Greenwood debuted a composition entitled "Doghouse" at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios. In an interview following the performance, Greenwood and conductor Robert Ziegler revealed that the composition would be extrapolated into a score for the upcoming film Norwegian Wood directed by Anh Hung Tran, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Haruki Murakami. Greenwood described the writing of the piece to the BBC, "I wrote this piece mostly in hotels and dressing rooms while touring with Radiohead. This was more practical than glamorous – lots of time sitting around indoors, lots of instruments about – and aside from picking up a few geographical working titles, I can't think that it had any effect where, on tour, it was written." The premiere of the entire score took place on 19 March 2010.[tpl]cite web| last = Carlick| first = Stephen| title = Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood Scoring Film Adaptation of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood | publisher = exclaim.ca| date = 5 March 2010| url = http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=844&fid1=44842| accessdate = 6 March 2010[/tpl]
