"Gümüş" ("Silver"), a Turkish melodrama originally broadcast in Turkey by Kanal D from 2005 to 2007. The sudser became a pop-culture phenomenon when it aired across the Arab world as "Noor" (Arabic for "light") in 2006[tpl]When|date=December 2011[/tpl]. The show which MBC execs dubbed into Arabic using a colloquial Syrian dialect rather than formal, classical Arabic, followed the travails of a simple young woman "Gümüş," played by Songül Öden, who marries into a wealthy family.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000057.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Arab net plans film of Turkish soap | first=Ali | last=Jaafar | date=February 11, 2009[/tpl]
The success of "Noor" for MBC has sparked a boom in dubbed Turkish dramas across many leading Arab sat-casters. MBC even launched a pay TV channel in partnership with pay TV platform Showtime Arabia entirely dedicated to "Noor" that allows viewers to watch episodes of the sudser around the clock.
The dizzying pop-cultural phenomenon surrounding the series has encouraged the broadcaster further to make a film out of the Turkish soap. The feature version, which MBC will co-produce with Turkish shingle Momentum Prods., will have a budget in the $2.5 million-3.5 million range and will also be shot in Turkish before being dubbed into Arabic. The project will reunite Turkish thespians Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ and Songül Öden, who captured the hearts of Arab audiences in their husband-and-wife roles of Muhannad and Noor, respectively.
The series has also been shown in Iran  and the show dubbed into Persian with the title "Nur" ("Brightness").
The series has also been shown in Romania on Kanal D Romania with the title "Iubire de Argint" ("Love of Silver"). The Bulgarian private TV channel bTV currently airing the show dubbed into Bulgarian with the title "Перла" ("Pearl").
The series is also currently[tpl]When|date=December 2011[/tpl] shown in Greece under the title  "Ασημένια Φεγγάρια" ("Silver Moons"). The first sixty episodes were broadcast on Makedonia TV from September 2010 to January 2011. However, due to the series' great success it was then picked up by ANT1 and is currently shown there.

==Reception and influence==

Noor and Muhannad observe Ramadan, and their marriage is arranged by Muhannad's grandfather but the characters break with tradition in other ways.  Characters are shown drinking wine with dinner, partying, and kissing onscreen which has been deemed inappropriate for younger audiences such as children.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/middleeast/2008/09/a_veritable_soap_opera_onscree_1.html | work=CBC News | title=Mideast Dispatches[/tpl] Muhannad had sex (and an illegitimate child) before marrying Noor, and one of his cousins has an abortion.http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-801/i.html  Perhaps most significantly, Noor and Muhannad's marriage is depicted (in an idealized way) as a modern partnership between equals, in which Muhannad supports his wife's career ambitions as a fashion designer.http://www.mail.com/layoutengine.aspx?page=Article.aspx&articlepath=APNews\General-Entertainment\20080727\Mideast-Subversive-Soap.xml&cat=entertainment&subcat=&pageid=1 The AP reports that the show "seems particularly effective in changing attitudes because it offers new content in a familiar setting: Turkey is a Muslim country, inviting stronger viewer identification than Western TV imports."
