Team Dynamik is a former V8 Supercar team. The team began within the Konica V8 Lites Series (now Dunlop V8 Supercar Series) in 2001 and won the Championship in its first season with driver Simon Wills. Wills won 10 of the season's 18 races, including a clean sweep at the finale in Mallala. In 2003 the team moved into the V8 Supercar Championship Series and was based in Adelaide, the only major V8 Supercar team to be based in South Australia, with Kiwi drivers Simon Wills (son of team principal Kieran Wills) and Jason Richards, the pair nearly winning the prestigious Sandown 500.
Results were much more difficult to come by in 2004, with Dale Brede replacing Jason Richards. After being caught testing illegally in Woomera in mid-2004, the team was partially bought out by Tony Longhurst Racing in 2005. Neither team has since competed in V8 Supercars.
