In the north-east (on the eastern bank of the Meuse river) the area of the municipality extends up to the village of Moelingen in the Limburgian municipality of Voeren, while in the north-west (on the western bank of the Meuse river) it extends  up to the border between Belgium and the Netherlands (on the other side of which the Dutch municipality of Maastricht is situated).

Apart from the Meuse river another waterway, the Albert Canal, passes through this town.

==History==

The German armies entered Belgium on 4 August 1914, and entered Visé that day as part of the opening movements of the Battle of Liège.  A small group of Belgian gendarmes opposed the advancing Germans and two of their number, Auguste Bouko and Jean-Pierre Thill, were killed in the action becoming the first Belgian casualties of World War I.http://www.arquebusiers.be/1914-bouko-thil.htm
