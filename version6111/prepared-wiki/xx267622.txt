Ptilotus nobilis, commonly known as Yellow Tails, Regal Foxtail or Broad Foxtail is a perennial herb of the family Amaranthaceae.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl=sp&name=Ptilotus~nobilis|title=Ptilotus nobilis|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust, Sydney Australia|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]  It is found across dry interior areas of mainland Australia.[tpl]cite web|title=Ptilotus nobilis|work=Atlas of Living Australia|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Ptilotus%20nobilis|accessdate =26 September 2011[/tpl]
The species was first formally described by English botanist John Lindley in Thomas Mitchell's Three Expeditions into the interior of Eastern Australia in 1838. Lindley gave it the name Trichium nobile. The species was transferred to the genus Ptilotus in 1868 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the sixth volume of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=Ptilotus+nobilis|title=Ptilotus nobilis |accessdate=26 September 2011 |work= Australian Plant Name Index (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra[/tpl] A 2007 genetic study focusing on populations of P. nobilis and the pink-flowered Ptilotus exaltatus found a very close relationship between the two. The authors proposed formally combining the two species as a single species.[tpl]cite journal|author =Lee, Kok K. ; Harrison, Dion K.;  Johnston, Margaret E.; Williams, Richard R.  |title=Molecular taxonomic clarification of Ptilotus exaltatus and Ptilotus nobilis (Amaranthaceae)| journal=Australian Systematic Botany |volume=20|pages=72–81 |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/lcafs/documents/lee%20et%20al_ptilotus%20austsyst_bot.pdf|doi=10.1071/SB0601[/tpl]
Ptilotus nobilis grows to around [tpl]convert|1|m|in|0[/tpl] high, with an erect perennial habit. Its spoon-shaped leaves are up to 13 cm (5 in) long, and 5 cm (2 in) wide, arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers rise above the foliage and are cylindrical fuzzy green-yellow spikes up to 22 cm (9 in) high and 5 cm (2 in) wide.[tpl]cite book|last=Cunningham, Geoff M.; Mulham, William E.; Milthorpe, Peter L.; Leigh, John H.|title=Plants of Western New South Wales|publisher=NSW Government Printing Service|location=Sydney, New South Wales|year=1981|page=288|isbn=0-7240-2003-9|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=fiINKSiT0eUC&pg=PA288&dq=Ptilotus+nobilis&hl=en&ei=XHmATveiPMrnmAWsysX4Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Ptilotus%20nobilis&f=false[/tpl] Plants studied at Cunnamulla in South West Queensland had both purplish and greenish flowerheads; this was a zone of overlap between the P. nobilis and P. exaltatus populations.
Scattered across inland New South Wales, it grows on a range of soils, though prefers more sandy than clayey soils. Habitats include Acacia woodland, mallee, shrubland and grassland.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bean|first= A.R.|year=2008|title= A synopsis of Ptilotus (Amaranthaceae) in  eastern Australi|journal=Telopea|volume=12|issue=2|pages= 227–50|url=http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/95402/Tel122227Bea.pdf[/tpl]
