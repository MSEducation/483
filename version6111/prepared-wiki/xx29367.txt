August Wilhelm Zumpt (December 4, 1815 – April 22, 1877) was a German classical scholar, known chiefly in connection with Latin epigraphy. He was a nephew of Karl Gottlob Zumpt.
Born in Königsberg, Zumpt studied in Berlin, and in 1851 became professor in the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium.
His papers on epigraphy (collected in Commentationes epigraphicae, i vols., 1850–54) brought him into conflict with Theodor Mommsen in connexion with the preparation of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, a scheme for which, drawn up by Mommsen, was approved in 1847. Zumpt died in Berlin.
