"Stronger" is a song by American hip hop artist Kanye West, released as the second single from his third studio album Graduation. It was produced by West and contains an extended outro co-produced with Mike Dean. The song contains a vocal sample of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by French house duo Daft Punk, who thereby have songwriting credits along with Edwin Birdsong, whose song "Cola Bottle Baby" formed the basis of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger." The single was first released digitally on July 31, 2007 and soon became West's third number-one single. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards. As of March 2013, "Stronger" has sold over 5 million digital copies in the United States.

==Background==

A portion of "Stronger" was first released in May 2007 on West's Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.datpiff.com/Kanye-West-Cant-Tell-Me-Nothing---The-Official-Mix-mid4750.html |title=Kanye West: Cant Tell Me Nothing – The Official Mixtape |accessdate=2007-09-19 |work=DatPiff |publisher= |date=2007-05-29[/tpl] Shortly afterwards, on May 31, 2007, Brendon Joshua played the full-length song on his podcast. On June 27, 2007, "Stronger" was put onto the BBC Radio 1 Up-Front playlist and was later upgraded to the A-List a month prior to its release. The single's cover art was released on West's website on June 28, 2007. It was designed by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, whom West collaborated with to produce the artwork for Graduation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/23/entertainment/ca-murakami23 |title=Ready For Launch |accessdate=2007-09-23 |author=Boucher, Geoff |date=2007-09-23 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]
The cover artwork features a cartoon version of West's mascot "Dropout Bear" wearing sunglasses similar to the those West wears in the music video, as well as the small, trademark robot helmets of the Daft Punk duo Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.[tpl]cite AV media notes |others=Kanye West |title=Graduation |year=2007 |publisher=Roc-A-Fella Records |id=[/tpl] West performed a partial version of "Stronger" live at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium on July 1, 2007 to a crowd of 63,000 people.

The single was released to iTunes on July 31, 2007. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number forty-seven and eventually peaked at the number-one position, the same week his album Graduation took the number one spot.  It is West's third number-one single in the United States, following "Slow Jamz" and "Gold Digger." After becoming West's first number one single in the UK, "Stronger" went on to be met by widespread international success, reaching number-one in Canada, Turkey, and New Zealand. The song was also met by critical recognition and was the recipient of multiple awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. Daft Punk themselves made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008 to join West in performing a reworked version of the song on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. A press release specified that this was the very first televised live performance by Daft Punk in their career.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Daft Punk Make Surprise Grammy Appearance With Kanye West | url=http://www.nme.com/news/daft-punk/34231 | work=NME | publisher=IPC Media | date=2008-02-11 | accessdate=February 10, 2008[/tpl]

==Music and structure==

"Stronger" is an electronica-infused hip-hop song composed in the key of E-flat minor. It is written in common time and moves at 104 beats per minute. The production of the track revolves around a vocoder-affected vocal sample of the song "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by French house duo Daft Punk. Following the introduction, where the cut-up sample of Daft Punk's robotic vocals is played continuously in the background at a decreased tempo, West raps the song's refrain over a four-to-the-floor rhythmic pattern.[tpl]cite web |author=Park, Adam |title=Kanye West "God Just Brings Collaborations Together"|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/kanye-west|work=Clash |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl] The lyrics of the refrain paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche's famous dictum, "What does not kill him, makes him stronger," as well as the chorus twice and enter the first verse. West repeats this process three more times, making slight alterations to the chorus each time. He injects a "me likey" ad-lib after the hook in the second, repeats a line within the verse six times on the third, and recites the hook four times on the fourth. At its close, the track enters an extended outro containing a synth-heavy breakdown that comes complete with angelic backing vocals and somber electric guitars chiming in unison.[tpl]cite web | author=Greene, Jayson | title= Kanye West Graduation – Music Review| url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/kanye-west/graduation.htm| work=Stylus Magazine | publisher= stylusmagazine.com | date=2007-09-10| accessdate=2007-09-10[/tpl]  
Feeling dissatisfied after he heard "Stronger" inside a club alongside Timbaland's 2007 single "The Way I Are," which was his favourite beat at the moment, West enlisted the hip-hop record producer to assist him in redoing his song's drum programming for the final version of the track, which appears on the Graduation album.[tpl]cite web |author=Kathwadia, Rajveer|title=Online Review: Kanye West – Graduation|url=http://www.rwdmag.com/articles/6015/Online-Review-Kanye-West--iGraduationi-.html|work=RWD Magazine|publisher=RWD Magazine|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/313353/l:embed_313353 |title= Stronger Revisited |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=West, Kanye |date=2007-09-20 |work=Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo, LLC[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1567552/20070821/west_kanye.jhtml? |title= Kanye West Thanks 50 Cent for Much-Hyped Rivalry: 'We Push Each Other' |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Reid, Shaheem |date=2007-09-31 |work=VH1 |publisher=MTV Networks[/tpl] 
This version contains a master use of Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby," the song that had been previously sampled by Daft Punk themselves to produce "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". The pre-album version of "Stronger", known to the public and being used by radio, television and other outlets, was the version used as the single. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] On October 4, 2007, a previously unreleased version of "Stronger" was revealed. This version retains a singular, unused verse from West, while the structure features less synthesizer chords and percussion. It is believed that this version was an early draft of the final song.kanYe Live! - The #1 kanYe West Fan Site » Alternate Version of Stronger (Unreleased)
On July 3, 2007, West told Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 that although he believes "Stronger" is a great song, it does not compare to the sampled original. Daft Punk were delighted upon first hearing the new song on Power 106 while on a San Francisco flight. As Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of the duo stated, "Our song had a good sound, but when radio DJ put Kanye's record on, the sound was really fat. It sounds really big." The use of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" was requested through Pedro Winter, Daft Punk's manager at the time, and approved by the duo.[tpl]cite web | author=Pytlik, Mark | title=Interview: Daft Punk | url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6701-daft-punk/ | work=Pitchfork Media | publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc | date=2007-10-02 | accessdate=2007-10-03[/tpl] De Homem-Christo also clarified that "It's not a collaboration in the studio, but the vibe of the music we do separately connected in what West did with the song."[tpl]cite web | author= Cohen, Jonathan | title=Exclusive: Live Album To Chronicle Daft Punk Tour | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049888/exclusive-live-album-to-chronicle-daft-punk-tour | work=Billboard | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc | date=2007-08-14 | accessdate=August 27, 2007[/tpl] In a 2008 interview, de Homem-Christo specified that the live performance of "Stronger" at the 50th Grammy Awards was "truly a collaboration from the start.
