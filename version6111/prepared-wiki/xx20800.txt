[[Coefficient]]

CATEGORIES: Polynomials, Mathematical terminology, Algebra

In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series or any expression; it is usually a number, but in any case does not involve any variables of the expression. For instance in
the first two terms respectively have the coefficients 7 and âˆ’3. The third term 1.5 is a constant. The final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient, but is considered to have coefficient 1, since multiplying by that factor would not change the term. Often coefficients are numbers as in this example, although they could be parameters of the problem, as a, b, and c, where "c" is a constant, in
when it is understood that these are not considered as variables.
Thus a polynomial in one variable x can be written as
is 4.
Specific coefficients arise in mathematical identities, such as the binomial theorem which involves binomial coefficients; these particular coefficients are tabulated in Pascal's triangle.

==Linear algebra==

In linear algebra, the leading coefficient of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row. So, for example, given
The leading coefficient of the first row is 1; 2 is the leading coefficient of the second row; 4 is the leading coefficient of the third row, and the last row does not have a leading coefficient.

==Examples of physical coefficients==

A coefficient is a number placed in front of a term in a chemical equation to indicate how many molecules (or atoms)  take part in the reaction. For example, in the formula
