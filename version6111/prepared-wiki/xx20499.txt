A survey of 1.1 million residents in the United States found that those that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night increased the mortality rate by 15%. Severe insomnia – sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men – also led to a 15% increase in mortality. However, most of the increase in mortality from severe insomnia was discounted after controlling for co-morbid disorders. After controlling for sleep duration and insomnia, use of sleeping pills was also found to be associated with an increased mortality rate.
The lowest mortality was seen in individuals who slept between six and a half and seven and a half hours per night. Even sleeping only 4.5 hours per night is associated with very little increase in mortality. Thus, mild to moderate insomnia for most people is associated with increased longevity and severe insomnia is associated only with a very small effect on mortality.
As long as a patient refrains from using sleeping pills, there is little to no increase in mortality associated with insomnia, but there does appear to be an increase in longevity. This is reassuring for patients with insomnia in that, despite the sometimes-unpleasantness of insomnia, insomnia itself appears to be associated with increased longevity.  It is unclear why sleeping longer than 7.5 hours is associated with excess mortality.[tpl]Cite pmid|11825133[/tpl]
Insomnia is 40% more common in women than in men.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=110961 |title=Several Sleep Disorders Reflect Gender Differences |journal=Psychiatric News |year=2007 |volume =42 |issue=8| page= 40[/tpl]

===Prevalence===

The National Sleep Foundation's 2002 Sleep in America poll showed that 58% of adults in the U.S. experienced symptoms of insomnia a few nights a week or more.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.sleepfoundation.org/site/c.huIXKjM0IxF/b.2417355/k.143E/2002_Sleep_in_America_Poll.htm |title= 2002 Sleep in America Poll |accessdate= 2008-08-13 |publisher= National Sleep Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614221846/http://www.sleepfoundation.org/site/c.huIXKjM0IxF/b.2417355/k.143E/2002_Sleep_in_America_Poll.htm |archivedate = June 14, 2008[/tpl] Although insomnia was the most common sleep problem among about one half of older adults (48%), they were less likely to experience frequent symptoms of insomnia than their younger counterparts (45% vs. 62%), and their symptoms were more likely to be associated with medical conditions, according to the poll of adults between the ages of 55 and 84.
As explained by Thomas Roth,[tpl]Cite pmid|17824495[/tpl] estimates of the prevalence of insomnia depend on the criteria used as well as the population studied.  About 30% of adults report at least one of the symptoms of insomnia.  When daytime impairment is added as a criterion, the prevalence is about 10%.  Primary insomnia persisting for at least one month yields estimates of 6%.
