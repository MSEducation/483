==The name==

The first element is the name of the farm Nore (Norse Nórar), the last element is sund n 'sound, strait'. The name of the farm is the plural of nór n 'narrow strait' - so the meaning of the name Noresund is 'strait-strait'. The actual strait divides the lake Krøderen in two parts (Upper K. and Lower K.). The farm Nore has also given name to the mountain Norefjell.
