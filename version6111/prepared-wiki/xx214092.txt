==C114==

The Cherrypal C114 is a small, light nettop computer using a PowerPC-processor, the Freescale 5121e system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated main-board, and Xubuntu as its operating system. The device launches Firefox Minefield web-browser, AbiWord word-processor,[tpl]cite web |url=http://greentechgirl.com/green-computing/my-cherrypal-has-arrived/ |title=Green Tech Girl Blog: My Cherrypal Has Arrived |author=Green Tech Girl |date=Dec 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-07[/tpl] and other apps via icon double-click. An article in The Register noted that Cherrypal's producers asserted that the computer will consume only 2 watts of power.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/21/cherrypal_launches_cherrypal_with_cherrypalcloud_and_cherrypal_etc/ |title=Cherrypal launches $249 mini PC into ad-backed cloud |author=Austin Modine |date=July 21, 2008 |work=The Register |accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] Independent, informal testing has shown a wattage consumption of still low 6.9 watts while booting.http://www.morphzone.org/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6196&forum=11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmF20N9HPGo
The CherryPal C114 was a rebadged version of the LimePC D1 mini-desktop computer developed as part of a broader Freescale PowerPC chip-based product line by THTF's Shenzhen R&D center and shown to the public at the 2008 CES in Las Vegas in January 2008.http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/01/09/limepc-little-linux-big-possibilities/http://greentechgirl.com/green-computing/cherrypal-limepc-architecture/

==Bing==

The "Cherrypal Bing" is a slim x86-based netbook that ships with Windows XP.

==Africa==

Cherrypal's $99 netbook, the Africa, is aimed primarily at the developing world but also available for sale to consumers. According to a blog post by Max Seybold, the device's specs in Cherrypal's web store are kept intentionally vague, because the Africa is not built to a set design. Instead, Cherrypal either purchases pre-made netbook systems or buys odd lots of whatever inexpensive components are available and builds netbooks out of these. It then rebrands these netbooks as Africas.  The $99 computer was named Africa in honor of PAAJAF, a humanitarian services group based in Ghana, West-Africa.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cherrypal.com/GreenOpenFair/2009/12/14/99-laptop/ |title=Why does the world need a $99 laptop? |author=Max Seybold  |date=Dec 14, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl]
Seybold states that the resulting device will at a minimum meet the specs listed on the website, but could also exceed them. It could also end up having an ARM, MIPS, or x86-based CPU architecture depending on what chips are available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cherrypal.com/GreenOpenFair/2009/12/19/the-open-secret-behind-the-cherrypal-africa-or-a-brand-is-a-promise-or-understatement-by-design/ |title=The open secret behind the Cherrypal Africa, or, A brand is a promise, or Understatement by design |author=Max Seybold |date=December 19, 2009 |work=GreenOpenFair |accessdate=2009-12-21[/tpl]
In an interview, Seybold stated that the Africa is not meant to be sold as a "computer" in the traditional sense, but as an "appliance" to provide Internet access to people who could not afford to buy a traditional computer. He said that with the number of government services (such as unemployment or disability) that are encouraging access by Internet, lack of such access is becoming more and more of a disability. The only thing Cherrypal promises for $99 is the ability to access the Internet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.teleread.org/2009/12/24/cherrypals-max-seybold-talks-africa/ |title=Cherrypal’s Max Seybold talks ‘Africa’: $99 netbook no Kindle—but can run e-book software like FBReader |author=Chris Meadows |date=December 24, 2009 |work=TeleRead.org |accessdate=2009-12-26[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==America==

The "Cherrypal America" also known as Cherrypad is an Android tablet based upon Telechips TCC89xx ARM11 processors. Cherrypal initially sold the tablet with the promise of an upgrade to Android 2.2 by November and support for Android market. The market support has been officially removed because the tablet does not conform to the market requirements by Google. Also the Android 2.2 upgrade has been canceled, instead Cherrypal now promises an update to Android 2.3.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cherrypal.com/support/index.php?topic=426.0 |title=Upgrade to Gingerbread (2.3) |accessdate=2010-12-11[/tpl]

==History==

Cherrypal was founded by Max Seybold based in Palo Alto.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2357185,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Mark | last=Hachman | title=Cherrypal Launches $99 Computer | date=2009-12-15[/tpl] The C114 (and following C120) desktop computers were originally developed by Tsinghua Tongfang (THTF) in its Shenzhen R&D center by an engineering team led by American electronics industry veterans Jack Campbell and Ryan Quinn. An extended line of handheld, desktop, and TV-based PCs using the Freescale MPC5121e PowerPC microprocessor was shown at CES 2008 by THTF, with the desktop product picked up thereafter as an OEM purchase by CherryPal.http://greentechgirl.com/green-computing/cherrypal-limepc-architecture/http://www.aboutjack.com/limepc.shtml

==Cloud computing plans==

Cherrypal's marketers planned to use Firefox not only as its web-browser but also as its user interface to launch other applications such as OpenOffice.org.[tpl]cite web |url=http://java.sys-con.com/read/614371.htm |title=Cloud computing start-Up creates PowerPC-based cloud desktop |author=Maureen O'Gara |date=July 28, 2008 |work=JDJ |accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] They planned that the Cherrypal would make use of cloud computing in which applications and storage would be wholly or in part Internet-based. These plans have not yet been implemented. The company's president asserted the cloud (Green Maraschino) would be launched in February 2010, however it is not known to have occurred.
