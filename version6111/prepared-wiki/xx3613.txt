It occupies the western, smaller portion of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antillean archipelago, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Ayiti ("land of high mountains") was the indigenous Taíno  name for the island. In French, the country is called "La Perle des Antilles" (The Pearl of the Antilles), because of its natural beauty. The country's highest point is Pic la Selle, at [tpl]convert|2680|m|ft|0|[/tpl]. Both by area and population, Haiti is the third largest Caribbean nation (after Cuba and the Dominican Republic), with [tpl]convert|27750|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] and an estimated 10.4 million people, with just under a million of which live in the capital city, Port-au-Prince.

Haiti's regional, historical, and ethno-linguistic position is unique for several reasons. When it gained independence in 1804, it was the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, the only nation in the world established as a result of a successful slave revolt, and the second republic in the Americas. Its successful revolution by slaves and free people of color lasted nearly a decade; all the first leaders of government were former slaves.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1202772.stm |title=Country profile: Haiti |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 January 2010[/tpl] Haiti is the only predominantly Francophone independent nation in the Americas. It is one of only two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements, or collectivités, of France.
With 10.4 million people, Haiti is the most populous full member-state of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The country is also a member of the Latin Union. In 2012, Haiti announced its intention to seek associate membership status in the African Union.[tpl]cite news |agency=BET |url=http://www.bet.com/news/global/2012/02/07/haiti-to-join-african-union.html |author=Naeesa Aziz |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2012 |title=Haiti to Join African Union[/tpl] It is the poorest country in the Americas as measured by the Human Development Index. Political violence has occurred regularly throughout its history, leading to government instability. Most recently, in February 2004, a coup d'état originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.  A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Michel Martelly, the current president, was elected in the 2011 general election.

==History==

===Pre-European history===

At the time of European encounter, the island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266962/Hispaniola |title=Hispaniola Article |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cardiostart.org/blog/ |title=Dominican Republic 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl]was one of many Caribbean islands inhabited by the Taíno Indians, speakers of an Arawakan language called Taino, which has been preserved in the Haitian Creole language. The Taíno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Kiskeya. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the Yanamamo of the Amazon Basin. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the Caribs. They also originated in Central and South America. Haiti is a part of Latin America.
In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean Islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique, or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Hispaniola was divided among five or six long-established caciquedoms.[tpl]cite book|author=Roberto Cassá|title=Los Indios de Las Antillas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oJ-wJ49cNwAC&pg=PA126|accessdate=15 August 2012|year=1992|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-84-7100-375-1|pages=126–[/tpl]Samuel M.

Taíno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions. Modern-day Léogane, started as a French colonial town in the southwest, is located at the site of the former capital of the caciquedom of Xaragua.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090216092556/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archivedate=2009-02-16|title=1492 and Multiculturalism|author=Royal, Robert |journal=The Intercollegiate Review|date=Spring 1992|volume=27|issue=2|pages=3–10[/tpl]

===Colonial era===

Navigator Christopher Columbus landed at Môle Saint-Nicolas on 5 December 1492, and claimed the island for Spain. Nineteen days later, his ship the Santa María ran aground near the present site of Cap-Haïtien. Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of La Navidad.

As a gateway to the Caribbean, Hispaniola became a haven for pirates during the early colonial period. The western part of the island was settled by French buccaneers. Among them was Bertrand d'Ogeron, who succeeded in growing tobacco. He attracted many French colonial families from Martinique and Guadeloupe.
European nations were competing for control in the New World, in the Caribbean as well as in North America. France and Spain settled their hostilities on the island by the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, and divided Hispaniola between them.
France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue. To develop it into sugar cane plantations, they imported thousands of slaves from Africa. Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the eighteenth century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 French colonists lived in Saint-Domingue.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples |author=Paul R. Magocsi |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=649 |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&pg=PA649 |isbn=0-8020-2938-8[/tpl] In contrast, by 1763 the French population of Canada, a much larger territory, had numbered 65,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/ImmigrationHistoryofCanada.htm |title=Immigration History of Canada |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] The French were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported for decades to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugar cane. Particularly in the north, slaves retained many ties to African cultures, religion and language, as they were continually renewed by new imports. They outnumbered whites by about ten to one.
The French-enacted Code Noir ("Black Code"), prepared by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and ratified by Louis XIV, had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms.  Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years.[tpl]cite web |author= Paul Farmer| title=Who removed Aristide? |accessdate=19 February 2010 |date=15 April 2004 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080608222428/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archivedate=6 June 2008[/tpl] Many slaves died quickly from tropical diseases, smallpox, and typhoid fever.[tpl]Cite book |author = Kenneth F.

As in its Louisiana colony, French colonists provided some rights to free people of color, the mixed-race descendants of female slaves (and later mixed-race women) and white colonists. Over time, many were given freedom. They established a separate class. White French Creole  fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to France for education. Some were admitted to the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near Port-au-Prince, and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slaveholders. They petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights.

===Revolution===

Inspired by the French Revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of men, free people of color and slaves in Saint-Domingue and the French and West Indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights. Most important was the revolution of the slaves in Saint-Domingue, starting in the northern plains in 1791, where Africans greatly outnumbered the whites.
In 1792, the French government sent three commissioners with troops to reestablish control. To build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves, the French commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the National Convention, led by Robespierre and the Jacobins, endorsed abolition and extended it to all the French colonies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
United States political leaders reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable planters to put down the revolt. Later in the revolution, the US provided support to black Haitian forces, with the goal of reducing French influence in North America and the Caribbean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |title=1784–1800 – The United States and the Haitian Revolution |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
Toussaint Louverture, a former slave and leader in the slave revolt, drove out not only the Spanish (from Santo Domingo) but also the British invaders who threatened the colony. In the uncertain years of revolution, the United States played both sides off against each other, with its traders supplying both the French and the rebels.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/books/poles-in-haiti.html |title=Poles in Haiti |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=22 March 1987 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |first1=Raymond A |last1=Joseph |first2=A Weekly |last2=Newspaper[/tpl] The struggle within Haiti between the free people of color led by André Rigaud and the black Haitians led by Louverture devolved into the War of the Knives in 1799 and 1800.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/revolution/revolution3.htm |title=The Haitian Revolution of 1791–1803 |first=Bob |last=Corbett |publisher=Webster University[/tpl]Smucker, Glenn R.

Many surviving free people of color left the island as refugees.
After Louverture created a separatist constitution, Napoléon Bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of more than 20,000 men under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc to retake the island. The French achieved some victories, but within a few months, yellow fever killed most of the French soldiers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/yellow_fever_haiti.htm |title=The Haitian Debacle: Yellow Fever and the Fate of the French |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] More than 50,000 French troops died in an attempt to retake the colony, including 18 generals.[tpl]cite news|author=Adam Hochschild |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/05/30/CMGKG6F3UV1.DTL |title=Birth of a Nation / Has the bloody 200-year history of Haiti doomed it to more violence? |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=30 May 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] The French captured Louverture, transporting him to France for trial. He was imprisoned at Fort de Joux, where he died in 1803 of exposure and tuberculosis.
The slaves, along with free gens de couleur and allies, continued their fight for independence. Jean-Jacques Dessalines defeated French troops at the Battle of Vertières on November 18, 1803, leading the first ever successful slave army revolution. In late 1803, France withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North American empire. With the war going badly, he sold Louisiana to the United States.

Fearful of the influence of the slaves' revolution, President Thomas Jefferson refused to recognize the new republic, as did most European nations. The US did not officially recognize Haiti for decades until after the American Civil War. Its new government was not supported by other republics.
The revolution in Saint-Domingue had resulted in waves of a massive multiracial exodus: French Creole colonists fled with those slaves they still held, as did numerous free people of color, some of whom were also slaveholders and transported slaves with them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm;jsessionid=f8303469141230638453792?migration=5&topic=2&bhcp=1 |title=From Saint-Domingue to Louisiana, The African-American Migration Experience |publisher=Inmotionaame.org |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] In 1809, nearly 10,000 refugees from Saint-Domingue settled en masse in New Orleans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081229/jelly-schapiro/single |title=In Congo Square: Colonial New Orleans |publisher=Thenation.com |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] They doubled that city's population and helped preserve its French language and culture for several generations.

The country was divided between the Kingdom of Haiti in the north, directed by Henri I; and a republic in the south directed by Alexandre Pétion, an homme de couleur.

Struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops, Boyer passed the Code Rural, which denied peasant labourers the right to leave the land, enter the towns, or start farms or shops of their own. Following the Revolution, many peasants wanted to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76479/Jean-Pierre-Boyer?anchor=ref126082 |title=Jean-Pierre Boyer (President of Haiti) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/%7Ecorbetre/haiti/history/earlyhaiti/boyer.htm |title=1820 – 1843: The rule of Jean-Pierre Boyer |author=Bob Corbett |publisher=Webster University |date=July 1995 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]

In July 1825, King Charles X of France sent a fleet to reconquer the island. Under pressure, President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which France formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs (reduced to 90 million in 1838). After losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843. A long succession of coups followed his departure to exile. The enforced payment to France hollowed out Haiti financially for years, and the failure of western nations to recognize it kept its economy and society isolated. Expatriates bankrolled and armed opposing groups.[tpl]cite book|title=The uses of Haiti |author=Paul Farmer and Jonathan Kozol |page=74 |edition=3 |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-56751-344-1[/tpl] In 1892, the German government supported suppression of the reform movement of Anténor Firmin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

In January 1914, British, German and US forces entered Haiti, ostensibly to protect their citizens from civil unrest at the time. In an expression of the Theodore Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, the United States occupied the island in 1915. US Marines were stationed in the country until 1934.
Sisal was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports.Henl, pp. 454–455.

Terry F. Buss, Adam Gardner. Aristide spent years negotiating with the Convergence Démocratique on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive.
In 2004, a revolt began in northern Haiti.  The rebellion eventually reached the capital; and Aristide was forced into exile, whereupon the United Nations stationed peacekeepers in Haiti. Some including Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a "new coup d'état or modern kidnapping" by U.S. forces.  Mrs. Aristide stated that the kidnappers wore US Special Forces uniforms, but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove Aristide from Haiti.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/186/34344.html |title=Aristide Kidnapped by US Forces? |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/16/exclusive_aristide_and_his_bodyguard_describe |title=Exclusive: Aristide and His Bodyguard Describe the U.S. Role In His Ouster |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] Boniface Alexandre assumed interim authority.

The United States led a vast international campaign to prevent Aristide from returning to his country while he was exiled in South Africa.  Released Wikileaks cables show that high-level U.S. and U.N. officials coordinated a politically motivated prosecution of Aristide to prevent him from "gaining more traction with the Haitian population and returning to Haiti."

==Geography==

Haiti is on the western part of Hispaniola, the second largest island in the Greater Antilles. Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind Cuba and the Dominican Republic (the latter shares a [tpl]convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on[/tpl] border with Haiti). Haiti at its closest point is only about [tpl]convert|45|nmi|km mi|0[/tpl] away from Cuba and has the second longest coastline ([tpl]convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) in the Greater Antilles, Cuba having the longest. The country lies mostly between latitudes 18° and 20°N (Tortuga island lies just north of 20°), and longitudes 71° and 75°W. Haiti's terrain consists mainly of rugged mountains interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys.
The northern region consists of the Massif du Nord (Northern Massif) and the Plaine du Nord (Northern Plain). The Massif du Nord is an extension of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the Guayamouc River, and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the Plaine du Nord lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the Massif du Nord and the North Atlantic Ocean. The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The Plateau Central (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the Massif du Nord. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the Plateau Central are the Montagnes Noires, whose most northwestern part merges with the Massif du Nord. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.
The southern region consists of the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the Tiburon Peninsula). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as Trou Caïman and Haiti's largest lake, Lac Azuéi. The Chaîne de la Selle mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the Massif de la Hotte in the west. This mountain range harbors Pic la Selle, the highest point in Haiti at [tpl]convert|2680|m|ft|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elahmad.com/maps/qibla-english.htm?latitude=18.9712&longitude=-72.2845&t=h&zoom=9 |title=Map of Haiti |publisher=Elahmad.com |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The country's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires. This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the Riviere l'Artibonite, which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the Golfe de la Gonâve. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau. Haiti also includes various offshore islands. The historically famous island of Tortuga (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The arrondissement of La Gonâve is located on the island of the same name, in the Golfe de la Gonâve. Gonâve Island is moderately populated by rural villagers. Île à Vache (Cow Island), a lush island with many beautiful sights, is located off the tip of southwestern Haiti. Also part of Haiti are the Cayemites and Île d' Anacaona.  La Navasse located [tpl]convert|40|nmi|mi km[/tpl] west of Jérémie on the south west peninsula of Haiti,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/haiti/rock.htm |title=Whose Rock Is It?

===Geology===

There are blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system over which Haiti lies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010rja6/#summary |title="Magnitude 7.0 – HAITI REGION Tectonic Summary" United States Geological Survey, 12 January 2010 |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=2014-01-11[/tpl] After the Earthquake of 2010, there was no evidence of surface rupture and based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hayes|first=G.P.|coauthors=Briggs R.W., Sladen A., Fielding E.J., Prentice C., Hudnut K., Mann P., Taylor F.W., Crone A.J., Gold R., Ito T. & Simons M.|year=2010|title=Complex rupture during the 12 January 2010 Haiti earthquake|journal=Nature Geoscience|doi=10.1038/ngeo977|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo977.html|accessdate=21 October 2010|volume=3|issue=11|pages=800–805| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101023111012/http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo977.html| archivedate= 23 October 2010 | deadurl= no|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..800H [/tpl]
The northern boundary of the fault is where the Caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about [tpl]convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in[/tpl] per year in relation to the North American plate. The strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the Septentrional-Oriente fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault in the south.
A 2007 earthquake hazard study by C. DeMets and M. Wiggins-Grandison noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2 Mw earthquake, similar in size to the 1692 Jamaica earthquake.[tpl]cite journal|last=DeMets|first=C.|coauthors=Wiggins-Grandison W.|year=2007|title=Deformation of Jamaica and motion of the Gonâve microplate from GPS and seismic data|journal=Geophysical Journal International|volume=168|pages=362–378|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/earthquake/files/DeformJaGPS2007.pdf |accessdate=19 December 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03236.x|bibcode = 2007GeoJI.168..362D [/tpl] Paul Mann and a group including the 2006 study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain; the team recommended "high priority" historical geologic rupture studies, as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ig.utexas.edu/jsg/18_cgg/Mann3.htm|title=Entiquillo-Plantain Garden Strike-Slip Fault Zone: A Major Seismic Hazard Affecting Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica|publisher=18th Caribbean Geological Conference |author=Mann, Paul, Calais, Eric, Demets, Chuck, Prentice, Carol S, and Wiggins-Grandison, Margaret |date=March 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100116160020/http://www.ig.utexas.edu/jsg/18_cgg/Mann3.htm| archivedate= 16 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] An article published in Haiti's Le Matin newspaper in September 2008 cited comments by geologist Patrick Charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in Port-au-Prince.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lematinhaiti.com/Article.asp?ID=14646|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqlCDrAo|archivedate=17 January 2010|title=Haiti/ Menace de Catastrope Naturelle / Risque sismique élevé sur Port-au-Prince|last=Delacroix |first=Phoenix |date=25 September 2008| accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl]

===Environment===

In addition to soil erosion, deforestation has caused periodic and severe flooding in Haiti, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004. Earlier that year, in May, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/2004-09-23-haiti-deforest_x.htm |title=Deforestation Exacerbates Haiti Floods |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
There has been little marine, coastal, and river basin management. Forest cover in the steep hills surrounding Haiti's river basin retains soil, which in turn retains water from rainfall, reducing river flood peaks and conserving flows in the dry season. But deforestation has resulted in much of the soil being released from the upper catchments. Many of Haiti's rivers are now highly unstable, changing rapidly from destructive flooding to inadequate flows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.haitiregeneration.org/node/67|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110303050815/http://www.haitiregeneration.org/node/67|archivedate=2011-03-03 |title=Environment and Natural Hazards | The Haiti Regeneration Initiative |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2014-01-11[/tpl] Scientists at the Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)  and the United Nations Environment Programme are working on the Haiti Regenerative Initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in Haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management.

===Flora===

In 1925, Haiti was lush, with 60% of its original forest covering the lands and mountainous regions. Since then, Haiti's residents have cut down an estimated 98% of its original forest cover for use as fuel for cookstoves, destroying fertile farmland soils and contributing to desertification.[tpl]cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/53.htm |title=Forestry in Haiti |accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl]

==Demographics==

Although Haiti averages approximately 350 people per square kilometer (~900 per sq mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. Haiti's population was about 9.8 million according to UN 2008 estimates,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/country_profiles/1202772.stm |title=Country profile: Haiti |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |work=BBC News[/tpl] with half of the population being under 20 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/global/pid/227 |title=New Haiti Census Shows Drastic Lack of Jobs, Education, Maternal Health Services |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] The first formal census, taken in 1950, showed that the population was 3.1 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/21.htm |title=Haiti – Population |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
Modern Haitians today are people who are descendants of former African slaves, Mulatto/Creole/Free people of color and the remaining white populations who survived the revolt. Smaller minority groups include people of Western European (French, German, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish), Arab, Armenian, or Jewish origin.[tpl]cite web |author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php |title=Aimaq, Firozkohi of Afghanistan Ethnic People Profile |publisher=Joshua Project |accessdate=14 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Haiti |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=14 January 2010[/tpl] Haitians of East Asian descent or East Indian origin number approximately 400+.

===Casta discrimination===

Due to the racial caste system instituted in colonial Haiti, Haitian mulattoes have become the nation's social elite and racially privileged. Despite making up only nearly 5% of the nation's population, the mulattoes have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in present day Haiti and in the fact that numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes.Smucker, Glenn R. "The Upper Class". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). Alexandre Pétion, born to a Haitian mother and a wealthy French father, was the first President of the Republic of Haiti.

===Religion===

Around 80% of Haitians profess to be Catholics. Protestants make up about 16% of the population. Some Haitians combine their Catholicism with elements of vodou.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=div2facpubs |title=The Madonna of 115th St. Revisited: Vodou and Haitian Catholicism in the Age of Transnationalism |author=McAlister, Elizabeth |work=In S.

===Languages===

One of Haiti's two official languages is French, which is the principal written and administratively authorized language. It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses. The second is the recently standardized Haitian Creole,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html |title=Creole: The National Language of Haiti |author=Albert Valdman |work=Footsteps, 2(4), 36–39 |publisher=Indiana University Creole Institute |accessdate=19 July 2011[/tpl] which is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti. Haitian Creole is one of the French-based creole languages. Its vocabulary is primarily derived from French, but its grammar and pronunciation display influences from some West African, Taino, Spanish, and Portuguese languages.Bonenfant, Jacques L. "History of Haitian-Creole: From Pidgin to Lingua Franca and English Influence on the Language". http://www.fmuniv.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/History_of_haitian_review_of_higher_education.pdf (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). Haitian Creole is related to the other French creoles, but most closely to Louisiana Creole, Mauritian Creole.

===Emigration===

Haitian immigrants have constituted a very visible segment of American and Canadian society, dating back to before the independence of Haiti from France in 1804. Haiti's proximity to the United States, and its status as a free black republic in the years before the American Civil War, have contributed to this relationship. Many influential early American settlers and black freemen, including Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and W. E. B. Du Bois, were of Haitian origin.
Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, an immigrant from Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), founded the first nonindigenous settlement in what is now Chicago, Illinois, the third largest city in the United States. The State of Illinois and City of Chicago declared du Sable the Founder of Chicago on October 26, 1968.

==Government and politics==

The government of Haiti is a semi-presidential republic, a multiparty system wherein the President of Haiti is head of state elected directly by popular elections.[tpl]cite web|title=1987 Constitution of the Republic of Haiti|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/haiti/haiti1987.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=9 July 2011|location=ARTICLE 134|pages=ARTICLE 134[/tpl]  The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government.

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Assembly of Haiti. The government is organized unitarily, thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the Constitution of Haiti on 29 March 1987. The current president is Michel Martelly.
Haitian politics have been contentious: in its 200-year history, Haiti has suffered 32 coups.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1741707&ps=rs |title=Haiti Starts Over, Once Again |author=Michele Kelemen |publisher=Npr.org |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]  Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution, but a long history of oppression by dictators[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]including François Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt – so much that foreign debt payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. They also enforced trade policies that have broken down the Haitian government’s ability to protect the local economy, forcing greater dependence on imports and eroding economic self-sufficiency.[tpl]cite book |last=Bell |first=Beverly |date=2013 |title=Fault Lines: Views across Haiti's Divide |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press|page=30-38 |isbn=978-0-8014-7769-0[/tpl]

Jean-Bertrand Aristide was initially denied access to Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities, despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers. The world's most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals, nor did they support them; an unnamed analyst "close to the Haitian government" quoted in several media sources[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]including the New York Times[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]is reported to have said: "Aristide could have 15 passports and he's still not going to come back to Haiti ...

===Departments, Arrondissements, and Communes===

Administratively, Haiti is divided into ten departments. The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.
The departments are further divided into 41 arrondissements and 133 communes. These serve as, respectively, second- and third-level administrative divisions.

Three-quarters of the population lives on $2 or less per day.

===Currency===

The Haitian gourde (HTG) is the national currency. Creole speakers will call U.S. dollars, Dola Ameriken or Dola US (pronounced oos), and gourdes, goud (rhymes fairly closely with the English “mood”). The vast majority of businesses and individuals in Haiti will accept U.S. dollars, though gourdes may be preferred in places such as outdoor markets.
The Haitian dollar equals 5 gourdes, and exists as a concept only. This exchange rate is fixed, with certain informal prices specified in Haitian dollars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haitihub.com/download/Money-Matters-in-Haiti.pdf |title=All About Money: Gourdes, Dollars and Sense for Work and Life in Haiti|publisher=haitihub.com |accessdate=16 February 2014[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve.
According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday January 2010 that they assessed the damage from the 12 Jan. quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |publisher=Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
The port at Port-au-Prince, Port international de Port-au-Prince,  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of Saint-Marc is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and congested Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.
During the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port suffered widespread damage, impeding aid to the victims. The main pier caved in and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.
Toussaint Louverture International Airport is located [tpl]convert|10|km[/tpl] North/North East of Port-au-Prince. It has Haiti's main jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. To travel on from the international airport at Port-au-Prince to other Haitian cities requires boarding a smaller plane. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, Cap-Haïtien, and Port-de-Paix have airports that are accessible only by smaller aircraft. Companies that fly to these airports include: Caribintair, Sunrise Airways and Tortug' Air.
In the past, Haiti used rail transport, but, today, railroads are no longer in use, due to their replacement by other forms of transportation.

===Bus service===

Tap tap buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis in Haiti. The "tap tap" name comes from sound of taps on the metal bus body signifying a passenger's request to be dropped off.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jansochor.com/photo-blog.aspx?id=tap-tap-haiti |title=Tap-Tap |accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated. They follow fixed routes, will not leave until filled with passengers, and riders are usually able to disembark at any point in the journey. It is a typically Haitian form of art.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |title=UN Volunteer takes part in art exhibition in Germany |accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl]

===Electricity===

In Haiti, only 12.5% of the population have access to electricity “officially”, although the Ministry of Public Works estimate that the coverage could be around 25% when irregular connections are considered. In the capital, Port-au-Prince, the access rate is about 45%.
Some towns in Haiti, such as the capital of the Nord-Est Department Fort-Liberté, have an electricity distribution network, but have been effectively abandoned by the national utility EdH for about a decade. Users thus have to rely entirely on small, privately owned generators to meet their electricity demand.

===Communications===

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

==Culture==

Haitian culture is a mixture of primarily French, African elements, and native Taíno, with influence from the colonial Spanish. The country's customs essentially are a blend of cultural beliefs that derived from the various ethnic groups that inhabited the island of Hispaniola. In nearly all aspects of modern Haitian society however, the African and European elements dominate.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The music of Haiti combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola and minor native Taino influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions, Rara parading music, Twoubadou troubadour ballads, Mini-jazz rock bands, Rasin movement, Hip hop Kreyòl, the wildly popular Compas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20071113022326/http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archivedate=2007-11-13 |title=Music and the Story of Haiti |publisher=Afropop Worldwide |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] and Méringue.
Compas (konpa) (also known as compas direct in French, or konpa dirèk in creole)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heritagekonpa.com/The%20Haitian%20Music%20Billboard.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100210081147/http://www.heritagekonpa.com/The%20Haitian%20Music%20Billboard.htm |archivedate=10 February 2010 |title=Haitian music billboard |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] is a complex, ever-changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing, mixed with Haiti's bourgeois culture. It is a refined music, with méringue as its basic rhythm. Haiti had no recorded music until 1937 when Jazz Guignard was recorded non-commercially. One of the most popular Haitian artists is Wyclef Jean. Wyclef Jean, however, left the country before his teenage years. His music is somewhat hip-hop mixed with world music.
Haiti is world famous for its distinctive art, notably painting and sculpture.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Brilliant colors, naive perspective and sly humor characterize Haitian art. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. Artists frequently paint in fables. People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people. As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party. Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by vodou symbolism.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

Haitian cuisine originates from several culinary styles from the various historical ethnic groups that populated the western portion of the island of Hispaniola. Haitian cuisine is similar to the rest of the Latin-Caribbean (the French and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Antilles), however it differs in several ways from its regional counterparts. While the cuisine is unpretentious and simple, the flavors are bold and spicy that demonstrate a primary influence of African culinary aesthetic, paired with a very French sophistication[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:S0PJo6i8lrkJ:www.haitianpatties.com/about-us-1/+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title=What is a Haitian Patty? |accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl] with notable derivatives coming from native Taíno and Spanish techniques. Though similar to other cooking styles in the region, it carries a uniqueness native only to the country and an appeal to many visitors to the island. Haitians often use peppers and other strong flavorings.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B6XkMTtunh0C&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=Rhum+Barbancourt+haiti%27s+most+famous+export+finest+rums&source=bl&ots=yR2rphyRfI&sig=CIYTfzexc7FhY3pRZsJN6nLhssc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uRQYU-zrBuPz2QWAmAE&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Rhum%20Barbancourt%20haiti's%20most%20famous%20export%20finest%20rums&f=false |title=Women and Children's Tribulation In Haiti |accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl]
Dishes tend to be seasoned liberally and consequently Haitian cuisine is often moderately spicy. In the country, however, several foreign cuisines have been introduced. These include Levantine from Arab migration to Haiti. Rice and beans in several differing ways are eaten throughout the country regardless of location, becoming a sort of national dish. They form the staple diet, which consists of a lot of starch and is high in carbohydrates. Rural areas, with better access to agricultural products, have a larger variety of choices.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
One such dish is mais moulu (mayi moulin), which is comparable to cornmeal that can be eaten with sauce aux pois (sòs pwa), a bean sauce made from one of many types of beans such as kidney, pinto, chickpeas, or pigeon peas (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often red snapper), or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, oregano, cabbage, avocado, bell peppers. A popular food is banane pesée (ban-nan'n peze), flattened plantain slices fried in cooking oil (known as tostones in the Spanish speaking Latin American countries). It is eaten both as a snack and as part of a meal is, often eaten with tassot or griot, which are deep-fried goat and pork respectively.

==Education==

The educational system of Haiti is based on the French system. Higher education, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, is provided by universities and other public and private institutions.[tpl]cite news |title=Education in Haiti; Primary Education |url=http://www.buildingwithbooks.org/intra/Intl_Programs/profile_Haiti.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080323105543/http://www.buildingwithbooks.org/intra/Intl_Programs/profile_Haiti.html |archivedate=23 March 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2007[/tpl] Haiti counts 15,200 primary schools, of which 90% are non-public and managed by communities, religious organizations or NGOs.[tpl]cite news |title=Education: Overview |url=http://www.usaid.gov/ht/education.htm |work=United States Agency for International Development |accessdate=15 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017050613/http://www.usaid.gov/ht/education.htm |archivedate=17 October 2007[/tpl] The enrollment rate for primary school is 67%, and fewer than 30% reach 6th grade. Secondary schools enroll 20% of eligible-age children. Charity organizations, including Food for the Poor and Haitian Health Foundation, are building schools for children and providing necessary school supplies. Haiti's literacy rate is 52.9%.
The January 2010 earthquake was a major setback for education reform in Haiti as it diverted limited resources to survival. Literacy levels remain near 50%. Haiti is one of the lowest-ranked countries in the world, 177th out of 186, for national spending on education.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haitiedstories.org/background/ |title=Haiti's Lost Children |publisher=Haitiedstories.org |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
Many reformers have advocated the creation of a free, public and universal education system for all primary school-age students in Haiti. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that the government will need at least $3 billion USD to create an adequately funded system.[tpl]cite web |author=Paul Franz, for the Pulitzer Center, Port-au-Prince, Haiti |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/improving-access-education-haiti |title=Improving Access to Education in Haiti |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]

Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases. Food or water-borne diseases include bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A and E; common vector-borne diseases are dengue fever and malaria; water-contact diseases include leptospirosis. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.[tpl]cite web |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 |title=The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science |author=Robert Lee Hadden and Steven G.
