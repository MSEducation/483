The State of Israel is the subject of many arguments about legitimacy, specifically, whether Israel's political authority over the area it claims should be accepted as legitimate political authority. A number of member states of the United Nations do not recognize Israel as a legitimate government, and many pressure groups argue against its legitimacy, however Israel is a member of the United Nations un.org/en/members/ 3 July 2006 and has been a member since 11 May 1949.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/1ce874ab1832a53e852570bb006dfaf6/0b3ab8d2a7c0273d8525694b00726d1b |publisher=The United Nations |title=Two Hundred and Seventh Plenary Meeting |date=11 May 1949 |accessdate=13 July 2007[/tpl]

==Diplomatic normalization and legitimacy==

[tpl]as of|2013[/tpl], a total of 32 United Nations member states do not recognise the State of Israel: 18 of the 22 members of the Arab League: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen; a further 11 members of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Chad, Guinea, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mali, Niger, and Pakistan; and Bhutan, Cuba, and North Korea.[tpl]Cite web|author=United States Congress|title=H.

===Palestinian Authority and Hamas===

Following the Oslo I Accord, the Palestinian Authority and Israel conditionally recognized each other's right to govern specific areas of the country. This boosted Israel's legal authority and legitimacy on the international stage.Burhan Dajani. "The September 1993 Israeli-PLO Documents: A Textual Analysis". Journal of Palestine Studies Vol. 23, No. 3 (Spring, 1994), pp. 5–23 Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, said while speaking at the UN regarding Palestinian recognition, "We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago, and that is Israel."[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/29/world/meast/palestinian-united-nations |author=David Ariosto and Michael Pearson |title=U.N. approves Palestinian 'observer state' bid |publisher=CNN |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl]
Hamas, in contrast, does not recognize Israel as a legitimate government. Furthermore, Hamas denies the legitimacy of the Oslo I Accord.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Rhetoric of delegitimization==

Especially in recent years, following the Palestinian legislative election of 2006 and Hamas' governance of the Gaza Strip, the term "delegitimisation" has been frequently applied to rhetoric surrounding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

===Legitimacy rhetoric as antisemitism===

Delegitimization is seen by some observers to be a double standard which separates Israel from other legitimate nations which have imperfect government. Natan Sharansky, head of the Jewish Agency, discussed a "3-D" test for determining new antisemitism. The third of the three D's is delegitimization. He explains "when Israel's fundamental right to exist is denied – alone among all peoples in the world – this too is anti-Semitism."[tpl]cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm |author=Natan Sharansky|title=3D Test of Anti-Semitism: Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization |publisher=Jewish Political Studies Review  |date= Fall 2004|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]
Dore Gold, President of the Israeli Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, believes there is a "campaign to delegitimize Israel" based on three themes, a "denial of Israel's right to security", "portrayal of Israel as a criminal state", and "denial of Jewish history".The Challenge to Israel’s Legitimacy Elhanan Yakira, professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, also considers portrayal of Israel as "criminal" and denial of Jewish history, specifically the Holocaust, to be key to a delegitimizing narrative.Elhanan Yakira. Post-Zionism, Post-Holocaust: Three Essays on Denial, Forgetting, and the Delegitimation of Israel. Cambridge University Press, 2009. ISBN 0521127866. pp. 36–46 Alan Dershowitz believes that other standard lines of argument include claims of Israel's "colonial" nature, a belief that statehood was not granted "legally", the apartheid analogy, and the necessity of a one-state solution.Alan Dershowitz. "Countering Challenges to Israel's Legitimacy". Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2011. According to Irwin Cotler, the lopsided number of anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN is an example of delegitimization.[tpl]cite news|last=Harkov |first=Lahav |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262664 |title='Delegitimization of Israel masked as good vs. evil' |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl]

===Legitimacy rhetoric as distraction===

M.J. Rosenberg, writing in the Los Angeles Times, argued that the term "delegitimization" is a "distraction", whose purpose is to divert attention away from world opposition to the "illegitimate" occupation of the West Bank and blockade of the Gaza Strip, from the "illegal" settlements, and from "the ever-louder calls for Israel to grant Palestinians equal rights". He concludes that "It's not the Palestinians who are delegitimizing Israel, but the Israeli government, which maintains the occupation. And the leading delegitimizer is Netanyahu, whose contemptuous rejection of peace is turning Israel into an international pariah."[tpl]cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=M.J.|title=Israel: 'Delegitimization' is just a distraction|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/17/opinion/la-oe-rosenberg-israel-20110717|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=17 July 2011[/tpl]

==Dangers of delegitimization to peace==

According to Gerald Steinberg writing for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, attacks on Israel's legitimacy are a barrier to the peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief2-6.htm |title=Starting Over After Oslo |author=Gerald M.

US President Barack Obama said in a May 2011 speech "for the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure. Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September won't create an independent state."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globaltoronto.com/world/Full+text+Obama+speech+Middle+East+North+Africa/4815768/story.html |author= |title=Obama Speech, Full Text |publisher=Globaltoronto.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] In 2012, the president said, "whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of Israel, my administration has opposed them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/03/04/president-obama-2012-aipac-policy-conference#transcript |author= |title=President Obama 2012 AIPAC policy conference transcript |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=4 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] Irwin Cotler, former Canadian Attorney General, said that delegitimization is "masked under the current discourse". It is hidden in the anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN, universal jurisdiction is "often abused" regarding Israel, it is "laundered under the cover of human rights", and is hidden behind the use of accusations of racism and apartheid.
Delegitimization is seen as a threat to Israel's security. Demands for Israel to not enter into Gaza and defeat Hamas during Operation Pillar of Defense are characterized by David Schwartz as a "delegitimization of Israel's right to defend itself."[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-11-20/news/fl-jjbs-protest-1122-20121120_1_israel-rabbi-simcha-freedman-pro-palestinian-supporters |author=David A.

==Legitimacy and Israeli uniqueness==

Professor Emanuel Adler of the University of Toronto considers Israel as willing to accept a situation where its legitimacy may be challenged, because it sees itself as occupying a unique place in the world order.Emanuel Adler. Israel in the World: Legitimacy and Exceptionalism. Routledge, 2012. ISBN 0415624150 p. 1 Stacie E. Goddard of Wellesley College argues that the legitimacy of Israeli historical narratives is used as a tool to secure territory.Stacie E. Goddard. Indivisible Territory and the Politics of Legitimacy. Cambridge University Press, 2009. pp. 18–20
