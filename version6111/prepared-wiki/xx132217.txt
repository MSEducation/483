==Plot==

Courtney, the younger sister of the "new girl across the street" in the first film is all grown up now. But suffers from nightmares from the events from the first film. She and the other members of her female rock group go to a condo for the weekend to play music and have fun with their boyfriends. Courtney's dreams are of her sister, who is in a mental institution, warning her about the killer, and the dreams begin to spill into real life, threatening Courtney and her friends. 
The film ends with Courtney (being the only survivor) being confronted by the killer, but manages to kill him by ablazing him with a torch lighter. The next day, paramedics are seen carrying Amy on a stretcher. When Courtney checks on her, Amy's eyes suddenly open and she starts evilly laughing in the killer's voice. Courtney wakes up in her room, only realizing it was a nightmare the whole time. She then makes out with her boyfriend, but it reveals to be the killer. Courtney wakes up from her nightmare, screaming profusely as a drill bursts through the floor, indicating that the nightmare isn't over yet.
