[[Service chain optimization]]

CATEGORIES: Business software

Service Chain Optimization is the application of processes and tools that embrace all functions for improving the efficiency, productivity and, eventually, the profitability of service organizations.
In this regard, profitability of a service organization is measured by the revenue generated from service demand (in the form of service work orders being carried out), and by the costs due to activity of the enterprise's human resources (who provide the service). Service chains consider the full life-cycle of service demand from early stages of forecasting, through planning, scheduling, dispatch, execution and post-analysis.
Service Chain Optimization is closely related to the fields of Workforce Management and Field Service Management; the activity performed by field service resources is managed through the later while being planned and optimized through the former. This relationship is analogous to the relation between supply chain optimization and Supply Chain Management in the domain of manufacturing. In this regard, the service chain benefits from demand forecasting, resource planning and scheduling, and long term analysis activities similarly to the manner these contribute in the supply chain (being typically managed by ERP systems and optimized by supply chain optimization systems).

==Origin of Service Chain Optimization==

The term “Service Chain Optimization” was coined by ClickSoftware in 1996.  ClickSoftware received a patent, US 6.985.872 B2, for continuous planning and scheduling (service chain optimization).  The term refers to field service management optimization, workforce productivity, improving customer service, and reducing operating costs.

==The Modules of Service Chain Optimization==

Prevalently, a Service Chain Optimization system is made up of the following units:
The cycle is completed by feeding the result of analysis back into the forecasting module.
