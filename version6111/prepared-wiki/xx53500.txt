The Bielefeld Conspiracy is a running gag among German and American Internet users, especially in the German Usenet. It is generally considered a satirical story rather than a hoax or an urban legend.

==Synopsis==

The story goes that the city of Bielefeld (population of 323,076 as of 2011[tpl]cite web|title=Amtliche Bevölkerungszahlen|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/amtlichebevoelkerungszahlen/index.html|publisher=Landesbetrieb Information und Technik NRW|accessdate=27 February 2012|language=German|date=2011-06-30|year=2011[/tpl]) in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia does not actually exist. Rather, its existence is merely propagated by an entity known only as SIE (in this context THEY or THEM, not SHE or the polite form of YOU), which has conspired with authorities to create the illusion of the city’s existence. 
The theory posits three questions: 
A majority are expected to answer 'no' to all three queries. Anybody claiming knowledge is said to be part of the conspiracy or being deceived themselves.
The origins of and reasons for this conspiracy are undocumented. Speculated originators jokingly include the CIA, Mossad or aliens who use the Bielefeld University as a disguise for their spaceship.Die Bielefeld-Verschwörung – German page detailing the conspiracy, as originally setup by Achim Held in 1994.

==History==

The conspiracy theory was first made public in a posting to the newsgroup de.talk.bizarre on May 16, 1994, by Achim Held, a student of computer science at the University of Kiel.The first newsgroup posting (Archived version at Google Groups) [tpl]de icon[/tpl] From there, it spread throughout the German-speaking Internet community and has lost little of its popularity, even after [tpl]#expr:[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]-1994[/tpl] years.
In a television interview conducted for the 10th anniversary of the newsgroup posting, Held stated that this myth definitely originated from his Usenet posting which was intended only as a joke. According to Held, the idea for the conspiracy theory formed in his mind at a student party while speaking to an avid reader of New Age magazines.Transcript of the TV interview with Achim Held in 2004 [tpl]de icon[/tpl] 
There are a number of conflicting theories about the reasons behind the joke's gain in popularity, the most popular being a flame war between Usenet admins and the Bielefeld based Z-Netz BBS about text encodings.

==Psychological background==

Some reasons for the popularity and wide spread of this myth may be the following:

==Public reception==

The Bielefeld Conspiracy is still one of the most popular internet gags that originated from Germany.
In November 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel referred to the Bielefeld Conspiracy in public when talking about a town hall meeting she had had in Bielefeld, adding: "…if it exists at all."Article: "Auch Merkel zweifelt an Existenz Bielefelds (German), Die Welt, November 27, 2012 (retrieved May 07, 2013).

===Official response===

The city council of Bielefeld tries hard to generate publicity for Bielefeld and build a nationwide known public image of the city. Even after 17 years, however, the mayor's office receives phone calls and e-mails each day which doubt the existence of the city.
In 1999, five years after the myth started to spread, the city council released a press statement titled Bielefeld gibt es doch! (There really is a Bielefeld!). However, the statement's publication date – April 1, 1999 (April Fools' Day) – was ill-chosen as it unwittingly played right into the humorous conspiracy.

==Movie==

In 2009, film students of the Bielefeld University started a project to develop a feature film based on the Bielefeld Conspiracy. The project was financed by the university and local sponsors. Most of the project staff and actors were students or university employees, in addition a few professionals joined the project like the actress Julia Kahl and the camera man Alexander Böke. The screenplay was written by Thomas Walden. The movie finally premiered in Bielefeld on June 2, 2010.Bielefake-Satire – Wir sehen uns nur in dieser Welt ... at Spiegel Online (2010-6-4) (German)[tpl]imdb title|id=1381403|title=Die Bielefeld Verschwörung[/tpl]
