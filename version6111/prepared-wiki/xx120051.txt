The Synthetic Fuels Corporation was a U.S. government-funded corporation established in 1980 by the Synthetic Fuels Corporation Act to create a financial bridge for the development and construction of commercial synthetic fuel manufacturing plants (such as coal gasification) that would produce alternatives to imported fossil fuels. The Great Plains coal gasification plant in Beulah, ND, still producing natural gas and sequestering carbon in 2009,dakotagas.com, DOE receives $57 million payment from clean coal plant was built with the support of the Department of Energy and applied for further support by this corporation, partly as a result of efforts by Reagan's Energy Secretary James B.

The original intention of the corporation[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] was to partner with industry (primarily oil and gas companies) to create a market for domestically-produced synthetic liquid fuels, with a goal of producing [tpl]convert|2|Moilbbl|m3[/tpl] of liquid fuel per day within five years.

The purported objective behind the Synthetic Fuels Corporation [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] was to move research and development of synthetic fuels out of the Department of Energy and into a public-private partnership that would produce tangible results in a short period of time.  Many believe[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=August 2009[/tpl] that the drop in worldwide oil prices in the early 1980s played a primary role in obviating the need for the corporation, at least from a short-term economic perspective.
