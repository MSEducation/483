[[Charity (virtue)]]

CATEGORIES: Christian ethics, Positive psychology, Christian terms, Love, Virtue

In Christian theology charity, Latin caritas, is by Thomas Aquinas understood as "the friendship of man for God", which "unites us to God". He holds it as "the most excellent of the virtues".http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3023.htm Further, Aquinas holds that "the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor".http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3025.htm
Some[tpl]who|date=September 2012[/tpl] delineate charity to mean only benevolent giving, while others, such as Roman Catholics, have multiple interrelated meanings (i.e. charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God: New Catholic Catechism 1822).

==Caritas: altruistic love==

In Christian theology charity is the greatest of the three theological virtues. Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity to "love", which he holds as a passion, not a virtue;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm rather, translators use the word "friendship", as stated above. This is in contrast with the following: 
Charity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit, because it is said to both glorify and reflect the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word "love".  The love that is caritas is distinguished by its origin, being divinely infused into the soul, and by its residing in the will rather than emotions, regardless of what emotions it stirs up.  According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man's last goal. 
Charity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one's neighbor and one's self.
Paul describes it in the First Letter to the Corinthians, chapter 13 (KJV):

Note that the King James Version uses both the words charity and love to translate the idea of caritas / ἀγάπη: sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept.  Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead throughout they use the same more direct English word love, so that the unity of the teaching should not be in doubt.  Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the New Testament it almost always refers to the virtue of caritas.
Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to "love of God".[tpl]clarify|date=April 2012|reason=the love that God has, or love for God?[/tpl] One example is "charity shall cover the multitude of sins" ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Peter|4:8|KJV[/tpl]), which forms the basis of perfect contrition.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
