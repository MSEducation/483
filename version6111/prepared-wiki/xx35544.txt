Gloucester National Park is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), 281 km south of Perth and about 3 km from Pemberton, Western Australia.
This park contains the Gloucester Tree, a renowned karri tree. Visitors can climb up to a viewing platform [tpl]convert|61|m|ft|0[/tpl] above the ground, using the climbing pegs inserted into the tree. The tree and the park are named after the then Governor General the Duke of Gloucester who visited the area in 1946.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pleasetakemeto.com/australia/gloucester-national-park/information|title=Please take me to - Gloucester National Park|year=2009|accessdate=5 June 2010[/tpl]
The tree served as a fire lookout and had the platform, cabin and climbing pegs installed in 1947, it was one of eight lookout trees constructed in the area between 1937 and 1952.[tpl]cite web|url=http://visitwa.com.au/australias-south-west-region/61-gloucester-national-park-wa.html|title=Visit WA- Gloucester Tree and National Park|year=2008|accessdate=5 June 2010[/tpl]
