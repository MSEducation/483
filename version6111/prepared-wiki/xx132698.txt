"Single Women" is a song, written by Saturday Night Live writer Michael O'Donoghue. The song, which depicted a number of women looking for love in a singles bar was originally performed during an SNL sketch by Christine Ebersole on the October 10, 1981 broadcast. The song later provided a top-ten country hit for Dolly Parton from her 1982 Heartbreak Express album. Released as the album's first single in February 1982, it reached number 8 on the U.S. country singles chart in April 1982.[tpl]cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=262[/tpl]  The song later inspired a 1984 TV movie starring Tony Danza and Jean Smart, which was produced by O'Donoghue.  An abbreviated version of Parton's recording of the song was used as the movie's theme song.
