==Specific characteristics==

The AUB is the only fully German-speaking university outside the German-speaking countries and a private, non-governmental, and non-profit university.

The students have the possibility to cover the tuition fees through official scholarships.
The AUB is “University of National Excellence” in Hungary and is the only university abroad, which is system accredited in Germany by evalag (Evaluation Agency Baden-Württemberg).

==Concept==

Andrássy University Budapest (AUB) considers following elements as essential and fixed cornerstones of its strategy:http://www.andrassyuni.eu/en/university Concept of the university, 06.03.2012

===German, outside the German language area===

The programmes offered by AUB rest on the tradition and the reservoir of the German language, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. This describes a clearly delineated target group within the rather large target market. With its extensive German course selection as well as with its advantages of being a German institution, AUB contributes to the maintenance and improvement of this target group.

===A multinational, intercultural community of teachers and students, with German as the lingua franca===

At AUB, students from more than 25 European countries meet to conduct their studies. The permanent and/or regular presence of professors from around the world creates unique study conditions which could not be achieved by the usual student or professor mobility.

===Applied interdisciplinarity===

Interdisciplinarity is incorporated structurally in the faculty layout, ensured in the curriculum by the interdisciplinary study programmes, implemented methodically into the joint transdisciplinary courses and embedded academically in the overlapping research topics.

===European focus on research and instruction===

European topics, including those regarding European integration, lie in the focus of research and instruction of all disciplines at AUB, whereby the Central and Eastern European countries and the Danube region are taken into particular consideration.

===Academic claims===

Thanks to the unity of research and instruction, the competitive and innovative study programmes, the research-related instruction and excellent student mentoring, AUB is committed to ensuring very high job market qualities.

==Aims==

In addition to encouraging the use of German as an academic language, the AUB aims to support and consolidate the cooperation of the states around the Danube, the education of European experts as well as multidisciplinary and multicultural teaching and research.

==Building==

Home of the AUB since 2003 is the historical Festetics Palota in the centre of Budapest and in the neighbourhood of the Hungarian National Museum.  

==Focus==

The main focus of teaching at the AUB is on the History, Law and Politics of the Eastern and Central European states. In the three faculties International Relations, Central European Studies and Comparative Law and Governance, students can choose one of the following Master Degree or Postgraduate Programmes:

==Studies==

With its motto “Fit for Europe!” Andrássy University Budapest offers international study programmes in the German language. Scientists from every German-speaking country as well as from Hungary, together with students from more than 25 nations, create a unique atmosphere.
In small international study teams of 15 to 20 students, intercultural competence is an everyday practice. Interdisciplinarity is another characteristic feature of the university, as associate professors and students from different research areas work closely together.
Interdisciplinarity, internationality and an excellent student mentoring together make up a study concept which demands and supports autonomy. There is a choice of six master's programmes: four consecutive master's and two second master's. Students benefit from the broad international support of AUB through affordable tuition fees and the additional scholarship programmes from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Visegrád countries.http://www.andrassyuni.eu/en/studies Studies at AUB, 06.03.2012
