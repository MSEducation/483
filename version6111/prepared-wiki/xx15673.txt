The Hippocratic Oath is an oath historically taken by physicians and other healthcare professionals swearing to practice medicine honestly. It is widely believed to have been written by Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of western medicine, or by one of his students.[tpl]cite book|last=Farnell|first=Lewis R.|title=Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|date=2004-06-30|pages=234–279|chapter=Chapter 10|isbn=978-1-4179-2134-8[/tpl] p.269: "The famous Hippocratean oath may not be an authentic deliverance of the great master, but is an ancient formula current in his school." The oath is written in Ionic Greek (late 5th century BC),The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation By Ludwig Edelstein Page 56 ISBN 978-0-8018-0184-6 (1943)  and is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus. Classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by Pythagoreans, a theory that has been questioned because of the lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine.[tpl]cite book|last=Temkin|first=Owsei|title="On Second Thought" and Other Essays in the History of Medicine and Science|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|date=2001-12-06|chapter=On Second Thought|isbn=978-0-8018-6774-3[/tpl] Of historic and traditional value, the oath is considered a rite of passage for practitioners of medicine in many countries, although nowadays the modernized version of the text varies among them.
The Hippocratic Oath (horkos) is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear upon a number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional ethical standards.

==Original==

This is the original version of the Oath:

==English translation==

I swear by Apollo, the healer, Asclepius, Hygieia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath and agreement:
To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me this art; to live in common with him and, if necessary, to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art;
and that by my teaching, I will impart a knowledge of this art to my own sons, and to my teacher's sons, and to disciples bound by an indenture and oath according to the medical laws, and no others.
I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone.
I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion.
But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts.
I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art.
In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or men, be they free or slaves.
All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal.
If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all humanity and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my life.

==The original oath broken down==

The original Hippocratic Oath can be broken up to cover twelve different areas to which a physician is swearing to; the areas are as follows:[tpl]cite journal|last=Hulkower|first=Raphael|title=The History of the Hippocratic Oath: Outdated, Inauthentic, and Yet Still Relevant|journal=The Einstein Journal of Biology and Medicine|year=2010|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl]
When the Oath was rewritten in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University, the prayer was omitted, and that version has been widely accepted and is still in use today by many medical schools.[tpl]cite web|title=The Hippocratic Oath Modern Version|publisher=University of California San Diego|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl]

==Modern use and relevance==

The oath has been modified multiple times. One of the most significant revisions was first drafted in 1948 by the World Medical Association. Called the Declaration of Geneva, it was "intended to be a self-conscious rewriting of the Hippocratic Oath, reaffirming Hippocratism in the face of the shame and tragedy of the German medical experience". The Third Reich had, true to their genocidal ethic, of course deemed that there was such thing as a life not worth living, and this was seen in their medical experimentation on minorities throughout WWII.
In the 1960s, the Hippocratic Oath was changed to "utmost respect for human life from its beginning", making it a more secular concept, not to be taken in the presence of God or any gods, but before only other people.
While there is currently no legal obligation for medical students to swear an oath upon graduating, 98% of American medical students swear some form of oath, while only 50% of British medical students do.

Seven medical schools did not reply to the survey. In France, it is common for new medical graduates to sign a written oath.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sritharan|first=Kaji|coauthors=Georgina Russell, Zoe Fritz, Davina Wong, Matthew Rollin, Jake Dunning, Bruce Wayne, Philip Morgan, Catherine Sheehan|title=Medical oaths and declarations|journal=BMJ|date=December 2000|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1440–1|pmid=11751345|pmc=1121898|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1440[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Crawshaw|first1=R|last2=Pennington|first2=T H|last3=Pennington|first3=C I|last4=Reiss|first4=H|last5=Loudon|first5=I|title=Letters|journal=BMJ|date=October 1994|volume=309|pages=952|pmc=2541124|pmid=7950672|issue=6959|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6959.952[/tpl] The modern Hippocratic oath being nonobligatory is in stark contrast to what a president, congressman, or other elected official takes when being sworn into office.[tpl]cite web|last=Hulkower|first=Raphael|title=The History of the Hippocratic Oath: Outdated,|publisher=Albert Einstein College of Medicine|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]
In the United States, the majority of osteopathic medical schools use the Osteopathic Oath as well as the Hippocratic Oath. The Osteopathic Oath was first used in 1938, and the current version has been in use since 1954.
In 1995, Sir Joseph Rotblat, in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, suggested a Hippocratic Oath for Scientists.

==Abortion and the Hippocratic Oath==

Despite the Hippocratic Oath prohibiting abortions, it is no longer considered a professional violation of ethics to perform one in the United States. This is very similar to what is happening currently with the lethal injection debate. As shown in the previous sections, the Hippocratic oath has been changed or modified to take out the section that forbids abortion. The important thing to remember here is that not every country has taken the same steps to modifying their Hippocratic Oath to remove abortion as the United States has. The major case that brought about this change was the Roe v. Wade case of 1973. As a result of the supreme court ruling that abortion was legal, change was brought about and the oath was modified.[tpl]cite web|last=Balch MD/Ph.D.|first=Julie|title=The Hippocratic Oath: An Ethic Surviving Historical,Social, and Religious Conflict|url=http://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/Students/About-SoM/Admission-Process/Essays/The-Hippocratic-Oath|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=1 April 2014[/tpl]

==Lethal injection and the Hippocratic Oath==

There has been a large debate on whether a doctor administering or facilitating in a lethal injection to a prisoner is breaking the Hippocratic Oath they took.
In 1991, Jose High was set to be executed in Georgia. The execution team could not gain access to Jose High's vein due to extreme drug use from his past. The execution team brought in a doctor who had critical care training and was an expert at finding deep veins in the human body. Once the doctor was hired for the sole reason of inserting an IV the doctor at that point become part of the execution team.
Up until this point, doctors would not take part in placing an IV or administering the drugs, they were only there to pronounce the death of the inmate. The execution happened without incident; however, a group of doctors sued the Georgia State Medical Board for not disciplining the doctor, stating that he violated federal law and broke the Hippocratic Oath (although the Hippocratic oath is not legally binding). In response, the Georgia legislature passed laws protecting doctors who take part in lethal injections from civil and criminal prosecution.

==Breaking the Hippocratic Oath==

There is no direct punishment for breaking the Hippocratic oath in modern days. It can be said that malpractice is the same thing and it carries a wide range of punishments from legal action to civil penalties.[tpl]cite journal|last=Groner M.D.|first=Johnathan|title=The Hippocratic Paradox: The Role of The Medical Profession In Capital Punishment In The United States|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal Library|year=2008|accessdate=12 March 2014[/tpl] In antiquity the punishment for breaking the Hippocratic oath could range from a penalty to losing the right to practice medicine.[tpl]cite book|last=Nutton|first=Vivian|title=Ancient Medicine|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY[/tpl] While there may not be any outright punishment for a doctor breaking their Hippocratic oath one can see a large scale example of this with the holocaust. During the Holocaust in the early 1940s, Nazi Germany was executing people of the Jewish faith by the thousands. In an dastardly attempt to make the killing more effective they turned to doctors to help find a way to kill more people faster and cheaper. It was the ultimate violation of the Hippocratic oath on a mammoth scale. These doctors did not just go free; the United States and allies pursued these doctors and charged them with war crimes.[tpl]cite web|title=Nazi Doctors & Other Perpetrators of Nazi Crimes|url=http://www.websteruniv.edu/~woolflm/nuremburg.html|publisher=Webster University|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]  The thing to remember is that while there are no direct laws, doctors can still be held accountable through malpractice and other civil and criminal charges.
