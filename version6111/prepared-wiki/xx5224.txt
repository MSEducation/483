Admiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, [tpl]post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|OM|GCVO|SGM[/tpl] (5 December 1859 – 20 November 1935) was a Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Egyptian war and the Boxer Rebellion and commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 during World War I. His handling of the fleet at that battle was controversial: he made no serious mistakes and the German High Seas Fleet retreated to port – at a time when defeat would have been catastrophic for Britain – but at the time the British public were disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the Battle of Trafalgar. Jellicoe later served as First Sea Lord but was removed at the end of 1917 as a result of his pessimistic view, declaring that nothing could be done to defeat the U-boats. He also served as the Governor-General of New Zealand in the early 1920s.

Promoted to commander on 30 June 1891, Jellicoe joined the battleship [tpl]HMS|Sans Pareil|1887|6[/tpl] in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1892. He transferred to the battleship [tpl]HMS|Victoria|1887|6[/tpl] in 1893 (the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon) and was aboard when it collided with [tpl]HMS|Camperdown|1885|6[/tpl]  and was wrecked off Tripoli on 22 June 1893. He was then appointed to the new flagship, [tpl]HMS|Ramillies|1892|6[/tpl], in October 1893.

==High command==

As a protege of Admiral John Fisher, Jellicoe became Director of Naval Ordnance in 1905 and, having been appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of launching of [tpl]HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6[/tpl] on 10 February 1906,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=27885 |date=13 February 1906 |startpage=1037|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] he was also made an Aide-de-Camp to the King on 8 March 1906.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=27897 |date=23 March 1906 |startpage=2061|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] Promoted to rear-admiral on 8 February 1907,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=27993 |date=8 February 1907 |startpage=899|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] he pushed hard for funds to modernise the navy, supporting the construction of new [tpl]HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2[/tpl]-type battleships and [tpl]sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|2[/tpl]s.Heathcote, p. 130 He supported F. C. Dreyer's improvements in gunnery fire-control systems, and favoured the adoption of Dreyer's "Fire Control Table", a form of mechanical computer for calculating firing solutions for warships.Brooks, p. 135 Jellicoe arranged for the output of naval ordnance to be transferred from the War Office to the Admiralty.Grigg 2002, p371-2
Jellicoe was appointed second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet in August 1907, hoisting his flag in the battleship [tpl]HMS|Albemarle|1901|6[/tpl]. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of the King's Review of the Home Fleet in the Solent on 3 August 1907.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=28048 |date=6 August 1907 |startpage=5390|supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] He went on to be Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy in October 1908 and, having taken part in the funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=28401 |date=26 July 1910 |startpage=5481|supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] he became Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet in December 1910, hoisting his flag in the battleship [tpl]HMS|Prince of Wales|1902|6[/tpl]. He advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the Coronation of King George V on 19 June 1911 and confirmed in the rank of vice-admiral on 18 September 1911.

==World War I==

===Grand Fleet===

At the start of World War I, Admiral George Callaghan, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, was removed by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill. Jellicoe was promoted to full admiral on 4 August 1914 and assigned command of the renamed Grand Fleet in Admiral Callaghan's place, though he was appalled by the treatment of his predecessor. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 8 February 1915.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=29066 |date=12 February 1915|startpage=1443 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl]
When Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) both had to leave office after their quarrel over the Dardanelles, Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: “We owe you a debt of gratitude for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, and I hope that never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise”.
Jellicoe was in command of the British Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, history's largest (and only major) clash of dreadnoughts, albeit an indecisive one. His handling of the Grand Fleet during the battle remains controversial, with some historians describing Jellicoe as too cautious and other historians faulting the battlecruiser commander, Admiral David Beatty, for making various tactical errors.Brooks, p. 232-237 Jellicoe certainly made no significant mistakes during the battle: based on limited intelligence, he correctly deployed the Grand Fleet with a turn to port so as to "cross the T" of the German High Seas Fleet as it appeared.Massie, p. 621 After suffering heavy shell damage, the German fleet turned 180 degrees and headed away from the battle.Massie, p. 645 Jellicoe was criticised for not pursuing the German High Seas Fleet, but it is unclear that this would have been sensible, given the risk of German torpedo attacks. At the time the British public were disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the Battle of Trafalgar. Churchill described Jellicoe later as 'the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon'. Nevertheless he was appointed a member of the Order of Merit on 31 May 1916,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=29751 |date=15 September 1916 |startpage=9070 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 17 June 1916[tpl]London Gazette |issue=29629 |date=20 June 1916 |startpage=6063 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] and awarded the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour on 15 September 1916.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=29751|date=15 September 1916 |startpage=9081 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl]

===First Sea Lord===

Jellicoe was appointed First Sea Lord in November 1916. His term of office role saw Britain brought within danger of starvation by German unrestricted U-Boat warfare.name=heath131>Heathcote, p. 131[/ref]
At the War Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1915-16) in November 1916, the admirals present, including Jellicoe, told Lloyd George that convoys presented too large a target for enemy ships, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to “keep station” in a convoy. In February 1917, Hankey wrote a memorandum for Lloyd George calling for the introduction of “scientifically organised convoys”, almost certainly after being persuaded by Commander Henderson and the Shipping Ministry officials with whom he was in contact. After a breakfast meeting (13 February 1917) with Lloyd George, Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Admirals Jellicoe and Duff agreed to “conduct experiments”. However, convoys were not in general use until August 1917, by which time shipping losses to U-boats were already falling from their April peak.Grigg 2002, p49, 51, 53
Jellicoe continued to take a pessimistic view, declaring (during the War Policy Committee planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July) that nothing could be done to defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after he had failed to act on “secret, but absolutely reliable” information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the defeat of Italy and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.Grigg 2002, p373
Jellicoe was rather abruptly dismissed by Geddes in December 1917.name=heath131>Heathcote, p. 131[/ref] Before he left for leave on Christmas Eve he received a letter from Geddes demanding his resignation. Geddes’ letter stated that he was still in the building and available to talk, but after consulting Admiral Halsey Jellicoe replied in writing that he would “do what was best for the service”. The move became public knowledge two days later.Grigg 2002, p371-3
The Christmas holiday, when Parliament was not sitting, provided a good opportunity to remove Jellicoe with a minimum of fuss. Geddes squared matters with the King and with the Grand Fleet commander Admiral Beatty (who had initially written to Jellicoe of his “dismay” over his sacking and promised to speak to Geddes, but then did not write to him again for a month) over the holiday. The other Sea Lords talked of resigning (although Jellicoe advised them not to do so), especially when Geddes suggested in a meeting (31 December) that Balfour and Carson had specifically recommended Jellicoe’s removal at the 26 October meeting; they had not done so, although Balfour’s denial was less than emphatic. There was no trouble from the generals, who had a low opinion of Jellicoe. In the end the Sea Lords remained in place, whilst Carson remained a member of the War Cabinet, resigning in January over Irish Home Rule.Grigg 2002, p374-5
Although it was pretended that the decision had been Geddes’ alone, he let slip in the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) that he had been conveying “the decision of the Government”, i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.Grigg 2002, p374
As First Sea Lord Jellicoe was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 21 April 1917,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=30029|date=20 April 1917 |startpage=3821 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] the Russian Order of St. George, 3rd Class on 5 June 1917,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=30116|date=5 June 1917 |startpage=5591 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] the Grand Cross of the Italian Military Order of Savoy on 11 August 1917[tpl]London Gazette |issue=30227|date=10 August 1917 |startpage=8208 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] and the Grand Cordon of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun on 29 August 1917.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=30258|date=29 August 1917 |startpage=8989 |supp=yes|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl]

===Later War===

Jellicoe was created Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa Flow on 7 March 1918[tpl]London Gazette |issue=30565|date=8 March 1918 |startpage=2989 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl]
In June 1918, amidst concerns that - following the Treaty of Brest Litovsk - the Germans were about to requisition the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Lloyd George proposed Jellicoe as Allied Supreme Naval Commander in the Mediterranean. The French were in favour of a combined Allied naval command, but the Italians were not, so nothing came of the suggestion.Grigg 2002, p372

==Retirement==

Jellicoe was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 April 1919. He became Governor-General of New Zealand in September 1920[tpl]London Gazette |issue=31983|date=16 July 1920 |startpage=7577 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] and while out there also served as Grand Master of New Zealand's Masonic Grand Lodge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freemasons.co.nz/cms/misc/grand-masters/|title=Grand Master & Past Grand Masters|publisher=The New Zealand Freemasons |accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] Following his return to England, he was created Earl Jellicoe and Viscount Brocas of Southampton in the County of Southampton on 1 July 1925.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=33063|date=3 July 1925|startpage=4448 |supp=|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] He died of pneumonia at his home in Kensington in London on 20 November 1935 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.

==Legacy==

In 1919, "Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem" with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham. was "Dedicated to Admiral Viscount Jellicoe." "Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem" with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham. Winnipeg, Manitoba: Waley, Royce and Co., 1919
The attempt of his official biographer Admiral Bacon to portray him as the conqueror of the U-Boats is, in John Grigg’s view, absurd, as the main decisions were taken by other men. Bacon also claimed that his elevation to a viscountcy on dismissal was a deliberate snub, but in fact Sir John French, the former Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, was only a viscount at the time (both he and Jellicoe became Earls subsequently), whilst Fisher was never more than a Baron. Bacon's neutrality may be questionable as he had himself been sacked by Geddes from command of the Dover Patrol, replaced by Roger Keyes, shortly after Jellicoe’s removal.

==Family==

In July 1902 Jellicoe married Gwendoline Cayzer, daughter of the shipping magnate Sir Charles Cayzer; they had a son and five daughters.
