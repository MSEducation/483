The 1,024 amino acids of E. coli  β-galactosidase were first sequenced in 1970,[tpl]cite journal | author = Fowler AV, Zabin I | title = The amino acid sequence of beta galactosidase. I. Isolation and composition of tryptic peptides | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 245 | issue = 19 | pages = 5032–41 |date=October 1970 | pmid = 4918568 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/245/19/5032 [/tpl] and its structure determined twenty-four years later in 1994.  The protein is a 464-kDa homotetramer with 2,2,2-point symmetry [tpl] pmid| 8008071 [/tpl] Each unit of β-galactosidase consists of five domains; domain 1 is a jelly-roll type barrel, domain 2 and 4 are fibronectin type III-like barrels, domain 5 a β-sandwich, while the central domain 3 is a TIM-type barrel.
The third domain contains the active site.[tpl]cite journal | author = Matthews BW | title = The structure of E. coli beta-galactosidase | journal = C. R. Biol. | volume = 328 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–56 |date=June 2005 | pmid = 15950161 | doi = 10.1016/j.crvi.2005.03.006 | url =  [/tpl] The active site is made up of elements from two subunits of the tetramer, and disassociation of the tetramer into dimers removes critical elements of the active site.  The amino-terminal sequence of β-galactosidase, the α-peptide involved in α-complementation, participates in a subunit interface. Its residues 22-31 help to stabilize a four-helix bundle which forms the major part of that interface, and residue 13 and 15 also contributing to the activating interface.  These structural features provide a rationale for the phenomenon of α-complementation, where the deletion of the amino-terminal segment results in the formation of an inactive dimer.

==Reaction==

The active site of β-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of its disaccharide substrate via "shallow" and "deep" binding. Monovalent potassium ions (K+) as well as divalent magnesium ions (Mg2+) are required for the enzyme's optimal activity. The beta-linkage of the substrate is cleaved by a terminal carboxyl group on the side chain of a glutamic acid.
In E. coli, Glu-461 was thought to be the nucleophile in the substitution reaction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gebler JC, Aebersold R, Withers SG | title = Glu-537, not Glu-461, is the nucleophile in the active site of (lac Z) beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli | journal = J.

Instead, Glu-537 is the actual nucleophile,[tpl]cite journal | author = Yuan J, Martinez-Bilbao M, Huber RE | title = Substitutions for Glu-537 of beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli cause large decreases in catalytic activity | journal = Biochem.

In humans, the nucleophile of the hydrolysis reaction is Glu-268.[tpl]cite journal | author = McCarter JD, Burgoyne DL, Miao S, Zhang S, Callahan JW, Withers SG | title = Identification of Glu-268 as the catalytic nucleophile of human lysosomal beta-galactosidase precursor by mass spectrometry | journal = J.

==Uses==

The β-galactosidase assay is used frequently in genetics, molecular biology, and other life sciences.  An active enzyme may be detected using X-gal, which forms an intense blue product after cleavage by β-galactosidase, and is easy to identify and quantify.  It is used for example in blue white screen.Beta-Galactosidase Assay (A better Miller) - OpenWetWare Its production may be induced by a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, IPTG, which binds and releases the lac repressor from the lac operator, thereby allowing the initiation of transcription to proceed.
Since it is highly expressed and accumulated in lysosomes in senescent cells, it is used as a senescence biomarker both in vivo and in vitro in qualitative and quantitative  assays, despite its limitations.
