==Life and career==

Horie was born in Katsushika, Tokyo, Japan.  She debuted in 1997 in the video game Voice Fantasia and for several years had minor roles in various anime. She landed her first leading role as Haruka in Kurogane Communication. The turning point in her career was not until 2000, when she won the role of Naru Narusegawa in the popular anime Love Hina. Other notable and defining career moments were taking the role of Tohru Honda in the anime Fruits Basket in 2001, and releasing her 1st music album (Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai) in 2000.  She has since become one of the most popular anime voice actresses in Japan.
Horie formed a temporary unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with the popular voice actress Yukari Tamura in 2001.  They released two singles, [tpl]nihongo|"Mō Hitori no Watashi"|もうひとりの私[/tpl] and "Merry Merrily"—the latter of which was an insert song in the Love Hina Christmas Special.  In October 2005, she founded Aice5, a J-Pop group consisting of 4 other voice actors, to help launch their careers. Aice5 was officially disbanded on September 20, 2007.  She has collaborated with a few other artists, such as Unscandal in 2005 and Kurobara Hozonkai, a goth band in 2007.  
Horie was affiliated with Arts Vision. However, she eventually left the agency in mid-2007 because of a scandal in the agency's top management and became a freelance voice actress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.new-akiba.com/archives/2007/06/post_9739.html|title=アーツビジョン事件を受けて堀江由衣が事務所を辞めたとの噂|publisher=NewAkiba.com|language=Japanese|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-08-05[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://seigura.com/artist/detail/463|title=堀江由衣　ほりえゆい|work=Seigura.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-05|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070716221115/seigura.com/artist/detail/463|archivedate=2007-07-16|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Today, she's affiliated with VIMS, a division of I'm Enterprise.
