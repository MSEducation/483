Esther Maria Lewis was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1871 and was raised in Hoboken, New Jersey. Her father was Colonel Edward Parke Custis Lewis (1837-1892), who served as  United States Minister to Portugal under President Grover Cleveland from 1885 to 1889. Her mother was Mary Picton Stevens (1840-1903), daughter of Edwin Augustus Stevens and formerly the wife of Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett. Her paternal great-grandparents were Lawrence Lewis, a nephew of George Washington, and Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis, a granddaughter of Martha Washington.[tpl]cite book |title=Lewis of Warner Hall |last=Sorley |first=Merrow Egerton ||origyear=1935 |year=1979 |pages=223–224 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b_scAAAAYAAJ[/tpl]
In 1888, at the age of 17 or 18, while her father was serving as Minister to Portugal, she was presented to Queen Victoria wearing a gown designed by Charles Frederick Worth, the world's first couturier. On May 29, 2001, the gown, which has a 23-inch waist and a 10½-foot detachable train, was sold at the Doyle New York auction for $101,500, at the time a world auction record for an antique dress.[tpl]cite news |title=Spencer-Churchill Property, Worth Gown Highlight Doyle New York Offerings|url=http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW0-05-29-2001-11-34-30 |work=Antiques and the Arts Online |date=2001-05-29 |accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Vanessa |last=Silberman |title=Auction Block |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HMU/is_11_28/ai_80192190/ |work=Art Business News |date=November 2001 |accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl]
