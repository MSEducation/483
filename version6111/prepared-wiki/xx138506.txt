Westfield Sydney, formerly Westfield Centrepoint, is an upscale shopping centre operated by the Westfield Group and located beneath the Sydney Tower in the Sydney central business district, Australia. It is adjacent to the Westfield Sydney Central Plaza.

==History==

The site of the A$860 million Westfield Sydney redevelopment was once occupied by the Westfield Centrepoint Shopping Centre and the smaller Skygarden and Imperial Arcades. The former Westfield Centrepoint housed over 140 stores and provided skybridge connections to two of Australia's major department stores, Myer and David Jones. There was also a connection to Imperial Arcade which featured the Sydney central business district's Angus & Robertson bookstore.
