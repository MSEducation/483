Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used by performers to represent a black person. It is often considered offensive, because it can imply stereotyped caricature of black people as in minstrel shows, and later vaudeville. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the proliferation of stereotypes such as the "happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation" or the "dandified coon".For the "darky"/"coon" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl, Temple University Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59213-555-2. See also Lewis A.

Ronald Green (2000), Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux, Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, ISBN 0-253-33753-4; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific "coon" archetype. In 1848, blackface minstrel shows were an American national art of the time, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.William J. Mahar, Behind the Burnt Cork Mask: Early Blackface Minstrelsy and Antebellum American Popular Culture, University of Illinois Press (1998), p. 9, ISBN 0-252-06696-0. Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form in its own right, until it ended in the United States with the U.S. Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.Frank W. Sweet, A History of the Minstrel Show, Backintyme (2000), p. 25, ISBN 0-939479-21-4
Blackface was an important performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the US, occurring on primetime TV as late as 1978 (The Black and White Minstrel Show)[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=62[/tpl] and 1981.[tpl]cite episode |title=Roots? |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1 |station= |airdate=1981-12-24 |season= |seriesno=8 |number=8 |minutes= [/tpl] In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. White blackface performers in the past used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.
Stereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture.Lott, Eric. "Blackface and Blackness: The Minstrel Show in American Culture", in Annemarie Bean, James V. Hatch, and Brooks McNamara (eds), Inside the minstrel mask: readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy, pp. 5-6. In some quarters, the caricatures that were the legacy of blackface persist to the present day and are a cause of ongoing controversy. Another view is that "blackface is a form of cross-dressing in which one puts on the insignias of a sex, class, or race that stands in binary opposition to one's own."Rogin, Michael (University of California Press 1998) Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot (p. 30)
By the mid-20th century, changing attitudes about race and racism effectively ended the prominence of blackface makeup used in performance in the U.S. and elsewhere. It remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or satire. Perhaps the most enduring effect of blackface is the precedent it established in the introduction of African-American culture to an international audience, albeit through a distorted lens.[tpl]Harvnb|Lott|1993|pp=17–18[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Watkins|1999|p=82[/tpl] Blackface's groundbreaking appropriation,Inside the minstrel mask: Readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy by Bean, Annemarie, James V.

==History==

==="Displaying Blackness" and the shaping of racist archetypes===

There is no consensus about a single moment that constitutes the origin of blackface. John Strausbaugh places it as part of a tradition of "displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers" that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=35–36[/tpl] Whites routinely portrayed the black characters in the Elizabethan and Jacobean theater (see English Renaissance theatre), most famously in Othello (1604). However, Othello and other plays of this era did not involve the emulation and caricature of "such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism," etc. that Strausbaugh sees as crucial to blackface.  Lewis Hallam, Jr., a white blackface actor of American Company fame, brought blackface in this more specific sense to prominence as a theatrical device in the United States when playing the role of "Mungo", an inebriated black man in The Padlock, a British play that premiered in New York City at the John Street Theatre on May 29, 1769.[tpl]Cite book|last= Tosches |first= Nick |title= Where Dead Voices Gather |publisher= Back Bay |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-316-89537-7 |page = 10[/tpl] The play attracted notice, and other performers adopted the style. From at least the 1810s, blackface clowns were popular in the United States.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=68[/tpl] British actor Charles Mathews toured the U.S. in 1822–23, and as a result added a "black" characterization to his repertoire of British regional types for his next show, A Trip to America, which included Mathews singing "Possum up a Gum Tree", a popular slave freedom song.Burrows, Edwin G. & Wallace, Mike. Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 489. Edwin Forrest played a plantation black in 1823, and George Washington Dixon was already building his stage career around blackface in 1828,[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=74 et. seq.[/tpl] but it was another white comic actor, Thomas D. Rice, who truly popularized blackface. Rice introduced the song "Jump Jim Crow" accompanied by a dance in his stage act in 1828[tpl]Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=211[/tpl] and scored stardom with it by 1832.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=67[/tpl]
Rice traveled the U.S., performing under the stage name "Daddy Jim Crow". The name Jim Crow later became attached to statutes that codified the reinstitution of segregation and discrimination after Reconstruction.Ronald L. F. Davis, Creating Jim Crow, The History of Jim Crow online, New York Life. Accessed 31 January 2008.
In the 1830s and early 1840s, blackface performances mixed skits with comic songs and vigorous dances. Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as entr'actes in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed either as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish; in the matronly, mammy mold; or highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman;[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=27[/tpl] the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=130–131[/tpl] featured many other, mostly ethnically-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal Jews;Jody Rosen (2006), album notes to Jewface, Reboot Stereophonic CD RSR006[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=131[/tpl] drunken brawling Irishmen with blarney at the ready;Michael C.

1830s and early 1840s blackface performers performed solo or as duos, with the occasional trio; the traveling troupes that would later characterize blackface minstrelsy arise only with the minstrel show.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=30[/tpl] In New York City in 1843, Dan Emmett and his Virginia Minstrels broke blackface minstrelsy loose from its novelty act and entr'acte status and performed the first full-blown minstrel show: an evening's entertainment composed entirely of blackface performance. (E. P. Christy did more or less the same, apparently independently, earlier the same year in Buffalo, New York.)[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=102–03[/tpl] Their loosely structured show with the musicians sitting in a semicircle, a tambourine player on one end and a bones player on the other, set the precedent for what would soon become the first act of a standard three-act minstrel show.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=51–52[/tpl] By 1852, the skits that had been part of blackface performance for decades expanded to one-act farces, often used as the show's third act.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=56–57[/tpl]
The songs of northern composer Stephen Foster figured prominently in blackface minstrel shows of the period. Though written in dialect and certainly politically incorrect by today's standards, his later songs were free of the ridicule and blatantly racist caricatures that typified other songs of the genre. Foster's works treated slaves and the South in general with an often cloying sentimentality that appealed to audiences of the day.Key, Susan. "Sound and Sentimentality: Nostalgia in the Songs of Stephen Foster." American Music, Vol. 13, No. 2 (Summer 1995), pp. 145–66.
White minstrel shows featured white performers pretending to be blacks, playing their versions of black music and speaking ersatz black dialects. Minstrel shows dominated popular show business in the U.S. from that time through into the 1890s, also enjoying massive popularity in the UK and in other parts of Europe.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=126[/tpl] As the minstrel show went into decline, blackface returned to its novelty act roots and became part of vaudeville. Blackface featured prominently in film at least into the 1930s, and the "aural blackface"[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225[/tpl] of the Amos 'n' Andy radio show lasted into the 1950s. Meanwhile, amateur blackface minstrel shows continued to be common at least into the 1950s.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=145–49[/tpl] In the UK, one such blackface popular in the 1950s was Ricardo Worley from Alston, Cumbria who toured around the North of England with a monkey called Bilbo.Ransom, Harry. Minstrel Show Collection, p. 149 (1959), UTA.
As a result, the genre played an important role in shaping perceptions of and prejudices about blacks generally and African Americans in particular. Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for whites' fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class, "The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening—and male—Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them."[tpl]Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=25[/tpl]

===Film===

Through the 1930s, many well-known entertainers of stage and screen also performed in blackface.One extensive list can be found at [tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=222–225[/tpl]. Whites who performed in blackface in film included Al Jolson,Smith, Rj, "Pardon the Expression" (book review), Los Angeles Magazine, August 2001. Accessed online 2 February 2008. Eddie Cantor,John Kenrick, Blackface and Old Wounds. Musicals101.com. Accessed online 2 February 2008. Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
In the early years of film, black characters were routinely played by whites in blackface. In the first known film of Uncle Tom's Cabin (1903) all of the major black roles were whites in blackface.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=203–04[/tpl] Even the 1914 Uncle Tom starring African-American actor Sam Lucas in the title role had a white male in blackface as Topsy.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=204–06[/tpl] D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) used whites in blackface to represent all of its major black characters,[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=211–12[/tpl] but reaction against the film's racism largely put an end to this practice in dramatic film roles. Thereafter, whites in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or "ventriloquizing" blackness Michael Rogin, Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot (1998), University of California Press, p. 79, ISBN 0-520-21380-7. in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=214[/tpl] This stands in contrast to made-up whites routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=214–15[/tpl]
Blackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities
regarding race began to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and bigotry. Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program Amos 'n' Andy (1928–60) constituted a type of "aural blackface", in that the black characters were portrayed by whites and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225[/tpl]; the televised version (1951–53) used African-American actors. The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons. Strausbaugh estimates that roughly one-third of late 1940s MGM cartoons "included a blackface, coon, or mammy figure."[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=240[/tpl] Bugs Bunny appeared in blackface at least as late as Southern Fried Rabbit in 1953.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=241[/tpl]

===Ballet===

In 1910 the ballet Sheherazade,  choreographed by Michael Fokine, premiered in Russia. The story behind the ballet was inspired by a poem written by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being Vaslav Nijinsky, would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet Petrushka, which was performed on stage. The ballet centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl], was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his scimitar. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When Petrushka is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as La Bayadère and Othello, in the United States and in Europe presently.Au, Susan. Ballet and Modern Dance, 2nd ed.

===Black minstrel shows===

By 1840, black performers also were performing in blackface makeup. Frederick Douglass generally abhorred blackface and was one of the first people to write against the institution of blackface minstrelsy, condemning it as racist in nature, with inauthentic, northern, white origins.Granville Ganter, "He made us laugh some": Frederick Douglass's humor, originally published in African American Review, December 22, 2003. Online at HighBeam Encyclopedia. Accessed online 2 February 2008. Douglass did, however, maintain: "It is something to be gained when the colored man in any form can appear before a white audience."Frederick Douglass, Gavitt's Original Ethiopian Serenaders, originally published in The North Star (Rochester), 29 June 1849. Online in Stephen Railton, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, University of Virginia. Accessed online 31 January 2008.
When all-black minstrel shows began to proliferate in the 1860s, they often were billed as "authentic" and "the real thing". These "colored minstrels"[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=199[/tpl] always claimed to be recently freed slaves (doubtlessly many were, but most were not)[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=198, 236–37[/tpl] and were widely seen as authentic. This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like "animals in a zoo"[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=206[/tpl] than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivalled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels may have been the country's most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=205[/tpl]
These "colored" troupes—many using the name "Georgia Minstrels"[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=203[/tpl]—focused on "plantation" material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern blacks.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=179, 198[/tpl] In the execution of authentic black music and the percussive, polyrhythmic tradition of pattin' Juba, when the only instruments performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was Sam Hague's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by Charles Hicks. This company eventually was taken over by Charles Callendar. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became Haverly's Colored Minstrels.
From the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from "Negro subjects", black troupes took the opposite tack.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=234[/tpl] The popularity of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and other jubilee singers had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by blacks, especially spirituals. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word "jubilee", originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for "plantation" material.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=236–37, 244[/tpl] Where the jubilee singers tried to "clean up" Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=243[/tpl]
African-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, blacks could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s "colored" troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen "corked up", but the other performers "astonished" commentators by the diversity of their hues.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=200[/tpl] Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=180[/tpl]
These black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the black bourgeoisie. James Monroe Trotter — a middle-class African American who had contempt for their "disgusting caricaturing" but admired their "highly musical culture"—wrote in 1882 that "few... who condemned black minstrels for giving 'aid and comfort to the enemy'" had ever seen them perform.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=226–28[/tpl], including the quotation from Trotter. Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, and took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of Moms Mabley.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=258–59[/tpl]
Despite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most blacks were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, "corking (or "blacking") up" provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=195[/tpl] Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the abolitionist cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of African-American music, humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad. It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=228[/tpl] Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior. It was also a forum for the sexual double entendre gags that were frowned upon by white moralists. There was often a subtle message behind the outrageous vaudeville routines:

left|thumb|A poster for the 1939 Broadway show The Hot Mikado using blackface imageryIn the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA), an all-black vaudeville circuit organized in 1909, blackface acts were a popular staple. Called "Toby" for short, performers also nicknamed it "Tough on Black Actors" (or, variously, "Artists" or "Asses"), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like Tim Moore and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers—black and white—many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly's European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the "Grand Old Man of the Negro Stage".Johnson (1968). Black Manhattan, p. 90. Quoted in [tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=218[/tpl] Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.Uncle Tom's Cabin (1914), IMDB. Accessed 31 January 2008. From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City's famous Apollo Theater in Harlem featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt "naked" without it.[tpl]rp|4, 1983 ed.[/tpl]
The minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Blacks took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic LeRoi Jones has written:
The black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The cakewalk is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:

==Authentic or counterfeit==

The degree to which blackface performance drew on authentic African-American culture and traditions is controversial. Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of African-American folk music.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=70–72[/tpl]
However, it seems clear that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.

Early blackface minstrels often said that their material was largely or entirely authentic to African-American culture; John Strausbaugh, author of Black Like You, said that such claims were likely to be untrue. Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=69[/tpl] Constance Rourke, one of the founders of what is now known as cultural studies, largely assumed this as late as 1931.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=27–28[/tpl] In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70[/tpl] Starting no later than Robert Toll's Blacking Up (1974), a "third wave" has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on African-American culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974[/tpl] passim.
As discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the Civil War, when many African Americans became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer's instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.
Author Strausbaugh summed up as follows: "Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks," writes Strausbaugh. "The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot. It was a mix, a mutt – that is, it was American music."

=="Darky" iconography==

The darky icon itself—googly-eyed, with inky skin; exaggerated white, pink or red lips; and bright, white teeth—became a common motif in entertainment, children's literature, mechanical banks and other toys and games of all sorts, cartoons and comic strips, advertisements, jewelry, textiles, postcards, sheet music, food branding and packaging, and other consumer goods.

"Golly", as he later affectionately came to be called, had a jet-black face; wild, woolly hair; bright, red lips; and sported formal minstrel attire. The generic British golliwog later made its way back across the Atlantic as dolls, toy tea sets, ladies' perfume, and in myriad other forms.

The United Artists 1933 release "Mickey's Mellerdrammer"—the name a corruption of "melodrama" thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows—was a film short based on a production of Uncle Tom's Cabin by the Disney characters. Mickey, of course, was already black, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers; and his now trademark white gloves."Mickey's Mellerdrammer."

For decades, darky images had been seen in the branding of everyday products and commodities such as Picaninny Freeze, the Coon Chicken InnCoon Chicken Inn Photos and history of the restaurant chain. restaurant chain and Darkie toothpaste (renamed Darlie) and Blackman mops in Thailand.

In Japan, in the early 1960s, a toy called Dakkochan became hugely popular. Dakkochan was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being distinguished by a bow. The black skin of the dolls was said to have been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist Tensei Kawano went as far as to state, "We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. In a way we are like Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them."

==Modern-day manifestations==

Over time, blackface and darky iconography became artistic and stylistic devices associated with art deco and the Jazz Age. By the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Europe, where it was more widely tolerated, blackface became a kind of outré, camp convention in some artistic circles. The Black and White Minstrel Show was a popular British musical variety show that featured blackface performers, and remained on British television until 1978. Many of the songs were from the music hall, country and western and folk traditions.Minstrels founder Mitchell dies, BBC, 29 August 2002. Accessed 2 February 2008.

===Germany===

In Germany, blackface was used in several theatrical productions. It should be noted that only around 800,000 (1%) people living in Germany are black.
Examples of theatrical productions include the many productions of the play "Unschuld" (Innocence) by the German writer Dea Loher, although in this play about two black African immigrants, the use of black-face is not part of the stage directions or instructions.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jenkenordalm.de/index.php?id=10 |title=Jenke Nordalm | Unschuld Innocence |language=German |work=jenkenordalm.de |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl] Webpage of the director of the production at the Theater Freiburg with pictures German productions of Herb Gardner's "I'm Not Rappaport" almost always cast the role of Midge Carter, the black character, famously portrayed in the U.S. by Ossie Davis, with a white actor in black makeup.
The production of "I'm Not Rappaport" at the Berlin Schlosspark-Theater was subject of protest.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16492222 |title=BBC News - Germany's Schlosspark Theatre defends 'blackface' actor |work=bbc.co.uk |date=January 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/10/german-play-im-not-a-rapp_n_1197160.html |title=German Play, 'I'm Not Rappaport', Angers Critics With Blackface Actor |work=huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |first=Danielle |last=Cadet |date=10 January 2012[/tpl] The director, Thomas Schendel, in his response to critics, argued that the classical and common plays would not offer enough roles that would justify a repertoire position for a black actor in a German theatre company. The protest grew considerably and was followed by media reports. While advocates of the theatre indicated that in principle it should be possible for any actor to play any character and that the play itself has an anti-racist message, the critics noted that the letter unwillingly disclosed the general, unexpressed policy of German theatres, i.e., that white actors are accounted to be qualified for all roles, even black ones, while black actors were suitable only for black roles.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.vice.com/read/blackface-is-the-new-black |title=Blackface Is the New Black | VICE |first=Stefan |last=Lauer |work=vice.com  |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl] Other authors said that this problem in Germany generally exists for citizens with an immigrant background.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6740:die-blackfacing-debatte-iii-man-muss-kein-neonazi-sein-um-rassistisch-zu-handeln&catid=101:debatte&Itemid=84 |title=Die Blackfacing-Debatte III – Man muss kein Neonazi sein, um rassistisch zu handeln |first=Lara-Sophie |last=Milagro |date=March 28, 2012 |work=nachtkritik.de |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5600:kommentar--migranten-spielen-auf-den-sprechbuehnen-keine-rolle&catid=101:debatte&Itemid=84 |title=Kommentar – Migranten spielen auf den Sprechbühnen keine Rolle |first=Özgür |last=Uludag |work=nachtkritik.de |date=May 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl] The debate was also in the foreign media attention. The Schlosspark-Theater has announced plans to continue the performances. And German publishing company of "Rappaport" stated it will continue to grant permits for such performances.
The staging of the play "Unschuld" (Innocence) at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin was also subject of protest.[tpl]cite web |url= http://etberlin.de/program-mainmenu-32/372-colorblind |title=Colorblind? |work=etberlin.de |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl] The activist group "Bühnenwatch" (stage watch) performed a stunt in one of the stagings: 42 activists, posing as spectators, left the audience without a word and later distributed leaflets to the audience. Fundamental of the criticism was that the use of black-face solidifies stereotypes regardless of any good intentions and supports racist structures. The critics were invited to a discussion with the director, actors, theatre manager and other artists of the Deutsches Theater. As a result of the discussion, Deutsches Theater changed the design of actor make-up. Ulrich Khuon, the theatre manager, later admitted to being surprised by the protest and is now in a process of reflection.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.arte.tv/de/6593686,CmC=6588478.html |title=Aktuell: Das Deutsche Theater sieht weiß und/oder Schwarz? | Theaterensemble 'Label Noir' | Metropolis, Samstag ab 16.45 Uhr | Kultur entdecken | de - ARTE |work=arte.tv |year=2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012[/tpl]

===Mexico===

In modern-day Mexico there are examples of images (usually caricatures) in blackface (i.e.:Memín Pinguín).

===South Africa===

Inspired by blackface minstrels who visited Cape Town, South Africa, in 1848, former Javanese and Malayn coolies took up the minstrel tradition, holding emancipation celebrations which consisted of music, dancing and parades. Such celebrations eventually became consolidated into an annual, year-end event called the "Coon Carnival" but now known as the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival or the Kaapse Klopse.
Today, carnival minstrels are mostly Coloured ("mixed race"), Afrikaans-speaking revelers. Often in a pared-down style of blackface which exaggerates only the lips, they parade down the streets of the city in colorful costumes, in a celebration of Creole culture. Participants also pay homage to the carnival's African-American roots, playing Negro spirituals and jazz featuring traditional Dixieland jazz instruments, including horns, banjos, and tambourines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.africapetours.com/Coon+Carnival.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051027061922/http://www.africapetours.com/Coon+Carnival.htm |archivedate=2005-10-27 |title=Coon Carnival Cape Town |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-11[/tpl]
Some have denounced Blackface as an artefact of apartheid accusing broadcasters of lampooning off of Black people.

[tpl]Original research|section|date=March 2014[/tpl]In Spain in the Three Wise Men traditional parade (Cabalgata de los Reyes Magos), the 6th of January Three Kings Day (Día de Reyes), Balthazar (Baltasar), the black king, is usually represented by a white man in blackface, although sometimes not. Many organizations publicly criticised the racist occurrence, stating that Balthazar is a positive figure based on Mansa Musa iconography and thus should be represented by a true African; notably the WakafriKa Pan-African Center has been publicly campaigning for a true black Balthazar.

In Portugal, where the black population is the most visible minority but not very sizeable as a population (and, except for some construction hand-labour from what were then Portuguese African colonies, did not have much of a black population until the 1990s-1980s), black actors (as in other countries) frequently complain of difficulty getting long-term roles and non minor.Ciomara Morais. “Para estares integrado em Portugal tens de esconder tudo o que tens de negro”, Nuno Ramos de Almeida, newspaper i, 3 February 2013.Carlos Paca - “O teatro é a verdade, a reciprocidade no momento”, Marta Lança, Buala There is not, though, a long history (besides Othello performance) of use of actors in blackface for "serious" performances meant for realistic black character, but the use of blackface for comedy keeps being used frequently well into the 21st century.Revolta dos Pasteis de Nata sic - Ze Black sic, Youtube The talk-show 5 Para a Meia-Noite, especially on episodes hosted by Luís Filipe BorgesBoy N'Ass & Dr. Pussy (parte 2) - Luís Filipe Borges - 5 Para a Meia Noite, Youtube and Pedro Fernandes,"BLACK N'DECK" episódio 6 - Pedro Fernandes - 5 Para a Meia Noite, Youtube who have both donned it, uses it almost on a weekly basis."Snoop Dogg" fala português - Pedro Fernandes - 5 Para a Meia Noite, Youtube Use of black performance in impersonations was quite frequently used in the (ongoing) song and impressions show A Tua Cara não Me É Estranha, with blackface impressions of Michael Jackson,A Tua Cara Não Me é estranha: Paulo Vintém interpreta Michael Jackson, YoutubeMaria João Abreu (Michael Jackson) - A Tua Cara Não Me É Estranha (TVI), Youtube Siedah Garrett,Daniela e Edmundo interpretam Michael Jackson e Siedah Garrett-A Tua cara não me é Estranha (TVI ), Youtube Tracy Chapman,Merche Romero interpreta Tracy Chapman, Youtube Louie Armstrong,Mico da Câmara Pereira interpreta «What a Wonderful World» de Louis Armstrong, Youtube Nat King ColeNicolau Breyner interpreta_Nat King Cole_ A Tua Cara Não me é Estranha, Youtube (with the hosts commenting that Nicolau Breyner, the performer, turned his skin into the color of a turd), among others. This use of blackface generates rather small (or at least little verbalized) uproar among Afro-Portuguese, and ironically enough, in a special presentation (not on contest) in the show mulatto former football goalkeeper Neno played Julio Iglesias in "whiteface".Neno interpreta Julio Iglesias
In Brazil, there has been at least some history of non-comedic use of blackface, using white actors for black characters like Uncle Tom (although the practice of "racelift", or making black/mulatto characters into mestiços/swarthy whites/caboclos, is more frequent than blackface).OS NEGROS NAS NOVELAS, blog Virtualia, 23 May 2009.A Cor de Gabriela, Lost in Japan, 18 June 2012.Caixa refaz propaganda e mostra Machado de Assis mulato, F5, Folha de São Paulo, 10 October 2011.

==Other contexts==

There are blackface performance traditions the origins of which stem not from representation of racial stereotype and are not in the stereotypical blackface mode.

===Europe===

In Europe, there are a number of folk dances or folk performances in which the black face appears to represent the night, or the coming of the longer nights associated with winter. Many fall or autumn North European folk black face customs are employed ritualistically to appease the forces of the oncoming winter, utilizing characters with blackened faces, or black masks.John Mack (ed.), Masks: the Art of Expression, British Museum, 1994. ISBN 0-7141-2507-5/"The Other Within: Masks and masquerades in Europe", Cesayo Dogre Poppi.
In Bacup, Lancashire, England, the Britannia Coco-nut Dancers wear black faces. Some[tpl]Who|date=December 2013[/tpl] believe the origin of this dance can be traced back to the influx of Cornish miners to northern England, and the black face relates to the dirty blackened faces associated with mining.
In Cornwall, England, several Mummer's Day celebrations are held; these were sometimes known as "Darkie Day" and involved local residents dancing through the streets in blackface to musical accompaniment. Although the origins of blacking-up for Mummer's Day have no racial connotations – the tradition goes back to the days of the Celts – controversially, in the Padstow festival, a song with the words "He's gone where the good niggers go", was formerly included due to the popularity of minstrel songs during the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdk4v11U4tQ |title=Darkie Day‏ |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11[/tpl]

The Netherlands and Belgium continue to celebrate St. Nicolas Eve with Sinterklaas accompanied by multiple Zwarte Pieten in the form of adolescent boys and girls, and men and women, who use black make-up and who wear Moorish page boy costumes. The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back to the middle of the 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children's book author, added an African servant to the Sinterklaas story.[tpl]cite web| title =De oudst bekende naam van Zwarte Piet: Pieter-mê-knecht (1850)| year= 1850| url =http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/nl/nieuwsbriefteksten/nieuwsbriefuitgelicht/143677-de-oudst-bekende-naam-van-zwarte-piet-pieter-me-knecht-1850| archiveurl =http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/nl/nieuwsbriefteksten/nieuwsbriefuitgelicht/143677-de-oudst-bekende-naam-van-zwarte-piet-pieter-me-knecht-1850| archivedate =November 2011| accessdate =2013-11-12[/tpl] However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with black faces appeared in Winter Solstice rituals.Marcel Bas, Zwarte Piet: discriminerend of fascinerend?, Aspekt Uitgeverij (2013), pp. 32, 34, 42-50, ISBN 9789461534095. In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of companions of Saint Nicholas, who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Niklaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland. Also on Saint Martin's Eve, black-faced men go around in processions through Wörgl and the Lower Inn Valley, in Tyrol.Marcel Bas, Zwarte Piet: discriminerend of fascinerend?, Aspekt Uitgeverij (2013), p. 49, ISBN 9789461534095.

InTintin in the Congo, cartoonist Hergé uses a blackface type drawing style to depict the native Congolese. And in the Dutch comic Sjors & Sjimmie, started in 1902, Sjimmy was initially depicted in the same way, but was gradually turned into a normal, but black, Dutch boy and in 1969, when Jan Kruis took over the comic, his transformation to a normal boy was complete.

===Japan===

In Japan, a fashion trend known as [tpl]nihongo3|"burn-black look", "charbroiled face", "dark tanning", "black-face" or "heavily-sunburned face"顔黒|ganguro[/tpl] was created in the late 1990s and peaked in popularity around the year 2000. Ganguro fashion is characterized by a combination of a dark tan and the application of heavy white or brightly colored makeup and light hair dye, usually blonde, orange, or silver. The bright hair and makeup result in the tanned skin looking even darker by contrast. Ganguro style also generally involves clothing items like miniskirts, tube-tops, and platform shoes or high heels. The trend is followed mostly by young women, and emulates American girls from California with an exaggerated version of the Valley Girl fashion popular in America in the same decade. An example of this fashion can be seen in the American movie "Clueless." Adopting this variance of Valley Girl culture is a rebellion against the traditional Japanese image of feminine beauty, which includes fair skin, natural looking makeup, and conservative dress.
In addition, within the world of Japanese hip hop, a subculture of hip-hoppers subscribe to the burapan style, and are referred to as blackfacers.Black-Face Minstrelsy One Japanese pop group, the Gosperats, has been known to wear blackface makeup during performances.[tpl]Cite news|last=Hamamoto |first=Ben |title=Is blackface in Japan racist? |url=http://www.mixedmediawatch.com/2006/06/05/is-blackface-in-japan-racist/[/tpl] The appearance of these "Jiggers" is evidence of the popularity of the hip-hop movement in Japan despite what is described as racist tendencies in the culture.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wood |first=Joe |title=The Yellow Negro |journal=Transition |number=73 |pages=40–67 |url=http://web.mit.edu/condry/Public/cooljapan/Mar23-2006/Wood97YellowNegro.pdf[/tpl]
Some Japanese fans of hip-hop find it embarrassing and ridiculous that blackface fans do this because they feel like they shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it can be seen as a racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit.Top: LocoRoco Racist?
The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.Neate, Patrick. "Where You're At: Notes From the Frontline of a Hip Hop Planet." Rebelling against the conformity and homogeneity of Japanese society, Japanese blackfacers took it a step further by uniquely adapting the physical look of black culture by literally tanning their faces to seem more "black". Japanese hip hop is superficial in that it mimics only the style of American hip hop, not the meaning.Japanese Hip-Hop, by Ian Condry (MIT)

===Korea===

In Korea, a cartoon character in a TV show[tpl]which|date=March 2014[/tpl] is being considered racially offensive; due to its dark skin color and specific facial features such as big lips and googy eyes that imposed an offend on most Africans. The practice of blackfacing is also executed in Korea, but not for the purposes of simulating a black person’s skin colour. Two cartoon fans were had a blackface when trying to copy the cartoon character Dooly. Although it was not for the same purposes as the original blackfacing in America, African-Americans felt disrespected, feeling that the Korean people did it to dishonour people of black skin colour. Koreans claim to be doing it for entertainment and education purposes. There are more foreigners working in Korea than before, hence the Korean people are trying to show a more respectful environment for foreigners.

In Thailand, actors darken their faces to portray the Negrito of Thailand in a popular play by King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910), Ngo Pa ([tpl]lang-th|เงาะป่า[/tpl]), which has been turned into a musical and a movie.

==Legacy==

Blackface minstrelsy was the conduit through which African-American and African-American-influenced music, comedy, and dance first reached the American mainstream. It played a seminal role in the introduction of African-American culture to world audiences. Wrote jazz historian Gary Giddins in Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams, The Early Years 1903–1940:
Many of country's earliest stars, such as Jimmie Rodgers
and Bob Wills, were veterans of blackface performance.Nolan Porterfield, Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler (1979), University of Indiana Press, p. 262, ISBN 0-252-00750-6.Charles Townsend, San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills (1986), University of Illinois Press, ISBN 0-252-01362-X, p. 45.Nick Tosches, Where Dead Voices Gather (2002), Back Bay, p. 66, ISBN 0-316-89537-7. More recently, the American country music television show Hee Haw (1969–1993) had the format and much of the content of a minstrel show.[tpl]Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=5[/tpl]
The immense popularity and profitability of blackface were testaments to the power, appeal, and commercial viability of not only black music and dance, but also of black style. This led to cross-cultural collaborations, as Giddins writes; but particularly according to some[tpl]Who|date=December 2013[/tpl] the often ruthless exploitation of African-American artistic genius, as well—by other, white performers and composers; agents; promoters; publishers; and record company executives.[tpl]Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=51[/tpl]Barlow, William.

While blackface in the literal sense has played only a minor role in entertainment in recent decades, various writers see it as epitomizing an appropriation and imitation of black culture that continues today. As noted above, Strausbaugh sees blackface as central to a longer tradition of "displaying Blackness". "To this day," he writes, "Whites admire, envy and seek to emulate such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism, the composure known as 'cool' and superior sexual endowment," a phenomemon he views as part of the history of blackface. For more than a century, when white performers have wanted to appear sexy, (like ElvisKolawole, Helen."He Wasn't My King." The Guardian Unlimited, August 15, 2002. Retrieved on 11-29-2007.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=61[/tpl]: not about "sexiness", but makes an explicit analogy between T. D.

"The First Word in Whiteness: Early Twentieth-Century European Immigration", Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror. Temple University Press, p. 355. they often have turned to African-American performance styles, stage presence and personas.[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=40[/tpl]: "To this day, Whites admire, envy and seek to emulate such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism, the composure known at 'cool' and superior sexual endowment." Conversely, up to and including the Civil Rights era, "aspirational" black performers imitated white style: [tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=140[/tpl] Pop culture referencing and cultural appropriation of African-American performance and stylistic traditions is a tradition with origins in blackface minstrelsy.
The international imprint of African-American culture is pronounced in its depth and breadth, in indigenous expressions, as well as in myriad, blatantly mimetic and subtler, more attenuated forms.Joel Hoard, "Fa shizzle dizzle, it's cultural appropriation-izzle", The Michigan Daily, April 19, 2004. Retrieved on 12-18-2008. This "browning", à la Richard Rodriguez, of American and world popular culture began with blackface minstrelsy. It is a continuum of pervasive African-American influence which has many prominent manifestations today, among them the ubiquity of the cool aestheticSouthgate, Nick."Coolhunting, account planning and the ancient cool of Aristotle."
