[[Trocha from Júcaro to Morón]]

CATEGORIES: Spanish colonial period of Cuba

The Trocha from Júcaro to Morón was a fortified military line built between 1869 and 1872 in Cuba by slave work force and Chinese immigrants to impede the pass of insurrectionist forces to the western part of the island during the 1st War of Independence (1868–1878) and was 68 km long between Júcaro and Morón.
This military line was the largest Spanish fortification in the colonies during the 19th Century. It was composed of differently sized forts, wire fences all along the line and a parallel railroad line. It is considered one of the most important military monuments of the Caribbean with a great historic value and is part of the Cuban National Heritage.
