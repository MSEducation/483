Raised near Manchester Bowett was a chorister at Manchester Cathedral, attended William Hulme's Grammar School and joined the Royal Navy at 18 years of age in 1945.  After demobilisation he studied law at Downing College, Cambridge. After gaining a first class degree Bowett was encouraged to continue his studies by Hersch Lauterpacht the then Whewell Professor of International Law.Sir Derek Bowett: international lawyer Obituary Times Online  3. August, 2009
His PhD (1958) was on “Self Defence in International Law”.
He was highly esteemed as a lawyer: J. P. Gardner (Director of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law)  wrote in the Introduction to Bowett’s book International Court of Justice (1997), that his “….experience of international litigation is unrivalled…” 
In 2007 he recorded a series of interviews for the Cambridge law faculty recalling his career, which are published on its website. The transcript, with its unaffected identification not only of those he respected as inspirations, but also those he regarded as lazy, poor lawyers or fools, preserves an authentic echo of the Bowett voice, immediately recognisable by those who knew him.
Sir Derek’s association with Queens’ College was long and eventful, and documented in a series of six amusing and elegantly written articles in the “Queens’ College Record” (20042, 20053, 20064, 2007-95).

==Personal life==

While in his first job as a university lecturer in Manchester, Bowett shared a house with three young women, including a "statuesque blonde with a sharp sense of humour", Betty Northall. Derek and Betty were married in 1953. http://www.squire.law.cam.ac.uk/eminent_scholars/derek_bowett_derek_bowett_memorial_service_address.php http://www.images.law.cam.ac.uk/gallery_viewer.php?gallery=2ef653d5dd02413cf39a4f0a3ba53224&image=d93ed5b6db83be78efb0d05ae420158e

==Work in Beirut and for Egypt==

He spent 1966-1968 in Beirut as Legal Adviser to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). There he experienced, from a distance, the Six Day War and, much more directly, its effects in terms of the great increase in the number of refugees falling under UNRWA’s remit. It coloured his attitude to the Middle East conflict thereafter: his rooms at Queens had on the walls photos of some of those refugees. In later years he successfully represented Egypt against Israel in a significant territorial dispute.

==Work in Somalia==

In 1964 while a Fellow of Queens' he was asked by the newly independent Government of Somalia to advise it on its territorial disputes with Ethiopia and Kenya. This was his first international law brief. On arrival in Mogadishu he was asked to draft a diplomatic note closing the British Embassy, on the basis that Britain was refusing to give effect to a plebiscite in the Northern Frontier District of Kenya, which had voted by a large majority to reunite with Somalia. Lacking experience in rupturing diplomatic relations, he asked to see the standard work, Satow’s Guide to Diplomatic Practice. But the Somali Foreign Ministry had no books of any kind, and he was told to borrow it from the British Embassy. The book was duly returned, with a note of thanks and another, more formal, note giving the Ambassador four days to leave. It seems to have been a case of persona non grata sed liber gratus.
