==Early release==

Ms. Foshee had already been in prison for 14 months before her trial. But she was released four weeks early, reportedly after she wrote to the authorities asking to return to her family for medical care. A court official told the Associated Press that she suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems. Her brother told reporters that he had taken her to Ho Chi Minh City airport as soon as she was released for a flight back to the United States. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20061113/ai_n16845620/
