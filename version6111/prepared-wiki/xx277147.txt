3-Methylcatechol is a chemical compound.

==Metabolism==

The enzyme 1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate dehydrogenase uses 1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate and NAD+ to produce 3-methylcatechol, NADH and CO2.[tpl]cite journal | author = Higson FK, Focht DD | date = 1992 | title = Degradation of 2-methylbenzoic acid by Pseudomonas cepacia MB2 | journal = Appl.

The isofunctional enzymes of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from species of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Nocardia, Alcaligenes and Corynebacterium oxidize 3-methylcatechol according to both the intradiol and extradiol cleavage patterns. However, the enzyme preparations from Brevibacterium and Arthrobacter have only the intradiol cleavage activity.Extradiol Cleavage of 3-Methylcatechol by Catechol 1,2-Dioxygenase from Various Microorganisms.
