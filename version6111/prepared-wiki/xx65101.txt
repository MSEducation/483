Under Slavic rule, it became known as Ravno (literal translation to English would be "flat"), since it is in a flat river valley. Some local names (of the villages Paljane and Isakovo, of the river Mirosava) recall the major clash in autumn 1191 between the Serbs (under Stefan Nemanja) and the Byzantines (under Emperor Isaac II Angelos).
In 15th century, Ćuprija became part of Ottoman Empire. After conquering this settlement, the Turks have built a bridge or "köprü" in Turkish - hance the name of the town.
Shortly after the First Serbian Uprising began, in 1805. one of the first and most important battles has been won on Ivankovac, near Ćuprija. Serbian uprisers under the leadership of dukes Milenko Stojković, Petar Dobrnjac and Stevan Sinđelić have defeated Turkish army which led to further spreading of the Uprising thru entire Belgrade Pashaluk. Four years after that, in 1809 Ćuprija Elementary school was founded.
During Second Serbian Uprising, Serbian prince Miloš Obrenović had made an oral agreement in Ćuprija which enabled Serbs in Belgrade Pashaluk to collect their own taxes, to participate in proceedings against Serbs and to establish People's Office composed of Serbian princes. After Turks have left Ćuprija in 1834., Ćuprija has started to grow economically and has merged with near-by villages Mućava, Mrčajevci and Žirovnica. In 1853, "Dobričevo" farm was founded. This led to establishment of Agricultural school in 1899. In 1911., a Sugar factory "ŠELK 911" was founded.
During the 19th century, Ćuprija was the center of Nahiyah. After 1890, it was the seat of Morvaski okrug (Morava county).
In World War Two, a special Ćuprija-Paraćin partisan troop was formed in order to fight against German Wehrmacht. On September 26, 1941, 35 members of this troop were shot by German occupiers. The WWII has finally ended in Ćuprija on October 13, 1944., when Ćuprija was liberated from Wehrmacht during so called Belgrade Operation.
