[[88 modern constellations]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Lists of constellations

Each culture divides the stars of the night sky into its own set of constellations, usually based on mythology. This article covers the 88 constellations used in modern astronomy, which properly speaking are not patterns of stars, as in the common use of the word, but areas of the sky (the celestial sphere), and include the constellations of the zodiac.
The ancient Sumerians, and later the Greeks (as recorded by Ptolemy), established most of the northern constellations in international use today. When explorers mapped the stars of the southern skies, European and American astronomers proposed new constellations for that region, as well as ones to fill gaps between the traditional constellations. Not all of these proposals caught on, but in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted the modern list of 88 constellations.  After this, Eug√®ne Joseph Delporte drew up precise boundaries for each constellation,[tpl]cite web|title=The Constellations|url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl] so that every point in the sky belonged to exactly one constellation.

==History==

Some constellations are no longer recognized by the International Astronomical Union, but may appear in older star charts and other references.  Most notable is Argo Navis, which was one of Ptolemy's original 48 constellations.

==Modern constellations==

The 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects and 17 humans or mythological characters. For help with the literary English pronunciations, see the pronunciation key. There is considerable diversity in how Latinate names are pronounced in English. For traditions closer to the original, see Latin spelling and pronunciation.

==Asterisms==

Various other unofficial patterns have existed alongside the constellations.  These are known as "asterisms." Examples include the Big Dipper/Plough and the Northern Cross.
Some ancient asterisms, for example Coma Berenices, Serpens, and portions of Argo Navis, are now officially constellations.
