Tulādhar (Devanagari: तुलाधर) is a Nepalese caste from the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. The name Tuladhar is derived from the Sanskrit words "tula" (weighing scale) and "dhar" (possessor), thus meaning scale-bearer or in general, merchant. Tuladhars belong to the Uray group which includes Kansakar, Tamrakar, Sthapit, Bania, Sindurakar, Selalik and other castes.[tpl]cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T.|title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 1996[/tpl] Page 110.[tpl]cite web | last =Wright| first =Daniel| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright_djvu.txt| title =History of Nepal with an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal| work = | publisher =Cambridge| year=1877| accessdate = 23 September 2012[/tpl] Page 86.

==Traditional occupation==

According to the division of labor laid down from ancient times in Newar society, business is the traditional occupation of Tuladhars. They are best known for their history as trans-Himalayan traders conducting trade between Nepal, India and Tibet.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

The merchants used two trade routes to travel to Tibet. One went north from Kathmandu and crossed the Himalaya at Kuti (now known as Nyalam) or Kyirong, also spelt Gyirong. The other route started at KalimpongKalimpong. New Delhi: Nest & Wings. ISBN 81-87592-01-X. Page 20. and passed through Nathula or Jelepla on the Sikkim-Tibet border. These trade routes are offshoots of the ancient Silk Road.
Textiles and other factory products were the main exports to Tibet while they brought back wool, musk pods, hides and yak tails. This traditional business came to an end in the mid-1960s after the route through Sikkim was shut down following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and all the Tuladhar traders returned home. In the course of conducting trade, they have been a cultural bridge between South and Central Asia.[tpl]cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title=Merchants of yore|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/01/08/Expression/Merchants-of-yore/203864/|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Rai|first=Dinesh|title=Traders on the Roof of the World: Lhasa Newars In Tibet|url=http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=188|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=ECS|date=October 2006[/tpl] Today, while they are still primarily merchants, many pursue varied professions.

==Cultural life==

Tuladhars observe an annual schedule of religious performances, devotional musical concerts and hymn singing sessions that are conducted at the community level. Among the prominent street performances are the Dāpā Thāyegu, Gunla Bajan Thāyegu and Bahidyah Bwayegu festivals.
The month-long Dāpā Thāyegu festival is held in October when they gather to sing hymns every evening. A picture of a sacred jar made of wheat, popcorn and black soyabean is displayed at Asan to mark the end of the festival.
