==History==

On 28 September 1883, a Holstenstraße station was opened for a horsecar line, from Millerntor  — near Reeperbahn — to Holstenstraße.[tpl]Citation |title=Straßen- und Stadtbahnen in Deutschland |volume=Band 11: Hamburg |language=German |page=36 |first1=Dieter |last1=Höltge |first2=Michael |last2=Kochems |publisher=EisenbahnKurier |location=Freiburg |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-88255-392-5 [/tpl] 
In 1893, the station was built elevated, as an alternate for the at-grade station called Schulterblatt at the current location. The station was part of the link line from Hamburg central station to Altona central station. During the bombing of Hamburg in World War II in 1943, the station building was destroyed and provisionally rebuild. In the end of the 1980s, the Station was completely renovated, with a new platform building and entrance.[tpl]citation |last1=Borchers |first1=Jan |last2=Heimann |first2=Martin |last3=Pischek |first3=Wolfgang |title=Die Hamburg S-Bahn |language=German |location=Munich |publisher=GeraMond |year=2002 |isbn=3-7654-7191-7 |page=22[/tpl]
