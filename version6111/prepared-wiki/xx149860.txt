==History==

The ground has hosted Gaelic games since the 1930s when CLG Naomh Adhamhnáin bought the land for £300. The ground opened on Sunday 2 May 1937, with the Bishop of Raphoe's blessing of the park, a hurling match between Donegal and Antrim, an address from GAA President Bob O'Keeffe and a football match between Donegal and Armagh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.steunansgaa.com/contentPage/78469/o_p_e_n_i_n_g_o_f_o_d_o_n_n_e_l_l_p_a_r_k|title=Opening of O'Donnell Park|work=St. Eunan's website[/tpl]
During the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann 2006, the ground was used as a makeshift campsite for visitors to the town for the duration of the festival. On 11 November 2008, CLG Naomh Adhamhnáin confirmed that it had completed the purchase of [tpl]convert|14.5|acre|m2[/tpl] of land adjoining O'Donnell Park, which it intended to develop over the coming years into additional pitches for the club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalnews/St-Eunans-club-complete-purchase.4692531.jp|title=St Eunan's club complete purchase of 14.5 acre site|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=14 October 2008[/tpl]
