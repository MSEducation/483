The  Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of almost all electric power generated in the United States.  eGRID is issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
As of May 2012, the available editions of eGRID contain data for years 2009, 2007, 2005, and 2004 as well as archived data for years 1996 through 2000.   eGRID is unique in that it links air emissions data with electric generation data for United States power plants.EPA - Clean Energy - EE Action Plan
eGRIDweb version 1.0 was released on April 27, 2009 by the U.S. EPA.      This user friendly web application allows users to select, view, and export eGRID2007 electric generation and emissions data for years 2005 and 2004.  The application includes downloadable eGRID subregion GHG total and non-baseload output emission rates for calculating indirect CO2 emissions, respectively; summary tables, representational maps, and a document, “The Value of eGRID and eGRIDweb to GHG Inventories”.

==History==

eGRID2012 Version 1.0 (the eighth edition of eGRID) was released by EPA on May 10, 2012.  It contains the complete release of year 2009 data, as well as data files for years 2007, 2005 and 2004 data.  TranSystems|E.H. Pechan, formerly E.H. Pechan & Associates, Inc has developed this and the previous seven editions of eGRID for EPA since first released on 1998.
eGRID2010 Version 1.1 (the seventh edition of eGRID) was released by EPA on May 20, 2011.  It contains the complete release of year 2007 data, as well as data files for years 2005 and 2004 data.  Data for year 2007 were configured to reflect the  electric power industry’s current structure as of December 31, 2010, including plant ownership and operators, parent company affiliations, company mergers, and grid configurations.  
eGRID2007 Version 1.1 (the sixth edition of eGRID) was released by EPA on January 28, 2009 and the fifth edition of eGRID, eGRID2006 Version 2.1, was released in April 2007; both years of data are included in eGRID2010 Version 1.1.  The fourth edition of eGRID, eGRID2002 Version 2.01, was released in May 2003 and contains data for years 1996 through 2000; it can be downloaded from the eGRID website’s Archive page.  The first through third editions of eGRID contained data years 1996 through 1998.  These editions are obsolete and have been replaced by the fourth edition.

==Data summary==

eGRID data include emissions, different types of emission rates,  electricity generation, resource mix, and heat input.  eGRID data also include plant identification, location, and structural information.  The emissions information in eGRID2010 includes carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), and mercury (Hg).   CO2, CH4, and N2O are greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming or climate change.  NOx and SO2 contribute to unhealthy air quality and acid rain in many parts of the country.  Hg is a toxic pollutant that can adversely affect exposed nervous systems.  eGRID's resource mix information includes the following  fossil fuel resources:  coal, oil, gas, other fossil; nuclear resources; and the following renewable resources: hydroelectric (water), biomass (including biogas, landfill gas and digester gas), wind, solar, and geothermal.
Data in eGRID2012 includes one Excel workbook with year 2009 data.  The eGRID workbook includes eight year 2009 data files – boiler, generator, plant, state, power control area, eGRID subregion, NERC region, and U.S. – and a  ninth file that displays the grid gross loss (%).  Data in previous versions of eGRID were presented in three Excel workbooks.  The first workbook contains data at the boiler, generator and plant levels.  The second workbook presents aggregated data by state, electric generating company, parent company, power control area, eGRID subregion, NERC region, and the U.S. The third workbook contains State import-export data for years 2004 and 2005, as well as U.S. generation and consumption data.  
The eGRID2012 Technical Support Document, File Structure, Summary Tables (with regional map), and GHG Annual Output Emission Rates for CO2, CH4, and N2O (for GHG inventory and registry work) are included in  Adobe PDF files.  
eGRID data for years 2009 along with year 2007, 2005 and 2004 data, are contained in a ZIP file that can be downloaded from EPA’s eGRID website. 
eGRID2007 data are also available at eGRIDweb version 1.0, the user friendly web application, which can be accessed directly from its own website or from EPA’s eGRID website, along with the eGRIDweb Users Manual. 
The primary data sources used for eGRID include data reported by electric generators to  EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division (pursuant to 40 CFR Part 70) and to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

==Data use==

eGRID data are used for carbon footprinting; emission reduction calculations; calculating indirect greenhouse gas emissions for The Climate Registry, the California Climate Action Registry, California’s Mandatory GHG emissions reporting program (Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, AB 32), and other GHG protocols;  were used as the starting point for the new international carbon emissions database, CARMA.  EPA tools and programs such as Power Profiler (which has been updated with eGRID year 2009 data), Portfolio Manager, 
the WasteWise Office Carbon Footprint Tool, the Green Power Equivalency Calculator, the Personal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator, 
and the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator use eGRID.  Other tools such as labeling/environmental disclosure,  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) attributes are supported by eGRID data.  States also rely on eGRID data for electricity labeling (environmental disclosure programs), emissions inventories, and for policy decisions such as output based standards.  eGRID is additionally used by nongovernmental organizations for tools and analysis by the  International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), the Rocky Mountain Institute, the National Resource Defense Council (NRDC), the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), Powerscorecard.org, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative. 
In 2010, Executive Order 13514 was issued, requiring Federal agencies to “measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect activities.”  
The Federal GHG Accounting and Reporting Guidance accompanied this order and recommended using eGRID non-baseload emission rates to estimate the Scope 2 (indirect) emission reductions from renewable energy.
