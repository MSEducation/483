The "Magnificent Seven" is an informal term applied to seven large cemeteries in London. They were established in the 19th century to alleviate overcrowding in existing parish burial grounds.[tpl]cite book |title=London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer |last=Meller |first=Hugh |publisher=Avebury |location=Amersham |year=1981 |isbn=0-86127-003-7 [/tpl]

==Background==

For hundreds of years, almost all London's dead were buried in small parish churchyards, which quickly became dangerously overcrowded. Architects such as Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Vanbrugh both deplored this practice and wished to see suburban cemeteries established,[tpl]cite book|last=Arnold|first=Catharine|title=Necropolis: London and its dead|date=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=London|isbn=9781416502487[/tpl] but it was not until British visitors, including George Frederick Carden, were inspired by Paris's Père Lachaise cemetery that something similar was developed in London: at Kensal Green.
In the first 50 years of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled from 1 million to 2.3 million. Overcrowded graveyards also led to decaying matter getting into the water supply and causing epidemics. There were stories of graves being dug that already contained bodies, and bodies being flushed directly into the newly built sewer system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

In 1981 the architectural historian Hugh Meller dubbed the group of cemeteries "The Magnificent Seven" after the  1960 western film of the same name.[tpl]cite journal | journal = The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians |title = Review: London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer | author = Lynne Walker |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=393–4 |date=December 1983[/tpl]
