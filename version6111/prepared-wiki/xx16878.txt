[[Carnelian]]

CATEGORIES: Quartz varieties, Gemstones, Trigonal minerals

Carnelian (also spelled cornelian) is a brownish-red mineral which is commonly used as a semi-precious gemstone.  Similar to carnelian is sard, which is generally harder and darker (the difference is not rigidly defined, and the two names are often used interchangeably). Both carnelian and sard are varieties of the silica mineral chalcedony colored by impurities of iron oxide.  The color can vary greatly, ranging from pale orange to an intense almost-black coloration. It is most commonly found in Brazil, India, Siberia, and Germany.

==History==

The bow drill was used to drill holes into carnelian in Mehrgarh between 4th-5th millennium BCE.Kulke, Hermann & Rothermund, Dietmar (2004). A History of India. Routledge. 22. ISBN 0-415-32920-5.
Carnelian was recovered from Bronze Age Minoan layers at Knossos on Crete in a form that demonstrated its use in decorative arts;C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (2007) this use dates to approximately 1800 BCE. Carnelian was used widely during Roman times to make engraved gems for signet or seal rings for imprinting a seal with wax on correspondence or other important documents. Hot wax does not stick to carnelian.Section 12 of the translation of Weilue - a 3rd-century Chinese text by John Hill under "carnelian" and note 12.12 (17) Sard was used for Assyrian cylinder seals, Egyptian and Phoenician scarabs, and early Greek and Etruscan gems.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sard[/tpl] The Hebrew odem (translated sardius), the first stone in the High Priest's breastplate, was a red stone, probably sard but perhaps red jasper.

Although now the more common term, "carnelian" is a 16th-century corruption of the 14th-century word "cornelian" (and its associated orthographies corneline and cornalyn).[tpl]cite web|title='Cornelian'|url=http://www.oed.com|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl]  Cornelian, cognate with similar words in several Romance languages, comes from the Mediaeval Latin corneolus, itself derived from the Latin word cornum, the cornel cherry,[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Carnelian[/tpl] whose translucent red fruits resemble the stone. The Oxford English Dictionary calls "carnelian" a perversion of "cornelian", by subsequent analogy with the Latin word caro, carnis, flesh. According to Pliny the Elder, sard derives its name from the city of Sardis in Lydia, but it more likely comes from the Persian word سرد sered, meaning yellowish-red.

==Distinction between carnelian and sard==

The names carnelian and sard are often used interchangeably, but they can also be used to describe distinct subvarieties.  The general differences are as follows:
All of these properties vary across a continuum, and so the boundary between carnelian and sard is inevitably blurred.
