I Am Sam (stylized i am sam) is a 2001 American drama film written and directed by Jessie Nelson, and starring Sean Penn as a father with a developmental disability, Dakota Fanning as his inquisitive seven-year-old daughter, and Michelle Pfeiffer as his lawyer. Dianne Wiest, Loretta Devine, Richard Schiff and Laura Dern appear in supporting roles. 
Jessie Nelson and Kristine Johnson, who co-wrote the screenplay, researched the issues facing adults with developmental disabilities by visiting the non-profit organization L.A. Goal (Greater Opportunities for the Advanced Living). They subsequently cast two actors with disabilities, Brad Silverman and Joe Rosenberg, in key roles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77829/vedder-crowes-cover-beatles-for-i-am-sam#/news/vedder-crowes-cover-beatles-for-i-am-sam-1097149.story|title=Vedder, Crowes Cover Beatles for 'I Am Sam'|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=2009-12-27[/tpl]
For his role as Sam, Penn was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002.
The movie's title is derived from the line "Sam-I-Am" featured in the book Green Eggs and Ham, which is read in the movie.

==Plot==

Sam Dawson (Sean Penn), a man with a developmental disability, is the single father of Lucy (Dakota Fanning), following their abandonment by her mother. Despite his limitations, Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with developmental disabilities, as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest) who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Though Sam provides a loving and caring environment for precocious Lucy, she soon surpasses his mental ability. Other children tease her for having a "retard" as a father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more intellectually advanced than Sam. In preparation for a custody case, a social worker turns up at Lucy's birthday party and takes her away, allowing Sam two supervised visits per week.
On the advice of his friends, Sam approaches a high-powered lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose brusque manner, fast-paced schedule and difficult personal life have earned her a reputation as cold and unfeeling. In an attempt to prove to others that she is not heartless, Rita surprisingly agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono. As they work together to secure Sam's parental rights, Sam unwittingly helps Rita with her family problems, including encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repairing her fractious relationship with her son.
At the trial, Sam breaks down after opposing counsel convinces him that he is not capable of being a father. After the trial, Lucy resides in a foster home with Randy Carpenter (Laura Dern), but tries to convince Sam to help her run away, and continually escapes in the middle of the night to go to Sam's apartment, whereupon he immediately returns her. Ultimately, the foster family who planned to adopt Lucy decide to return her to Sam, with an arrangement that Randy will help him raise her.
The final scene depicts a soccer game, refereed by Sam, in which Lucy participates as a player. In attendance are the foster family, Sam's friendship group, and a newly-single Rita with her son.

The New York Times wrote that "I Am Sam is a good movie, and its intentions are unimpeachable. But its sentimentality is so relentless and its narrative so predictable that the life is very nearly squeezed out of it."[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502E0D71031F93BA15751C1A9679C8B63|first=A.

On the other hand, the Los Angeles Times reviewed it positively as a "most inviting and accessible film that turns upon a mental condition that most people would prefer not to think about."[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/28/entertainment/et-sam28 |title=In 'I Am Sam,' Skillful Players Embrace a Heartfelt Family Tale |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=December 28, 2001 |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |accessdate=July 31, 2013[/tpl] The San Francisco Chronicle commended Sean Penn for his performance: "Penn's accuracy, his lack of condescension or sentiment, and his willingness to inhabit his character without any implicit commentary take what might have been the equivalent of an inflated TV movie and elevate it to the level of art."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Penn-plays-sad-Sam-He-s-full-of-integrity-as-2880088.php|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|title=Penn plays sad 'Sam' / He's full of integrity as retarded father|publisher=sfgate.com|date=January 25, 2002[/tpl] The New Yorker, however, found Michelle Pfeiffer to be the standout: "Pfeiffer, enormously likable in the role, almost saves the movie."[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/i_am_sam_nelson |title=I Am Sam |date=February 4, 2002 |first=David |last=Denby |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=July 31, 2013[/tpl]
Nick Rogers condemned the film: "Sean Penn gives the most professionally shameful, cruelly wrongheaded performance ever nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, while Jessie Nelson Kristine Johnson's script lives down to Penn's ugly ineptitude with idiotic catchphrases and product placement."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefilmyap.com/2010/06/23/movies-you-aught-not-watch-i-am-sam/ |title=Movies You Aught Not Watch: I Am Sam |publisher=The Film Yap |date=June 23, 2010 |first=Nick |last=Rogers |accessdate=July 31, 2013[/tpl] Ron Wells added: "This movie is every bit as painful as it sounds."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/2476/ |title=I Am Sam |date=January 25, 2002 |first=Ron |last=Wells |publisher=Film Threat |accessdate=July 31, 2013[/tpl]

Penn's brother, Michael Penn, is also featured on a duet with his wife Aimee Mann.
As the movie was shot and produced to the original Beatles music, the artists had to record their covers to the same musical timing (tempo) as The Beatles original pieces had.
