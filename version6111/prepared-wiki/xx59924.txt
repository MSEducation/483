Nicholas Berkeley "Nick" Mason (born 27 January 1944) is an English musician and composer, best known as the drummer of Pink Floyd. He is the only constant member of the band since its formation in 1965. Despite solely writing only a few Pink Floyd songs, Mason has co-written some of Pink Floyd's most popular compositions such as "Echoes" and "Time".
Mason is the only Pink Floyd member to be featured on every one of their albums. It is estimated that as of 2010, the group have sold over 250 million records worldwide,[tpl]Citation | title = Pink Floyd Reunion Tops Fans' Wish List in Music Choice Survey | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aOmothQgn6l4&refer=muse|work=Bloomberg| date = 26 September 2007| accessdate =25 May 2012| postscript = [/tpl][tpl]Citation | title = Pink Floyd's a dream, Zeppelin's a reality| url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/lifestyles/2007/sep/28/-rtd_2007_09_28_0044-ar-182172/|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch | date = 28 September 2007| accessdate =25 May 2012| postscript = [/tpl] including 74.5 million units sold in the United States.

==Early life==

The son of the documentary film maker Bill Mason, he was born in Birmingham but brought up in Hampstead, London (many online biographies mistakenly cite the street address Downshire Hill – sometimes as "the Downshire Hills" – as a district of Birmingham), and attended Frensham Heights School, near Farnham, Surrey. He later studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster), where he teamed up with Roger Waters, Bob Klose and Richard Wright in 1964 to form Pink Floyd's predecessor, Sigma 6.

==Musical career==

Mason has been the drummer on every Pink Floyd album (but not on every song; some feature session drummers and drum machines).
The only Pink Floyd songs that are solely credited to Mason are "The Grand Vizier's Garden Party Parts 1–3" (from Ummagumma) and "Speak to Me" (from The Dark Side of the Moon). The one-off song by the band titled "Nick's Boogie" was named after him.
The only times Mason's voice has been included on Pink Floyd's albums are "Corporal Clegg", the single spoken line in "One of These Days" and spoken parts of "Signs of Life" and "Learning to Fly" (the latter taken from actual recording of Mason's first solo flight) from A Momentary Lapse of Reason. He does, however, sing lead vocals on two unreleased but heavily bootlegged tracks, "Scream Thy Last Scream" (1967) and "The Merry Xmas Song" (1975–76). In live performances of the song "Sheep", he did the spoken section.
Despite legal conflicts over ownership of the name 'Pink Floyd', which began when Waters left the group in 1986 and lasted roughly seven years, Waters and Nick Mason are now on good terms. Mason joined Waters on the last two nights of his 2002 world tour to play drums on the Pink Floyd song "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", and he also played drums on some concerts of Waters' European tour in 2006, and during performances in Los Angeles and New York City in the United States. On 12 May 2007, Mason joined Waters again on stage at Earls Court to play The Dark Side of the Moon. Again, on 12 May 2011, Mason was featured, along with David Gilmour, on the encore "Outside the Wall" at a concert by Waters, who was performing The Wall in its entirety. Gilmour also performed on "Comfortably Numb" that night.
In July 2005, Mason, Gilmour, Wright, and Waters played together on stage for the first time in 24 years. A four-song set was played at the Live 8 concert in London. Mason also joined Gilmour and Wright for the encore during Gilmour's show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 31 May 2006, reuniting the post-Waters Pink Floyd. Mason has also claimed to be the link between Gilmour and Waters, and believes the band will play live again, mentioning the possibility of "playing again for a charitable cause" or even "a tour" in various interviews in the last few years. He also stated in 2006 that Pink Floyd have not officially disbanded yet.
Unlike the other members of Pink Floyd, Mason has rarely played an instrument other than his drum kit, although he has contributed sound effects to many Pink Floyd albums. He has only ever played non-percussive instruments on "The Grand Vizier's Garden Party", his personal composition from Ummagumma, where he provided some keyboard, guitar and bass noises, and on live versions of "Outside the Wall", where he played acoustic guitar along with the rest of the band. However, on the Profiles album Mason released with Rick Fenn in 1985, he is also credited with keyboards. He can be seen playing a vibraphone in the promo video for "Lie for a Lie", but it is unknown if he actually played on the recording. Also, he has said that he took some failed piano and violin lessons as a child.
Mason has done some work with other people, notably as a drummer and producer for Steve Hillage, Robert Wyatt (with whom he appeared on Top of the Pops), The Damned and Gong. He also drummed for Michael Mantler.
Nick Mason used Premier drums in the 1960s and occasionally in the 1970s (mainly on recordings up to Wish You Were Here). After that, he used Ludwig drums from 1970 until 1992. He currently uses Drum Workshop (DW) drums, pedals and hardware. His kit is a DW double bass kit with the Dark Side of the Moon logo on the drums. He has also used Paiste cymbals during his entire career with Pink Floyd. He currently uses a mixture of Paiste Traditional, Signature and 2002 cymbals.
Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd, was published in the UK in October 2004. It is also available, abridged, as a 3CD audio book, read by Mason. An updated edition was published, in paperback, in 2011.
He performed in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games on 12 August 2012.

==Drumming style==

Influenced by jazz and big band music, Nick was a pioneer who embraced acoustic drums (both single and double headed), tuned percussion, electronic drums and Rototoms, melding all of these into a melodic whole. His snare drum sound shifted from harsh demarcation of beats 2 and 4 ("Careful with that Axe, Eugene") to a fatter and gentler timbre ("Echoes") — a change that reflected growing studio chops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lpmusic.com/Pros_That_Play_LP/Players_Roster/mason.html |title=Artists |publisher=Lpmusic.com |date=[/tpl]
His style was gentler and more laid back than other progressive rock drummers of the time. Mason soloed on a few Pink Floyd compositions including 'Nick's Boogie', 'A Saucerful of Secrets', 'The Grand Vizier's Garden Party', 'Up The Khyber' and 'Time'. Due to the dynamic live performances of Pink Floyd, Mason's style was more energetic and complex live, and can be heard on such albums as Ummagumma and Live at Pompeii.

==Non-musical ventures==

Mason is married to his second wife, Nettie, most famous for her adjudication role on the second series of Treasure Hunt in 1984.  They live in Hampstead, London; however, they often stay in the Wiltshire town of Corsham in the former home of Camilla Parker Bowles. He has four children: two daughters (Holly and Chloe) from his first marriage and two sons (Guy and Cary) from his second. Holly is married to sports car racer Marino Franchitti, the younger brother of multiple IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2069424/Pink-Floyd-family-values-Its-just-rioter-Charlie-Gilmour--rock-stars-EIGHTEEN-children-women.html|title=Pink Floyd family values: It's not just rioter Charlie Gilmour... how four rock stars had EIGHTEEN children by eight women|work=Mail Online|accessdate=20 December 2011|location=London|first=Alison|last=Boshoff|date=2011-12-03[/tpl]
As Pink Floyd's recording and touring schedule grew more sporadic, Mason was left with more time to pursue his favourite hobby: motor racing. He owns (through his company Ten Tenths) and races several classic cars, and has competed successfully at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. His collection has been a subject of his 1998 book, Into the Red, in which he documents his experience with his cars, along with some histories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tentenths.co.uk/www/index2.htm |title=Into the Red |publisher=Tentenths.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 October 2011[/tpl] He is also a qualified pilot, and flies an Aerospatiale AS 350 Squirrel helicopter in specially painted colours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.photographersdirect.com/buyers/stockphoto.asp?imageid=1010980 |title=Stock photography image of Mason of in his special painted Aerospatiale AS 350 helicopter |publisher=Photographersdirect.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2011[/tpl]
Mason was invited by Ferrari to purchase one of their 400 Enzos, which he let Jeremy Clarkson borrow for reviewing purposes on the BBC motoring programme Top Gear. Mason agreed, on the sole condition that throughout the review, Clarkson promoted the release of the book Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd. This led to Clarkson using Pink Floyd album titles in his description of the Enzo and The Stig driving round the track with "Another Brick in the Wall"[tpl]clarify|Which part was playing?  The three parts are generally never played back to back|date=August 2012[/tpl] playing (despite the fact that the Enzo does not come equipped with a stereo). Mason says that his favourite car of all time is the Ferrari 250 GTO, and owns one of the 39 built (valued between £16m and £30m).
His wealth amounts to £55 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2006–07.Sunday Times Rich List 2006–2007, A & C Black (ISBN 978-0-7136-7941-0)
