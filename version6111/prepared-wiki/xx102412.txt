Mikael Kaj Forssell (born 15 March 1981) is a Finnish footballer who plays as a striker[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14845940.stm |title=Leeds United sign striker Mikael Forssell for the season |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl] He is currently playing for HJK and for the Finnish national team.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.palloliitto.fi/maajoukkueet/miesten-maajoukkue/pelaajat/mikael-forssell | title = Mikael Forssell | language = Finnish | accessdate =11 June 2013 | publisher = Suomen Palloliitto (Football Association of Finland)[/tpl] .
Forssell began his professional career in 1997 for HJK, having progressed through the team's youth teams, but he only remained at the club for a single season, making 17 league appearances, before he moved to England to join Chelsea in 1998. He never broke into the Chelsea team (making 33 league appearances in seven years), and spent two loan spells at Crystal Palace, one at Borussia Mönchengladbach, and two at Birmingham City. He switched permanently to the latter club in 2005, but injury problems restricted him to 65 league appearances in three seasons. He joined German side Hannover 96 in July 2008 on a free transfer, but once again struggled with form and injury problems, and he left the club in 2011, having made 44 league appearances. 
This was followed by an unsuccessful season back in England, this time with Leeds United; 15 league games failed to yield a single goal. Forssell returned to current club HJK in October 2012.
Forssell made his full international debut for Finland in 1999, and has been a regular player for his country in almost every year since; the one exception being 2012, where he didn't make a single appearance. He has 86 caps for his country, and has scored 29 goals; making him the sixth most capped Finnish player, and his country's second highest goalscorer.

===Chelsea===

His goal-scoring form for Finland's youth teams made him a target for a host of Europe's top clubs, and in 1998, the 17-year-old striker was snapped up by Chelsea[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.eufo.de/index/squad/chelsea-fc/1998-99 |title=Chelsea FC squad 1998–1999 |publisher=en.eufo.de |accessdate=26 May 2012[/tpl] who at the time were managed by Gianluca Vialli.

===Birmingham City===

In the summer of 2005, Forssell joined Birmingham on a three-year deal for a fee of £3 million, after Chelsea decided that he did not figure in their long term plans. He struggled in the 2005–06 season, not having found his best form after his injury, and could not save Birmingham from relegation. Forssell suffered another cruel injury blow to his other knee during training in October 2006. This left him on the sidelines until he returned to training in February 2007 after undergoing operations on both knees. He remained at Birmingham to have another go at resurrecting his career.
His 2007–08 pre-season performances were good, he scored five goals in five games. His manager, Steve Bruce, was enthusiastic about his return to form. He continued his good form into the start of the season, scoring the opening goal of the match against Chelsea and consolidating his good form with two assists in the next three matches. He scored his first hat-trick at club level on 1 March 2008, in the 4–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, a so-called "perfect hat-trick" – one goal scored with the left foot, one with the right, and one with the head.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/birmingham/article3466741.ece |title=Mikael Forssell routs Spurs |work=The Sunday Times |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2008[/tpl] In his final season at Birmingham, he finished the season as their top scorer with nine goals as the club were relegated from the Premier League.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/05/16/birmingham-city-begin-contract-talks-with-mikael-forssell-97319-20922760/ |title=Birmingham City begin contract talks with Mikael Forssell |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]

===Hannover 96===

In May 2008, following the club's relegation from Premier League, Forssell signed a pre-contract agreement to join Hannover 96 on a free transfer when his Birmingham contract expired at the end of June. His contract with Hannover ran out at the end of the 2010–11 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blues.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~1321534,00.html |title=Alex wishes Forss well |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/7417549.stm |title=Forssell completes Hannover deal |date=30 May 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 May 2008[/tpl]
On his pre-season debut for Hannover, he scored 10 goals including an eight-minute hat-trick in one friendly game against amateurs FC Boffzen. The game ended up as a 23–0 win.[tpl]cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=554921&cc=5739 |title=Forssell scores 10 goals on Hannover debut.|publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl]

===Leeds United===

After leaving Hannover when his contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season, Forssell had trials with clubs including West Ham United[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110729/sam-ready-for-saturday_2236884_2405290 |title=Sam ready for Saturday |publisher=West Ham United F.C |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2011[/tpl] and Leeds United[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/leeds_united_forssell_has_his_trial_extended_by_grayson_1_3694976 |title=Forssell has his trial extended by Grayson |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] of the English Football League Championship (second tier). On 8 September he returned from international duty with Finland to sign a contract with Leeds until the end of the 2011–12 season. Forssell was handed the number 18 shirt and took his place on the bench two days later against his former club Crystal Palace. He came on as a second-half substitute to make his Leeds debut and assisted Ross McCormack for their winning goal in a 3–2 victory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20110910/crystal-palace-live_2247585_2446651 |title=McCormack seals United victory |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C |date=10 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl] He came on as a substitute against fierce rivals Manchester United in a 3–0 League Cup defeat.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20110920/carling-cup-live_2247585_2457062 |title=United slip out of Cup |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]
After mainly being used as a substitute and failing to score a single goal for Leeds, Forssell was told by Neil Warnock that his one-year contract wouldn't be renewed at the end of the 2011–12 season and that he would be released from the club at the expiry of his contract.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120502/eleven-told-they-can-go_2247585_2757295 |title=ELEVEN TOLD THEY CAN GO |publisher=LUFC |date= 2 May 2012 |accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl]

===Return to HJK===

On 29 October 2012, it was announced that Forssell would be returning to Finland after spending 14 years abroad, signing a two-year contract with his former club HJK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hjk.fi/uutiset/1-1331/Forssell+palaa+vahvistamaan+mestaria |title=Forssell palaa vahvistamaan mestaria |language=Finnish |publisher=HJK |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012[/tpl] On 22 April 2013, Forssell opened the scoring by a header, in a 2−0 away win over rivals Honka. He finished the season with 14 league goals, being the clubs best goalscorer as HJK won their fifth consecutive championship.
