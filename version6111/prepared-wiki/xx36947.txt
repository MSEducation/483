The waters of Haderslev Fjord cut into the municipality from the Little Belt, dividing the city north-to-south, and becoming Haderslev Dam, west of the city center. Årø Strait (Årøsund) separates the bulk of the municipality from the island of Årø, and the two are connected by ferry service between the town of Årøsund on the mainland and the town of Årø on the island.
