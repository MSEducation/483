[[Retrosplenial region]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy

The retrosplenial region is a brain area and part of the cingulate cortex. It is defined by Brodmann area 26, Brodmann area 29 and Brodmann area 30.

==Function==

The retrosplenial cortex has dense reciprocal projections with both the anterior thalamic nuclei and the hippocampus.  In humans, fMRI studies implicate the posterior cingulate region in the recall of episodic information.  The retrosplenial cortex is one of several brain areas that produce anterograde amnesia when damaged.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
