[[Street installation]]

CATEGORIES: Graffiti and unauthorised signage, Installation art, Street culture

Street installations are a form of street art. While conventional street art is done on walls and surfaces street installations use three-dimensional objects set in an urban environment. Like graffiti, it is generally non-permission based and the installation is effectively abandoned by the artist upon completion.  Street Installations sometimes have an interactive component.
