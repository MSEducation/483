The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the ships and resources of the separate colonial navies were integrated into a national force: the Commonwealth Naval Forces. Originally intended for local defence, the navy was granted the title of 'Royal Australian Navy' in 1911, and became increasingly responsible for defence of the region.
Britain's Royal Navy continued to support the RAN and provided additional blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to the early years of World War II. Then, rapid wartime expansion saw the acquisition of large surface vessels and the building of many smaller warships. In the decade following the war, the RAN acquired a small number of aircraft carriers, the last of these paying off in 1982.
Today, the RAN consists of 51 commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel. The navy is one of the largest and most sophisticated naval forces in the Pacific region, with a significant presence in the Indian Ocean and worldwide operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions. The current Chief of Navy is Vice Admiral Ray Griggs.[tpl]cite press release |title=Navy welcomes new Chief |publisher=Department of Defence |date=7 June 2011 |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=11937 |accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The Commonwealth Naval Forces were established on 1 March 1901, two months after the federation of Australia. On 10 July 1911, King George V granted the title of "Royal Australian Navy".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/feature-histories/ran-brief-history |title=The R.A.N. – A Brief History |last=Stevens |first=David |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
During World War I, the RAN was initially responsible for capturing many of Germany's South Pacific colonies and protecting Australian shipping from the German East Asia Squadron. Later in the war, most of the RAN's major ships operated as part of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean and North Seas.
During the 1920s and early 1930s, the RAN was drastically reduced in size. As international tensions increased, however, the RAN was modernised and expanded. Early in World War II, RAN ships again operated as part of the Royal Navy, many serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the West African coast, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the virtual destruction of the Royal Navy force in Asia, the RAN operated more independently, or as part of United States Navy forces. By war's end, the RAN was the fifth-largest navy in the world.
After World War II, the size of the RAN was again reduced, but it gained new capabilities with the delivery of two aircraft carriers. The RAN saw action in many Cold War–era conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region and operated alongside the Royal Navy and United States Navy off Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. Since the end of the Cold War, the RAN has been part of Coalition forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and has become a critical element in Australian operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.

==RAN today==

===Command structure===

The strategic command structure of the RAN was overhauled during the New Generation Navy changes.
The RAN is commanded through Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Canberra. The professional head is the Chief of Navy (CN), who holds the rank of Vice-Admiral. NHQ is responsible for implementing policy decisions handed down from the Department of Defence and for overseeing tactical and operational issues that are the purview of the subordinate commands.
Beneath NHQ are two subordinate commands:
Fleet Command was previously made up of seven Force Element Groups, but after the New Generation Navy changes, this was restructured into four Force Commands:[tpl]cite book |title=Australian Maritime Doctrine |page=124 |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/australian-maritime-doctrine[/tpl]

===Fleet===

As of January 2013, the RAN fleet consisted of 51 commissioned warships, including frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships. Ships commissioned into the RAN are given the prefix HMAS (His/Her Majesty's Australian Ship).
The RAN has two primary bases for its fleet:
In addition, three other bases are home to the majority of the RAN's minor war vessels:

====Current ships====

The RAN currently operates 51 commissioned vessels, made up of eight ship classes, and four individual ships plus two non-commissioned vessels.

===Aviation===

====Fleet Air Arm====

The Fleet Air Arm (previously known as the Australian Navy Aviation Group) provides the RAN's aviation capability. As of 2013, the FAA consists of three active squadrons plus a fourth being activated, operating five helicopter types in the anti-submarine warfare and maritime support roles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/about/organisation/fleet-air-arm |title=Fleet Air Arm |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] The Fleet Air Arm is based at [tpl]HMAS|Albatross|air station|6[/tpl] in Nowra, New South Wales, and operates from the RAN's frigates, large amphibious warfare vessels, and large support ships.

====LADS Flight====

In addition to the helicopter squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm, the RAN operates an additional flying unit that comes under the operational responsibility of the Australian Hydrographic Service. The Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight contains the sole remaining fixed-wing aircraft operated by the RAN, and is based at [tpl]HMAS|Cairns|naval base|6[/tpl] in Cairns, Queensland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/fleet/aircraft/laser-airborne-depth-sounder|title=Laser Airborne Depth Sounder|publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl]

===Clearance Diving Teams===

The RAN has two Clearance Diving Teams that serve as parent units for naval clearance divers:
When RAN personnel are sent into combat, Clearance Diving Team Three (AUSCDT THREE) is formed.
The CDTs have two primary roles:

==Future==

There are currently several major projects underway that will see upgrades to RAN capabilities:
To boost the RAN's amphibious capability until the arrival of the Canberra-class LHDs, the RAN acquired [tpl]HMAS|Choules|L100|6[/tpl] (a former Bay class landing ship of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary) in December 2011, and the support vessel [tpl]Ship|ADV|Ocean Shield[/tpl] in June 2012.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-13/hmas-choules-to-be-commissioned/3727686 |title=HMAS Choules commissioned in honour of veteran |work=ABC News |date=13 December 2011 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=Ocean Shield the Navy's newest humanitarian and disaster relief vessel |publisher=Offices of the Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Materiel |date=3 June 2012 |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2012/06/03/minister-for-defence-stephen-smith-and-minister-for-defence-materiel-jason-clare-joint-media-release-ocean-shield-the-navys-newest-humanitarian-and-disaster-relief-vessel/ |accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl]

==Current operations==

The RAN currently has forces deployed on one major operation:http://www.navy.gov.au/navy-today/operations[tpl]verification needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Personnel==

As of June 2011, the RAN has 14,215 permanent full-time personnel, 161 gap year personnel, and 2,150 reserve personnel.[tpl]Cite book|title=Portfolio Budget Statements 2011–12: Defence Portfolio|year=2011|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |isbn=978-0-642-29739-6 |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/11-12/pbs/2011-2012_Defence_PBS_Complete.pdf |author=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|page=39[/tpl] The permanent full-time force consisted of 3,357 commissioned officers, and 10,697 enlisted personnel. In June 2010, male personnel made up 82% of the permanent full-time force, while female personnel made up 18%.Defence Annual Report 2009-2010, Appendix 7, Table A7.3 The RAN has the highest percentage of women in the ADF, compared to the RAAF's 17.8% and the Army's 9.7%.
The following are the current senior Royal Australian Navy Officers:
The RAN needs 2,000 recruits, including 700 apprentices,[tpl]cite book|title=Defence White Paper 2009|page=114[/tpl] to crew the next generation of warships, such as air warfare destroyers, which enter service next decade. To overcome a lack of Australian recruits, the RAN began to recruit sailors who have been laid off from other western navies.[tpl]cite news |last=Stewart |first=Cameron |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/laid-off-british-sailors-to-grab-ran-positions/story-fn59niix-1226267186673 |title=Laid-off British sailors to grab RAN positions |work=The Australian |date=10 February 201[/tpl]

==Ranks and uniforms==

The uniforms of the Royal Australian Navy are very similar in cut, colour and insignia to their British Royal Navy forerunners.  However, beginning with the Second World War all RAN personnel began wearing shoulder flashes reading Australia, a practice continuing today.  These are cloth arcs at shoulder height on uniforms, metallic gold on officers' shoulder boards, and embroidered on shoulder slip-ons.

===Commissioned officers===

Commissioned officers of the Australian Navy have pay grades ranging from S-1 to O-11. The only O-11 position in the navy is honorary and has only ever been held by royalty, currently being held by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh. The highest position occupied in the current Royal Australian Navy structure is O-9, a Vice Admiral who serves as the Chief of the Navy. O-8 (Rear Admiral) to O-11 (Admiral of the Fleet) are referred to as flag officers, O-5 (Commander) and above are referred to as senior officers, while S-1 (Midshipman) to O-4 (Lieutenant-Commander) are referred to as junior officers. All officers of the Navy receive a commission from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia.  The Commissioning Scroll issued in recognition of the commission is signed by the Governor General of Australia as Commander-in-Chief and the serving Minister for Defence.
Naval officers are trained at the Royal Australian Naval College (HMAS Creswell) in Jervis Bay, New South Wales and the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.

===Other ranks===

===Chaplains===

Royal Australian Navy (RAN) chaplains are commissioned officers and wear the uniform of a RAN officer. Like chaplains in the Royal Navy (RN), they do not wear rank insignia, but instead wear epaulettes with a cross-and-anchor insignia. Like other chaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF), Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Australian Navy chaplains are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as Commander (equivalent of Lieutenant Colonel in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equivalent of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are "Principal Chaplains," and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant, are accorded the rank and status of Commodore (equivalent of Brigadier). Principal Chaplains' uniforms do not differ from other Navy chaplains however they do wear gold braid on the peak of their caps. The title "Padre" for chaplains is less common in the Royal Australian Navy, than in the Australian Army, although it is known to be used by many sailors and some Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of "Chaplain", or other formal forms of address towards an officer such as "Sir."[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

==Special insignia==

The Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N) is an appointment held by the most senior sailor in the RAN, and holds the rank of Warrant Officer (WO). However, heTo date, all Warrant Officers of the Navy have been males. does not wear the WO rank insignia; instead, he wears the special insignia of the appointment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/about/senior-leadership-group |title=Defence Leaders: Navy |publisher=www.defence.gov.au |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] The WO-N appointment has similar equivalent appointments in the other services, each holding the rank of Warrant Office, each being the most senior sailor/soldier/airman in that service, and each wearing their own special insignia rather than their rank insignia. The Australian army equivalent is the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Leaders/Regimental-Sergeant-Major-Army |title=Regimental Sergeant Major – Army |publisher=www.army.gov.au[/tpl] and the Royal Australian Air Force equivalent is the Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/leaders/woff-af.aspx |title=Warrant Officer of the Air Force |publisher=www.airforce.gov.au[/tpl]
