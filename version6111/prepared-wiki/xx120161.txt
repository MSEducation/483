Stephen de Pa (â€  1386) was Prior and, briefly, Bishop-elect of St. Andrews. He was elected to succeed William de Landallis after the latter's death on 23 September 1385. He was never consecrated, because while on his way to continental Europe  to receive confirmation and consecration by the Pope, carrying a commendation from King Robert II of Scotland and a decree of the election, he was captured by English pirates. He was kept prisoner in England while his captors demanded a ransom. Stephen however did not want his church burdened with such a payment, and chose to remain in that country. Moreover, he had caught ill soon after his capture, and died at Alnwick on 2 March 1386.
