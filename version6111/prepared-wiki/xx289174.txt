Palm Springs General Hospital, Inc. is a 247 bed acute care hospital located in Hialeah, Florida and has grown to be one of the largest private hospitals in Florida. The hospital offers a wide array of services. Services include orthopedics, (hips, knees, shoulders) cardiac implants, pacemakers, and other major spinal procedures. Other services include Interventional radiological procedures including the less invasive, Endovascular aneurysm repair of abdominal aortic aneuryisms (AAA) which requires a short inpatient stay as compared to the traditional open surgery which requires at least an 8-10-day recovery."Palm Springs General Hospital, Inc."

==History==

In 1965, the hospital opened in what was then the rural outskirts of Hialeah in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida. As dramatic growth elevated Hialeah to the eight largest city in the State of Florida, Palm Springs General Hospital has grown to be one of the largest privately owned hospitals in the state. Due to the rapid influx of Hispanic-Americans, the hospital became largely bilingual in both Spanish and English as well as Haitian Creole."Palm Springs General Hospital, Inc."
Over the years, Palm Springs General Hospital has been through new renovations and construction. In 1995, a complete renovation was undertaken of the Intensive Care Unit, and in 2004 a 24 bed Emergency Department was built alongside the hospital. Over time, its Outpatient Services and GI Departments were expanded, and a Laparoscopic Surgery Center was opened. In 2013 a Cardiac Catheterization Unit was opened."Palm Springs General Hospital, Inc."
