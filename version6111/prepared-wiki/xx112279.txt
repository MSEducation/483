The Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Stairs, also known as the Stairway to Heaven or Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Ladder, is a steep hiking trail on the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://friendsofhaikustairs.org/ |title=THE FRIENDS OF HAIKU STAIRS (archive.org) |publisher=Friendsofhaikustairs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080420111816/http://friendsofhaikustairs.org/ |archivedate = 2008-04-20[/tpl]
The trail began as a wooden ladder spiked to the cliff on the south side of the Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley.  It was installed in 1942 to enable  antenna cables to be strung from one side of the cliffs above Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley to the other.  A building to provide a continuous communication link between Wahiawā and Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley Naval Radio Station was constructed at the peak of Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]ukeahiakahoe, elevation about [tpl]convert|2800|ft|m[/tpl]. The antennae transmitted very low frequency radio signals from a 200,000-watt Alexanderson alternator in the center of Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū valley.  The signals could reach US Navy submarines as far away as Tokyo Bay while the submarines were submerged.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.haikuvalley.com/History/HIGH-SCALERS-OF-HAIKUBILL/2043841_ADiaP#110678032_jzzCn |last=Woodbury |first=David |title=High Scalers of Haiku |newspaper=Denver Post |year=1950 |quote=Thousands of lives, millions of dollars' worth of equipment hinged on the audacity of Bill Adams and Louis Otto |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Woodbury |first=David |title=Builders for Battle |chapter=Fighting Men on a Flying Trapeze |pages=353–370 |publisher=E.

When the Naval base was decommissioned in the 1950s, the United States Coast Guard used the site for an Omega Navigation System station.  In the mid-1950s, the wooden stairs were replaced by sections of metal steps and ramps — by one count, 3,922 steps.  The station and trail were closed to the public in 1987. Some hikers ignore the No Trespassing signs and continue to climb, contributing to the local community's misgivings about reopening the structure.
In 2003, the stairs were repaired, costing the city $875,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/attractions/stairwaytoheaven.php |title=Stairway to Heaven, Oahu |publisher=To-hawaii.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] As of early 2012, land usage rights issues have not been resolved. The City and County of Honolulu has stated that there is currently no plan to open the stairs for public use, citing liability concerns. Dozens of people, however, routinely hike up the stairs every day. As recently as early December, 2013, a guard had been posted at the base of the stairs; however, the guard frequently had not been there in the early months of 2014 and a small tent which had been erected for the guard to use had been dismantled in early February, 2014. As of early April 2014, the guard has been posted but didn't seem too concerned with stopping any hikers.
