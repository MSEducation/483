Tick Bite is a small unincorporated community on the Contentnea Creek near Grifton in Lenoir County, North Carolina, United States.  The only business in the community is a quarry.
Tick Bite was decimated by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Contentnea Creek, which runs parallel to much of the town, before emptying into the Neuse River, surged to levels that had not been seen (estimated by county and state officials) in 500 years. The flooding set a new "500 year flood plain" for the area.
