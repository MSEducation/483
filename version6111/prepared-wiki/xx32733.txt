On September 27, 1821, after three centuries of Spanish rule, Mexico gained its independence. The Treaty of Córdoba recognized part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain as an Independent Empire, which was recognized as "Monarchist, constitutional and moderate."[tpl]cite web |title=24 de agosto de 1821. Se firman los tratados de Córdoba|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1055:24-de-agosto-de-1821-se-firman-los-tratados-de-cordoba&catid=120:agosto&Itemid=221 |publisher=Gobierno Federal |accessdate= October 5, 2010[/tpl] The new country took the name of Mexican Empire. The morning after the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City on September 28, 1821, Agustín de Iturbide ordered the Supreme Provisional Governmental Junta (September 1821-February 1822) to meet to elect a president of the Imperial Regency and to issue a declaration of independence for the new nation. Iturbide was elected president of the Regency, and that afternoon the members of the Regency and the Supreme Junta signed the Declaration.
A minority of the Constituent Congress, looking for stability, elected Agustín de Iturbide as emperor. On July 21, 1822, Iturbide was crowned Emperor of Mexico.[tpl]cite web |title= 21 de julio de 1822.

The deputies were imprisoned just for expressing their opinions and finally, Iturbide decided to dissolve the Congress and establish instead a National Board.[tpl]cite web |title=La Transición del Imperio a la Republica (1821-1823) |url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html#nf41|publisher=Estudios de Historia Moderna y Contemporánea de México|accessdate=October 5, 2010[/tpl]
The lack of a legitimate legislature, the illegitimacy of the Emperor and the absence of real solutions to the nation's problems increased revolutionary activity.[tpl]cite book |last=Suárez y Navarro |first=Juan  |title=Historia de México y del general Antonio López de Santa Anna |year=1850 |location=México |page=23[/tpl] Antonio López de Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata, to which later joined Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo. Iturbide was forced to reestablish the Congress and in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated the crown of the Empire on March 19, 1823.[tpl]cite news | title=La Transicion del Imperio a la Republica o la Participacion Indiscriminada | url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html| language =Spanish[/tpl]
However, the Congress nullified the designation of Iturbide and therefore the recognition of the abdication and made the coronation of Iturbide seem a logical mistake in consummation of Independence.
The dissolution of the Empire was the first political realignment of independent Mexico.
