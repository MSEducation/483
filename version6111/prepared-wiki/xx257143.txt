Tropical Cyclone Tasha was a short-lived, but devastating tropical cyclone that exacerbated widespread floods in Queensland, Australia during the 2010 Christmas holiday.

==Meteorological history==

Tropical Cyclone Tasha was first identified on 24 December 2010 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) as a weak area of low pressure accompanied by increasing deep convection. At the surface, the structure of the storm's circulation was uncertain as feeder bands provided a clear indication of its centre; however, the lack of westerly winds at the surface refuted this. Situated roughly [tpl]convert|370|km|mi[/tpl] east-northeast of Cairns, Queensland, favourable environmental conditions, such as low wind shear, would allow for further development of the low.[tpl]cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Centre|publisher=United States Navy|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|title=Significant Tropical Weather Outlook for the Western and South Pacific Oceans|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDU6SLma[/tpl] Later on 24 December, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low.[tpl]cite web|work=Queensland Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Advice Number One|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDcjJyvF[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, the system rapidly consolidated as deep convection formed around a well-defined low-level circulation. This prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they anticipated the system to intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24 hours.[tpl]cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Centre|publisher=United States Navy|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDccONR3[/tpl] At 16:00 UTC, the BOM upgraded the low to a Category 1 cyclone, assigning with the name Tasha.[tpl]cite web|work=Queensland Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Advice Two|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDdxV8rH[/tpl]
Within hours of the BoM declaring Tasha a tropical cyclone, the JTWC followed suit and issued their first advisory on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 04P. Situated along the northwestern edge of a subtropical ridge, Tasha tracked southwestward towards Queensland, Australia and intensified.[tpl]cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Centre|publisher=United States Navy|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=27 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone 04P (Tasha) Advisory 001|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDu4oDrr[/tpl] The storm attained its peak intensity on 24 December with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a barometric pressure of 993 mbar (hPa; 29.32 inHg).[tpl]cite web|work=Queensland Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=24 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Technical Bulletin 1853 UTC 24 December 2010|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDuC1guB[/tpl] Hours later, the centre of Tasha made landfall between Cairns and Innisfail at this intensity.[tpl]cite web|work=Queensland Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Advice Number Three|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vDruTwg6[/tpl] Later that day, the BOM issued their final advisory on Tasha as it weakened to a tropical low over Queensland;[tpl]cite web|work=Queensland Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Advice Four|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vE8130pz[/tpl] the JTWC followed suit shortly thereafter.[tpl]cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Centre|publisher=United States Navy|date=25 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Tropical Cyclone 04P (Tasha) Advisory 002|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vFC4La8M[/tpl] The remnants of Tasha persisted in the region for several more days, bringing heavy rains to much of Queensland.

==Impact and aftermath==

Following the Bureau of Meteorology's first advice for the tropical low on 24 December, a cyclone warning was declared for areas between Port Douglas and Lucinda, Queensland. Some parts of Queensland were already suffering from flooding and additional rainfall was expected to worsen the situation.
Although a relatively weak storm, Tasha produced widespread torrential rains in Queensland, amounting to more than [tpl]convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in some areas. Thousands of hectares of cropland were inundated by floods and many towns and cities were underwater. In Theodore, much of the area was flooded after the Dawson River reached its highest level in 50 years, cresting around [tpl]convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. This surpassed the previous record by more than [tpl]convert|50|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=BBC News|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Australians evacuate flood-hit Queensland towns|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vJsxa25f[/tpl] Efforts to evacuate the entire town of 300 were made as water levels continued to rise. Thousands of people were evacuated by local authorities using military helicopters.[tpl]cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=RTT News|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Flooding Forces Mass Evacuations In Australia |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vJsSiZ2J[/tpl] The town of Ingham was isolated as the Herbert River reached a level of [tpl]convert|12.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|author=Josh Robertson, Andrew MacDonald and Peter Michael |work=The Courier-Mail|publisher=The Australian National News|date=27 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Cyclone Tasha leaves Queensland waterlogged and facing $1b damages bill|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vJrg9l3S[/tpl] The town of Dalby was split in two by the swollen Myall Creek, leaving more than 100 homes flooded.[tpl]cite web|author=Australian Associated Press|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=More Qld evacuations as floods rage on |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vJtlAWEQ[/tpl] One fatality took place in Mareeba, near where Tasha made landfall, where a man drowned after being swept off a footbridge.http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/man-found-dead-in-flooded-creek-20101230-19aga.html
Areas as far south as Brisbane were affected by Tasha. There, roughly 1,100 emergency calls for help were made as hundreds of drivers became trapped on flooded roads.[tpl]cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=New Tang Dynasty Television|date=27 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=Cyclone Tasha Causes Major Flooding in the Australian State of Queensland|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vgeV7Rja[/tpl] In New South Wales, 175 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as the flooding spread south. An additional 800 people were isolated in the towns of Urbenville and Bonalbo on 28 December as flood waters blocked off roads.
By 28 December, nearly half of Queensland was flooded and preliminary damage estimates exceeded A$1.4 billion. Total economic losses also reached A$6 billion, roughly 0.5% of the nation's gross domestic product.[tpl]cite web|author=David Uren and Andrew Fraser |publisher=The Australian|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Floods deal $6bn blow to economy as 1000 evacuated in Queensland deluge|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vJtOURCc[/tpl] In response to the severe flooding, the Government of Queensland declared numerous towns as disaster areas, allowing for federal funds to be used. By 27 December, flood waters began to recede in Babinda and Gordonvale, leaving behind debris and thick black mud. The following day, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that additional Blackhawk helicopters would be sent to assist in evacuation efforts.
