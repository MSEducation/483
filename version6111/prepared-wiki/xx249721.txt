==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. wrote of the album; "These songs are brought to fullness by simple arrangements and a straightforward production... The only snag on B-Sides and Confessions is that most of the songs are fairly slow paced, which causes the last two-thirds of the album to blend together. The album nonetheless succeeds in offering a singer-songwriter effort that doesn't fall into the usual singer-songwriter clich√©s."
