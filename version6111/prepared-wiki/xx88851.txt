In the same election, there was a provincial referendum on whether to change from first-past-the-post to mixed member proportional representation, as recommended by the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform. This measure failed, with 37% of the participating electorate and 5 out of 107 ridings voting for the new system; a 60% supermajority was required province-wide, with at least half the ridings also supporting it by a simple majority.

==Strategies==

===Liberal===

Until just weeks before the election, the governing Liberal Party planned to run primarily on its record. The idea, advocated most often by campaign chair Greg Sorbara, was to go to the people with the achievements of the previous four years and a message of good government. In the summer before the election, a subset of the campaign team began promoting the idea of polarizing the election around Progressive Conservative leader John Tory's proposal to fund religious education, increase the role for the private sector in health care and reduce environmental protections. This view won out, and the Liberals determined their best strategy was to polarize the election into a referendum on public vs private. This would marginalize the NDP, while containing the threat from the right. It also had the added benefit of increasing the negatives for Tory, who had been enjoying positive media coverage for the most part in the build up to the campaign[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl].

===PC===

The Progressive Conservative Party (PC) plan was to attempt to polarize the election around leadership, using the advantage of John Tory's high net positive public opinion ratings to turn the election into a referendum on the performance of Premier Dalton McGuinty. From the name of the platform to the campaign graphics, Tory was the new PC Party brand. Due to the involvement of a high number of veterans of the 1988 federal election, there was considerable hope invested in a "bomb the bridge" strategy aimed at the perceived weak link in Liberal support. As John Turner had proven vulnerable to direct attack in 1988, the PCs hoped McGuinty would prove similarly vulnerable in 2007 Ontario.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]

===NDP===

The Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) was focused on directly confronting the phenomenon of "strategic voting" which had seen NDP support fall in each of the three previous elections. They hoped that the election of a Liberal government would reduce the growing tendency of the electorate to polarize between the PCs and Liberals. By emphasizing populist issues like MPP pay increases, the NDP hoped to push down support for the Liberals generally, push voters to either opposition party and gain seats in those areas where the NDP was the logical non-Liberal vote[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl].

==Issues==

Although all four parties released a variety of detailed platform proposals, the campaign was dominated almost entirely by John Tory's promise to extend public funding to Ontario’s faith-based schools.Caroline Alphonso, Ontario campaign starts with verbal attacks, September 10, 2007
In Ontario at present, the Catholic school system is fully funded in the same manner as public schools. However, other religious schools, such as Jewish, Muslim or Evangelical Christian schools, are not funded by the province. This discrepancy has been cited as discriminatory by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the United Nations Human Rights Committee, although to date the province has taken no action to change its existing school funding policies, on the grounds that Catholic school funding in the province is mandated by the Constitution of Canada.
Tory's proposal to extend funding to religious schools was controversial, with polls confirming that a clear majority of Ontarians opposed the proposal.  Even some of Tory's own caucus, most notably Bill Murdoch and Garfield Dunlop, openly criticized the proposal during the election campaign. After heavy opposition, Tory changed his position later in the campaign, promising a free vote on the issue.Progressive Conservatives to soften position on faith-based schools: report
The Liberals and the NDP were both opposed to non-Catholic religious school funding, while the Green Party proposed eliminating the province's existing Catholic school funding in favour of a single public school board.
There was a brief flurry of interest in health care issues when John Tory emphasized his support for an increasing role for the private sector in health care.
In the final week of the campaign, NDP leader Howard Hampton criticized the media for focusing almost entirely on religious schools and virtually ignoring other issues.

==Ridings==

With the passing of Bill 214 and the Representation Act, 2005 in 2005, Ontario’s electoral boundaries are no longer identical to the federal electoral boundaries.[ref]
</ref> The province is now divided into 11 northern electoral districts that are identical, except for a minor boundary adjustment, to the ones that existed on October 2, 2003, and 96 southern electoral districts that are identical to their federal counterparts as they existed on September 1, 2004.<ref name="new boundary"/>
The 11 northern electoral districts are: Algoma—Manitoulin, Kenora—Rainy River, Nickel Belt, Nipissing, Parry Sound—Muskoka, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Thunder Bay—Atikokan, Thunder Bay—Superior North, Timiskaming—Cochrane, and Timmins—James Bay.
As a result of the redistribution, none of the three major parties took fewer seats than it held at the dissolution of the previous legislature. The Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives each gained seats, while the New Democratic Party's seat total remained unchanged.
