Hayes Pillars (April 30, 1906, North Little Rock, Arkansas - August 11, 1992, Richmond Heights, Missouri) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and bandleader.
Pillars played locally in Little Rock and Jackson, Tennessee before joining the territory band of Alphonso Trent in 1927-28. Following this he co-led the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra, an ensemble which featured a large number of noted jazz sidemen over the course of its existence.
Following his time in Jeter-Pillars, Pillars became a mainstay of the St. Louis, Missouri jazz scene, working there from the 1950s into the 1980s.
