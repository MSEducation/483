Schtonk! (1992) is a satirical German film, retelling the hoax of the Hitler Diaries.
Subtitled Der Film zum Buch vom Führer ("The film accompanying the Führer's book"), the film is a grotesque farce about the events when, in 1983, German Stern magazine began to publish, with great fanfare, the 60 volumes of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler – which two weeks later turned out to be entirely fake.
The film is widely considered a hilarious tale, making fun not only of the events and characters who were involved in the hoax, and who are only thinly disguised in the film, but also of the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.
The film is co-written and directed by Helmut Dietl and, among his many respected comedies, is frequently considered his best. Dietl researched the scandal for two years and has been quoted as having to leave out several real events from the film because they were too outrageous.
The title is a bow to Charlie Chaplin's classic The Great Dictator, in which the Führer repeatedly uses "Schtonk!" as an expression of disgust – the word has no meaning in German but resembles Stunk (pronounced as shtoonk), a colloquial expression for a scuffle or altercation.

==Plot==

Fritz Knobel (the film's alter-ego of real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. So he sells a portrait of Eva Braun and one volume of Hitler's alleged diaries to factory owner Karl Lenz. Lenz presents this on a "birthday party to the Führer" to his guests, among them sleazy journalist Hermann Willié. Willié is working for the magazine "HH press" (real-world Stern magazine is located in Hamburg, which is abbreviated "HH" on German car license plates; "HH" is pronounced "haha", but is also an abbreviation of "heil Hitler"). In the events Knobel writes down according to what happens around him; after he meets his later lover Martha, she becomes his inspiration for Eva Braun. As he then comes under increasing stress, having to deliver the remaining volumes that he had already sold, he turns more and more into a mock image of Hitler himself.
