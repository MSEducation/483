John Christopher Pratt CC (born 9 December 1935) is a Canadian painter and printmaker.
Christopher Pratt first started painting watercolours in 1952. In 1953 he attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick as a student in pre-medicine. At Mount Allison he quickly became interested in Fine Arts, especially painting. He was encouraged to paint by Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville. Pratt met his future wife at Mount Allison, artist Mary West.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/pratt.html |publisher=cbc.ca |title=Life and Times [/tpl] They married in 1957, and have 4 children: John, Barbara, Anne and Edwin. He and Mary separated in 1990. 
From 1957-1959 Pratt studied at the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. During the summers, he returned to Newfoundland to work as a construction surveyor at the American Naval Base at Argentia. The training he received in precise measuring was applied to his paintings. In 1959 Pratt returned to Mount Allison University to complete in 1961 a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. During this period he began to make silkscreen prints. The early screen print Boat in Sand, 1961 in the National Gallery’s collection was produced at this time and included in the Gallery’s fourth Biennial Exhibition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=4433|publisher=National Gallery of Canada| title=Christopher Pratt| accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]

He remained at the gallery for two and a half years before deciding to concentrate on his painting full-time, moving his family to Salmonier, Newfoundland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/arts/agnl/cpratt.html |title=AGNL |publisher=heritage.nf.ca |title=Christopher Pratt[/tpl]
