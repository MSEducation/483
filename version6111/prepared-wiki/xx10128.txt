[[Transport in Romania]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Romania

As a densely populated country in a central location in Central-Southeastern Europe and with a developed economy, Romania has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure.
Transportation infrastructure in Romania is the property of the state, and is administered by the Ministry of Transports, Constructions and Tourism, except when operated as a concession, in which case the concessions are made by the Ministry of Administration and Interior.Romania : transport worldbank.org
The country's most important waterway is the river Danube. The largest port is that of Constanta. Bucharest Airport is a major international airport and European transportation hub. Air travel is used for greater distances within Romania but faces competition from the state-owned CFR's rail network. Public transport is available in most areas.

==History==

Romania has a system of large, navigable rivers, such as the Danube, Olt and Mureș that cross the country.
The first important human improvements were the Roman roads linking major settlements and providing quick passage for marching armies.

==Railway transport==

A fast growing number of Romania's major cities have modern tram or light rail networks, including Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca Oradea. Recently the tram has seen a very big revival with many experiments such as ground level power supply in Oradea.

==Roads and automotive transport==

According to CIA Factbook, Romania total road network is estimated to be 198,817 km long, out of which 60,043 km are paved and 138,774 km (2004) are unpaved.The CIA world factbook :Romania www.cia.gov The World Bank estimates that the road network that is outside of cities and communes (i.e. excluding streets and village roads) is about 78,000 km long.

===Motorways===

As of July 2013, there are 549 km of motorway in use and 144 km under construction, with an estimated timetable in between 2013 and 2016. Currently under construction is A1 Motorway part of the Pan European IV Corridor. Also under construction are parts of A3 - Autostrada Transilvania, which is the largest motorway project in Europe with a length of 588 km from Bucharest to Oradea (near the Hungarian border). This project is expected to be completed by 2018.This project has been renegotiated with Bechtel which will finish a remaining 64 km that were started. The rest will be reauctioned and as a result of renegotiations with the EU, the remaining segments will receive funds from the EU. This is due to the cancelation of the Bechtel contract which was extremely expensive. 
Timişoara–Arad (32 km) and Arad's ring-road (12 km), part of the A1 motorway (Bucharest–Nădlac) are another projects completed in 2011.In the same year, half of Constanța's ring-road was ready.http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/autostrada-spre-litoral-este-de-20-de-ani-in-constructie-dar-va-fi-finalizata-abia-in-2011-5275732/
In order to complete another 100 km of motorway by end of 2010, Romanian Government struggled to allocate the necessary funds for 55 km motorway, part of the Bucharest–Ploieşti motorway (from a total of 62 km). The newest motorways that have been opened are Sibiu ring road (17,5 km) and another 27.4 km from Autostrada Transilvania.

Bucharest is known to be the only city in Romania which as of 2009 has an underground railway system, comprising both the Bucharest Metro and  the light rail system  Regia Autonomă de Transport București.
