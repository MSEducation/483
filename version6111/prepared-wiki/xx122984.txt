Anthea Kym "Kym" Karath (born August 4, 1958 in Los Angeles, California, U.S.) is an American actress, best known for her role as Gretl in The Sound of Music.

==Career==

Karath started her career at the age of three, appearing in Spencer's Mountain with Henry Fonda and Veronica Cartwright in 1963 (she would subsequently work with Veronica's younger sister Angela Cartwright in The Sound of Music).  Also in 1963, she was seen in The Thrill of It All with Doris Day and James Garner.  In 1964, she was seen in  Good Neighbor Sam with Jack Lemmon.
Karath is best remembered for her role in The Sound of Music, where she played the youngest child,  Gretl Von Trapp.
During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Julie Andrews was asked about working with the Von Trapp children. She replied, "They were all lovely. However, the youngest one (Karath) was probably the most difficult for me, because she was just a tad heavy in those days. Today, she is this amazing gorgeous looking Monroe-esque young lady."
After The Sound of Music Karath primarily appeared in American television, including appearances in Family Affair, The Brady Bunch and Lost in Space. She remains friends with the other 'Von Trapp' children today, and in 2000 she went back to Salzburg with them, filming a documentary about the making of the film.
She is still currently working with them in new upcoming films.

Karath has said she still is not fond of the water after nearly drowning in the boat scene in The Sound of Music, as she could not swim.
