[[Bugey Nuclear Power Plant]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear power stations in France, Buildings and structures in Ain

The Bugey Nuclear Power Station is located in Bugey in the Saint-Vulbas commune (Ain), about 30 km from the Swiss border.  The site occupies 100 hectares.  It is on the edge of the Rhône River, from where it gets its cooling water, and is about 30 km upstream from Lyon.  About 1,200 people work at the site.
The site houses 4 currently operating units, all being pressurized water reactors. The 5th reactor (unit 1) is currently being dismantled. It was the last UNGG reactor built in the world. 
Some of the cooling comes from direct use of the Rhône water (units 2 and 3) while some is done by the use of cooling towers (units 4 and 5).

==Seismic activity==

According to reports from the Autorité de sûreté nucléaire,The French Nuclear Safety Authority [tpl]en icon[/tpl] some safety functions may not be provided in the event of an earthquake. The area is not known for its seismic activity.
In the last few years, the plant was modernized to updated earthquake resistance standards.

==Heat dumping==

During the heat wave on July 20, 2003 waste heat water was piped into the Rhône, which is permitted in extreme cases, for about 2 hours and the maximum heat difference was 0.9 degrees Celsius.  Again on July 30, 2003 water was directly discharged into the Rhône for 9 hours.
