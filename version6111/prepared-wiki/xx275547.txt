The South African Class GK 2-6-2+2-6-2 of 1923 is a South African steam locomotive from the 
South African Railways era.
In 1923 the New Cape Central Railway placed two Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 "Double Prairie" wheel arrangement in service. In 1925, when the New Cape Central Railway was amalgamated into the South African Railways, the two Garratts were renumbered and designated [tpl]nowrap|Class GK[/tpl].

==New Cape Central Railway==

The New Cape Central Railway (NCCR) was an independent privately owned common carrier that operated between Worcester and Mosselbaai. It was formed in January 1893 when it purchased all the assets of the bankrupted Cape Central Railway (CCR), who had constructed a line from Worcester via Robertson to Roodewal, later renamed Ashton.
In 1894 the NCCR began work to extend the line to Swellendam. From there it continued via Heidelberg to Riversdale, which was reached on 3 December 1903. Mosselbaai was reached in 1904.
Unlike many other privately owned railways in South Africa, the NCCR prospered and was well and efficiently run. It was the last component railway to be added to the South African Railways (SAR) when it was amalgamated in May 1925. All the NCCR locomotives that came onto the SAR roster continued to give good service for many years.

==Manufacturer==

Increasing traffic and heavier loads led to the decision by the NCCR to place an order for two Garratt 2-6-2+2-6-2 locomotives with Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1922. The locomotives were built to the design of the Class GB and were also superheated, with plate frames and Walschaerts valve gear, but heavier and with larger cylinders. They were delivered in 1923 and were initially numbered 12 and 13, later renumbered G1 and G2. The Garratts were to be the last new locomotives ordered by the company.

==Service==

In service on the NCCR, each Garratt could replace two of its older Class 7 locomotives, with one [tpl]convert|95|LT|t|0|abbr=off[/tpl] Garratt able to do the work of altogether [tpl]convert|166|LT|t|0|abbr=off[/tpl] worth of tender locomotives, while saving [tpl]convert|5|LT|t|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of coal and one crewâ€™s wages in the process.
When the NCCR was amalgamated into the SAR in 1925, the two Garratt locomotives were renumbered 2340 and 2341 on the SAR roster and reclassified to Class GK. 
The locomotives were then initially transferred to Cape Town and worked the Overberg line to Caledon for a brief period. They were then sent to Natal, where they remained in service on the Donnybrook to Underberg branch until they were withdrawn from service by 1957.
