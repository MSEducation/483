Robert Lee "Bobby" Hatfield (August 10, 1940 â€“ November 5, 2003) was an American singer, best known as one half of the Righteous Brothers.

==Early life==

Born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Hatfield moved with his family to Anaheim, California, when he was four. A 1958 graduate of Anaheim High School, he sang in the school choir and played baseball. He briefly considered signing as a professional ballplayer, but his passion for music led him to pursue a singing career while still attending high school. He eventually encountered his singing partner, Bill Medley, while attending California State University, Long Beach. Hatfield is an alumnus of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Career==

Hatfield and Medley began singing as a duo in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours.[tpl]cite news |title=Remembering a Blue-Eyed Soul Brother  |author=Mike Anton |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 12, 2003 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/12/local/me-righteous12/2[/tpl] They were often told they sounded like African-American gospel singers and named their singing act "The Righteous Brothers" after a fan remarked of their singing, "that's righteous, brothers."
Their first charted single as the Righteous Brothers was "Little Latin Lupe Lu" and their first #1 was "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'," produced by Phil Spector in 1964. Follow-up hits included the #1 "(You're My) Soul and Inspiration" and "Unchained Melody", the latter of which was actually a Hatfield solo performance that he recorded again after the success of the film Ghost, remarking to friends that he had not lost any of the high notes in his tenor range since the original recording, but had actually gained one note.  The duo broke up in 1968, but returned with another hit in 1974, the #3 "Rock and Roll Heaven." The duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2003 by Billy Joel.

==Personal life==

Hatfield had a short marriage with Joy Ciro, who appeared as a dancer on the T.A.M.I. Show and Where the Action Is. They had two children, Bobby, Jr. and Kalin.  Hatfield married Linda in 1979, and they remained married until his death; they had two children, Vallyn and Dustin.
