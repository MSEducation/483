===VCP and Russia===

During the initial takeover of BorsodChem (in 2001), VCP has been suspected of secretly acting on behalf of Russian Gazprom.Gazprom’s European Web[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] (see Gazprom's European Web), Roman Kupchinsky, The Jamestown Foundation, 18 February 2009. In the report Gazprom's European Web, published by the Soviet dissident think tank The Jamestown Foundation, the authors further criticize the transaction's complex arrangements and saying that "this intricate set of maneuvers should have alerted EU regulators to investigate what appeared to be an unusually complex series of deals."
