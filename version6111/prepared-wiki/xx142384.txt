==Synopsis==

The show was set in Passaic, New Jersey and was about the daily life of Billy Manucci, a young man who frequented the local disco club, Inferno, at night while working at an ice cream parlor called Tasty Treats during the day. Manucci was highly influenced by the disco craze and the movie Saturday Night Fever specifically.
Makin' It had the misfortune of coming to air near the end of the disco fad as backlash against the disco culture (such as the one portrayed in the show) was rising in the United States, culminating in Disco Demolition Night in the summer of 1979. As such, it lasted only eight weeks on air before being canceled.
Robert Stigwood, the producer of Saturday Night Fever as well as the Bee Gees' manager, was involved in the show's creation, as was Garry Marshall. The theme song, sung by David Naughton, reached #5 on the Billboard Top 40 charts in 1979.Billboard Top 40 Hits of 1979  It entered the Top 40 on May 12, nearly two months after the show had been canceled.  The song was also featured in the Bill Murray movie Meatballs.
