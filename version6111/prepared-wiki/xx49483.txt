At the 1904 Summer Olympics, nine swimming events were contested, all for men.  The 1904 swimming competition was the only time in Olympic history that racing distances were measured in yards.  The competition was held September 4–6, 1904.  There was a total of 32 participants from 5 countries competing.
The short sprint, at [tpl]convert|50|yd[/tpl], made its first Olympic appearance in 1904.  The 100 returned after not being contested in 1900.  The 1000 metres and 4000 metres were replaced with the much shorter [tpl]convert|440|yd[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|1|mi|m|sing=on[/tpl] events, making the 200 the only freestyle event to be held for the second time in a row.
The 200 metre backstroke was shortened to [tpl]convert|100|yd[/tpl] and the team swimming event was replaced with a 4×50 yard freestyle relay.  The obstacle course and underwater swimming events were eliminated, while breaststroke made its Olympic debut.
