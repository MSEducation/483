In 1906 the wealth of the builder declined, and the Castle was sold to an Italian Riding School.  in 1910 it became the Clifford Park Boys Prep School.  In 1941 it and a second property were set on fire to serve as beacons for German warplanes, allowing them to bomb the Clyde shipyards and escape.http://www.broomhallcastle.co.uk/hotel.html
It was left in ruins until 1985 when it was rebuilt and turned into a nursing home.
In 2003 it was purchased by the current owners who wished to turn it into a small hotel.  It is currently in use as a 10 bedroom hotel, with restaurant and lounge.http://www.broomhallcastle.co.uk/
