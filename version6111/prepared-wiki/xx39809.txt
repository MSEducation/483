==Music career==

===Early===

Jewel was discovered in August 1994 by Inga Vainshtein, a former Paramount studio executive. John Hogan, the lead singer from a local San Diego (California, United States) band, Rust, signed to Atlantic Records, who Vainshtein was managing, called to tell Vainshtein about a female surfer who sang at Innerchange, a local Pacific Beach coffee shop on Thursdays. Jenny Price, an assistant to Rust's A&R, Tom Carolan, came along on a trip. After the show Vainshtein and Price called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Records' West Coast operations.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.soulfulliving.com/question_of_time.htm | title =Lenedra J. Carroll — The Question of Time — Feature Article | accessdate = 2009-06-14[/tpl] Jewel didn't have a demo tape at that time and had no funds to pay for it.  Goldberg offered to pay for Jewel to record some of her songs. He suggested Jewel record her first studio recording session with Bruce Robb, where Evan Dando from Lemonheads, another Atlantic Records artist, was recording.  Bruce Robb produced, engineered, and mixed her demos.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The Robb Brothers had just produced The Lemonheads for Atlantic Records. Vainshtein became Jewel's manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war, leading to Jewel's deal with Atlantic Records[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19970721,00.html | title =Time Magazine Cover: Jewel and the New Women of Rock — July 21, 1997 | accessdate = 2009-06-14[/tpl] and her subsequent appearance on the cover of Time, the first ever by an Atlantic artist.
It was Vainshtein's idea to ask Neil Young's long time engineer and producer, Ben Keith, who never worked with anyone else but Neil Young.  Keith, not only agreed to produce Jewel's debut, but suggested they use, The Stray Gators, to back her on non-acoustic songs. Jewel released her debut album, Pieces of You, in 1995 when she was 21.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,205332,00.html | title =Jewel: Pieces Of You | accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl] The album was recorded live at the Innerchange Coffeehouse in San Diego, and also in the studio on Neil Young's ranch.  It was backed by Young's band, The Stray Gators. The album was produced by Ben Keith, who played steel guitar in Neil's band. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years, reaching number four at its peak.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.superiorpics.com/jewel_kilcher/ | title =Superiorpics| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl] The album spawned the popular hits "You Were Meant for Me", "Who Will Save Your Soul", and "Foolish Games". The album eventually sold more than 12 million copies in the United States alone.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Peak===

Jewel was chosen to sing the American national anthem at the opening of the Super Bowl XXXII in January 1998 in San Diego. She was introduced as "San Diego's own Jewel!". However, she was criticized for lip syncing the anthem to a digitally recorded track of her own voice. This was especially noticeable due to her missing her cue and not mouthing the first words. Super Bowl producers have since admitted that they attempt to have all performers pre-record their vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WinterConcert/Story?id=6788924&page=1 |title=Hudson's Super Bowl Lip-Sync No Surprise to Insiders - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] She performed the "Star-Spangled Banner" again in the 2003 NBA Finals in one of the New Jersey Nets' home games.
Jewel parted ways with her original manager, Inga Vainshtein, in February 1998. At the time she was in talks with Daniel Lanois about producing what would have become her second album. However, upon letting Vainshtein go and handing her career management to her mother, she abruptly changed creative direction. Instead of Lanois, she ended up going with Patrick Leonard, who created a much more pop album.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Many believe that going in a more pop direction alienated her core fan base, resulting in much lower sales. Spirit was released in November 1998. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 4 million copies in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The song "Hands" hit No. 6 on the Hot 100. Other singles followed, including a new version of "Jupiter (Swallow the Moon)", "What's Simple Is True" (the theme song to her upcoming movie), and the charity single "Life Uncommon".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1353251| title =Spirit thing| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl]
A year later, in November 1999, Jewel released Joy: A Holiday Collection. The album sold over a million copies and peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. She released a cover of "Joy to the World" from the album as a single.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.gohastings.com/catalog/artist/artist.asp?Ctrb_Id=34336115| title =Jewel| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl]
In November 2001 the album This Way was released. The album peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. A song from the album "Standing Still" hit the Top 30. Other singles released were "Break Me", "This Way", and "Serve the Ego", the latter giving Jewel her first number one club hit.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70886/jewel-pleasing-fans-online-on-tour| title =Billboard, Jewel Pleasing Fans| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl]

===0304===

In 2003 Jewel released the album 0304. Following the limited success of "Serve the Ego", Jewel moved to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of the single "Intuition". The song reached No. 5 on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart and No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q4-03/j.htm| title =The Log Book| accessdate = 2007-03-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070219010036/http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q4-03/j.htm |archivedate = February 19, 2007[/tpl]

==Writing==

Jewel published a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor in 1998. Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a The New York Times Best Seller list, it received mixed reviews.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9806/01/jewel/excerpts.html| title =CNN excerpts from Jewel| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl] During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage in her book of poetry of the word "casualty" (intended as something to the effect of "of a casual nature") to which Jewel responded, "You're a smartass for pointing that out.  Next topic."  In the fall of '98, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to "A Night Without Armor" entitled "A Night Without Armor II:  the Revenge."[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.amazon.com/Night-Without-Armor-II-Revenge/dp/0966204298/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330004051&sr=1-1 |title=A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge.

His is wry and absurd."Gundersen, Edna, "A rare Jewel of a poetic parody," USA Today, September 16, 1998.
Jewel went on to write an autobiography titled Chasing Down the Dawn in 2000, a collection of diary entries and musings detailing her life growing up in Alaska, her struggle to learn her craft and life on the road.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.paraview.com/jewel/index.htm| title =Chasing Down The Dawn| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl]
Jewel was scheduled to release a third book called Love Poems, which was supposed to be an extremely intimate portrayal of her relationship with her boyfriend, Ty Murray. It was canceled several months before release because Jewel was worried about Murray's mother's reaction to her intimate confessions.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.girlything.com/jewel2006.html| title =Jewel Diamond In The Rough| accessdate = 2007-03-02[/tpl]

Jewel identifies as a feminist and has said, "I don't think I started off young as a feminist. I read a lot of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I was raised in a place where pioneer women were very strong still. They'd shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn't really until I've gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them."[tpl]cite web|title=Folk artist Jewel on feminism and LGBT courage |url=http://outfrontonline.com/social/high-society/ofc-exclusive-folk-artist-jewel-on-feminism-and-lgbt-courage/#sthash.f0tGAGrk.dpuf|publisher=Out Front|accessdate=17 June 2013[/tpl]
