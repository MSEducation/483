==Geography==

Zion is located at [tpl]coord|42.453221|-87.840222|type:city|format=dms|notes=.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl][/tpl]
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|9.81|sqmi[/tpl], all land.
The city is one of only a few in the world to have ever been completely planned out before building. Dowie modeled the city layout after the Union Flag, because he was originally from Scotland and Australia.http://www.zionhs.com/history.htm In the planning stage he mailed the mayors of many large cities across the world for suggestions on how to design the best city possible. A few of the recommendations were:
Some of the diagonal roads were never completed. The north-south roads in the original plan are all named from the Bible except for two: "Caledonia" is the Roman word for Scotland, Dowie's native country, and Edina Boulevard which is named for an old Roman abbreviation for the city of Edinburgh, Dowie's birthplace. The original east-west roads are numbered starting with 1 at the state line (now called Russell Road), although there are now new east-west roads which bear names. The city used to extend all of the way down to the lakefront until the state bought it to preserve the beach. Because most of the houses on the lakefront were owned by wealthy citizens, most of them were moved to places around what is now Sheridan Road.
The former city seal was the subject of a Supreme Court case because it contained a religious symbol.

===Illinois Beach State Park===

Zion is the closest municipality to South Beach within Illinois Beach State Park. The North Beach is in Winthrop Harbor. The beach was originally part of Camp Logan, a rifle range developed by the Illinois National Guard in 1892. In World War I and World War II it served as a rifle range for the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. The range remained in operation until 1973, when it was transferred to the Illinois Department of Conservation.  In 1950, the Illinois Dunes Preservation Society was established to maintain the natural qualities of the beach. With the help of the Illinois Department of Conservation the area south of Beach Road was established as the state's first natural preserve. The northern beach, between Beach Road and the Wisconsin state border, were obtained between 1971 and 1982.State.il.us
The south beach is now home of the Illinois Beach Resort and Conference Center. The North Point Marina is at the north beach. This is Illinois' newest and largest marina.
On May 9, 2000, the area encompassing Illinois Beach State Park and North Point Marina was officially designated as the Cullerton Complex in honor of William J. Cullerton, Sr., war hero, avid environmentalist and long-time friend of conservation.[tpl]cite news |first=Graydon|last=Megan|title=William Cullerton, 1923-2013 WWII pilot, entrepreneur, radio host and well-known outdoorsman championed conservation |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-16/news/ct-met-bill-cullerton-obit-20130116_1_radio-show-host-war-hero-german-pilot |work= Chicago Tribune  |publisher= |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Laurie|last=Grano|title=Cullerton Complex Christened At State Park |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-10/news/0005100179_1_lake-michigan-george-ryan-illinois-beach-state-park |work= Chicago Tribune  |publisher= |date=2000-05-10 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]
