CATEGORIES: Sheep wool, Animal hair

Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and certain other animals, including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.[tpl]cite book|last=Braaten|first=Ann W.|title=Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion|year=2005|volume=3|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-684-31394-4|pages=441–443|editor=Steele, Valerie|chapter=Wool[/tpl]
Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it is elastic,  and it grows in staples (clusters).D'Arcy, J. B., Sheep and Wool Technology, NSW University Press, Kensington, 1986 ISBN 0-86840-106-4 While in the United States the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, in the UK the term may be used of any long curling fiber such as wood wool, wire wool, etc.Australian Wool Corporation, Australian Wool Classing, Raw Wool Services, 1990

==Characteristics==

Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together.  Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Insulation works both ways: Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes to keep heat out and protect the body.
Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together.
The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers.  A fine wool like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while the coarser wools like karakul may have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp.  The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.
Wool fibers are hydrophilic, meaning they readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb moisture almost one-third of its own weight.Wool Facts. Aussiesheepandwool.com.au. Retrieved on 2012-08-05.
Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.
Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers. It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip;Wool History. Tricountyfarm.org.

Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire.
Wool is considered by the medical profession to be hypoallergenic.[tpl]dubious|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Processing==

===Shearing===

Sheep shearing is the process by which the woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off. After shearing, the wool is separated into four main categories: fleece (which makes up the vast bulk), broken, bellies, and locks.  The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person called a wool classer groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner.  In Australia and  New Zealand, before being auctioned, all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for micron, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color and comfort factor.

===Scouring===

Wool straight off a sheep, known as "greasy wool"Preparation of Australian Wool Clips, Code of Practice 2010–2012, Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX), 2010 or "wool in the grease", contains a high level of  valuable lanolin, as well as dirt, dead skin, sweat residue, pesticides, and vegetable matter.  Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool. Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali and specialized equipment.[ref]

In North West England special Potash pits were constructed to produce Potash used in the manufacture of a soft soap for scouring locally produced white wool.
In commercial wool, vegetable matter is often removed by chemical carbonization.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]A study of wool carbonizing / by Wu Zhao. - Version details - Trove In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents.  This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen.  Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams.  

==Quality==

The quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color, and staple strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price.
Merino wool is typically 3–5 inches in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns).[ref]
