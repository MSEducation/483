Ethiopian–Turkish relations are foreign relations between Ethiopia and Turkey. Ethiopia opened an embassy in Ankara in 1959, but was forced to close it in 1976 due to economic constraints; it was recently re-opened in 2006. The Ottoman Empire had an honorary Consul in Harar during 1910-1912, and opened a diplomatic consulate in Addis Ababa in 1912; the Republic of Turkey re-opened a consulate in that city, headed by Charge d'affaires, in 1925."Bilateral relations", Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 28 July 2009) Turkey was the sixth country to open an embassy in Ethiopia.
