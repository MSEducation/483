[[Geography of South Africa]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of South Africa

South Africa occupies the southern tip of Africa, its coastline stretching more than [tpl]convert|2500|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the desert border with Namibia on the Atlantic (western) coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then north to the border with Mozambique on the Indian Ocean. The low-lying coastal zone is narrow for much of that distance, soon giving way to a mountainous escarpment (Great Escarpment) that separates the coast from the high inland plateau. In some places, notably the province of KwaZulu-Natal in the east, a greater distance separates the coast from the escarpment. Although most of the country is classified as semi-arid, it has considerable variation in climate as well as topography.
South Africa contains only two major rivers:
In so dry a country, dams and irrigation are extremely important: the largest dam is the Gariep on the Orange River.

==Landform Regions==

Like much of the African continent, South Africa features a landscape dominated by a high plateau in the interior, surrounded by a narrow strip of coastal lowlands. This inland plateau is drained by two major rivers, the Orange River and the Limpopo River. In the central areas of the plateau, the arid scrubland gives way to dry grasslands, which become better watered further to the east. These grasslands extend northeastward until they reach the Witwatersrand and Magaliesberg, which are the main watershed between the Orange and Limpopo Rivers. 
Unlike most of Africa, the perimeter of South Africa's inland plateau rises abruptly to form a series of mountain ranges before dropping to sea level. These mountains, known as the Great Escarpment, vary between 2,000 metres and 3,300 metres in elevation, with their highest stretch forming the Drakensberg Mountains.  In general, the Great Escarpment slowly loses altitude into the northwestern areas of the inland plateau, where it merges with the Kalahari. The coastline is fairly regular and has few natural harbours. Each of the dominant land features—the inland plateau, the encircling mountain ranges, and the coastal lowlands—exhibits a wide range of variation in topography and in natural resources.

===Highveld===

The interior plateau consists of a series of rolling grasslands (veld in Afrikaans), arising out of the Kalahari Desert in the north. The largest sub-region in the plateau is the 1,200-meter to 1,800-meter-high central area known as the Highveld. The Highveld stretches from Western Cape Province to the northeast, encompassing the entire Free State (formerly the Orange Free State). It receives between 400 and 1200 mm of rain annually, due to the east/west distribution of rainfall in South Africa. In the north it rises into a series of rock formations known as the Magaliesberg Mountains and the Witwatersrand (literally, "Ridge of White Waters" in Afrikaans, commonly shortened to Rand). The Rand is a ridge of gold-bearing rock, roughly 100 kilometres by thirty-seven kilometres, that serves as a watershed for numerous rivers and streams. It is also the site of the world's largest proven gold deposits and the country's leading industrial city, Johannesburg.
The southern border of the Highveld rises to form the Great Escarpment, the semicircle of mountain ranges roughly paralleling South Africa's coastline. The Drakensberg Mountains, the country's largest mountain range, dominate the southern and the eastern border of the Highveld from the Eastern Cape province to the border with Swaziland. The highest peaks of the Drakensberg Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal exceed 3,300 meters and are even higher in Lesotho, which is known as the "Mountain Kingdom." Meanwhile, along its western border, the Highveld generally loses altitude where the grassland merges with the Kalahari.

===Lowveld===

The narrow coastal strip between the Great Escarpment and the ocean, called the Lowveld, varies in width from about sixty kilometres to more than 200 kilometres.  These lowlands, below about [tpl]convert|abbr=on|500|m|ft|0[/tpl] altitude, form South Africa's northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe, where a 180 million year-old failed rift valley cuts into Southern Africa's central plateau and locally obliterates the Great EscarpmentMcCarthy t. & Rubidge B.

Readers Digest Association, Cape Town The Limpopo and Save rivers run from the central African highlands via the Lowveld into the Indian Ocean to the east. The Limpopo Lowveld extends southwards, east of the Drakensberg escarpment through Mpumalanga Province and ultimately into eastern Swaziland. This southern limb of the Lowveld is  bounded by South Africa's border with Mozambique to the east, and the north-eastern part of the Drakensberg to the west.Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). pp. 13, 182, 192. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town This region is generally hotter and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld. 
The Lowveld used to be known as  "fever country" because malaria, carried by mosquitoes, was endemic to almost the entire area. Before the middle of the 20th century, the Lowveld was also home to the tsetse fly, which transmits sleeping sickness to humans and nagana to animals, especially the horses of the travelers trying to reach the Highveld and Witwatersrand Gold Fields from Maputo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/map/lowveld_map.asp |title=Map of Lowveld |publisher=Saexplorer.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl]
The Lowveld is known for its high concentration of big game, including the larger animals, like African elephants, rhino, African buffalo, the big cats (lions, leopards, and cheetahs), the Plains zebra, and a wide variety of antelope, while the slow-flowing streams and wetlands of the Lowveld are a haven for the hippos and crocodiles. The bird life is also astoundingly abundant and varied. The Kruger National Park, for example, is located in the eastern Lowveld areas of Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces, along almost the entire border with Mozambique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wheretostay.co.za/information/mp/knp |title=Lowveld & Kruger National Park |publisher=Wheretostay.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl]

===Bushveld===

The Lowveld partly overlaps with a dry savanna ecoregion known as the Bushveld, a basin characterized by open grasslands with scattered trees and bushes. Elevation varies between 600 metres and about 900 metres above sea level. The Bushveld is one of the largest and best known layered igneous mineral complexes in the world. Covering an area roughly 350 kilometres by 150 kilometres, the Bushveld has extensive deposits of platinum and chromium and significant reserves of copper, fluorspar, gold, nickel, and iron.
The northern edge of the Bushveld, where the plains rise to a series of high plateaus and low mountain ranges, form the southern edge of the Lowveld and the Limpopo River Valley in Northern Province. These mountains include the Waterberg, and the Soutpansberg Range. The Soutpansberg Range reaches an elevation of 1,700 meters before dropping off into the Limpopo River Valley and the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe. West of the Bushveld, Highveld, and Lowveld is the southern basin of the Kalahari Desert, which borders Namibia and Botswana at an elevation of 600 meters to 900 meters.

===Karoo===

The western section of South Africa is dominated by the Karoo, a semidesert region that is divided into the Upper Karoo in the north, the Great Karoo, and the Little Karoo in the south. 
In the southwest, the mountains of the Cape Fold Belt—formed by the folding of the continental crust—form an "L," where the north-south ranges meet several east-west ranges. The north-south ranges, paralleling the Atlantic coastline, include the Cederberg and the Groot Winterhoek and have peaks close to 2,000 metres high. The east-west ranges, paralleling the southern coastline, include the Swartberg and the Langeberg with peaks exceeding 2,200 metres. The mountains of the Cape Fold Belt are separated from the Highveld by the Great Karoo. Lying between 450 metres and 750 metres above sea level, the Great Karoo is crossed by several rivers that have carved canyons and valleys in their southward descent from the Highveld into the ocean. 
The Great Escarpment divides the Great Karoo from the Upper Karoo to the north. The town of Sutherland is located in the Roggeveld Mountains of the Upper Karoo, with midwinter temperatures as low as −15 degrees and is thought to be the coldest inhabited place in South Africa. 
Another narrow strip of arid savanna lies south of the Great Karoo, between the Swartberg and the Langeberg. This high plain, known as the Little Karoo, has a more temperate climate and more diverse flora and fauna than the Great Karoo. 

===Cape Middleveld===

The most westerly region in South Africa's interior plateau is the Cape Middleveld subregion, an arid expanse of undulating plains that sometimes reaches an elevation of 900 meters. Its northern and eastern border is the Orange River, to the west the Great Escarpment and to the south the Upper Karoo. The Cape Middleveld is characterized by large depressions, or "pans," where rainfall collects, providing sustenance for a variety of plants and animals.

===Coastline===

The vast majority of South Africa's border consists of the ocean—or two oceans, which meet at the southwestern corner. Its territory includes Marion and Prince Edward Islands, nearly [tpl]convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Cape Town in the Atlantic Ocean. 
The cold Benguela current sweeps up from the Antarctic along the Atlantic coast, laden with plankton and providing rich fishing-grounds. The east coast has the north-to-south Mozambique/Agulhas Current, which provides warm waters. These two currents have a major effect on the country's climate, the ready evaporation of the eastern seas providing generous rainfall while the Benguela current retains its moisture to cause desert conditions in the west.
Several small rivers run into the sea along the coastline, but none are navigable and none provide useful natural harbors. The coastline itself, being fairly smooth, provides only one good natural harbour, at Saldanha Bay north of Cape Town. A lack of fresh water prevented major development here. Nevertheless, busy habors now exist at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, and Richards Bay.

==Climate==

The Karoo, which occupies a large part of the western Central Plateau, has a climate extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter. In contrast, the eastern coastline on the Indian Ocean is lush, well watered and warmed by the Mozambique Current; patches of Southern Africa mangroves grow along this coast.
The southern coast, part of which is known as the Garden Route, is temperate and green. The Cape of Good Hope has a Mediterranean climate, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (becoming hotter in interior valleys). Snow commonly falls in winter on the higher ground of the Cape Fold Mountains. The Cape has a reputation for its wind – which blows intermittently virtually all year round, either from the south-east or the north-west – and for its sunny summer, when almost no rain falls. The vegetation of the Cape area consists of fynbos grassland and Albany thickets.
The eastern section of the Karoo does not extend as far north as the western part, giving way to the flat landscape of the Free State, which – though still semi-arid – receives somewhat more rain. North of the Vaal River the Highveld is better watered, with an annual rainfall of [tpl]convert|760|mm|in|1| abbr=on[/tpl] and a high altitude (around [tpl]convert|1750|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) which mitigates the extremes of heat. Winters are cold though snow is rare.
Further north and to the east, especially where a drop in altitude beyond the escarpment gives the Lowveld its name, temperatures rise: the Tropic of Capricorn slices through the extreme north. Here one finds the typical South African Bushveld. There is skiing in winter in the high Drakensberg mountains that form the eastern escarpment, but the coldest place in the country is Sutherland in the western Roggeveld Mountains, with midwinter temperatures as low as −15 degrees Celsius. The deep interior provides the hottest temperatures: in 1948 the mercury hit [tpl]convert|51.7|°C|°F|2[/tpl] in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington.
