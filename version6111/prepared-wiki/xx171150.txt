Tears for Dolphy is a 1964 album by jazz trumpeter Ted Curson.  The album's title track, an elegy for Eric Dolphy, has been used in numerous films.

==Reception==

Brian Morton and Richard Cook, writing for The Penguin Guide to Jazz, give Tears for Dolphy a favorable review, noting "a raw sorrow in the title tune," a robust rhythm section, and the leader's "high, slightly old-fashioned sound."  Earlier editions of The Penguin Guide to Jazz give the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars.
Chuck Berg, writing for Down Beat, notes Curson and saxophonist Bill Barron's "tough, but highly melodic lines above the steady and crisp rhythmic substructure ably provided by bassist Herb Bushler and drummer Dick Berk."
Scott Yanow of AllMusic asserts that most tracks "manage to be both explorative and surprisingly accessible."

==Track listing==
