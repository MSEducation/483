==History==

Harrods founder Charles Henry Harrod first established his business in 1824, aged 25. The business was located south of the River Thames in Southwark. The premises were located at 228 Borough High Street. He ran this business, variously listed as a draper, mercer and a haberdasher, certainly until 1831.Rate Books April 1824 to April 1831 held at Local History Library, Borough High Street, Southwark, London.1830 Critchett’s Directory, London.1832 Robson’s Directory During 1825 the business was listed as 'Harrod and Wicking, Linen Drapers, Retail',Pigot’s Directory of 1826-27 but this partnership was dissolved at the end of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/search |title=Issue 18210, published on the 10th. January, 1826, page 57 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] His first grocery business appears to be as ‘Harrod & Co.Grocers’ at 163 Upper Whitecross Street, Clerkenwell, E.C.1., in 1832.1832 Robson's Directory
In 1834 in London's East End, he established a wholesale grocery in Stepney, at 4, Cable Street, with a special interest in tea. In 1849, to escape the vice of the inner city and to capitalise on trade to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in nearby Hyde Park, Harrod took over a small shop in the district of Brompton, on the site of the current store. Beginning in a single room employing two assistants and a messenger boy, Harrod's son Charles Digby Harrod built the business into a thriving retail operation selling medicines, perfumes, stationery, fruit and vegetables. Harrods rapidly expanded, acquired the adjoining buildings, and employed one hundred people by 1880.
However, the store's booming fortunes were reversed in early December 1883, when it burnt to the ground. Remarkably, in view of this calamity, Charles Harrod fulfilled all of his commitments to his customers to make Christmas deliveries that year—and made a record profit in the process. In short order, a new building was built on the same site, and soon Harrods extended credit for the first time to its best customers, among them Oscar Wilde, Lillie Langtry, Ellen Terry, Charlie Chaplin, Noël Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Sigmund Freud, A. A. Milne, and many members of the British Royal Family.
On Wednesday, 16 November 1898, Harrods debuted England's first "moving staircase" (escalator) in their Brompton Road stores; the device was actually a woven leather conveyor belt-like unit with a mahogany and "silver plate-glass" balustrade."The First Moving Staircase in England." The Drapers' Record, 19 November 1898: 465. Nervous customers were offered brandy at the top to revive them after their 'ordeal'. The department store was purchased by the Fayed brothers in 1985.

===2010 sale===

Following denial that it was for sale, Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar in May 2010. A fortnight previously, chairman of Harrods since 1985, Mohamed Al-Fayed, had stated that "People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough. But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/qatar-the-tiny-gulf-state-that-bought-the-world-1970551.html |title=Qatar, the tiny Gulf state that bought the world. |publisher=Independent |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl]
The sale was concluded in the early hours of 8 May, when Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani came to London to finalise the deal, saying that the acquisition of Harrods would add "much value" to the investment portfolio of Qatar Holdings while his deputy, Hussain Ali Al-Abdulla, called it a "landmark transaction".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8669657.stm|title=Mohammed Fayed sells Harrods store to Qatar Holdings|date=8 May 2010 |work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 May 2010[/tpl] A spokesman for Mohamed Al-Fayed said "in reaching the decision to retire, Fayed wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued." Harrods was sold for £1.5 billion; half of the sale will be used to pay bank debts of £625 million.[tpl]cite web|last=Bower |first=Tom |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=504193&in_page_id=2 |title=Why Al-Fayed sold Harrods, for £1.5 billion. |publisher=This Is Money |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl]
Al-Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Al-Fayed said "I'm here every day, I can't take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots...I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838358-a-four-letter-farewell-from-mohammed-fayed.do |title=Mohammed Fayed: Why I Sold Harrods. |publisher=Evening Standard |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] Al-Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he will hold for at least six months.

==Royal warrants==

Harrods was the holder of royal warrants from:
In August 2010, in a letter to the Daily Telegraph, chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed revealed that he had burnt Harrods royal warrants, after taking them down in 2000. Harrods had held the Royal warrants since 1910. Describing the warrants as a "curse", Al-Fayed claimed that business had tripled since their removal. The Duke of Edinburgh removed his warrant in January 2000,[tpl]Cite news |date=26 June 2011|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/diana/8598896/Anger-as-Mohamed-Fayed-burns-Harrods-royal-warrants.html|title=Anger as Mohamed Fayed burns Harrods royal warrants|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Robert|last=Mendick[/tpl] and the other warrants were removed from Harrods by Al-Fayed in December, pending their five-yearly review.

==Memorials==

Since the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Al-Fayed, Mohamed Al-Fayed's son, two memorials commissioned by Al-Fayed have been erected inside Harrods to the couple. The first, located at the base of the Egyptian Escalator, was unveiled on 12 April 1998, consisting of photographs of the two behind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wine glass smudged with lipstick from Diana's last dinner as well as what is described as an engagement ring Dodi purchased the day before they died.Rick Steves, Getting Up To Snuff In London, /www.ricksteves.com.
The second memorial, unveiled in 2005 and located by the escalator at door three is entitled "Innocent Victims", a bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross, a bird said to symbolise the "Holy Spirit".Harrods unveils Diana, Dodi statue, CNN.com, 1 September 2005. The sculpture was created by William Mitchell, a close friend of Al-Fayed and artistic design advisor to Harrods for 40 years. Al-Fayed said he wanted to keep the pair's "spirit alive" through the statue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4204364.stm|title=Diana bronze unveiled at Harrods|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=8 May 2010[/tpl]

Harrods still has a strict and accepted dress code, where people are refused and not allowed to enter the store if they are wearing high-cut, Bermuda or beach shorts, swimwear, athletic singlets, cycling shorts, flip flops or thong sandals, if they have bare midriff or bare feet, if they are excessively sweaty, or if they are wearing dirty or unkempt clothing.
