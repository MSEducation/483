[[Li people]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups officially recognized by China, Hainan

The Li (黎; pinyin: Lí) or Hlai are a minority ethnic group, the vast majority of whom live off the southern coast of mainland China on Hainan Island,[ref]Original from Indiana University 
[/ref] where they are the largest minority ethnic group. Divided into the five branches of the Qi, Ha, Run, Sai and Meifu,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Minorities/min-Li.html|title=Chinese Nationalities (Li Minority)|accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] the Li have their own distinctive culture and customs.

==Background==

They refer to themselves as the Hlai people, but they are sometimes colloquially known as "Sai" or "Say", and during the Sui Dynasty they were known by the name Liliao. The Li form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China.

==Origin and history==

The Li are believed to be descendants of the ancient Yue tribes of China and Vietnam, who settled on the island thousands of years ago. DNA analysis carried out amongst the modern Li population indicate a close relationship with populations in mainland southern China and in particular Guangxi province.
During the Japanese occupation of Hainan (1939–1945), the Li suffered heavily. They are held in high esteem by the Beijing government because they fought on the side of the CPC against Chinese Nationalist rule during the Chinese Civil War. Hainan Li-Miao Autonomous Prefecture was created in 1952 (abolished in 1988).

==Language==

They speak their own Hlai language, a member of the Tai–Kadai language family,[ref]Norquest, Peter K. 2007. A Phonological Reconstruction of Proto-Hlai. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona.
[/ref] but most can understand or speak Hainanese and Mandarin—and it is also common for Li people to learn and speak Cantonese because many Li in Hainan relocate to Cantonese-speaking areas in southern mainland China near Hainan such as Guangzhou and Hong Kong.

==Culture==

The Li play a traditional wind instrument called kǒuxiāo (口箫),http://www.hongxiao.com/dy/Article/musicnatural/chianUSA/minyuechuiguanlei/huangshe/200509/422.html and another called lìlāluó (利拉罗).
