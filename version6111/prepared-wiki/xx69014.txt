Digoxin INN ([tpl]IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˈ|dʒ|ɒ|k|s|ɨ|n[/tpl]OED) is a purified cardiac glycoside similar to Digitoxin extracted from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata,[tpl]cite journal | author = Hollman A | title = Digoxin comes from Digitalis lanata | journal = British Medical Journal | year = 1996 | volume = 312 | issue = 7035 | page = 912 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/312/7035/912 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7035.912[/tpl] which was discovered by William Withering. Its corresponding aglycone is digoxigenin, and its acetyl derivative is acetyldigoxin. Digoxin is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and sometimes heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication. 
Digoxin preparations are marketed under the trade names Cardigox; Cardiogoxin; Cardioxin; Cardoxin; Coragoxine; Digacin; Digicor; Digomal; Digon; Digosin; Digoxine Navtivelle; Digoxina-Sandoz; Digoxin-Sandoz; Digoxin-Zori; Dilanacin; Eudigox; Fargoxin; Grexin; Lanacordin; Lanacrist; Lanicor; Lanikor; Lanorale; Lanoxicaps; Lanoxin; Lanoxin PG; Lenoxicaps; Lenoxin; Lifusin; Mapluxin; Natigoxin; Novodigal; Purgoxin; Sigmaxin; Sigmaxin-PG; Toloxin.
Digoxin was discovered by physician William Withering, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.

==Medical use==

Derivatives of plants of the genus Digitalis have a long history of medical use. The British physician William Withering is credited with the first published description of the use of digitalis derivatives in his 1785 book "An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases".[tpl]cite book|last=Withering|first=William|title=An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases|year=1785|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24886[/tpl]
Today, the most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers are a better first choice.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sticherling C, Oral H, Horrocks J et al. | title = Effects of digoxin on acute, atrial fibrillation-induced changes in atrial refractoriness | journal = Circulation | volume = 102 | issue = 20 | pages = 2503–2508 |date=November 2000 | pmid = 11076824 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.102.20.2503 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/102/20/2503.full.pdf | format = pdf [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hallberg P, Lindbäck J, Lindahl B, Stenestrand U, Melhus H | title = Digoxin and mortality in atrial fibrillation: a prospective cohort study | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 63 | issue = 10 | pages = 959–971 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17684738 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-007-0346-9 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/62g4v62272167l75/?p=7c71dc6f1f0e463ab54515c25f735dd9&pi=3 [/tpl] High ventricular rate leads to insufficient diastolic filling time. By slowing down the conduction in the AV node and increasing its refractory period, digoxin can reduce the ventricular rate. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves owing to improved filling.
The use of digoxin in heart problems during sinus rhythm was once standard, but is now controversial. In theory, the increased force of contraction should lead to improved pumping function of the heart, but its effect on prognosis is disputable, and other effective treatments are now available. Digoxin is no longer the first choice for congestive heart failure, but can still be useful in patients who remain symptomatic despite proper diuretic and ACE inhibitor treatment.
Digitalis/digoxin has recently fallen out of favor because it did not demonstrate a mortality benefit in patients with congestive heart failure; however, it did demonstrate a reduction in hospitalizations for this condition. Because other therapies have shown a mortality benefit in congestive heart failure, maximizing other therapies (e.g., beta blockers) first is recommended before using digoxin.

==Adverse effects==

The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Adverse effects are concentration-dependent, and are rare when plasma digoxin concentration is + ions for the same binding site on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.
Common adverse effects (≥1% of patients) include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as gastrointestinal motility increases. Other common effects are blurred vision, visual disturbances (yellow-green halos and problems with color perception), confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, insomnia, nightmares, agitation, and depression, as well as a higher acute sense of sensual activities.[tpl] cite book | editor = Tripathi KD | title = Essentials of Medical Pharmacology | edition = 6th | publisher = Jaypee Publications | location = New Delhi | isbn = 81-8448-085-7 [/tpl] Less frequent adverse effects (0.1%–1%) include: acute psychosis, delirium, amnesia, convulsions, shortened QRS complex, atrial or ventricular extrasystoles, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and heart block. Rarely, digoxin has been shown to cause thrombocytopenia. Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule,[tpl] cite journal | author = Moscovitz T, Aldrighi JM, Abrahanshon PA et al. | title = Repercussions of digoxin, digitoxin and estradiol on the endometrial histomorphometry of oophorectomized mice | journal = Gynecology and Endocrinology | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 213–220 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 16019364 | doi = 10.1080/09513590400021219 | url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590400021219 [/tpl] but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal.[tpl]cite journal | author = Thompson DF, Carter JR | year = 1993 | title = Drug-induced gynecomastia | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–45 | pmid = 8094898 [/tpl]
The pharmacological actions of digoxin usually result in electrocardiogram changes, including ST depression or T wave inversion, which do not indicate toxicity. PR interval prolongation, however, may be a sign of digoxin toxicity. Additionally, increased intracellular Ca2+ may cause a type of arrhythmia called bigeminy (coupled beats), eventually ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.  The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with A-V block - so-called "PAT with block") is said to be pathognomonic (i.e. diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Doering W, König E, Sturm W | year = 1977 |title=(title in German) | trans_title = Digitalis intoxication: specifity and significance of cardiac and extracardiac symptoms. part I: Patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias (author's transl) | language = German | journal = Zeitschrift für Kardiologie  | volume = 66  | issue = 3  | pages = 121–128 | pmid = 857452 [/tpl]
An often described, but rarely seen, adverse effect of digoxin is a disturbance of color vision (mostly yellow and green) called xanthopsia.  Vincent van Gogh's "Yellow Period" may have somehow been influenced by concurrent digitalis therapy.  Other oculotoxic effects of digoxin include generalized blurry vision, as well as seeing a "halo" around each point of light.[tpl] cite book | author = Goldfrank LW | title = Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies | edition = 8th | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2006 [/tpl]  The latter effect can also be seen in van Gogh's Starry Night.  Evidence of van Gogh's digoxin use is supported by multiple self-portraits that include the foxglove plant, from which digoxin is obtained. (e.g. Portrait of Dr. Gachet)
Digoxin plasma concentrations may increase while on antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine (based on two case reports from 1982).[tpl]cite journal | author = Leden I | title = Digoxin-hydroxychloroquine interaction? | journal = Acta Medica Scandinavica | year = 1982 | volume = 211 | issue = 5 | pages = 411–412 | pmid = 7113754 | doi = 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1982.tb01971.x [/tpl]
In overdose, the usual supportive measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalaemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab).[tpl]cite journal | author = Flanagan RJ, Jones AL | title = Fab Antibody Fragments: Some Applications in Clinical Toxicology | journal = Drug Safety | year = 2004 | volume = 27 | issue = 14 | pages = 1115–1133 | pmid = 15554746 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200427140-00004 | url = http://drugsafety.adisonline.com/pt/re/drs/fulltext.00002018-200427140-00004.htm [/tpl] Toxicity can also be treated with higher than normal doses of potassium.  Digoxin is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis with enough effectiveness to treat toxicity.
Digoxin has potentially dangerous interactions with verapamil,[tpl]cite journal | author = Kaplanski J, Weinhouse E, Topaz M, Genchik G | title = Verapamil and digoxin: interactions in the rat | journal = Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology | year = 1983 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–388 | pmid = 6665298 [/tpl] amiodarone, erythromycin, and epinephrine (as would be injected with a local anesthetic).

==Pharmacokinetic properties==

Digoxin is usually given orally, but can also be given by IV injection in urgent situations (the IV injection should be slow, and heart rhythm should be monitored).  While IV therapy may be better tolerated (less nausea), digoxin has a very long distribution half-life into the cardiac tissue, which will delay its onset of action by a number of hours.  The half-life is about 36 hours for patients with normal renal function, digoxin is given once daily, usually in 125-μg or 250-μg doses.
In patients with decreased kidney function, the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd, calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days, elimination is mainly by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein which leads to significant clinical interactions with other drugs commonly used in patients with heart problems. These include: spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. ( Inhibit P-glycoprotein that is mainly responsible for Digoxin Clearance )
Effective plasma levels vary depending on the medical indication.  For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/ml are recommended.[ref]
