[[Stump (game)]]

CATEGORIES: Drinking games

Stump is an American drinking game played with a hammer, nails, a tree stump, and beer. The exact place of origin is vague, but evidence suggests it was likely invented somewhere in the northeastern US, possibly at Paul Smith's College.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldstump.com/about.html|title=About Stump|accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]  In the Southeast, the game has been referred to as Nails. The game is likely a derivative of Hammerschlagen.
