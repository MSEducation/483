[[Lactase]]

CATEGORIES: Food additives, Antiflatulents, EC 3.2.1

Lactase is an enzyme produced in the digestive system of infants and some, mostly European, adult humans. Lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk. Lactase breaks down lactose, a simple sugar which gives milk its sweetness.  Lacking lactase, a person consuming dairy products may experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance.[tpl]cite journal | author = Järvelä I, Torniainen S, Kolho KL | title = Molecular genetics of human lactase deficiencies | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 568–75 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19639477 | doi = 10.1080/07853890903121033 | url =  [/tpl] Lactase can be purchased as a food supplement, and is added to milk to produce "lactose-free" milk products.
Lactase (also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), a part of the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mantei N, Villa M, Enzler T, Wacker H, Boll W, James P, Hunziker W, Semenza G | title = Complete primary structure of human and rabbit lactase-phlorizin hydrolase: implications for biosynthesis, membrane anchoring and evolution of the enzyme | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 2705–13 |date=September 1988 | pmid = 2460343 | pmc = 457059 | doi = | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Harvey CB, Fox MF, Jeggo PA, Mantei N, Povey S, Swallow DM | title = Regional localization of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase gene, LCT, to chromosome 2q21 | journal = Annals of Human Genetics | volume = 57 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 179–85 |date=July 1993 | pmid = 8257087 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1993.tb01593.x| url =  [/tpl]

==Mechanism==

The optimum temperature for lactase is about 77 °F (25 °C) for its activity[tpl]cite journal | author = Hermida C, Corrales G, Cañada FJ, Aragón JJ, Fernández-Mayoralas A | title = Optimizing the enzymatic synthesis of beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-xyloses for their use in the evaluation of lactase activity in vivo | journal = Bioorg. Med. Chem. | volume = 15 | issue = 14 | pages = 4836–40 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17512743 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2007.04.067 | url =  [/tpl] and has an optimum pH of 6.[tpl]cite journal | author = Skovbjerg H, Sjöström H, Norén O | title = Purification and characterisation of amphiphilic lactase/phlorizin hydrolase from human small intestine | journal = Eur. J. Biochem. | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 653–61 |date=March 1981 | pmid = 6786877 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05193.x| url =  [/tpl]
In metabolism, the β-glycosidic bond in D-lactose is hydrolyzed to form D-galactose and D-glucose, which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream.  The overall reaction that lactase catalyzes is C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 + heat.  Lactase also catalyzes the conversion of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose.
The catalytic mechanism of D-lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sinnott M | title = Catalytic mechanisms of enzymic glycosyl transfer | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 90 | issue = 7 | pages = 1171–1202 |date=November 1990 | doi = 10.1021/cr00105a006[/tpl]  While the details of the mechanism are uncertain, the stereochemical retention is achieved through a double displacement reaction.  Studies of E. coli lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the β-glycosidic bond.[tpl]cite journal | author = Juers D, Heightman T, Vasella A, McCarter J, Mackenzie L, Withers S, Matthews B | title = A structural view of the action of Escherichia coli (lacZ) β-galactosidase | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 49 |  pages = 14781–94 |date=December 2001 | pmid = 11732897 | doi = 10.1021/bi011727i[/tpl]  The removal of the D-glucose leaving group may be facilitated by Mg-dependent acid catalysis.  The enzyme is liberated from the α-galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water, which produces D-galactose.
Substrate modification studies have demonstrated that the 3’-OH and 2’-OH moieties on the galactopyranose ring are essential for enzymatic recognition and hydrolysis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fernandez P, Cañada F, Jiménez-Barbero J, Martín-Lomas, M | title = Substrate specificity of small-intestinal lactase: Study of the steric effects and hydrogen bonds involved in enzyme-substrate interaction | journal = Carbohydr. Res. | volume = 271 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–42 |date=July 1995 | pmid = 7648581 | doi = 10.1016/0008-6215(95)00034-Q[/tpl]  The 3’-hydroxy group is involved in initial binding to the substrate while the 2’- group is not necessary for recognition but needed in subsequent steps.  This is demonstrated by the fact that a 2-deoxy analog is an effective competitive inhibitor (Ki = 10mM).  Elimination of specific hydroxyl groups on the glucopyranose moiety does not completely eliminate catalysis.

==Structure and biosynthesis==

Pre-pro-lactase, the primary translation product, has a single polypeptide primary structure consisting of 1927 amino acids.  It can be divided into five domains: (i) a 19 amino acid cleaved signal sequence; (ii) a large prosequence domain that is not present in mature lactase; (iii) the mature lactase segment; (iv) a membrane spanning hydrophobic anchor; and (v) a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus.  The signal sequence is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting 215 kDa pro-LPH is sent to the Golgi, where it is heavily glycosylated and proteolytically processed to its mature form.[tpl]cite journal | author = Naim HY, Sterchi E, Lentze M | title = Biosynthesis and maturation of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase in the human small intestinal epithelial cells | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 241 | issue = 2 | pages = 427–34 |date=January 1987 | pmid = 3109375 | pmc = 1147578[/tpl]  The prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the ER, preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing LPH to adopt the necessary 3-D structure to be transported to the Golgi apparatus.[tpl]cite journal | author = Naim HY, Jacob R, Naim H, Sambrook J, Gething M | title = The pro region of human intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 269 | issue = 43 | pages = 26933–43 |date=October 1994 | pmid = 7523415 [/tpl]
Mature human lactase consists of a single 160 kDa polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells.  It is oriented with the N-terminus outside the cell and the C-terminus in the cytosol. LPH contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites.  In the human enzyme, the lactase activity has been connected to Glu-1749 while Glu-1273 is the site of phlorizin hydrolase function.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zecca L, Mesonero J, Stutz A, Poirée J, Guidicelli J, Cursio R, Gloor S, Semenza G | title = Intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH): the two catalytic sites; the role of the pancreas in pro-LPH maturation | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 435 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 225–8 |date=September 1998 | pmid = 9762914 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01076-X[/tpl]

==Genetic expression and regulation==

Lactase is encoded by a single genetic locus on chromosome 2.[tpl]cite journal | author = Troelsen J, Mitchelmore C, Spodsberg N, Jensen A, Norén O, Sjöström H | title = Regulation of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase gene expression by the caudal-related homoeodomain protein Cdx-2 | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 322 | issue = Pt. 3 | pages = 833–838 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9148757 | pmc = 1218263[/tpl]  It is expressed exclusively by mammalian small intestine enterocytes and in very low levels in the colon during fetal development.  Humans are born with high levels of lactase expression.  In most of the world’s population, lactase transcription is down-regulated after weaning, resulting in diminished lactase expression in the small intestine.  Diminished lactase expression causes the common symptoms of adult-type hypolactasia, or lactose intolerance.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Some population segments exhibit lactase persistence resulting from a mutation that is postulated to have occurred 5,000-10,000 years ago, coinciding with the rise of cattle domestication.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bersaglier T, Sabeti P, Patterson N, Vanderploeg T, Schaffner S, Drake J, Rhodes M, Reich D, Hirschhorn J | title = Genetic Signatures of Strong Recent Positive Selection at the Lactase Gene | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 1111–20 |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15114531 | doi = 10.1086/421051 | pmc = 1182075[/tpl]  This mutation has allowed almost half of the world’s population to metabolize lactose without symptoms.  Studies have linked the occurrence of lactase persistence to two different single-nucleotide polymorphisms about 14 and 22 kilobases upstream of the 5’-end of the LPH gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kuokkanen M, Enattah N, Oksanen A, Savilhahtl E, Orpana A, Järvela I | title = Transcriptional regulation of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase gene by polymorphisms associated with adult-type hypolactasia | journal = Gut. | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 647–52 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12692047 | doi = 10.1136/gut.52.5.647 | pmc = 1773659[/tpl]  Both mutations, C→T at position -13910 and G→ A at position -22018, have been independently linked to lactase persistence.[tpl]cite journal | author = Troelsen J | title = Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta. | volume = 1723 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 19–32 |date=May 2005 | pmid = 15777735 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2005.02.003[/tpl]
The lactase promoter is 150 base pairs long and is located just upstream of the site of transcription initiation. The sequence is highly conserved in mammals, suggesting that critical cis-transcriptional regulators are located nearby.  Cdx-2, HNF-1α, and GATA have been identified as transcription factors. Studies of hypolactasia onset have demonstrated that despite polymorphisms there is little difference in lactase expression in infants, showing that the mutations become increasingly relevant during development.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5085(98)70429-9 | author = Wang Y, Harvey C, Hollox E, Phillips A, Poulter M, Clay P, Walker-Smith J, Swallow D | title = The genetically programmed down-regulation of lactase in children | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 1230–6 |date=June 1998 | pmid = 9609760[/tpl] Ιt is hypothesized that developmentally-regulated DNA-binding proteins down-regulate transcription or destabilize mRNA transcripts, causing decreased LPH expression after weaning.

==Industrial use==

Lactase produced commercially can be extracted both from yeasts such as Kluyveromyces fragilis and Kluyveromyces lactis and from fungi, such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae.[tpl]cite journal|last=Seyis I, Aksoz N|year=2004|title=Production of lactase by Trichoderma sp|journal=Food Technol Biotechnol|volume=42|pages=121–124|url=http://public.carnet.hr/ftbrfd/42-121.pdf[/tpl] Its primary commercial use, in supplements such as Lacteeze is to break down lactose in milk to make it suitable for people with lactose intolerance. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not formally evaluated the effectiveness of these products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm153949.htm|title=Agency Response Letter GRAS Notice No. GRN 000132|last=Tarantino, LM|date=2003-12-03|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl]
Lactase is also used to screen for blue white colonies in the MCS of various plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli or other bacteria.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
