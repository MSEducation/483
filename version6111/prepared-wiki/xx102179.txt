CATEGORIES: Multinational aircraft manufacturers

Euroflag was a collaboration of European aerospace companies formed for the development of the Airbus A400M. Development is now carried out by Airbus Military.
The project began as the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, set up in 1982 by; Aérospatiale, British Aerospace, Lockheed and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm to develop a replacement for the C-130 Hercules and C-160 Transall. Varying requirements and the complications of international politics caused slow progress. In 1989, Lockheed left the group, and went on to develop the second-generation C-130J Super Hercules.
With the addition of Alenia Aeronautica and CASA, the Future International Military Airlifter group became Euroflag, European future large aircraft group.
