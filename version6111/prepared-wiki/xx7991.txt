The usual prescribed dosage for these disorders is 200 mg once a day (less commonly, 100 to 400 mg/day in one or two doses). Modafinil has also been linked in many articles to increasing concentration.
For conditions other than shift work sleep disorder, modafinil is normally taken in one dose in the morning or in two doses in the morning and at midday. It is generally not recommended to take modafinil after noon: modafinil is a relatively long-acting drug with a half-life of 15 hours, and taking it during the later part of the day carries a risk of sleep disturbances.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-multiple-sclerosis/what-we-know-about-ms/treatments/medications/modafinil/index.aspx |title=Provigil (modafinil) |publisher=(U.S.) National Multiple Sclerosis Society |accessdate=December 31, 2013[/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=June 2012[/tpl]

A randomized double-blind study of modafinil showed that normal healthy volunteers between the ages of 30-44 showed general improvement in alertness as well as mood. In the three-day study, counterbalanced, randomized, crossover, inpatient trial of modafinil 400 mg was administered as well as a placebo to the control group. The conclusion demonstrated that modafinil may have general mood-elevating effects in particular for the adjunctive use in treatment-resistant depression.

===ADHD===

Modafinil was shown to be an effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with a more favorable overall side effect profile to approved treatments, but it did not receive FDA approval due to concerns over a small number of deaths related to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

===Depersonalization disorder===

Modafinil used alone has been reported to be effective in a subgroup of individuals with depersonalization disorder; the subgroup of people with depersonalization disorder most likely to respond are those who have attentional impairments, under-arousal and hypersomnia. However, clinical trials have not been conducted.[tpl]cite book |author=Mauricio Sierra |title=Depersonalization: A New Look at a Neglected Syndrome |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |date=August 13, 2009 |page=120 |isbn=0-521-87498-X |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qOat1nDGZAkC[/tpl] Dr. Evan Torch calls a combination of an SSRI and Modafinil "the hidden pearl that can really help depersonalization disorder".[tpl]Cite book |title=Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self |year=2006 |page=256 |isbn=978-0-19-517022-1 |author=Simeon D, Abugel J[/tpl]

A group of 72 people with MS of varying degrees of severity tested two different doses of modafinil and an inactive placebo over nine weeks. Fatigue levels were self-evaluated on standardized scales. Participants taking a lower dose of modafinil reported feeling less fatigued and there was a statistically significant difference in fatigue scores for the lower dose versus the placebo.

===Cocaine addiction===

Modafinil is under investigation as a possible method to treat cocaine dependence, for several reasons involving biochemical mechanisms of the two drugs, as well as the observation that clinical effects of modafinil are largely opposite to symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.
The pilot 8-week double-blind study of modafinil for cocaine dependence (2004) produced inconclusive results. The number of cocaine-positive urine samples was significantly lower in the modafinil group as compared to the placebo group in the middle of the trial, but by the end of the 8 weeks the difference stopped being significant. Even before the treatment began, the modafinil group had lower cocaine consumption further confounding the results. As compared to placebo, modafinil did not reduce cocaine craving or self-reported cocaine use, and the physicians ratings were only insignificantly better.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP |title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=205–11 |year=2005 |pmid=15525998 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300600[/tpl] Dan Umanoff, of the National Association for the Advancement and Advocacy of Addicts, criticized the authors of the study for leaving the negative results out of the discussion part and the abstract of the article.[tpl]cite journal |author=Umanoff DF |title=Trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=2298; author reply 2299–300 |year=2005 |pmid=16294193 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300866[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP |title=Reply: Do Self-Reports Reliably Assess Abstinence in Cocaine-Dependent Patients? |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=2299–300 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300867[/tpl]

However, the prescribing information for Provigil notes that "There were no clinically significant differences in body weight change in patients treated with Provigil compared to placebo-treated patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trials."[tpl]cite web |url=http://provigil.com/media/PDFs/medication_guide.pdf |title=Provigil |date=November 1, 2010 |work=Medication Guide |publisher=Cephalon, Inc. |accessdate=December 31, 2013[/tpl]
In experimental studies, the appetite reducing effect of modafinil appears to be similar to that of substituted amphetamines, but, unlike substituted amphetamines, the dose of modafinil that is effective at decreasing food intake does not significantly increase heart rate. Also, an article published in the Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, presented the case of a 280 pound patient (BMI=35.52) who lost 40 pounds over the course of a year on Modafinil (to 30.44 BMI). After three years, his weight stabilized at a 50 pound weight loss (29.59 BMI). The authors conclude that placebo controlled studies should be conducted on using Modafinil as a weight loss agent.[tpl]cite journal |author=Henderson DC, Louie PM, Koul P, Namey L, Daley TB, Nguyen DD |title=Modafinil-associated weight loss in a clozapine-treated schizoaffective disorder patient |journal=Ann Clin Psychiatry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=95–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16075662 |doi=10.1080/10401230590932407[/tpl] Conversely, a US patent (#6,455,588) on using modafinil as an appetite stimulating agent has been filed by Cephalon in 2000.

===Doping agent===

Modafinil has received some publicity in the past when several athletes (such as sprinter Kelli White in 2004, cyclist David Clinger[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usada.org/files/active/arbitration_rulings/AAA-CAS%20decision%20Clinger.pdf |title=Arbitration between United States Anti Doping Agency and David Clinger |publisher=North American Court of Arbitration for Sport Panel |date=March 11, 2010[/tpl] and basketball player Diana Taurasi[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402993.html |publisher=The Washington Post |title=Taurasi tested positive for modafinil |date=December 25, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2013[/tpl] in 2010) were discovered allegedly using it as a performance-enhancing doping agent.

The BALCO scandal brought to light an as-yet unsubstantiated (but widely published) account of Major League Baseball's all-time leading home-run hitter Barry Bonds' supplemental chemical regimen that included Modafinil in addition to anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.[tpl]cite news |title=Bonds Exposed |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/03/06/news.excerpt/1.html |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=July 2, 2011 |date=March 7, 2006[/tpl] Modafinil has been shown to prolong exercise time to exhaustion while performing at 85% of VO2max and also reduces the perception of effort required to maintain this threshold.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jacobs I, Bell DG |year=2004 |title=Effects of acute modafinil ingestion on exercise time to exhaustion |url= |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1078–1082 |doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000128146.12004.4F |pmid=15179180[/tpl] Modafinil was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency "Prohibited List" in 2004 as a prohibited stimulant (see Modafinil Legal Status).

==Military and law enforcement==

Militaries of several countries are known to have expressed interest in Modafinil as an alternative to amphetamine—the drug traditionally employed in combat situations where troops face sleep deprivation, such as during lengthy missions. The French government indicated that the Foreign Legion used modafinil during certain covert operations.

The Canadian Medical Association Journal also reports that Modafinil is used by astronauts on long-term missions aboard the International Space Station. Modafinil is "available to crew to optimize performance while fatigued" and helps with the disruptions in circadian rhythms and with the reduced quality of sleep astronauts experience.[tpl]cite journal |author=Thirsk R, Kuipers A, Mukai C, Williams D |title=The space-flight environment: the International Space Station and beyond |journal=CMAJ |volume=180 |issue=12 |pages=1216–20 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19487390 |pmc=2691437 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081125[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

===Contraindications and warnings===

Literature distributed by maker Cephalon advises that it is important to consult a physician before using Modafinil, particularly for those with:
Modafinil in combination with yohimbine causes a dangerous increase in heart rate and blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lin JS, Roussel B, Akaoka H, Fort P, Debilly G, Jouvet M |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(92)91713-O |title=Role of catecholamines in the modafinil and amphetamine induced wakefulness, a comparative pharmacological study in the cat |journal=Brain Research |date=September 25, 1992 |volume=591 |issue=2 |pages=319–26 |pmid=1359924 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(92)91713-O[/tpl]

===Side effects===

Modafinil is less likely than its parent drug, adrafinil, to cause side-effects such as stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety and (with prolonged use) elevated liver enzymes. Common side effects of modafinil include:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tevausa.com/assets/base/products/pi/Modafinil_PI.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modafinil Information Page |publisher=Teva Pharmaceuticals |date=February 1, 2012[/tpl]
Serious side effects include:
In 2007, the FDA ordered Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet in bold-face print of several serious and potentially fatal conditions attributed to modafinil use, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), DRESS syndrome, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).
The long term safety and effectiveness of modafinil have not been determined.[tpl]cite journal |author=Banerjee D, Vitiello MV, Grunstein RR |title=Pharmacotherapy for excessive daytime sleepiness |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=339–54 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15336235 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2004.03.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079204000243[/tpl]
Modafinil has been reported to be a drug of abuse. If snorted it can lead rapid euphoria and hyperagitation, in addition to significant nasal congestion.Dr.Samuel Malkinson(personal proceedings)
Modafinil may have an adverse effect on hormonal contraceptives, lasting for a month after cessation of dosage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602016.html |title=MedlinePlus Drug Information: Modafinil |publisher=NIH |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070610045952/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602016.html |archivedate=June 10, 2007[/tpl]

===Toxicity===

In mice and rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) of modafinil is approximately or slightly greater than 1250 mg/kg. Oral LD50 values reported for rats range from 1000 mg/kg to 3400 mg/kg. Intravenous LD50 for dogs is 300 mg/kg. Clinical trials on humans involving taking up to 1200 mg/day for 7 to 21 days and known incidents of acute one-time overdoses up to 4500 mg did not appear to cause life-threatening effects, although a number of adverse experiences were observed, including excitation or agitation, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sleep disturbances, nausea, and diarrhea.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4325b_04_08_Modafinil%20Label.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDA Approved Labeling Text for Provigil |date=January 23, 2004 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=December 31, 2013[/tpl] As of 2004, FDA is not aware of any fatal overdoses involving modafinil alone (as opposed to multiple drugs, including modafinil). Consequently, oral LD50 of modafinil in humans is not known exactly. However, it appears to be higher than oral LD50 of caffeine. Bastuji and Jouvet describe a suicide attempt using 4500 mg of modafinil; the patient survived with no long-term effects but temporary nervousness, nausea, and insomnia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bastuji H, Jouvet M |title=Successful treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy with modafinil |journal=Prog.

Modafinil may induce severe dermatologic reactions requiring hospitalization. From the date of initial marketing, December 1998, to January 30, 2007, FDA received six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with modafinil, including erythema multiforme (EM), SJS, TEN, and DRESS involving adult and pediatric patients. The FDA issued a relevant alert.

===Addictive potential===

A National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) study highlighted "the need for heightened awareness for potential abuse of and dependence on modafinil in vulnerable populations" due to the drug's effect on dopamine in the brain's reward center.[tpl]cite journal |author=Volkow ND, Fowler JS, Logan J, Alexoff D, Zhu W, Telang F, Wang GJ, Jayne M, Hooker JM, Wong C, Hubbard B, Carter P, Warner D, King P, Shea C, Xu Y, Muench L, Apelskog-Torres K |title=Effects of modafinil on dopamine and dopamine transporters in the male human brain: clinical implications |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=11 |pages=1148–54 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19293415 |pmc=2696807 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.351[/tpl] However, the synergistic actions of modafinil on both catecholaminergic and histaminergic pathways lower abuse potential as compared to traditional stimulant drugs while maintaining the effectiveness of the drug as a wakefulness promoting agent.

==Measurement in body fluids==

Modafinil and/or its major metabolite, modafinilic acid, may be quantified in plasma, serum or urine to monitor dosage in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a vehicular traffic violation. Instrumental techniques involving gas or liquid chromatography are usually employed for these purposes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wong YN, King SP, Laughton WB, McCormick GC, Grebow PE |title=Single-dose pharmacokinetics of modafinil and methylphenidate given alone or in combination in healthy male volunteers |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=276–82 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9549666 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1998.tb04425.x[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Baselt, Randall C. |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |isbn=0-9626523-7-7 |pages=1152–1153[/tpl] As of 2011, it is not specifically tested for by common drug screens (with the exception of anti-doping screens) and is unlikely to cause false positives for other chemically-unrelated drugs such as substituted amphetamines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.provigilweb.org/drugtest.htm |title=Modafinil in Drug Tests |publisher=ProvigilWeb[/tpl]

Food slows absorption, but does not affect the total AUC. Half-life is generally in the 10–12 hour range, subject to differences in CYP genotypes, liver function and renal function. It is metabolized in the liver, and its inactive metabolite is excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of the unchanged drug ranges from 0% to as high as 18.7%, depending on various factors.
Modafinil's efficacy in improving vigor and well-being in sleep deprivation subjects is dependent on COMT status. Research suggests that individuals with the Val/Val genotype experience a great improvement in their cognitive function, while those with the Met/Met genotype experience very little improvement.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bodenmann S, Xu S, Luhmann UF, Arand M, Berger W, Jung HH, Landolt HP |title=Pharmacogenetics of modafinil after sleep loss: catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype modulates waking functions but not recovery sleep |journal=Clin.

A considered mechanism of action involves brain peptides called orexins, also known as hypocretins. Orexin neurons are found in the hypothalamus but project to many different parts of the brain, including several areas that regulate wakefulness. Activation of these neurons increases dopamine and norepinephrine in these areas, and excites histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons increasing histamine levels there. It has been shown in rats that modafinil increases histamine release in the brain, and this may be a possible mechanism of action in humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ishizuka T, Sakamoto Y, Sakurai T, Yamatodani A |title=Modafinil increases histamine release in the anterior hypothalamus of rats |journal=Neurosci.

Animals with defective orexin systems exhibit signs and symptoms similar to narcolepsy, for treatment of which Modafinil is FDA approved. Modafinil seems to activate these orexin neurons in animal models, which would be expected to promote wakefulness.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chemelli RM, Willie JT, Sinton CM, Elmquist JK, Scammell T, Lee C, Richardson JA, Williams SC, Xiong Y, Kisanuki Y, Fitch TE, Nakazato M, Hammer RE, Saper CB, Yanagisawa M |title=Narcolepsy in orexin knockout mice: molecular genetics of sleep regulation |journal=Cell |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=437–51 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10481909 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81973-X[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Scammell TE, Estabrooke IV, McCarthy MT, Chemelli RM, Yanagisawa M, Miller MS, Saper CB |title=Hypothalamic arousal regions are activated during modafinil-induced wakefulness |journal=J.

Additionally, a study of orexin-knockout mice found that not only did modafinil promote wakefulness in these mice, but that it did so even more effectively than in wild-type mice.[tpl]cite journal |author=Willie JT, Renthal W, Chemelli RM, Miller MS, Scammell TE, Yanagisawa M, Sinton CM |title=Modafinil more effectively induces wakefulness in orexin-null mice than in wild-type littermates |journal=Neuroscience |volume=130 |issue=4 |pages=983–95 |year=2005 |pmid=15652995 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.10.005[/tpl]
Modafinil's substantial, but incomplete, independence from both monoaminergic systems and those of the orexin peptides has proven difficult to explain, in contrast to the better-understood mechanisms of stimulants such as cocaine or substituted amphetamines. Alternative mechanisms of action that have been proposed include the activation of glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tahsili-Fahadan P, Carr GV, Harris GC, Aston-Jones G |title=Modafinil blocks reinstatement of extinguished opiate-seeking in rats: mediation by a glutamate mechanism |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=2203–10 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20631691 |pmc=2939923 |doi=10.1038/npp.2010.94[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Nardone R, Bergmann J, Lochner P, Caleri F, Kunz A, Staffen W, Tezzon F, Ladurner G, Trinka E, Golaszewski S |title=Modafinil reverses hypoexcitability of the motor cortex in narcoleptic patients: a TMS study |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=870–5 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20810311 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.05.007[/tpl]
Enhanced electrotonic coupling by enhancing the effectiveness of direct gap junctions between neurons has also been suggested by several studies. Most neurons are separated by synapses, and communication between cells is accomplished via release and diffusion of neurotransmitters. However, some neurons are directly connected to one another via gap junctions, and it is proposed that modafinil influences the effectiveness of these connections. Modafinil increased activity via this mechanism in the thalamocortical loop, which is critical in organizing sensory input and modulating global brain activity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Urbano FJ, Leznik E, Llinás RR |title=Modafinil enhances thalamocortical activity by increasing neuronal electrotonic coupling |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 |issue=30 |pages=12554–9 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17640897 |pmc=1925036 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705087104[/tpl] Administration of the gap junction blocker mefloquine abolished this effect, providing good evidence that this result was a consequence of improved electrical coupling. The calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor, KN-93, abolishes modafinil's enhancement of electrotonic coupling. Modafinil's effect is mediated, at least in part, by a CaMKII-dependent exocytosis of gap junctions between GABAergic interneurons and possibly even glutamatergic pyramidal cells. Additionally modafinil has pro electrotonic effects on specific populations of neurons in two sites in the reticular activating system. These sites, the subcoeruleus nucleus and the pedunculopontine nucleus, are thought to enhance arousal via cholinergic inputs to the thalamus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Garcia-Rill E, Heister DS, Ye M, Charlesworth A, Hayar A |title=Electrical coupling: novel mechanism for sleep-wake control |journal=Sleep |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1405–14 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18041475 |pmc=2082101 |doi=[/tpl]
Looking more closely at electrotonic coupling, gap junctions permit the diffusion of current across linked cells and result in higher resistance to action potential induction since excitatory post-synaptic potentials must diffuse across a greater membrane area. This means, however, that when action potentials do arise in coupled cell populations, the entire populations tend to fire in a synchronized manner.[tpl]cite news |author=Siegel J |title=Gaps that wake you up |work=Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles |year=2008 |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sites/all/files/sleep-research//2008/08%20modafinil%20gaps%20siegel.pdf[/tpl] Thus enhanced electrotonic coupling results in lower tonic activity of the coupled cells while increasing rhythmicity. Agreeing with data implicating catecholaminergic mechanisms, modafinil increases phasic activity in the locus coeruleus (the source for CNS norepinephrine) while reducing tonic activity with respect to interconnections with the prefrontal cortex.[tpl]cite journal |author=Minzenberg MJ, Watrous AJ, Yoon JH, Ursu S, Carter CS |title=Modafinil shifts human locus coeruleus to low-tonic, high-phasic activity during functional MRI |journal=Science |volume=322 |issue=5908 |pages=1700–2 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19074351 |doi=10.1126/science.1164908[/tpl] This implies an increased signal-to-noise ratio in the circuits connecting the two regions. Greater neuronal coupling theoretically could enhance gamma band rhythmicity, a potential explanation for modafinil's nootropic effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Minzenberg MJ, Carter CS |title=Modafinil: a review of neurochemical actions and effects on cognition |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1477–502 |date=June 2008 |pmid=17712350 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301534 |url=[/tpl] Modafinil's beneficial effects on working memory and motor networks are suggestive of heightened gamma band activity.
Administration of modafinil enhances arousal-specific P13 evoked potentials in a gap-junction dependent manner which provides a direct link between electrotonic coupling and wakefulness.[tpl]cite journal |author=Beck P, Odle A, Wallace-Huitt T, Skinner RD, Garcia-Rill E |title=Modafinil increases arousal determined by P13 potential amplitude: an effect blocked by gap junction antagonists |journal=Sleep |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1647–54 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19090320 |pmc=2603487 |doi= |url=http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=20083728[/tpl] Tying into inconclusive effects on monoamine systems, enhanced electrotonic coupling is thought to reduce activity in localized populations of GABAergic neurons whose normal function is to reduce neurotransmitter release in other cells. For example, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been demonstrated to be the result of decreased GABAergic tone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ferraro L, Tanganelli S, O'Connor WT, Antonelli T, Rambert F, Fuxe K |title=The vigilance promoting drug modafinil increases dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens via the involvement of a local GABAergic mechanism |journal=Eur. J. Pharmacol. |volume=306 |issue=1–3 |pages=33–9 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8813612 |doi=10.1016/0014-2999(96)00182-3[/tpl] Thus, while modafinil's unique stimulant profile features interactions with monoamine systems, these may very well be downstream events secondary to effects on specific, electrotonically-coupled populations of GABAergic interneurons. It is likely that modafinil's exact pharmacology will feature the interaction of direct effects on electrotonic coupling and various receptor-mediated events.
Recently, modafinil was screened at a large panel of receptors and transporters in an attempt to elucidate its pharmacology.[tpl]cite pmid | 19197004[/tpl] Of the sites tested, it was found to significantly act only on the dopamine transporter (DAT), inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine with an IC50 value of 4 μM. Accordingly, it increases locomotor activity and extracellular dopamine concentrations in a manner similar to the selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor vanoxerine, and also blocks methamphetamine-induced dopamine release. As a result, it appears that modafinil exerts its effects by acting as a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, though it cannot be ruled out that other mechanisms may also be at play. On account of its action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and lack of abuse potential, modafinil was suggested as a treatment for methamphetamine addiction by the authors of the study.
The (R)-enantiomer of modafinil, known as armodafinil, has also recently been found to act as a D2 receptor partial agonist, with a Ki of 16 nM, an intrinsic activity of 48%, and an EC50 of 120 nM, in rat striatal tissue. The (S)-enantiomer is inactive with respect to the D2 receptor (Ki > 10,000).[tpl]cite journal |author=Seeman P, Guan HC, Hirbec H |title=Dopamine D2High receptors stimulated by phencyclidines, lysergic acid diethylamide, salvinorin A, and modafinil |journal=Synapse |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=698–704 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19391150 |doi=10.1002/syn.20647[/tpl]

==History==

Modafinil was originally developed in France by neurophysiologist and emeritus experimental medicine professor Michel Jouvet and Lafon Laboratories. Modafinil originated with the late 1970s invention of a series of benzhydryl sulfinyl compounds, including adrafinil, which was first offered as an experimental treatment for narcolepsy in France in 1986. Modafinil is the primary metabolite of adrafinil, lacking the polar -OH group on its terminal amide,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ballas CA, Kim D, Baldassano CF, Hoeh N |title=Modafinil: past, present and future |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=449–57 |date=July 2002 |pmid=19810941 |doi=10.1586/14737175.2.4.449[/tpl] and has similar activity to the parent drug but is much more widely used. It has been prescribed in France since 1994 under the name Modiodal, and in the US since 1998 as Provigil. It was approved for use in the UK in December 2002. Modafinil is marketed in the US by Cephalon Inc., who originally leased the rights from Lafon, but eventually purchased the company in 2001.
Cephalon began to market the R-enantiomer Armodafinil of Modafinil in the U.S. in 2007. After protracted patent litigation and negotiations (see below), generic versions of Modafinil became available in the U.S. in 2012.

==Patent protection and antitrust litigation==

[tpl]US patent|4927855[/tpl] was issued to Laboratoire L. Lafon on May 22, 1990, covering the chemical compound modafinil. After receiving an interim term extension of 1066 days and pediatric exclusivity of six months, it expired on October 22, 2010. On October 6, 1994, Cephalon filed an additional patent, covering modafinil in the form of particles of defined size. That patent, [tpl]US patent|5618845[/tpl] was issued on April 8, 1997, but was reissued in 2002 as RE 37,516, which surrendered the 5618845 patent. With pediatric exclusivity, this patent was due to expire on April 6, 2015.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/03/27/daily13.html |title=Cephalon gets six-month Provigil patent extension |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |date=March 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/patent/index.php?query=RE37516 |title=Details for Patent: RE37516[/tpl]
On December 24, 2002, anticipating the expiration of exclusive marketing rights, generic drug manufacturers Mylan, Teva, Barr, and Ranbaxy applied to the FDA to market a generic form of modafinil.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prescriptionaccess.org/lawsuitssettlements/current_lawsuits?id=0024 |title=Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Lawsuits & Settlements :: Current Lawsuits |publisher=Prescriptionaccess.org |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2012[/tpl] At least one withdrew its application after early opposition by Cephalon based on the '516 patent. There is some question as to whether a particle size patent is sufficient protection against the manufacture of generics. Pertinent questions include whether modafinil may be modified or manufactured to avoid the granularities specified in the new Cephalon patent, and whether patenting particle size is invalid because particles of appropriate sizes are likely to be obvious to practitioners skilled in the art. However, under United States patent law, a patent is entitled to a legal presumption of validity, meaning that in order to invalidate the patent, much more than "pertinent questions" are required.
As of October 31, 2011, U.S. Reissue Patent No. RE 37,516 has been declared invalid and unenforceable.[tpl]cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2006cv02768/205626/514 |title=Document 514 :: APOTEX, INC. v.

Lafon); (3) was obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art under 35 U.S.C. section 103(a); and (4) failed the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. section 112.[tpl]cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2006cv02768/205626/513 |title=Document 513 :: APOTEX, INC. v.

Cephalon made an agreement with four major generics manufacturers Teva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Ranbaxy Laboratories, and Watson Pharmaceuticals between 2005 and 2006 to delay sales of generic modafinil in the US until April 2012 by these companies in exchange for upfront and royalty payments.[tpl]cite web |url=http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/873364/000104746909001690/a2190556z10-k.htm |title=Cephalon Inc., SEC 10K 2008 disclosure |pages=9–10 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2009[/tpl] Litigation arising from these agreements is still pending including an FTC suit filed in April 2008.[tpl]cite news |title=CVS, Rite Aid Sue Cephalon Over Generic Provigil |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=arNEtMSU7D9s |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=August 21, 2009[/tpl] Apotex received regulatory approval in Canada despite a suit from Cephalon's marketing partner in Canada, Shire Pharmaceuticals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=71906 |title=Canada IP Year in Review 2008 |date=January 1, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Shire v.

The following countries do not classify Modafinil as a controlled substance:
Currently, use of modafinil is controversial in the sporting world, with high profile cases attracting press coverage since several prominent American athletes have tested positive for the substance (see Modafinil as a doping agent). Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested that the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offenses. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains that it was related to already banned substances. The Agency added modafinil to its list of prohibited substances on August 3, 2004, ten days before the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Availability==

Modafinil is sold under a wide variety of brand names world wide.
