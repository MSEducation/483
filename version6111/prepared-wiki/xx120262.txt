France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.Statistiques détaillées sur les flux d'immigration[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl], Ined, 2011 It is also Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications in 2005 (a 15% decrease from 2004).[tpl]cite web |publisher=UNHCR |year=2006 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4492677f0.pdf |title=UNHCR Global Report 2005: Western Europe |accessdate=14 December 2006 |format=PDF[/tpl] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration, and immigration remains a contentious political issue.
In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, more than 5 million of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi origin.Être né en France d’un parent immigré, Insee Première, n°1287, mars 2010, Catherine Borrel et Bertrand Lhommeau, InseeRépartition des immigrés par pays de naissance 2008, Insee, October 2011[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=INSEE |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/ipweb/ip1098/ip1098.html#encadre1 |title=Enquêtes annuelles de recensement 2004 et 2005 |date=25 January 2005|accessdate=14 December 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061212212050/http%3A//www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/ipweb/ip1098/ip1098.html#encadre1 |archivedate = 12 December 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly to people from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[ref]

France is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a fairly high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, France was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006, with the natural growth rate (excess of births over deaths) rising to 300,000.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=bilan-demo&page=donnees-detaillees/bilan-demo/pop_age3.htm#evol-gen-sit-demo-fe|title=Évolution générale de la situation démographique, France|first=Government of France|last=INSEE|accessdate=20 January 2011[/tpl] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1332|title=Bilan démographique 2010|first=Government of France|last=INSEE|accessdate=20 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/sd2008/dd/excel/sd2008_t44_fe.xls|title=Tableau 44 – Taux de fécondité générale par âge de la mère|first=Government of France|last=INSEE|accessdate=20 January 2011[/tpl] From 2006 to 2011 population growth was on average +0.6% per year. Immigrants are also major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27% of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and 24% had at least one parent born outside of Europe (parents born in overseas territories are considered as born in France).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=ir-sd20101 |title=Naissances selon le pays de naissance des parents 2010 |publisher=Insee.fr |date= |accessdate=1 October 2013[/tpl]
France is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population) in 2011 being Paris (12,292,900 inh.), Lyon (2,182,482), Marseille (1,721,031), Toulouse (1,250,251), Lille (1,159,547), Bordeaux (1,140,668), Nice (1,003,947), Nantes (884,275), and Strasbourg (763,739).
