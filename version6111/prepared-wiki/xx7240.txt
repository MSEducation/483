 MD5("[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]'''.'''") = 
 e4d909c290d0fb1ca068ffaddf22cbd0
The hash of the zero-length string is:
 MD5("") = 
 d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
The MD5 algorithm is specified for messages consisting of any number of bits; it is not limited to multiples of eight bit (octets, bytes) as shown in the examples above. Some MD5 implementations such as md5sum might be limited to octets, or they might not support streaming for messages of an initially undetermined length

==Simple implementation==

A simple MD5 implementation in C++, that follows the pseudocode:
The message to hash is passed via the first argument of the command line.
