The Maids ([tpl]lang-fr|Les Bonnes|links=no[/tpl]) is a play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. It was first performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed.Frechtman (1989, 33) and Banham (1998, 417). A film adaptation of the play was released in 1974. Swedish composer [tpl]ill|sv|Peter Bengtson[/tpl] adapted the play in 1994 for a chamber opera.

==Background==

Genet loosely based his play on the infamous Papin sisters, Lea and Christine, who brutally murdered their employer and her daughter in Le Mans, France, in 1933, although the play is not the story of the Papin sisters as such. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, Genet's original intention was that the three protagonists, Madame and the maids Solange and Claire, be performed by male actors. Some productions have cast men in the roles, but most have cast women.

==Plot==

Solange and Claire are two housemaids who construct elaborate sadomasochistic rituals when their mistress (Madame) is away. The focus of their role-playing is the murder of Madame and they take turns portraying both sides of the power divide. Their deliberate pace and devotion to detail guarantees that they always fail to actualize their fantasies by ceremoniously "killing" Madame at the ritual's dénouement.
