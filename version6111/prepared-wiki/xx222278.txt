Same-sex marriage in Spain has been legal since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began a campaign for its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples.[tpl]cite web |title=Spain's new government to legalize gay marriage |agency=Reuters |publisher=SignonSanDiego.com |date=2004-04-15 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040415-0750-spain-marriage.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kV80Iu9U |archivedate=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2009-12-14[/tpl] After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day,[tpl]cite news |title=Spain approves liberal gay marriage law |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=2005-07-01 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/07/01/Worldandnation/Spain_approves_libera.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl] making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of Canada.
The ratification of this law was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening of the meaning of marriage.[tpl]cite web |title=Spanish bishops decry legislation weakening marriage |publisher=Catholic World News |date=2005-07-20 |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=38522 |accessdate=2007-01-11[/tpl] Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Manifiesto del Foro de la Familia |publisher=20 Minutos.es |date=2005-06-18 |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/32527/0/manifiesto/foro/familia/ |accessdate=2007-01-12[/tpl] Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain.

Approximately 4,500 same-sex couples married in Spain during the first year of the law.[tpl]cite web |title=Conservative mayor presides over gay wedding |publisher=Euronews |date=2006-07-30 |url=http://www.euronews.net/2006/07/30/conservative-mayor-presides-over-gay-wedding/ |accessdate=2009-10-13[/tpl] Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership.[tpl]cite web |title=Spain's same-sex marriage law applies to foreigners |publisher=Advocate.com |agency=Reuters |date=2005-08-09 |url=http://www.advocate.com/article.aspx?id=37238 |accessdate=2006-12-22[/tpl] At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.
The November 2011 general election delivered a landslide victory to the People's Party, whose leader Mariano Rajoy said that he opposed same-sex marriage, but any decision about repealing the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court.[tpl]cite news |title=Spain gay rights and abortion activists fear backlash|publisher=BBC |date=2011-11-25 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15894536 |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Factbox: Policies of Spain's People's Party |agency=Reuters |date=2011-11-20 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/20/us-spain-election-policies-idUSTRE7AJ08F20111120|accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Mariano Rajoy, New Spain Prime Minister, Opposes Same-Sex Marriage Law|work=Huffington Post |date=2011-11-28 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/21/mariano-rajoy-spain-prime-minister-same-sex-marriage_n_1106185.html|accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] On 6 November 2012, the law was upheld by the Court with 8 support votes and 3 against.Same-sex marriage upheld by Spain's highest court[tpl]es[/tpl] Amplio respaldo del Tribunal Constitucional al matrimonio homosexual[tpl]es[/tpl] SENTENCIA Minister of Justice Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón announced that, the government will abide the ruling and the law will not be repealed.[tpl]es[/tpl] Gallardón no tocará la ley vigente[tpl]es[/tpl] Gallardón: El Gobierno "no modificará" la ley de matrimonio homosexual[tpl]es[/tpl] El Gobierno mantendrá el matrimonio homosexual tal y como lo ha validado el TC

==History==

During the 1990s and early 2000s, several city councils and autonomous communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although the effect was mainly symbolic.[tpl]cite web |title=EQUALITY FOR LESBIANS AND GAY MEN A relevant issue in the civil and social dialogue |publisher=THE INTERNATIONAL LESBIAN AND GAY ASSOCIATION |date=June 1998 |url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/content/download/409/1857/file/1998%20Equality%20in%20EU%20English.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-13|format=PDF[/tpl] Registries were created in 12 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003) and Cantabria (2005).Same-sex couples in Spain. Historical, contextual and symbolic factors[tpl]es[/tpl] Ley de la C.A. de Cantabria 1/2005, de 16 de mayo, de parejas de hecho de la Comunidad Autónoma de Cantabria Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.[tpl]cite web|title=World legal survey:Spain |publisher=The International Lesbian and Gay Association |url=http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/europe/spain.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070328221007/http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/europe/spain.htm|archivedate=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl]
The Socialist Party (PSOE) manifesto for the 2004 general election included the pledge of amending the Civil Code to legalize same-sex marriage, granting it the same status as heterosexual marriage in order to "ensure full social and legal equality for lesbians and gays".[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |date=2004 |title=Merecemos una España mejor.

(...) As a result, we will modify the Civil Code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects over inheritance, labor rights and social security protection".  On 30 June 2004, the then Minister of Justice Juan Fernando López Aguilar announced that the Congress of Deputies had provisionally approved a government plan for legislation to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples. López Aguilar also announced two propositions, introduced by the regional Convergence and Union party of Catalonia: one introduced legal status for both opposite- and same-sex common-law unions (parejas de hecho, "de facto unions"), while the other permitted transgendered people to legally change their name and sex designation without the requirement of surgery.[tpl]cite web|title=Spanish lawmakers approve bill to let transsexuals change gender without surgery |publisher=Advocate.com|date=2006-11-09 |url=http://www.advocate.com/article.aspx?id=35289|accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl]

With the final approval, and enactment of the bill on 2 July 2005, Spain became the third country in the world to formally legalize same-sex marriages nationwide, after the Netherlands and Belgium.[tpl]cite web|last=Woolis|first=Daniel|title=Spain's Gay Marriage Law Goes Into Effect|publisher=365GAY.com|date=2005-06-02|url=http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/07/070205spain.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050706033344/http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/07/070205spain.htm|archivedate=2005-06-06|accessdate=2006-12-20[/tpl]

In spite of these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if children were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |title=El Gobierno revisará la discriminación de las lesbianas con bebés 'in vitro' |last=De Cózar |first=Álvaro |work=El País |date=2006-10-18|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Gobierno/revisara/discriminacion/lesbianas/bebes/in/vitro/elpporsoc/20061018elpepisoc_7/Tes |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the government amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother to be regarded as a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |title=Lesbianas podrán ser madres de los hijos "in vitro" de sus parejas|publisher=Terra |date=2006-11-07|url=http://terranoticias.terra.es/sociedad/articulo/lesbianas_podran_madres_hijos_in_1194087.htm |accessdate=2007-08-20[/tpl]

===Ratification of Law 13/2005===

The projected bill announced on 30 June 2004 by the Minister of Justice was studied by the General Council of the Judiciary.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|language=Spanish |title=El Consejo de Ministros aprobará el matrimonio homosexual|publisher=Agencia Pulsar|date=2004-12-29|url=http://www.agenciapulsar.org/nota.php?id=3469|accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] Although the General Council admitted that the existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned, it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same-sex couples (including collateral adoption). It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution, and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means, such as the extension of civil unions.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title=El CGPJ pide que se paralice la reforma que permitirá los matrimonios entre homosexuales |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2005-01-15|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/01/15/espana/1105797044.html |accessdate=2007-01-26[/tpl]
Despite this negative report, the government presented the bill to Congress on 1 October 2004. With the exception of the People's Party and members of the Democratic Union of Catalonia, the different parliamentary parties favoured the reform. On 21 April 2005, Congress approved the bill, with 183 "yes" and 136 "no" votes and 6 abstentions (including a member of the People's Party).[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title=El Congreso aprueba el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2005-04-22|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/04/21/espana/1114087944.html |accessdate=2007-01-26[/tpl] The bill to allow same-sex marriage in Spain was short: it added a new paragraph to article 44 of the civil code, saying that Matrimony shall have the same requisites and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title=El Congreso aprueba la ley que permite casarse a los homosexuales|pages= |publisher=20 minutos|date=2005-04-22|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/18537/0/congreso/ley/homosexual/ |accessdate=2007-01-29[/tpl]
In accordance with constitutional provisions, the text approved by the Congress was then submitted to the Senate for final approval, change or veto. On 21 June 2005 experts were called to the Senate to debate the issue. The expert's opinions were diverse; some stated that gay adoption had no effect on a child's development, except for perhaps a higher tolerance towards homosexuality.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Psicólogos y juristas avalan adopción y correcto desarrollo del niño|publisher=Web de Hogar|date=2005-06-20|url=http://www.webdehogar.com/noticias/0506/20154220.htm|accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] However, psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, called by the People's Party as an expert, called homosexuality a pathology and emotive disorder. Among other assertions that generated debate, he claimed that "many homosexuals have rape abuse antecedents since childhood" and that homosexuals generally come from families with "hostile, alcoholic and distant" fathers, and mothers who were "over protective" toward boys and "cold" toward girls. Prominent People's Party members later rejected Polaino's assertions.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title=Dirigentes del PP discrepan del experto citado por su partido que tachó de enfermos a los gays |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2005-06-21|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/21/espana/1119349159.html |accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl]

The Senate vetoed the text submitted by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held the majority of the seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 "yes" and 119 "no" votes and 2 abstentions.[tpl]cite web|title=Spanish Senate vetoes gay marriage law |publisher=Catholic News Agency|date=2005-06-23 |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4213|accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl] As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005 it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 "yes" votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 "no" votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society.[tpl]cite news |title=Spain Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage|last=Green|first=Jennifer|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2005-07-01|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063000245.html |accessdate=2007-01-30[/tpl] Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.[tpl]cite news |title=Spain Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage|last=Green|first=Jennifer|work=Washington Post|date=2005-07-01|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063000245.html |accessdate=2007-01-30[/tpl]
When the media asked King Juan Carlos if he would sign the bill that was being debated in the Cortes Generales, he answered that he was the King of Spain, not of Belgium[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]a reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title=Don Juan Carlos, sobre el matrimonio gay: 'Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica' |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2006-05-13|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/05/12/espana/1115917538.html |accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl] For the king to withhold his royal assent would effect a veto of the legislation.

==Reactions==

The bill's passage was met with concern by Catholic authorities, including Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, even if it meant losing their jobs.[tpl]cite news|title=Vatican condemns Spain gay bill|publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4473001.stm|accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl]
Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Crown Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe this may be due to the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues.[tpl]cite news |last=McLean|first=Renwick |title=Spain Legalizes Gay Marriage; Law Is Among the Most Liberal |pages= |work=The New York Times|date=2005-06-01|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/international/europe/01spain.html?ex=1277870400&en=ee2765acf7bebdbb&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=2007-01-26[/tpl] A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality.[tpl]cite news |last=Tremlett|first=Giles |title=Bishops to lead gay law protest|pages= |publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-06-17|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jun/17/gayrights.religion |accessdate=2007-01-26[/tpl] A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.[tpl]cite news |title=Spain approves gay marriage bill |publisher=BBC|date=2004-10-01|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3706414.stm |accessdate=2007-01-30[/tpl]
Prime Minister Zapatero responded to Church criticism by saying:

On 19 June 2005 there was a public protest against the law. Protesters — led by People's Party members, Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum (Foro Español de la Familia) — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they considered an attack on the traditional family; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |last=Arroyo |first=Marta |title=Una multitud pide que se retire la ley del Matrimonio Homosexual |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2006-06-20 |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/18/espana/1119111135.html |accessdate=2007-01-27[/tpl] Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with Gay Pride Day, FELGT (Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=La marcha del Orgullo Gay celebra la Ley del Matrimonio Homosexual|publisher=Telefónica de España, S.A.U.|date=2005-02-07|url=http://terranoticias.terra.es/sociedad/articulo/orgullo_gay_marcha_celebra_ley_382594.htm |accessdate=2006-12-22[/tpl][tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Multitudinaria marcha del Orgullo Gay festeja Matrimonio Homosexual|publisher=Terra|date=2005-02-07|url=http://terranoticias.terra.es/sociedad/articulo/multitudinaria_marcha_orgullo_gay_festeja_383264.htm |accessdate=2006-12-27[/tpl] Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.
Spanish bishops also claimed that the government, by extending the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of gay couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed for a long time in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre, Asturias, Aragon, the Basque Country, and Catalonia before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=La sentencia que concede la adopción a una pareja de lesbianas desata un intenso debate social |publisher=Caja Madrid|date= |url=http://cajamadrid.cronicasocial.com/anteriores/pg040223/nacional/mujer/mujer1.htm|accessdate=2007-01-21[/tpl]
These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |last=Lantigua |first=Isabel F |title=Los psicólogos niegan que la homosexualidad sea una enfermedad |pages= |publisher=El Mundo|date=2005-06-21|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundosalud/2005/06/21/neuropsiquiatria/1119356356.html |accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl]
