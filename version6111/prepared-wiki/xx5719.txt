===Biofuel===

In 2011, KLM announced plans to start to use recycled cooking oil as biofuel to power more than 200 flights from Amsterdam to Paris. On 19 June 2012, KLM made the world's first-ever transatlantic KLM flight fueled partly by sustainable biofuels to Rio de Janeiro. This was the longest distance that any aircraft had flown on biofuels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.klmtakescare.com/en/content/biofuel-flight-to-rio |title=Biofuel flight to Rio |publisher=Klmtakescare.com |accessdate=2012-11-29[/tpl] In March 2013, KLM announced that it would begin weekly flights from John F.
