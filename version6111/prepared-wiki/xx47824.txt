Jelly Babies are a type of soft confectionery that are shaped as babies in a variety of colours.

==About==

The sweets were originally called "unclaimed babies", invented in 1864 by an Austrian man working at Fryers of Lancashire.Sweets: The History of Temptation, Tim Richardson, Random House, 2002, ISBN 9780553814460 In 1918 they were produced by Bassett's in Sheffield as "Peace Babies" to mark the end of World War I. Production was suspended during World War II due to wartime shortages. In 1953 the product was relaunched as "Jelly Babies". In March 1989 Bassett's were taken over by Cadbury-Schweppes.
Each Bassett's jelly baby now has an individual name and shape, colour and flavour: Brilliant (red - strawberry), Bubbles (yellow - lemon), Baby Bonny (pink - raspberry), Boofuls (green - lime), Bigheart (black - blackcurrant) and Bumper (orange). The introduction of different shapes and names was an innovation, circa 1989, prior to which all colours of jelly baby were a uniform shape. In 2007, Bassett's jelly babies changed to include only natural colours and ingredients.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/The-Big-Picture/Confectionery-giants-cut-use-of-artificial-additives|title=Confectionery giants cut use of artificial additives[/tpl]
There are currently several other brands of jelly babies, as well as supermarket own brands. A line of sweets called Jellyatrics were launched by Barnack Confectionery Ltd to commemorate the Jelly Baby's 80th birthday.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/jellyatrics-revive-those-sweet-memories-415459.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Nicole | last=Martin | title=Jellyatrics revive those sweet memories | date=18 March 1999[/tpl]
Like most other gummi sweets, they contain gelatin. Jelly babies manufactured in the United Kingdom tend to be dusted in starch which is left over from the manufacturing process where it is used to aid release from the mould.  Jelly babies of Australian manufacture generally lack this coating.
Jelly babies are similar in appearance to gummi bears, which are better known outside the United Kingdom, though the texture is different — jelly babies have a firmer outer layer and a softer, less rubbery centre, making them more similar to the American jelly bean or Belgian Cuberdon.

In the British television programme Doctor Who, jelly babies were often mentioned in the classic series. First seen being consumed by the Second Doctor, they became most associated with Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor, who had a predilection for offering them to strangers in order to defuse tense situations. The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Eleventh Doctors also offered them up in different episodes. The Doctor's nemesis the Master in "The Sound of Drums" offers them to his wife on board the Valiant.
