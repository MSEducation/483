Tisiphone (Ancient Greek: Τισιφόνη, "avenging murder") is the name of two figures in Greek mythology. 

==The Fury==

Tisiphone was one of the Erinyes or Furies, and sister of Alecto and Megaera. She was the one who punished crimes of murder: parricide, fratricide and homicide. In Book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, she is described as the guardian of the gates of Tartarus, 'clothed in a blood-wet dress'.A.S.Kline's translation
Between 1779-1816 there was a British navy fireship (later converted to a sloop) named after the goddess.http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=16287.0 Kent History Forum

==Daughter of Manto and Alcmaeon==

Tisiphone was the daughter of Alcmaeon and Manto.  Alcmaeon accidentally left his children, Tisiphone and Amphilochus, with Creon. Creon's wife sold Tisiphone into slavery, envious of her beauty.  She did not realize that Tisiphone's purchaser was acting on behalf of her father.  When Alcmaeon returned, he rescued his daughter and recovered his son.
