[[Schlosser's base]]

CATEGORIES: Bases

Schlosser's base describes various superbasic mixtures of an alkyllithium compound and a potassium alkoxide. Commonly, the mixture is formed by combining n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide in a one-to-one ratio. The reagent is named after Manfred Schlosser, though he uses the term LICKOR superbase (LIC denoting the alkyllithium, and KOR denoting the potassium alkoxide).
