The National Synagogue or Ohev Sholom Talmud Torah (Hebrew for Lovers of Peace and Study of Torah); OSTT is the oldest Orthodox synagogue in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite news |first=Caryle |last=Murphy |title=A Rabbi's Unorthodox Revival |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21499-2004Sep14.html |work=The Washington Post |date=2004-09-15 |page=B01[/tpl]
The synagogue is located in the neighborhood of Shepherd Park. It was formed from the merger of two earlier synagogues, Ohev Sholom and Talmud Torah.

==Name==

The copyrighted name "The National Synagogue" has been controversial.  While it echoes the name of the Washington National Cathedral, it does not signify the same relationship to the federal government.  The cathedral's charter was passed by an act of the United States Congress. The National Synagogue has no such governmental designation.

==History==

Ohev Sholom was founded in 1886, and the father of Al Jolson once served as cantor.  The combined Ohev Sholom Talmud Torah was formed as a 1958 merger between the Ohev Sholom and Talmud Torah Congregations, as both congregations relocated from southwest DC to the northern reaches of the city and built a combined building, which opened in 1960.  Membership fell in the late twentieth century as Jewish families moved to the suburbs.  The synagogue opened a branch composed largely of younger families in Olney, MD in 1994,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ostns.org/history.shtml | title=Synagogue History | accessdate=April 11, 2011 | publisher=Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue[/tpl] which became the separate congregation Ohev Sholom Talmud Torah Congregation of Olney between 2002 and 2005.[tpl]cite web |title=Ohev Sholom in name only: Ohev Sholom (Washington, D.C.) rift drags on, District Appeals Court sends synagogue factions to religious court |url=http://jewishwhistleblower.blogspot.com/2005/03/ohev-shalom-in-name-only-ohev-sholom.html |publisher=The Jewish Whistleblower |date=17 March 2005 |accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl]  Only a few, mostly older families, were left at the Washington DC location.  
Early in the new century, a number of families who preferred urban life decided to attempt to revive Orthodox Jewish life in the Shepherd Park neighborhood.  Hiring a new rabbi, Shmuel Herzfeld who was formerly the associate rabbi at the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale synagogue headed by Rabbi Avi Weiss, was central to this effort.[tpl]cite news |first=Aaron |last=Leibel |title=With rabbi's hiring, OSTT continues efforts to grow |newspaper=Washington Jewish Week |date=2004-01-22 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-947162011.html[/tpl] The decision to rename the synagogue "The National Synagogue" in 2005 drew a good deal of criticism, not least from among other Jews, who felt that the name was a marketing label inaccurately implying a special position of leadership in the American Jewish community. Rabbi Herzfeld defended the choice on the grounds that the name makes clear that the synagogue is welcoming and open to everyone.[tpl]cite news |title=An Orthodox blossoming In District, traditional offerings grow, as do names |first=Paula |last=Amann |work=Washington Jewish Week |date=2005-03-03[/tpl]  Herzfeld insisted that in spite of the copyright on the phrase, other synagogues should feel free to use the same label.
The synagogue is noted as a particularly vibrant and fast-growing institution.Andrea Useem. “Tradition for a New Generation, New Rabbi brings Life Back to 119 year old synagogue”.

Under the Rabbi Herzfeld's leadership, it has taken a number of unusual initiatives, including advertising its services with leaflets and television and radio spots, holding free Yom Kippur services, and the installation of ramps and elevators to ensure that the synagogue is genuinely open to everyone.[tpl]cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1209933961.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+3%2C+2007&author=Jacqueline+L.+Salmon+-+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&desc=Barriers+to+Worship%3B+Congregations+Increasingly+Seek+Ways+to+Improve+Access+For+People+With+Disabilities+To+Participate+in+Services | title=Barriers to Worship; Congregations Increasingly Seek Ways to Improve Access For People With Disabilities To Participate in Services | newspaper=Washington Post | date=Feb 3, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2011 | pages=B9 | first=Jacqueline L. | last=Salmon |postscript=,[/tpl] reprinted here.  The National Synagogue has unusual financing for an American synagogue;  it is primarily funded by large donations rather than member dues, and so member dues are much smaller than at other area synagogues, while outreach efforts are much greater.
