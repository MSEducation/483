Although it has not been re-released due to changes in the originating duo, it has retained its popularity over the years. 
It has been included on the two-disc album Club Nation America by Johnny Vicious and Tall Paul.[tpl]cite web|title=Various - Club Nation America|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/133003|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2008-03-19[/tpl] 

One of the show points of this tune is the silence transitioning two passages of the tune.  Trance is marked by repetitious rhythmic electronic beat and here it is played in point and counterpoint.
As a result of the song's success in Japan, it was included on beatmania IIDX 7th Style as a playable song with two other songs licensed by Avex.
Svenson & Gielen have also made a music video of their performance at a 1000-member concert in  Europe.
