Tsipouro ([tpl]lang-el|τσίπουρο[/tpl]) is a pomace brandy from Greece and in particular Thessaly (Tsipouro Tyrnavou), Epirus, Macedonia, Mani Peninsula, and the island of Crete (where Cretans call it tsikoudia). Tsipouro is a strong distilled spirit containing 40-45% alcohol by volume and is produced from the pomace (the residue of the wine press). 
It comes in two types: pure or anise-flavored. 

==History==

According to tradition, the first production of tsipouro was the work of some Greek Orthodox monks. This occurred during the 14th century on Mount Athos in Macedonia, Greece.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl].

==Method of production==

Ripe dark grapes are passed through crusher/destemmers. The mass is left to settle for a few days, just enough to get fermentation started. Formerly, wine would be collected and only the solid residue would be used for tsipouro in an attempt to get the most out of the plant. [tpl]refnec|This method is outdated and modern producers tend to use the whole grape mass, which is a huge improvement in quality.|date=November 2013[/tpl] 
In the next stage, the mass is fed into distillation units, where temperature and pressure are closely monitored. The first and last distinct batches (the 'head' and the 'tail') are discarded. Only the intermediate batch (known as the 'heart') is kept to make tsipouro. This process is repeated at least once more, giving a double or multiple distilled result.
Finally, the distillate is left to settle and mature either in stainless tanks. It can also be aged in wooden barrels to give aged tsipouro, a relatively new beverage that can be compared to whiskey. 

==Serving==

Depending on the time of year, tsipouro is used either as refreshment or as a hot beverage, and depending on the time of day, it replaces the drinking of coffee or wine. Tsipouro and tsikoudia, as with all alcoholic beverages in Greece, always seem to coincide with various social gatherings.
According to Greek manufacturers, the best way to enjoy tsipouro is straight from the freezer. Some people prefer to either dilute with water or add ice, although ice causes a violent heat transfer that may undermine the fine structure of the liquid. 
Tsipouro is usually served in shot glasses with meze (small side dish)such as be nuts, dried fruit, raisins, cheese, olives, seafood, meat, halva, paximadi (rusk), etc.
In 2006, Greece filed a request to recognize tsipouro as a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) product.[tpl]cite news |title=Greece is claiming tsipouro |author= |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=68915 |newspaper=Kathimerini |location=Athens, Greece |language=English Edition |date=21 April 2006 |accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl]

==Relation to ouzo==

Although most Greeks prefer pure tsipouro, anise-flavored is also available, produced especially in Central Macedonia, Chalkidiki, and Thessaly. Anise-flavored tsipouro and ouzo have almost identical taste but vary enormously in their method of production. The alcohol used to produce ouzo is 96% ABV ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin (Rectified spirit obtained from agricultural products) and therefore does not retain the flavours of the primary distilled products, whereas the lower degree of distillation of Tsipouro allows it to retain the aroma of the pomace.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsipouro.gr/lang1/index.html |title= Tsipouro : Greek traditional distillation from grapes |work=www.tsipouro.gr |publisher=Winery of Tirvanos |accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nestorimports.com/idoniko-tsipouro-anise/ |title=Idoniko Tsipouro Anise |publisher=Nestor Imports |accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.greekwines.com/spirits.htm |title=Traditional Greek Spirits |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212175404/www.greekwines.com/company.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |publisher=Vergina Imports |accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl]
