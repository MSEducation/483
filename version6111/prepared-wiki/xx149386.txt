The Tashahhud ([tpl]lang-ar|تشهد[/tpl]) is the portion of salat (obligatory prayer) where the Muslim kneels on the ground facing Qibla in Mecca.
التحيات لله  والصلوات  والطيبات، السلام عليك أيها النبي  ورحمة الله
وبركاته، السلام علينا و على عباد الله الصالحين، أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، وأشهد أن محمدا عبده و رسوله
This translates as:
"Salutations to God and prayers and good deeds. Peace be upon  you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and his blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and his messenger."

This translates as:

"Blessed salutations, prayers, good deeds to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and his blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His  messenger."

الحمد لله، أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له
وأشهد أنّ محمدا عبده ورسوله. اللهم صلى على محمد وآل محمد

This translates as:

"Praise to God, I testify that there is no god but God the one and no partner to him, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His prophet. O God bestow blessings upon Muhammad and the household of Muhammad"
