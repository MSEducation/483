Opal Coast (fr: Côte d'Opale) is a touristic coast in northern France, on the English Channel.

==Geography==

The Côte d'Opale is a French coastal region bordering Belgium, situated in front of the cliffs of the southeast of England, lining the English Channel and the North Sea.
The Côte d'Opale extends over 120 km of coast between the Belgian border and the border with Picardy.
The Côte d'Opale gathers varied landscapes like beaches, dunes, swamps, estuaries or cliffs.
The Côte d'Opale is marked by the presence of two big cliffs situated between Calais and Boulogne : the Cap Gris Nez (literally grey nose cape in English) reaching 50 m and the Cap Blanc Nez (literally white nose cape in English) reaching 132 m. They are the French points of the coast the closest to England.

Turner, Carolus-Duran, Maurice Boitel and Eugène Boudin.
