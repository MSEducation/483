One of Boston's creations, the house he designed in 1959 for artist Elisabeth Vellacott, sister of classical scholar Philip Vellacott, served as the basis of the home in Rebecca Stott's 2007 novel Ghostwalk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/jun/27/writers-rooms-frances-spalding|title=Writers' rooms: Frances Spalding|last=Spalding|first=Frances|date=27 June 2009 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 January 2010|location=United Kingdom[/tpl]

==Illustrator career==

In 1939, while Boston was still at university, Lucy Boston bought The Manor, which was to so suffuse the Green Knowe books. Mother and son worked together to refurbish the house, which dates to the time of the Norman Conquest.
Boston's mother based the fictional character Tolly (short for Toseland) on her son Peter. Visitors to the Manor can still see many of the rooms and items that inspired Peter Boston's illustrations. These include the mirror that first greets Tolly and Tolly's magical Japanese mouse of carved wood, which Diana Boston called "the most important thing in the house." Mrs. Boston said that the sight of the toy, a favorite feature of the novels, would provoke adults to nostalgic tears.
In addition to illustrating his mother's books for children, Boston illustrated the dust jackets of L.M. Boston's adult books, Yew Hall (1954) and Persephone (1969).
