The Electoral Leftist Alliance ([tpl]lang-de|Wahlb√ºndnis Linke[/tpl]) or Left ([tpl]lang-de|Linke[/tpl]) is a  movement of Marxist-Leninist, Maoist and Trotskyist organisations in Austria which was founded by the Communist Initiative, the Socialist Left Party, the League of the Socialist Revolution and other left-wing movements and activists in the run-up to the 2008 election. The Communist Party of Austria was also invited to participate, but it stated that the timeframe was too short and that it would stand on its own instead, while supporting the unification of the left in principle.
