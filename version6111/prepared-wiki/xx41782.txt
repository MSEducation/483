Macrophages, sometimes called macrophagocytes  ([tpl]lang-el|big eaters[/tpl], from makros "large" + phagein "eat"; abbr. MΦ), are cells produced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues. Macrophages were discovered by Ilya Mechnikov, a Russian bacteriologist, in 1884.[tpl]cite book |author=Semyon Zalkind |title=Ilya Mechnikov: His Life and Work |publisher=Honolulu, Hawaii: University Press of the Pacific | year=2001 | isbn=0-89875-622-7 |pages=78, 210[/tpl] Human macrophages are about [tpl]convert|21|um[/tpl] in diameter.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krombach, F., Münzing, S., Allmeling, A.

Macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize one amino acid, arginine, to either a "killer" molecule (nitric oxide) or a "repair" molecule (ornithine).  Macrophages predominantly expressing the killer phenotype are called M1 macrophages, whereas those involved in tissue repair are called M2 macrophages.[tpl]cite pmid|23428224[/tpl] Their role is to phagocytose, or engulf and then digest, cellular debris and pathogens,  either as stationary or as mobile cells.  They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to pathogens. They are specialized phagocytic cells that attack foreign substances, infectious microbes and cancer cells through destruction and ingestion. They are present in all living tissues, and have a function in regeneration.
Macrophages can be identified by specific expression of a number of proteins including CD14, CD40, CD11b, CD64, F4/80 (mice)/EMR1 (human), lysozyme M, MAC-1/MAC-3 and CD68 by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining.[tpl]cite journal |author=Khazen, W., M'bika, J.

==Life cycle==

When a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel, a process known as the leukocyte extravasation, it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage. Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis, triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells, pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site. At some sites such as the testis, macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation.
Unlike short-lived neutrophils, macrophages survive longer in the body up to a maximum of several months.
