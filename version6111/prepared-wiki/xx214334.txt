[[Kampfgeschwader 54]]

CATEGORIES: Luftwaffe Wings

Kampfgeschwader 54 "Totenkopf"([tpl]IPA-de| kampfɡəʃvaːdɐ  fiːɐ ʊntfʏnftsɪç [/tpl]) (KG 54) was a Luftwaffe bomber wing during World War II .
Its units participated on all of the fronts in the European Theatre until it was disbanded in May 1945. It operated two of the major German bomber types; the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. Its unit insignia, sometimes displayed on a shield-like device, but more often depicted over a normal camouflage pattern, bore a strikingly close graphic resemblance to that of the 3rd SS Panzer Division, known by the same name.
