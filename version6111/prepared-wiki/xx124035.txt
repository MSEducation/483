"If You're Gone" is the title of a song by the rock band Matchbox Twenty. It was released in October 2000 as the second single off Mad Season. The song, written by Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas, became a hit on adult contemporary radio, spending two weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications) It also reached #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, the band's second best-ranking song, preceded by the single "Bent" from the same album.  Rob Thomas never dreamed of the song going out on an album, let alone being a huge success. The horn-driven outro of "If You're Gone" borrows heavily (note for note) from "When the Rainbow Comes" by World Party from their 1990 release Goodbye Jumbo.

==Background and writing==

Thomas told Billboard magazine that he wrote the song right after he met his future wife. "We were separated for a few weeks and were on the phone all the time, and I was thinking, 'I met this wonderful person,' and I wondered if everything I was going through Matchbox Twenty's success was going to make it too crazy to build a relationship."

==Music video==

The music video for the song, directed by Pedro Romhanyi, is filmed completely in black and white and features only the band (along with two trumpet players and a trombone player), performing at night on the rooftop of a building in the central business district of downtown Los Angeles. Halfway through the video, Rob Thomas steps onto the edge of the roof and spreads his arms like he's going to jump. He doesn't; he turns around and goes back to where the band is playing. Near the end of the video, the sun dawns and illuminates the rooftop and surrounding buildings of the city.
