Regular script ([tpl]zh|s=楷书|t=楷書|p=kǎishū[/tpl]; Hepburn: kaisho), also called 正楷 ([tpl]zh|p=zhèngkǎi[/tpl]), 真書 (zhēnshū), 楷體 (kǎitǐ) and 正書 (zhèngshū), is the newest of the Chinese script styles (appearing by the Cao Wei dynasty ca. 200 CE and maturing stylistically around the 7th century), hence most common in modern writings and publications (after the Ming and sans-serif styles, used exclusively in print).
