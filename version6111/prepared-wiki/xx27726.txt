Aholibamah (Hebrew אָהֳלִיבָמָה, Standard Hebrew Oholivama, Tiberian Hebrew ʼOhŏlîḇāmā; "My tabernacle of/is height/exaltation" or "Tent of the High Place"Phillips, J. Exploring Genesis: an expository commentary, (ISBN 0-8254-3488-2, ISBN 978-0-8254-3488-4), 2001, p. 284), is an eight time referenced matriarch in the biblical record. Book of GenesisGenesis 36:2,5,14,18,25,41,& 1CH 1:52 ). 
Aholibamah was the daughter of Anah of Zibeon the Hivite. Her maternal grandfather was Zibeon the Hivite son of Seir the Horite.[tpl]bible verse||Genesis|36:2|HE[/tpl] She was one of two Canaanite women who married Esau, the son of Isaac, when he was in his forties. However, her In-Laws were greatly opposed to this union.[tpl]bible verse||Genesis|26:35|HE[/tpl] So as to pacify them, Esau changed her name to the Hebraic name "Judith".Phillips, Exploring Genesis, p. 284, 285
Aholibamah bore three children to Esau who would become Dukes of three Edomite tribes. Her Hittite name was also used to name a mountainous district in Edom, probably near Mount Hor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Children:
Anah in Genesis 36:2,14,18,25 mentioned above is the same as the Anah, the son of Zibeon in verse 24. In verse 2 and 14 it says, "Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;." Some are confused with this wording and believe that it is saying that Anah is a daughter of Zibeon. In verse 24 it clearly says that Zibeon's two sons were Ajah and Anah. Since the original text does not have a literal word for "grand daughter" the word "bath" was used in both cases. But this sentence is stating that Aholibamah is the daughter of Anah and the "granddaughter" of Zibeon, not that Anah is the daughter of Zibeon.

In The Red Tent, Oholibamah is mentioned as having died in childbirth, leaving only Adah and Basemath, both bitter rivals for Esau's affections.
