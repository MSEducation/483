Thomas Grey Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton (14 August 1749 – 23 September 1814), known as Sir Thomas Grey Egerton, Bt from 1756 to 1784, was a British peer.
Egerton was the son of Sir Thomas Grey Egerton, 6th Baronet, and his wife Catherine Copley. On his father's side he descended from Sir Rowland Egerton, 1st Baronet, who married Bridget Grey, sister and co-heir of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton, who was attainted in 1603 with his title forfeited. Egerton sat as a Member of Parliament for Lancashire from 1772 to 1784. The latter year the barony of Grey de Wilton held by his ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Grey de Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County Hereford. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1801 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Grey de Wilton and Earl of Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Hereford, with remainder to the second and the younger sons successively of his daughter Eleanor, wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster.

Lord Wilton married Eleanor Assheton, daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, in 1769. He died in September 1814, aged 65. On his death the Barony of Grey de Wilton became extinct as he had no sons while the Baronetcy was passed on to a distant relative. He was succeeded in the Viscountcy and Earldom according to the special remainder by his grandson Lord Thomas Grosvenor Egerton.
