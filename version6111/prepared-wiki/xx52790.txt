[[Levi-Civita connection]]

CATEGORIES: Riemannian geometry, Connection (mathematics)

In Riemannian geometry, the Levi-Civita connection is a specific connection on the tangent bundle of a manifold.  More specifically, it is the torsion-free metric connection, i.e., the torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle (an affine connection) preserving a given (pseudo-)Riemannian metric.
The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that there is a unique connection which satisfies these properties.
In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the term covariant derivative is often used for the Levi-Civita connection. The components of this connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols.
The Levi-Civita connection is named after Tullio Levi-Civita, although originally "discovered" by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. Levi-Civita,See Levi-Civita (1917) along with Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, used Christoffel's symbolsSee Christoffel (1869) to define the notion of parallel transport and explore the relationship of parallel transport with the curvature, thus developing the modern notion of holonomy.See Spivak (1999) Volume II, page 238
The Levi-Civita notions of intrinsic derivative and parallel displacement of a vector along a curve make sense on an abstract Riemannian manifold, even though the original motivation relied on a specific embedding
since the definition of the Christoffel symbols make sense in any Riemannian manifold. In 1869, Christoffel discovered that the components of the intrinsic derivative of a vector transform as the components of a contravariant vector. This discovery was the real beginning of tensor analysis. It was not until 1917 that Levi-Civita interpreted the intrinsic derivative in the case of an embedded surface as the tangential component of the usual derivative in the ambient affine space.

==Formal definition==

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold). Then an affine connection ∇ is called a Levi-Civita connection if
Condition 1 above is sometimes referred to as compatibility with the metric, and condition 2 is sometimes called symmetry, cf. DoCarmo's text.
Assuming a Levi-Civita connection exists it is uniquely determined. Using conditions 1 and the symmetry of the metric tensor g we find:
By condition 2 the right hand side is equal to
so we find
Since Z is arbitrary, this uniquely determines ∇XY. Conversely, using the last line as a definition one shows that the expression so defined is a connection compatible with the metric, i.e. is a Levi-Civita connection.

==Christoffel symbols==

The definition of the Levi-Civita connection derived above is equivalent to a definition of the  Christoffel symbols in terms of the metric as

==Derivative along curve==

The Levi-Civita connection (like any affine connection)  also defines a derivative along curves, sometimes denoted by D.
Given a smooth curve γ on (M,g) and a vector field V along γ its derivative is defined by
(Formally D is the pullback connection on the pullback bundle γ*TM.)

==Parallel transport==

In general, parallel transport along a curve with respect to a connection defines isomorphisms between the tangent spaces at the points of the curve. If the connection is a Levi-Civita connection, then these isomorphisms are orthogonal – that is, they preserve the inner products on the various tangent spaces.

==Example: The unit sphere in R3==

Denote by dY the differential of such a map. Then we have:
 Lemma: The formula
 defines an affine connection on S2 with vanishing torsion.
Proof: It is straightforward to prove that ∇ satisfies the Leibniz identity and is C∞(S2) linear in the first variable. It is also a straightforward computation to show that this connection is torsion free. So all that needs to be proved here is that the formula above does indeed define a vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all m in S2
Consider the map
The map f is constant, hence its differential vanishes. In particular
In fact, this connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric on S2 inherited from R3. Indeed, one can check that this connection preserves the metric.
