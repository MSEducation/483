]]thumb|245x245px|Construction of the Lecumberri Prison, view from the top
Palacio de Lecumberri is located at the North East border of Mexico City's Federal District. The building was used as a prison from 1900-1976, and as the Countri National Archive from 1980 onwards.
The prison was mainly constructed to contain major political advisers of the opposing side, or other criminals to the nation from the time of operation. Construction began in 1888.
The inspiration and design of the Palacio is by Miguel S. Macedo, who was later on imprisoned there for several months during the Mexican Revolution. The design is said to have been based on that of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon.See page 85 of Muy interesante (No. 2, 2008), a Mexican journal for the diffusion of science published by Editorial Televisa Internacional (ISSN 0188-0659.
This design allows for a single guard to observe all the prisoners without them being able to tell when the guard is looking; they therefore act as though they are always being watched.
The prison was built to hold 800 men, 180 women and 400 children. It had 804 cells, workshops,
a nursery, cooking and baking workshops. They was also an area of government, a section dedicated to medical and waiting rooms.

==National Achieves==

The Archivo General de la Nación (General Archive of the Nation) is charged by the Mexican state to
"be the governing body of the national archives and the central consultative entity of the Federal Executive." The writer Edmundo O'Gorman was its general director from 1938 until 1952. It is considered the most important among its class in the Americas and one of the most important in the entire world.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In November 1976 the Prison was decommissioned on the order of President Luis Echeverria and turned over to the National Archive in 1980.
The archive houses millions of pages of the country’s documentary heritage. Former prison cells are now used as record repositories and the corridors between them are used as galleries in which researchers can sit and read. In June 2002, 60,000 secret police files held within the archives were opened to the public by President Vicente Fox. The files document the government's actions during the Dirty War.[tpl]cite book | title=The Right to Know: Transparency for an Open World | publisher=Columbia University Press | author=Florini, Ann | year=2013 | pages=Chapter 10, pg.2 | isbn=9780231512077[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-06-29/news/0206290061_1_black-palace-files-national-archives | title=Mexicans scrutinize awful chapters past | work=Chicago Tribune | date=June 29, 2002 | accessdate=18 March 2014 | author=Dellios, Hugh[/tpl]
