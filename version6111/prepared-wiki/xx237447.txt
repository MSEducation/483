Jessica Watson, OAM (born 18 May 1993) is an Australian sailor. In May 2010, she unofficially became the youngest person to sail non-stop and unassisted around the world, although her route did not meet World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) criteria for circumnavigation of the globe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/15/us-australia-sailing-idUSTRE64E0D920100515|title=Australian teenager finishes round-world solo sail|last=Munoz|first=Daniel|date=15 May 2010|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 May 2010[/tpl]
Watson departed from Sydney on 18 October 2009, heading eastbound over the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. She returned to Sydney on 15 May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday.[tpl]cite news|date=15 May 2010|title=Jessica Watson completes historic round-the-world voyage|work=Australia Times|url=http://www.australia-times.com.au/national/article.php?id=4990|accessdate=15 May 2010[/tpl]

==Early life==

Watson was born on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia."About Jessica and her mission", Jessica Watson. Retrieved 22 June 2010. The second of four children of New Zealand couple Roger and Julie Watson, who moved to Australia in 1987, she has dual Australian and New Zealand nationality.Jessica Watson blog entry – she states she has both Australian and New Zealand passports: only New Zealand citizens are entitled to be issued New Zealand passports. She has an older sister (Emily) and younger brother and sister (Tom and Hannah). All four took sailing lessons as children, and the family went on to live on board a 16 metre cabin cruiser for five years, the children being home schooled via distance learning. Later they lived on a purpose-built double decker bus for some time.What were her parents thinking? by Mike Colman, The Courier-Mail, 13 June 2009. When Watson was eleven and they were still living on the boat, her mother read Jesse Martin's book Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit to the children as a bedtime story. This led to Watson forming the ambition, at age twelve, to sail around the world too.Solo sailor Jessica Watson battles dyslexia Kathleen Donaghey, The Sunday Mail (Qld), 31 January 2010.

==Circumnavigation and publicity==

Watson had been planning to complete a solo non-stop and unassisted circumnavigation of the globe since at least early 2008.[tpl]cite news | last = Kelly | first = Claire | date = 25 April 2008 | title = Mooloolaba's Jessica dreaming of the open sea | work = Sunshine Coast Daily | url = http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2008/04/25/mooloolabas-jessica-dreaming-open-sea/ | accessdate = 12 May 2010 [/tpl] Officially announced in May 2009, the journey was expected to take eight months with an estimated distance of 23,000 nautical miles. To fulfill the plan of sailing non-stop and unassisted, during the journey no other person would be allowed to give her anything and she must not moor to any port or other boat, although advice over radio communication was permitted.
Watson's planned circumnavigation route was to start and end at Sydney, and to pass near New Zealand, Fiji, Kiribati, Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and South East Cape. In accordance with the definitions for circumnavigations set out by the International Sailing Federation's WSSRC, the equator must be crossed;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html|title=The Courses Offshore |work=World Sailing Speed Record Council|quote=To sail around the World, a vessel must start from and return to the same point, must cross all meridians of longitude and must cross the Equator.|accessdate=26 January 2010[/tpl] this crossing was carried out near Kiritimati. However, the journey eventually did not meet the WSSRC requirement of an orthodromic distance of 21,600 nmi (refer below for the reason).
Watson arrived back in Sydney Harbour at 1:53 pm, Saturday 15 May 2010.
The Los Angeles Times reported Watson's reason for her journey: "I wanted to challenge myself and achieve something to be proud of. And yes, I wanted to inspire people. I hated being judged by my appearance and other people's expectations of what a 'little girl' was capable of. It's no longer just my dream or voyage. Every milestone out here isn't just my achievement, but an achievement for everyone who has put so much time and effort into helping getting me here."[tpl]cite news | last = Burgess | first = Kelly | date = 22 February 2010 | title = Sailors Abby Sunderland, 16, crosses the equator; Jessica Watson, also 16, nears southern point of Africa |work=Los Angeles Times | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/outposts/2010/02/abby-sunderland-1.html | accessdate = 14 May 2010 [/tpl]
After the journey she continued a relationship with Michael Perham, the previous youngest circumnavigator.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/1055856/jessica-watson-finds-love-with-perham |title=Jessica Watson finds love with Perham |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl] They met during a stop he made in Australia during his circumnavigation, and they had several phone conversations during her journey. More recently, however, Watson has also been seen spending time with Australia's youngest ever federal politician, Wyatt Roy. Jessica's mother insists they are just friends, and that Jessica's schedule—which takes her around the country and world—is currently preventing her from "dating boys.""Smooth sailing for Jessica and Wyatt." Herald Sun, 8 January 2011. Retrieved 31 January 2011.
Watson has written a book about her experience, True Spirit published by Hachette Australia.[ref][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/news/jessica-s-book-to-be-titled-true-spirit|title=Jessica's Book to be Titled 'True Spirit' | work = Jessica Watson | date = 25 April 2010 | accessdate = 14 May 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/news/jessicas-book-tour-dates-confirmed |title=Jessica's Book Tour Dates Confirmed| date = 14 July 2010 |accessdate = 9 August 2010[/tpl]

Watson has also filmed a documentary about her solo trip before, during and after completing her journey. It was narrated by Sir Richard Branson and premiered on ONEHD on 16 August 2010, before being released on DVD along with a CD album on 20 August 2010.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Preparation==

As training for her voyage, Watson crewed on a number of vessels, including OceansWatch's Magic Roundabout on which she acted as skipper during a crossing of the Tasman Sea.[tpl]cite news | last = Pares | first = Jane | date = 9 January 2009 | title = Another Teen Solo – 15 year-old Jessica is on her way | work = Sail World.com | url = http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Another-Teen-Solo---15-year-old-Jessica-is-on-her-way/52638 | accessdate = 12 May 2010 [/tpl] At the time she left on her voyage, Watson had the following qualifications:[tpl]cite news | last = Knudsen | first = Nancy | date = 27 September 2009 | title = Jessica Watson blames instruments for bulk carrier collision | work = Powerboat World | url = http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Jessica-Watson-blames-instruments-for-bulk-carrier-collision/61691 | accessdate = 12 May 2010 [/tpl]

===Boat===

The boat is a [tpl]convert|10.23|m|ft[/tpl] Sparkman & Stephens model S&S 34, the same design as used by Jon Sanders, David Dicks and Jesse Martin in their circumnavigations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/pink-lady|title=Ella's pink lady|work=Jessica Watson|accessdate=26 January 2010[/tpl] It was obtained and refitted with new equipment under the supervision of Don McIntyre and Bruce Arms, both skilled and experienced sailors. The refitting included a new galley, reconditioned diesel and water tanks, and a complete rebuild of the electrical system.[tpl]cite web | last = McIntyre | first = Don | date = 23 September 2009 | title = The Making of Pink Lady | work = Trade-A-Boat | url = http://www.tradeaboat.com.au/news-and-reviews/article/articleid/58540.aspx | accessdate = 14 May 2010 [/tpl] Watson was also deeply involved in the preparation of the boat, which she named Ella's Pink Lady. Most of the time the boat is steered by a self-steering windvane system. She has named the system Parker after the chauffeur of the pink Rolls-Royce in the Thunderbirds television series.

===Test run and collision===

During a test run sailing from Brisbane to Sydney, on her first night after leaving Brisbane, Ella's Pink Lady collided with the Silver Yang, a 63,000-tonne bulk carrier at about 02.00 am on 9 September 2009 near Point Lookout.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=477089100|title=Silver Yang|work=marinetraffic.com|accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] Watson's boat was dismasted in the collision. She was able to retain control and return the boat to Southport under motor.[tpl]cite news | last = Maynard | first = Neale | date = 20 October 2009 | title = Teen sailor Jessica Watson checked radar but didn't see cargo ship before collision | work = The Courier-Mail | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/teen-sailor-jessica-watson-checked-radar-but-didnt-see-cargo-ship-before-collision/story-e6freon6-1225788684542 | accessdate = 29 January 2011[/tpl]
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's preliminary report on the collision found that Watson had been taking a five minute nap during the event, (thus she was asleep at the time of the collision), and that while she had checked her radar prior to lying down, she had failed to spot the Silver Yang. This led to the accident four minutes later. The report also found that the Silver Yang had been aware of her presence and had attempted to change course, but that this had been insufficient to avoid Watson's boat.[tpl]cite news | last = Christine | first = Kellett | date = 20 October 2009 | title = Watson asleep during crash: report | work = Brisbane Times | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/watson-asleep-during-crash-report-20091020-h5sl.html | accessdate = 21 October 2009 [/tpl]
The final report was released in June 2010. The report stated that both Watson and the Silver Yang's watchkeepers had failed to maintain an adequate lookout and that both had failed to properly employ the navigational aids. In addition, the report found that the watchkeeper on the Silver Yang had failed to offer assistance to Watson after the two vessels had collided.[tpl]cite news | date = 16 June 2010 | title = Jess Watson and tanker both to blame for collision |work=Sydney Morning Herald | url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/jess-watson-and-tanker-both-to-blame-for-collision-20100615-ybig.html | accessdate = 16 June 2010 [/tpl]

==Journey==

Watson sailed out of Sydney Harbour on 18 October 2009 in her pink-hulled Ella Baché-sponsored Ella's Pink Lady.[tpl]cite news | date = 18 October 2009 | title = Jessica Watson sails in search of record | work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-18/jessica-watson-sails-in-search-of-record/1108326 | accessdate = 21 October 2009 [/tpl] 18 days later, on 5 November, she passed Tonga, sailing clear of both New Zealand and Fiji.
As required for a full circumnavigation, she crossed the equator on 19 November 2009 (Australian date),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/teen-solo-sailor-jessica-watson-crosses-equator/story-e6frfq80-1225799669862|title=Teen solo sailor Jessica Watson crosses equator|work=news.com.au|date=19 November 2009[/tpl] near Jarvis Island at about 161°40'W longitude, and rounded Kiritimati on 22 November 2009 (Australian date) after 36 days. Then she crossed the equator again at 156°20'W longitude, and continued south-easterly towards Cape Horn. The sailed distance from Sydney to Kiritimati was about 3,900 nmi. At Christmas she was near Point Nemo, the place located furthest from land.
On 13 January 2010 (9:40 UTC) she passed Cape Horn, having sailed around 9,800 nmi in 87 days. This was 11 days ahead of the planned [tpl]convert|100|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] per day schedule. Soon after her parents flew over her in a small plane in order to witness the passage.[tpl]cite news | last = Lulham | first = Amanda | date = 16 January 2010 | title = Jessica Watson's parents see their sail-around-the-world daughter as they fly over her in Southern Ocean |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jessica-watsons-see-their-sail-around-the-world-daughter-as-they-fly-over-her-in-southern-ocean/story-e6frf7jo-1225820152374 | accessdate = 13 May 2010 [/tpl] Just over a week later, on 23 January 2010, several days after passing the Falkland Islands, she suffered four knock-downs in a severe storm with 10-metre waves and [tpl]convert|70|kn|km/h|adj=on[/tpl] winds.

When south of Australia, Watson suffered a lot of inclement weather. In this part of the journey, she had at least three knockdowns (where the mast hit the water), one of them with the mast deep into the sea, luckily without any real damage or injury. The swells she experienced in the Great Australian Bight were up to 12 metres in height, higher than anytime before.[tpl]cite news | last = Lulham | first = Amanda | title = Jess survives wild seas |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia | date = 29 April 2010 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/jess-survives-wild-seas/story-e6frf7l6-1225859604737 | accessdate = 13 May 2010 [/tpl]

Watson completed her journey on day 210 of her voyage at 1:53 pm on 15 May 2010 when she arrived in Sydney Harbour. Her 17th birthday was 3 days later.
During the journey Watson had to do repairs herself to the boat and the equipment.

===Ella's Pink Lady stays in Queensland===

In the months following the completion of Jessica's journey, there were questions about what would become of her boat, Ella's Pink Lady.[tpl]cite news |title=Fight to keep Pink Lady on Coast |author=Furler, Mark |url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2010/10/30/jessica-watson-boat-pink-lady/  |newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily |date=30 October 2010  |accessdate=15 May 2011[/tpl] In April 2011, after the state and federal governments jointly purchased the yacht for $300,000, it was announced that the Pink Lady would have a permanent exhibition at the Queensland Maritime Museum in Brisbane.[tpl]cite news |title=Ella's Pink Lady finds a way home |author=Remeikis, Amy |url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2011/04/03/ellas-pink-lady-finds-a-way-home-jessica-watson/ |newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily |date=3 April 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Watson's journey has been criticised, particularly after the collision with the freighter. Barry Tyler of Pacific Motor Yacht magazine wrote, "like the majority of the seafaring world I consider it irresponsible, cavalier and indeed ignorant to attempt such a feat, at such a tender age and with so little trans-ocean experience."[tpl]cite news | last = Tyler | first = Barry | date = November 2009 | title = Should She, or Shouldn't She? | work = Pacific Motor Yacht | page = 6 [/tpl] Questions about her experience were also expressed by Phil Jones, the CEO of Yachting Australia, and by Grant Wharington, the skipper of Skandia, with Wharington stating that he had been impressed by Watson when they had met, but that he had advised her to gain experience by undertaking a number of shorter solo passages before attempting the circumnavigation, although she chose not to follow his advice.[tpl]cite news | last = Pierce | first = Jeremy | date = 28 September 2009 | title = Jessica not ready, warn top yachties | work = The Courier Mail | location = Queensland, Australia | page = 9 [/tpl] A more general concern was raised by the Australian Childhood Foundation, who questioned whether a 16 year old girl would have the ability to fully understand the risks that such a venture would involve.[tpl]cite news | last = Pierce | first = Jeremy | date = 11 September 2009 | title = Storm in a port | work = Hobart Mercury | location = Tasmania, Australia | page = 9 [/tpl]

===Circumnavigation scrutiny===

Sailing website Sail-World.com published an analysis on 3 May 2010 which claimed that the expected rhumb line distance travelled by Watson was [tpl]convert|19631.6|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl], which was less than the required distance according to the definition set by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), and that the journey was therefore ineligible to claim world record status for round-the-world journeys. The equivalent orthodromic distance for Watson's route would be [tpl]convert|18582|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | last = Knudsen | first = Nancy | date = 5 May 2010 | title = Jessica Watson: Keeping the Record Straight | work = Sail-World.com | url = http://www.sail-world.com/CruisingAus/index.cfm?SEID=0&Nid=69108&SRCID=0&ntid=12&tickeruid=0&tickerCID=0 | accessdate = 9 May 2010[/tpl] The WSSRC definition states in part "The shortest orthodromic track of the vessel must be at least [tpl]convert|21600|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in length." The analysis suggests that Watson's published distance logs are based on sailed distances, including tacks and strategic weather detours, rather than the shortest orthodromic track between islands and capes as defined.[tpl]cite web | title = ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore | work = World Sailing Speed Records Council | url = http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html | accessdate = 14 May 2010 [/tpl]Girl, 16, shrugs off controversy as she ends global sail.

What is a circumnavigation? Retrieved 12 April 2011.Jesse Martin Interview. Note: The original link is dead, but this is the Internet Archive version at the Internet Archive. Retrieved 12 April 2011. "The Azores, that was my antipodal point, I had to sail up there and back to make it a proper circumnavigation..." that during a circumnavigation the sailor must pass two points on opposite sides of the earth (antipodes). For example, if starting in southern England, a place near the start will be opposite to the track near New Zealand. It was replaced by the rule that for world records the shortest orthodromic track must be at least as long as the circumference of the earth (hence 21,600 nautical miles).
Watson responded "If I haven't been sailing around the world, then it beats me what I've been doing out here all this time!  Yes it's a shame that my voyage won't be recognized by a few organizations because I'm under 18, but it really doesn't worry me."[tpl]cite web | last = Watson | first = Jessica | date = 6 May 2010 | title = Savouring Every Second| work = Jessica Watson | url = http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/_blog/Official_Jessica_Watson_Blog/post/Savouring_Every_Second/ | accessdate = 6 May 2010[/tpl]
Watson's manager, Andrew Fraser, dismissed the claim, noting that the WSSRC does not recognise records by sailors under eighteen.[tpl]cite news| date = 5 May 2010 | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/teen-sailor-jessica-watson-will-miss-out-on-world-record-20100503-u2kb.html|title=Teen sailor Jessica Watson 'will miss out on world record'|accessdate = 5 May 2010|newspaper=Brisbane Times|first=Megan|last=Levy[/tpl]  He stated "Jessica has sailed a southern hemisphere solo circumnavigation, which 'a vessel must start from and return to the same point, must cross all meridians of longitude and must cross the Equator'. Jessica has ticked all of these boxes.  Jessica has sailed the most challenging and treacherous oceans of the world, passing the four capes (Cape Horn, Cape Agulhas, Cape Leeuwin and the Cape of SE Tasmania) and crossed the Equator twice. She has sailed around the world, non-stop, solo, unassisted and when she completes the voyage, she will be the youngest to have done that, sailing almost 23,000 nautical miles in the process. We have official TracPlus data to confirm Jessica's exact distance upon her return."[tpl]cite web|date = 5 May 2010 | url=http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/news/the-facts-about-jessica-s-voyage|title=The Facts About Jessica’s Voyage|work= Jessica Watson |accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl]
British sailing journalist and author Bob Fisher published an article on Sail-World.com refuting the round the world claim. He said "True, Jessica has sailed alone and unassisted, passed under the four required capes, but the orthodromic route she has taken does not total the necessary 21,600 miles that is equivalent of the girth of the Earth at the equator. And that, Andrew Fraser, is a requirement for the world record you were claiming for Jessica, and which would put her in line to beat Jesse Martin's record."[tpl]cite web|author=Bob Fisher|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and PR Spin|work=Sail World.com|url=http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Lies,-Damn-Lies,-and-PR-Spin/69252|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=14 May 2010[/tpl]
Watson commented on this matter in her book True Spirit.[tpl]cite book |title= True Spirit|last= Watson |first= Jessica |year=2010 |page=316 |publisher=Hachette |isbn= 0-7336-2497-9[/tpl] She states that she wrote a number of letters to the WSSRC asking what she had to do to claim the record. Their answer was that she could not claim the record since age records were no longer recognized. She got the impression it was (according to WSSRC) not necessary to follow the route Jesse Martin followed (which went far north of the equator in the Atlantic), a route Watson knew well from reading Martin's book more than once. Watson decided to follow a route commonly accepted as round the world. A number of sailors, like Kay Cottee, followed a similar route which has been accepted.
In the book she also criticised those who criticised her management. Sail-World.com has written "We don’t believe she decided her route. People think we’re criticising Jessica. We’re not. We’re criticising her management". She felt hurt by that, since it hinted that "He was suggesting that I was just a puppet, that I had no voice and no will of my own."[tpl]cite book |title= True Spirit|last= Watson |first= Jessica |year=2010 |page=318 |publisher=Hachette |isbn= 0-7336-2497-9[/tpl]

At the arrival in Sydney, she was met by approximately 75,000 spectators including then Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. He said "Jess welcome back to dry land. Welcome back home to Australia. You know something, you may feel a little wobbly on your feet just now, but in the eyes of all Australians you now stand tall as our newest Australian hero." The crowd then sang a special rendition of Australia's national Anthem Advance Australia Fair as a salute to Watson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/jessica-watson-our-newest-hero-says-rudd/story-e6frfku9-1225867155080 |title=Jessica Watson our newest hero, says Rudd | work=news.com.au | date=15 May 2010[/tpl]

This was considered a success, since all the other boats in the class had considerably older male skippers.
