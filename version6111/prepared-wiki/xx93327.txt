Religious, particularly LDS buildings, are prominent in Salt Lake City.
Settled by Brigham Young and 147 other pioneers on July 24, these Latter-day Saints were fleeing persecution after the death of their first leader Joseph Smith, Jr. Young originally intended the city and territory to be a religious theocracy. Although the government has long been secular, and even though less than 50% of residents in Salt Lake City are LDS, the city has an unusual number of religious buildings. It is the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so can be considered a kind of holy city. As the largest single landowner in the city, the LDS Church also has been very influential throughout its history. The Roman Catholic Cathedral, Cathedral Of The Madeleine located on South Temple is one of the most beautiful in the nation and a significant landmark in the city.
Unless noted, all of these buildings are in or around Downtown Salt Lake City.
