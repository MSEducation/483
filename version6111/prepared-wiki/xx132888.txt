==History==

The history of public education in Lohn dates back to the late nineteenth century. A one-room school house was constructed in 1893. Three years later, the Lohn Central School was completed and two smaller schools in the neighboring communities of Cow Creek and Salt Gap consolidated with it.Lohn School History - Lohn Independent School District.

In 1915, a two-story brick school building was built. As Lohn continued to grow, the need for a larger school led to the construction of another building in 1934. That school housed the majority of classes until it was replaced by the present facility in 2004.
