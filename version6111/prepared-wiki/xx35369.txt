The custom of guising at Halloween in North America is first recorded in 1911, where a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported children going "guising" around the neighborhood.Rogers, p.76. In 19th century America, Halloween was often celebrated with costume parades and "licentious revelries".Lherm, 2001, p. 194. However, efforts were made to "domesticate" the festival to conform with Victorian era morality.  Halloween was made into a private rather than public holiday, celebrations involving liquor and sensuality de-emphasized, and only children were expected to celebrate the festival.Lherm, 2001, p. 194-195, 204. Early Halloween costumes emphasized the and gothic nature of Halloween, and were aimed primarily at children. Costumes were also made at home, or using items (such as make-up) which could be purchased and utilized to create a costume.  But in the 1930s, A.S. Fishbach, Ben Cooper, Inc., and other firms began mass-producing Halloween costumes for sale in stores as trick-or-treating became popular in North America. Halloween costumes are often designed to imitate supernatural and scary beings. Costumes are traditionally those of monsters such as vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghosts,Rook, Dennis W. (Dec 1985). "The Ritual Dimension of Consumer Behavior". Journal of Consumer Research (Univ. of Chicago Press) 12 (3): 251–264. Accessed November 14, 2010. skeletons, witches, goblins, trolls, devils, etc. or in more recent years such science fiction-inspired characters as aliens and superheroes. There are also costumes of pop culture figures like presidents, athletes, celebrities, or characters in film, television, literature, etc. Another popular trend is for women (and in some cases, men) to use Halloween as an excuse to wear sexy or revealing costumes, showing off more skin than would be socially acceptable otherwise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/fashion/19costume.html|title=Good Girls Go Bad, for a Day|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2006[/tpl] Young girls also often dress as entirely non-scary characters at Halloween, including princesses, fairies, angels, farm animals and flowers.
Halloween costume parties generally take place on or around October 31, often on the Friday or Saturday prior to the holiday.

==Politics of Halloween costumes==

Halloween costumes in the contemporary Western world sometimes depict people and things from present times and are sometimes read in terms of their political and cultural significance. Halloween costumes are sometimes denounced for cultural appropriation when they uncritically use stereotypical representations of other groups of people.Kjerstin Johnson, "Don't Mess Up When You Dress Up: Cultural Appropriation and Costumes", Bitch magazine, 25 October 2011.Lisa Wade, "Race-Themed Events at Colleges (Trigger Warning)", Sociological Images, updated 11 October 2012.
