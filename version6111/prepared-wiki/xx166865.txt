J. Raymond Jones (St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, 1899 - June 9, 1991 New York) was an African American New York City politician. He moved to New York City in 1918. Known as "The Fox," Jones was leader of Harlem's Carver Democratic Club.http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781610393010 A Mayor's Life: Governing New York's Gorgeous Mosaic He challenged Tammany Hall leader Carmine DeSapio twice, succeeding in 1964 in becoming Tammany's first black leader. In 1961 Jones supported the election of Robert F. Wagner Jr. as mayor of New York City, again in contrast to DeSapio. Jones served as mentor to many younger black politicians who later became prominent in New York politics. This group became known as the "Harlem Clubhouse". New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins said about Jones, "Without his counsel and guidance, Percy Sutton, Constance Baker Motley, Fritz Alexander, Charlie Rangel, Robert Weaver, and I might add, David N. Dinkins, would not have achieved as much. He was a true political pioneer and a deeply committed individual who dedicated his life to serving the people of New York."http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/obituaries/j-raymond-jones-harlem-kingmaker-dies-at-91.html J.
