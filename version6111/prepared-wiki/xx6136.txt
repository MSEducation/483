Calligra Suite is a graphic art and office suite by KDE forked from KOffice in 2010.[tpl]cite web|author=Aaron Seigo |url=http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2010/12/rose-by-any-other-name.html |title=A rose by any other name |author=Aaron Seigo |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2013-06-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/419822/|title=Behind the KOffice split|first=Joe|last=Brockmeier|work=Linux Weekly News|date=14 December 2010|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] It is available for desktop PCs, tablet computers, and smartphones. It contains applications for word processing, spreadsheets, presentation, databases, vector graphics, and digital painting.
Calligra uses the OpenDocument format as its default file format for most applications and can import other formats, such as Microsoft Office formats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calligra.org/words/ |title=Calligra Words|publisher=Calligra |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] Calligra relies on KDE technology and is often used in combination with KDE Plasma Workspaces.

==Supported systems==

===Desktops===

Calligra’s main platform is desktop PCs running Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, and Windows,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calligra.org/get-calligra/ |title=Get Calligra |publisher=Calligra.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl] of which Linux is the best supported system.[tpl]cite web|url=https://slangkamp.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/the-problem-with-supporting-windows/ |title=The problem with supporting Windows |publisher=Slangkamp.wordpress.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl]
On desktop systems, the whole range of features is available.

===Smartphones===

Calligra Mobile is a version for smartphone-like formfactors. Its main purpose is to serve as document viewer for devices running Maemo or its successor MeeGo but simple editing features are also available.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calligra.org/news/calligra-2-4-snapshot-1-tour/ |title=Calligra 2.4 Snapshot 1 Tour |publisher=Calligra |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] This version only includes Words, Sheets and Stage.
Development was initiated in summer 2009 and first shown during Akademy / Desktop Summit 2009 by KO GmbH as a simple port of KOffice to Maemo. Later Nokia hired KO to assist them with a full-fledged mobile version, including a touchscreen-friendly user interface which was presented by Nokia during Maemo Conference in October 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dot.kde.org/2009/10/13/nokia-sponsors-koffice-development-mobile-devices |title=Nokia Sponsors KOffice Development for Mobile Devices |publisher=KDE.News |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] The first alpha version was made available in January 2010.[tpl]cite news| title= KOffice Based Office Viewer Launched for Nokia N900| url= http://dot.kde.org/2010/01/21/koffice-based-office-viewer-launched-nokia-n900| author = Jonathan Riddell| agency = KDE.NEWS| publisher = KDE| date = 2010-01-21[/tpl] Along with the launch of the Nokia N9 smartphone, Nokia released its own Poppler and Calligra-based office document viewer under GPL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calligra.org/news/calligra-provides-the-engine-for-nokias-harmattan-office/ |title=Calligra provides the Engine for Nokia’s Harmattan Office |publisher=Calligra.org |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/pool/harmattan/free/o/office-tools/ | title = Index of /pool/harmattan/free/o/office-tools |publisher=Harmattan-dev.nokia.com | date = | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130213215230/http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/pool/harmattan/free/o/office-tools | archivedate = 2013-02-13 | accessdate = 2014-03-14 [/tpl]

==History==

Calligra was created as a result of a split in the KOffice community in 2010, after disagreements between the core developers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=128782551919625&w=2 |title=KOffice split|publisher=KDE |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=128812911619277&w=2 |title=Re: KOffice split|publisher=KDE |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] Following arbitration with the community members, several applications were renamed by both communities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/calligra-devel/2011-June/001663.html |title=KOffice arbitration is finished |publisher=KDE |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] Most developers, and all but one maintainer, of particular applications joined the Calligra project. Three applications, Kexi, Krita and KPlato and the user interfaces for mobile devices have been completely moved out of KOffice and are only available within Calligra. A new application called Braindump has been added to Calligra after the split and KWord was replaced by the new word processor Calligra Words.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.kde.org/node/4538 |title=Calligra Words is not a fork of KWord |publisher=blogs.kde.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl]
KOffice 2.3, released [tpl]date|2010-12-31[/tpl], along with subsequent bugfix releases (2.3.1–2.3.3) was still a collaborative effort of both the KOffice and Calligra development teams. According to its developers, this version is stable enough for real use, and Karbon14, Krita and KSpread are recommended for production work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koffice.org/news/koffice-2-3-0-released/ |title=KOffice 2.3.0 Released |publisher=KOffice.org |date=2010-12-31 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl]
On [tpl]date|2011-05-18[/tpl] the Calligra team began releasing monthly snapshots while preparing for the release of Calligra 2.4.
The first version of the Calligra Suite for Windows was released on [tpl]date|2011-12-21[/tpl]. The package is labeled as “highly experimental” and “not yet suitable for daily use”.[tpl]cite web|title = Calligra Packages for Windows Released|url = http://www.calligra.org/news/calligra-packages-for-windows-released/[/tpl]
The Calligra team originally scheduled to release the final 2.4 version in January 2012[tpl]cite web|url=https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/calligra-devel/2011-December/003350.html |title=2.4 Beta 5 |publisher=KDE |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] but problems in the undo/redo feature of Words and Stage required a partial rewrite and caused a delay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.kde.org/node/4541 |title=Calligra Words: undo/redo framework |publisher=blogs.kde.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] Calligra 2.4 was released on [tpl]date|2012-04-11[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calligra.org/news/calligra-2-4-released |title=Calligra 2.4 Released |publisher=Calligra.org |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] From the 2.4 release onward, the Calligra developers aim for a four months release cycle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ingwa2.blogspot.de/2012/04/calligra-24-released-now-what.html |title=Calligra 2.4 Released – Now What? |publisher=Ingwa2.blogspot.de |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl]

==Components==

==Reception==

Initial reception shortly after the 2.4 release was positive. Linux Pro Magazine Online’s Bruce Byfield wrote "Calligra needed an impressive first release. Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team’s credit, it has managed one in 2.4", but also noted that "Words in particular is still lacking features". He concluded that Calligra is "worth keeping an eye on".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/Features/Calligra-The-Other-Office-Suite-Narrows-the-Gap |title=Calligra: The Other Office Suite Narrows the Gap |publisher=Linux Pro Magazine Online |date= |accessdate=[tpl]date|2012-05-01[/tpl] [/tpl]
The German sister publication LinuxUser 10/2012 reviewed Calligra 2.5 on [tpl]date|2012-09-12[/tpl]. Its reception was mostly positive. Negative criticism centered around Words' stability: "During our review no Calligra module was completely free of crashes, however Words' crashes reached an amount that we cannot recommend it for general use." The reviewer Thomas Drilling on the other hand praised Calligra’s usability, writing: "The consistent work flow, often stunningly intuitive workflows, and clear menu structure are well received." He then concluded: "The individual modules' quality varies: While Words shows weakness, image editor Krita, spreadsheet application Sheets, and presentation program Stage completely won us over. Flowcharting application Flow allures with its wide range of stencils which makes drawing flow charts come easy."
LinuxUser reviewed Calligra 2.6 in issue 3/2013. Reviewer Vincze-Aron Szabo reiterated positive criticism about Calligra’s user interface and noted increased stability of Words compared to Calligra 2.5. Szabo’s major point for negative criticism was Autor’s and Word’s handling of long documents, resulting in decreased performance and crashes. The other reviewed components – Plan, Stage, Sheets, and Krita – were praised in terms of stability and intuitiveness.
Calligra 2.7 was reviewed by LinuxUser in its October 2013 issue. Thomas Drilling, the reviewer, drew a positive conclusion overall. Among the positive aspects he pointed out were better .docx file import than LibreOffice and the amount of new features gained by the new version of the suite. Source for negative criticism was once again Words’ stability, although Drilling noted improvements in this regard.

==Technical details==

Calligra is designed to work with the KDE Platform, using the Qt and KDE libraries. However it is released independently of the KDE Software Compilation. All its components are released under free software licenses and use OpenDocument as their native file format when applicable.
The developers of Calligra plan to share as much infrastructure as possible between applications to reduce bugs and improve the user experience.The KOffice Project – KOffice 2.0 Alpha 5 Release Announcement This is done by common technologies like Flake and Pigment. Flake provides a way to handle shapes, which can contain text, images, formulas (via KFormula), charts (via KChart) or other objects, in a consistent way across all applications. The Calligra team also wants to create an OpenDocument library for use in other KDE applications that will allow developers to easily add support for reading and outputting OpenDocument files to their applications.KOffice ODF Sprint Report Automating tasks and extending the suite with custom functionality can be done with D-Bus or with scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript through the Kross scripting framework.
