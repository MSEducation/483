Colby College is a private liberal arts college located on Mayflower Hill in Waterville, Maine, USA.  Founded in 1813, it is the 12th-oldest independent liberal arts college in the United States.  Colby was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students in 1871.http://www.colby.edu/about_cs/history.cfm
Approximately 1,800 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually.  The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors.  In part because of Colby's location, more than two thirds of Colby students participate in study abroad programs.  Colby College competes in the NESCAC conference and is one of the "Little Ivies".

==History==

===Origins===

On February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a petition to establish the Maine Literary and Theological Institution, the 33rd chartered college in the United States.Mayflower Hill, A History of Colby College, Earl Smith, University Press of New England, 2006 The petition was led by Baptists who had come to the region for missionary work, and who wanted to train their own ministers, to end the reliance on England for providing men of learning. From 1816-1818, the new institution found a home in Waterville on 179 acres of land donated by citizens.  In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Rev. Jeremiah Chaplin, a Baptist theologian.  Chaplin arrived in Waterville in the summer of 1818 with his family and seven students, including George Dana Boardman, the institution's first graduate.  They were put up in a vacant Waterville home, and in that home the first classes were held.
After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes.  Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees.  A turning point, the Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed Waterville College on February 5, 1821.  In 1822, Elijah Parish Lovejoy, who would become a celebrated martyr to emancipation and to freedom of the press, graduated as valedictorian.  In 1825, the theological department was discontinued.[tpl]cite book |last= Maine League of Historical Societies and Museums |editor=Doris A. Isaacson |title=Maine: A Guide 'Down East' |year=1970 |publisher=Courier-Gazette, Inc. |location=Rockland, Me | pages = 226–227 [/tpl]  In 1833, Rev. Rufus Babcock became Colby's second president, and students formed the nation’s first college-based anti-slavery society.http://www.colby.edu/education/activism/stories/antislavery.html  In 1845, the college's first Greek Society was formed, a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was followed by chapters of Zeta Psi in 1850 and Delta Upsilon in 1852.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, Edwin Carey Whittemore
During the Civil War, many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, Richard C. Shannon, Henry C. Merriam, and Benjamin Butler.  Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town.  In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment.  Waterville College was on the verge of closing.

===Colby University===

On August 9, 1865, a Boston merchant, prominent Baptist philanthropist and Maine native Gardner Colby attended Waterville College's commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president James Tift Champlin, announced a matching $50,000 donation that would allow the college to remain open.  On January 23, 1867, the college was renamed Colby University in gratitude.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 93, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag
Now on solid financial footing and just 16 months after The Battle of Appomattox Court House, trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, making Memorial Hall the first Civil War memorial erected on a college campus.  The building began construction in the summer of 1867, and was dedicated at commencement in 1869.  At commencement in 1871, The Lion of Lucerne, a sculpture by Martin Milmore, was added as the centerpiece of the building.  The lion was brought to Miller Library from Memorial Hall in January 1962."The Lion of Lucerne", Colby College Libraries, accessed: http://libguides.colby.edu/content.php?pid=240829
In the fall of 1871 Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students.  The national Sigma Kappa sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college's first five female students.http://www.sigmakappa.org/about/default.asp?page=history  One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Caffrey Low, who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875.

===Colby College===

On January 25, 1899, Colby president Nathaniel Butler, Jr. '73, having come from the University of Chicago, renamed the "university" Colby College.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 129, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag  In 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter, but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820.

===Mayflower Hill===

Franklin W. Johnson was appointed president of the college in June 1929.  Citing a recently released Maine Higher Education Survey Report, a cramped location between the Kennebec River and the Maine Central Railroad Company tracks through Waterville, and an aging physical plant (amongst others), Johnson began a campaign to move the college to a more adequate location.  Franklin's campaign to raise funds for the move were complicated by the Great Depression, but ended up including a gift from the City of Waterville; in an effort to keep Colby from relocating to Augusta, Waterville deeded [tpl]convert|600|acre|km2[/tpl] on Mayflower Hill, near the outskirts of the city, to the college.The Man of Mayflower Hill: A Biography of Franklin W. Johnson, by Ernest C. Marriner, Colby College Press, 1968
In 1937 and according to master plans drawn up by Jens Frederick Larson, construction broke ground on Lorimer Chapel, the first building on the new Mayflower Hill campus.  In 1951, the last class took place on the old campus in Coburn Hall.
In 1984, following an investigation of campus life commissioned by the Board of Trustees, a decision was made to withdraw recognition from Colby’s Greek system as it was seen to be "exclusionary by nature".[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E4D6163BF931A15756C0A962948260&scp=5&sq=%22colby%20college%22%20Fraternities&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; Justice Upholds Ban On Colby Fraternities | date=1984-05-22 | accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]
