The area contains biologically rich wetlands and heathlands as well as old growth and regrowth karri forests. The area remained largely untouched by logging until the 1940s due to the inaccessibility of the area. A timber mill and the town of Shannon were established in the mid-1940s as a result of a timber shortage during World War II. The town once boasted over 90 homes and a hall, post office, church and nursing station. A dam was built in 1949 to guarantee water supply during the summer months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.australiannationalparks.com/westernaustralia/Shannon/default.htm|title=Australian National Parks|year=2008|accessdate=24 January 2011[/tpl]
The mill eventually closed in 1968 and the houses were sold and moved leaving the townsite empty and a campground now stands were the town once did. The area was gazetted as a national park in 1988.
The campgrounds contain toilets, gas barbecues, hot water showers and two huts available to campers on a first come first served basis.
