[[Sketchpad 1]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Sirrah albums

Sketchpad #1 is the sole album by theMANcalledTEA, the aftermath of avant-garde/progressive gothic metal band Sirrah. The album was a one-off, profit-free project and a further evolution of the progressing industrial sound of Sirrah. Later versions of the album included two bonus tracks, "jaywalker" and "RaconteuR", in their raw mixes.http://dying.art.pl/info/191.html These two songs were originally set to appear on the proposed Sketchpad #2, before the project ended.
