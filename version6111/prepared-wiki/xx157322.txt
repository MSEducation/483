==History==

Bosa was once the site of an important muisca village. During the Pre-Columbian era the area was governed by Caciques, among them and at the moment of the Spanish arrival; the Cacique Techotiva. The name of Bosa in chibcha means "fence of the one that guards and defends the cereals".
Early in 1538, Bosa witnessed one of the most dramatic chapters in the history of the Muisca people. The Zipa or ruler Sagipa (o Saquesazipa) was hung by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada when his subjects failed to fill up a room with the amount of gold the conquistador asked as ransom for his freedom. At the same time, Cuxinimpaba and Cucinimegua, the legitimate heirs to the throne of Tisquesusa, the last Muisca ruler who had been assassinated in Facatativa in 1537 by Jimenez de Quesada's soldiers, were hanged. This way the conquistador put end to the lineage of the Muisca rulers.
In 1538 Bosa became a meeting place for Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, Nicolás de Federmán and Sebastián de Belalcázar during the conquest of the Americas. The exact location of their encounter was marked with stone cross, today located on the east side of Bosa's main square.
The 4th article of the June 22, 1850 Law dissolved the resguardo for indigenous peoples in an effort to drive them away from the villages. These process ended in 1886.
On November 22, 1853 a battle took place in Bosa between the forces of Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, José Hilario López and Pedro Alcántara Herrán against the forces of Dictator Jose Maria Melo, this became known as the Battle of Bosa.
Until the mid 20th Century Bosa was a relatively small municipality formed by five neighborhoods and a population inferior to 20,000 people dedicated to rural agricultural activities. by 1954 the government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla annexed Bosa to the Special District of Bogotá, which triggers a demographic expansion. Bosa then became a commuter town for Bogotá.
In the Colombian Constitution of 1991 Bogotá was rearranged and became the Capital District and Bosa became its 7th locality. in 1992 and 2000 the Cabildos of Suba and Bosa were officially recognized by the Government of Bogotá as estipulated in Law 89 of 1890.
