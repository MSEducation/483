==Career==

===Magician===

Though defining himself as a conjuror, Randi's career as a professional stage magician[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi.html |title=James Randi: Homeopathy, quackery and fraud |date=February 2007 |work=TED |publisher=Sapling Foundation |location=New York |accessdate=April 24, 2010[/tpl] Randi explained in a February 2007 presentation that he believes the word "magician" implies one who has actual magical abilities, whereas a conjurer is one who uses skills to merely play the part of one. and escapologist began in 1946. Initially, he presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of "The Amazing Randi." Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC's Today show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini's record of 93 minutes.[tpl]cite news |title=Television & radio column |first=Gordon |last=Sinclair |authorlink=Gordon Sinclair |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=February 7, 1956[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Handcuffs no problem Toronto-born magician laughs at locksmiths |first=George |last=Bryant |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=June 21, 1956[/tpl]
In the late 1960s, Randi hosted The Amazing Randi Show on New York radio station WOR.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/58.html|title=About James Randi Full Bio|year=2007|publisher=JREF|accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] This radio show, which filled Long John Nebel's old slot with similar content after Nebel went to WNBC in 1962, often invited guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi, in turn, spoke at Moseley's 1967 Fourth Congress of Scientific Ufologists in New York City,Moseley & Pflock 2002, pp. 189, 204 stating, "Let's not fool ourselves. There are some garden variety liars involved in all this. But in among all the trash and nonsense perpetrated in the name of Ufology, I think there is a small grain of truth."[tpl]cite news|first=Willard|last=Clopton|title=Air Force's UFO Expert Meets the Man From S.A.U.C.E.R.S.|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 27, 1967 [/tpl]
Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As "The Amazing Randi" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series Wonderama from 1959 to 1967.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/lostwonder1.html |title=Wonderama! |last1=Butler |first1=Kevin S. |last2=Ingram |first2=Billy |work=TVparty! |publisher=William Ingram |location=Greensboro, NC |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |quote=Sonny Fox hosted another 'Wonderama Thanksgiving Day Party' on Thursday afternoon, November 23, 1961 with guests ventriloquist and cartoon voice-over performer Paul Winchell, magician/escape artist and magic historian The Amazing James Randi and folk singer Pat Woodell.[/tpl] He also hosted a  revival of the 1950s children's show The Magic Clown in 1970, though the program enjoyed only a brief life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/lostny2bonamo.html |title=Bonamo, The Magic Clown |last=Butler |first=Kevin S. |work=TVparty! |publisher=William Ingram |location=Greensboro, NC |accessdate=May 13, 2008[/tpl] In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine Abracadabra, Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated, "I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours." In the December 2003 issue of The Linking Ring, the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated, "Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing" and "The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk."[tpl]cite journal |last=Barber |first=Peter W. |date=December 2003 |title=Points to Ponder: Another Matter of Ethics |journal=The Linking Ring |volume=83 |issue=12 |page=97 |publisher=International Brotherhood of Magicians |issn=0024-4023[/tpl]

Randi has been accused of actually using "psychic powers" to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said, "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." The professor shouted back: "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it."Alcock 2001, p. 42 A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator simply by using trickery, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying, "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.Gardner 2000, p. 178

===Author===

Randi is author of 10 books, among them Conjuring (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled: Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC! The book's cover says that it is by "James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed." The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book which was called Houdini, His Life and Art.[tpl]cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Kay |title=Truthful trickster |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RU4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wykEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3862,1502395 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=July 13, 1981[/tpl] This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.Burt 2001, p. 192
Randi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled The Magic World of the Amazing Randi, which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about the paranormal and pseudoscientific. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on A Magician in the Laboratory, which recounts his application of skepticism to science.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1194-teleportation-magic-established-by-science-at-last.html |title=Teleportation Magic Established By Science, At Last! |last=Randi |first=James |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=January 19, 2011[/tpl] He is a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.Asimov 1994
Other books are Flim-Flam! (1982) and The Faith Healers (1987).

===Skeptic===

Randi entered the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. Randi accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book The Truth About Uri Geller (1982).[tpl]cite news|first=Boyce|last=Rensberger|url=|title=Magicians Term Israeli 'Psychic' a Fraud|newspaper=The New York Times|page=29|date=December 13, 1975[/tpl] Geller sued Randi for $15 million in 1991 and lost.[tpl]cite news|first=Charles|last=Petit|title=Bay Magicians Back Uri Geller's Critic|work=San Francisco Chronicle|page=A27|date=May 23, 1991[/tpl] Geller's suit against the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.[tpl]cite news|first=Michael|last=Levy|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BN/lib00142,0EAF986A6473E6E1.html|title=Group Gets $40,000 From 'psychic' Geller Starts Paying Debunkers $120,000|work=The Buffalo News|date=March 13, 1995|accessdate=December 29, 2007[/tpl] Randi also dismissed Uri Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argues, of trick photography using a hand-held optical device.Carroll 2003, p. 313 Randi was a founding fellow and prominent member of CSICOP.[tpl]cite news |title=God's Chariot!

Randi refused and resigned, though he maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff/ |title=CSI Fellows and Staff – CSI |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center for Inquiry |location=Amherst, NY |accessdate=July 23, 2013[/tpl]
Randi has gone on to write several books criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/bio.html |title=About James Randi |publisher=JREF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212232735/http://www.randi.org/jr/bio.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 29, 2007[/tpl] He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi revealed that he had been able to orchestrate a three-year-long compromise of a privately funded psychic research experiment.[tpl]cite news |title=Magicians Score a Hit On Scientific Researchers |first=Philip J. |last=Hilts |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=First Section; A1 |date=March 1, 1983[/tpl] The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level.
Randi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on That's My Line, Randi appeared opposite psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |title=A Look at the Past |last=Randi |first=James |date=September 22, 2006 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Newsletter |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070709000648/http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |archivedate=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2013[/tpl] Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging.[tpl]YouTube|id=QlfMsZwr8rc|title="James Randi exposes James Hydrick"|link=no[/tpl] Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick "confessed everything."
Randi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's 5-year grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his late-night TV show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealing personal information about her that he claims comes from God, and then performing a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. The information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who handed out "prayer cards" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.Randi 1987, pp. 139–181[tpl]cite news |title=Skeptics' Revelations: Faith Healer Receives 'Heavenly' Messages Via Electronic Receiver, Debunkers Charge |first=John |last=Dart |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-11/local/me-5518_1_faith-healer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 11, 1986 |accessdate=August 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]YouTube|id=q7BQKu0YP8Y|title="James Randi Debunks Peter Popoff Faith Healer"|link=no[/tpl]
The news coverage generated by Randi's exposé on The Tonight Show led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's TV show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987.[tpl]cite news |title=Evangelist Popoff Off Air, Files Bankruptcy Petitions |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-26/local/me-2461_1_peter-popoff |first=John |last=Dart |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 26, 1987 |accessdate=August 18, 2012[/tpl] 
However, the televangelist returned to the airwaves a decade later with faith healing infomercials that reportedly pulled in more than $23 million in 2005, from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's Think Again! TV documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.[tpl]YouTube|id=oZo0DLKriDY|title="Secret Footage of 'Faith Healer' Peter Popoff in Toronto May 2011"|link=no[/tpl]
In 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's 60 Minutes program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a spirit channeler named Carlos who was actually artist Jose Alvarez, whom Randi described as a "friend."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/stoss01.htm |title=The Power of Belief |date=October 6, 1998 |work=ABC News |type=Transcript |oclc=707971164 |accessdate=June 29, 2012[/tpl] Randi would tell him what to say through sophisticated radio equipment. According to the 60 Minutes program on the Carlos hoax, "it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales there from) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)," though an analysis by The Skeptic's Tim Mendham concluded that while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, "it hoax at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical."[tpl]cite journal |last=Mendham |first=Tim |year=1988 |title=The Carlos Hoax |journal=The Skeptic |volume=8 |issue=1 |location=Sydney |publisher=Australian Skeptics Inc. |format=PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2013 |issn=0726-9897 |oclc=53994493 |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/theskeptic/2ndcoming/skepticism.pdf[/tpl] The hoax was exposed on 60 Minutes; Carlos and Randi explained how they pulled it off.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/carlos.html |title='Carlos' hoax |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Robert Todd Carroll |accessdate=June 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite interview |last=Randi |first=James |interviewer=Paul Willis |title=James Randi and the Great Carlos |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/randi4.htm ||publisher=Abc.net.au |program=The Correx Archives |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=May 7, 1998 |accessdate=June 15, 2009[/tpl]
In the book The Faith Healers, Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arises out of compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi has also been critical of João de Deus (John of God), a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who has received international attention.[tpl]cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=February 18, 2005 |title=The ABC-TV Infomercial for John of God |journal=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Newsletter |accessdate=November 18, 2006 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100722060547/http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html |archivedate=July 22, 2010[/tpl] Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, "To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious."Randi 1995, "psychic surgery"
In 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia physician who is able to determine the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the groove on the record. However, Lintgen does not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.[tpl]cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=November 1, 2002 |title=Reading Records |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |publisher=JREF |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/110102.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100620232826/http://www.randi.org/jr/110102.html |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2010[/tpl]
In 1988 John Maddox asked Randi to join the supervision of the experiment conducted by Jacques Benveniste's team. Once a stricter protocol concerning the experiment was in place, the results could not be reproduced anymore.
James Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the accordion in question was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home's large moustache and that one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death.Randi 1995, "Home, Daniel Dunglas" According to Randi, William Lindsay Gresham told Randi "around 1960" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR).Lamont 2005, p. 302 Eric Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, "It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public."
Randi distinguishes between pseudoscience and crackpot science. He regards most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached, but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate science which "must be pursued," and from which real scientific discoveries may develop.Randi 1997, p. 170 Randi regards crackpot science as being as "equally wrong" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.[tpl]cite journal |editor-last=Ripin |editor-first=Barrett H. |date=June 1995 |title=Trio Takes Aim Against Spread of Pseudo-Science |journal=APS News |volume=4 |issue=6 |location=College Park, MD |publisher=American Physical Society |issn=1058-8132 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199506/pseudo-science.cfm[/tpl]

==James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)==

In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues update JREF's blog, Swift. Topics have included the mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle. Randi also contributes a regular column, titled "'Twas Brillig," to The Skeptics Society's Skeptic magazine. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.[tpl]cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=July 2005 |title=Fakers and Innocents |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=29 |issue=4 |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=0194-6730 |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2005-07/randi.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061027131225/http://www.csicop.org/si/2005-07/randi.html |archivedate=October 27, 2006[/tpl]

==Views on religion==

Randi's parents were members of the Anglican Church, but rarely attended services. He went to Sunday School a few times as a child, but decided to stop going when he was told not to question or doubt the teachings of the church.[tpl]cite web | url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/webpage/2010 | title=MTS: Meet James Randi | work=Meet the Skeptics! | date=13 September 2010 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Brown, Christopher[/tpl]
In his essay "Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright," Randi, who identifies himself as an atheist,[tpl]cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=August 5, 2005 |title=Our Stance on Atheism |journal=Swift |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) |type=Newsletter |accessdate=January 27, 2011 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/080505potential.html#14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120423224515/http://www.randi.org/jr/080505potential.html#14 |archivedate=April 23, 2012[/tpl] has stated that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. For example, Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being "impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes" and questions how Adam and Eve "could have two sons, one of whom killed the other, and yet managed to populate the earth without committing incest." He writes that, compared to the Bible, "The Wizard of Oz is more believable. And more fun."[tpl]cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=July 25, 2003 |title=Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright |journal=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Newsletter |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/072503.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030801101731/http://www.randi.org/jr/072503.html |archivedate=August 1, 2003[/tpl]
In An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (1995), he looks at a variety of spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji he writes: "Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret."Randi 1995, "Maharaj Ji" In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |publisher=American Humanist Association |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=September 28, 2012[/tpl]

==One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==

The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offers a prize of one million U.S. dollars to eligible applicants who can demonstrate a supernatural ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1964, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal.[tpl]cite news |title=Skeptic Revamps $1M Psychic Prize |first=Kevin |last=Poulsen |authorlink=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 |work=Wired |publisher=Condé Nast |location=San Francisco |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2008[/tpl] The prize money has since grown to $1,000,000, and has formal published rules. For example, no one has progressed past the preliminary test, which is set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He also refuses to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.[tpl]cite web |title=Rules and Guidelines |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/254-jref-challenge-faq.html |publisher=JREF |accessdate=November 28, 2012[/tpl] As of April 1, 2007, only those with an established, nationally-recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting resources on obscure claimants.
On Larry King Live, March 6, 2001, Larry King asked Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she apparently agreed.[tpl]cite interview |last1=Edward |first1=John |authorlink1=John Edward |last2=Jaroff |first2=Leon |last3=Browne |first3=Sylvia |authorlink3=Sylvia Browne |last4=Van Praagh |first4=James |authorlink4=James Van Praagh |last5=Boteach |first5=Shmuley |authorlink5=Shmuley Boteach |last6=Kurtz |first6=Paul |authorlink6=Paul Kurtz |last7=Van Zandt |first7=Clint |last8=Graff |first8=Dale |interviewer=Larry King |title=Are Psychics for Real? |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/06/lkl.00.html |program=Larry King Live |callsign=CNN |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] Randi appeared with Browne on Larry King Live six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge.[tpl]cite interview |last1=Randi |first1=James |last2=Browne |first2=Sylvia |interviewer=Larry King |title=Are Psychics Real? |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/03/lkl.00.html |program=Larry King Live |callsign=CNN |date=September 3, 2001 |accessdate=August 18, 2006[/tpl] However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/sylvia/ |title=The Sylvia Browne Clock |publisher=JREF |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
During an appearance on Larry King Live on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question.[tpl]cite interview |last1=Altea |first1=Rosemary |authorlink1=Rosemary Altea |last2=Randi |first2=James |interviewer=Larry King |title=Spiritual Medium Versus Paranormal Skeptic |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/05/lkl.00.html |program=Larry King Live |callsign=CNN |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] Instead Altea replied only, "I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere." On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on Larry King Live, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.[tpl]cite interview |last1=Altea |first1=Rosemary |last2=Randi |first2=James |interviewer=Larry King |title=The Controversy Swirling Around Psychic Sylvia Brown and Her Inaccurate Read on a Now Famous Kidnapping Victim |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/26/lkl.01.html |program=Larry King Live |callsign=CNN |date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2007[/tpl]
In October 2007, John Edward appeared on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck; when asked if he would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke then, and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/27/gb.01.html|title=CNN Transcript: GLENN BECK: John Edward Shares Insights into His Career|date=October 27, 2006[/tpl]
Randi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/231-a-direct-specific-challenge-from-james-randi-and-the-jref.html |title=A Direct, Specific, Challenge From James Randi and the JREF |last1=Randi |first1=James |year=2008 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] Randi called the ADE 651 "a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money.

==Legal disputes==

Randi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has "never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me." However, he says, he has paid out large sums to personally defend himself in these suits.

===Uri Geller===

According to Randi, Geller tried to sue Randi a number of times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third of one percent of what Geller had demanded, but this ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |title=An End to the Uri Geller vs. Randi & CSICOP Litigations? |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |authorlink=Marcello Truzzi |website=UriGeller.com |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
In 1991, Randi commented that Uri Geller's public performances were of the same quality as those found on the backs of cereal boxes. Geller sued both Randi and CSICOP. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages to CSICOP.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |title=Uri Geller Libel Suit Dismissed |date=August 1994 |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center for Inquiry |location=Amherst, NY |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070406080201/http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/skeptic/randi032.htm|title=Lawsuit Against CSICOP Dismissed |website=The Skeptic Tank |publisher=Fredric L. Rice |location=San Clementa, CA |accessdate=June 3, 2007[/tpl] Randi and Geller subsequently settled their dispute out of court, the details of which have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.

===Other===

In 1996, Baltimore District Court found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a "convicted child molester" because, although Byrd had been found guilty of child pornography offences and admitted to molestation, the admission was part of a plea bargain so he was not actually convicted.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] No damages were awarded to Byrd.[tpl]cite news |title=Randi Found Guilty of Defamation |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4CD802FEBC248&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=June 9, 1993 |accessdate=April 20, 2009[/tpl]

Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings.
