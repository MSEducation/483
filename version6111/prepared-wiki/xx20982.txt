Porto-Novo is a port on an inlet of the Gulf of Guinea, in the southeastern portion of the country. It is Benin's second-largest city, and although Porto-Novo is the official capital, where the national legislature sits, the larger city of Cotonou is the seat of government, where most of the government buildings are situated and government departments operate.  The region around Porto-Novo produces palm oil, cotton and kapok.  Petroleum was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s, and has become an important export.

==History==

Porto-Novo was once a  tributary of the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo and there continues to be a sizable Yoruba community in Porto Novo today. The city's name is of Portuguese origin, meaning "New Port." It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.
In 1863, the British, who were active in nearby Nigeria, bombarded the city, which persuaded the Kingdom of Porto-Novo to accept French protection. The neighbouring Kingdom of Abomey objected to French involvement in the region and war broke out between the two states.  In 1883, Porto-Novo was incorporated into the French "colony of Dahomey and its dependencies."  In 1900, it became Dahomey's capital city.
The kings of Porto-Novo continued to rule in the city, both officially and unofficially, until the death of the last king, Alohinto Gbeffa, in 1976. From 1908, the king held the title of Chef supérieur.
Many Afro-Brazilians settled in Porto-Novo following their return to Africa after emancipation in Brazil. Brazilian architecture and foods are important to the city's cultural life.

==Adjogan==

Adjogan music is endemic to Porto-Novo.  The style of music is played on an alounloun, a stick with metallic rings attached which jingle in time with the beating of the stick.  The alounloun is said to descend from the staff of office of King Te-Agdanlin.  The music is played to honor the King and his ministers.  The music is also played in the city's Roman Catholic churches, but the royal bird crest has been replaced with a cross.
