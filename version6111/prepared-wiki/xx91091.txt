Medical Information Technology, Inc., commonly known as MEDITECH, is a Massachusetts-based software and service company selling information systems that are installed in health care organizations.  The company was founded in 1969 by A. Neil Pappalardo.

==History==

In 1969, A. Neil Pappalardo began development of MIIS. This was one of several proprietary implementations of MUMPS, a programming language which at the time had not been standardized. MIIS users and developers later influenced efforts toward MUMPS standardization during the early 1970s; the MUMPS standard was complete by 1974 and approved by 1977. Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated health care information remained his primary focus.{https://www.meditech.com/AboutMeditech/pages/newsmeditech40thanniversary.htm}
In 1982, MEDITECH adopted the then-new MAGIC programming language. MAGIC became integral to MEDITECH's health care information systems' implementations. In 1994, the company adopted Client/Server, a second software platform. While Client/Server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/Server executes the code on a user's PC, although all code remains centralized. Client server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems.  MEDITECH unveiled its 6.0 platform in 2006.{https://www.meditech.com/AboutMeditech/pages/newsmeditech40thanniversary.htm}
