427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron (427 SOAS) ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|427e Escadron d'opérations spéciales d'aviation, 427 EOSA[/tpl]) is a tactical helicopter unit that provides aviation support to Canadian Special Operations Forces Command. The squadron is based at CFB Petawawa, Ontario with a fleet of Bell CH-146 Griffon helicopters.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=378|title = 427 Squadron|accessdate = 2009-01-22|last = Canadian Forces|authorlink = |date=December 2008[/tpl] It was originally founded as No. 427 Squadron RCAF.

==History==

427 Squadron started as a bomber squadron formed at Croft, England on 7 November 1942 and spent its wartime entirely in England as a part of No. 6 Group RCAF, RAF Bomber Command. 427 flew Vickers Wellington Mk IIIs and Mk Xs from its first operational mission on 14 December 1942, a minelaying sortie to the Frisian Islands, until May 1943 when it was relocated to Leeming, North Yorkshire. Re-equipped with Handley Page Halifax Mk V aircraft, the squadron flew intensely until early 1944 when it replaced its inventory with Halifax Mk III aircraft. This fleet saw the greatest number of missions and in slightly more than a year's time they were then replaced by Avro Lancaster bombers prior to the end of WWII. The Lancasters were used for Prisoner of War repatriation until the end of May 1946. 427 was stood down on 1 June 1946.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=392|title = 427 Squadron History World War II|accessdate = 2009-01-22|last = Canadian Forces|authorlink = |date=December 2008[/tpl]
The squadron was reformed on 1 August 1952 at RCAF Station St Hubert (a suburb of modern day Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as 427 Fighter Squadron, flying Canadair Sabres, and was transferred to No. 3 (Fighter) Wing at Zweibrücken in March 1953. Selected as the first European RCAF squadron to receive the CF-104 Starfighter in the nuclear strike role, the squadron was stood down from its day-fighter role on 15 December 1962 and reformed as 427 (Strike-Attack) Squadron two days later.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=399|title = 427 Squadron History Re-Activated as Fighter Squadron|accessdate = 2009-01-22|last = Canadian Forces|authorlink = |date=December 2008[/tpl] 
On 1 February 1968, unification integrated 427 into the new Canadian Forces. The squadron was again disbanded on 1 July 1970.
427 came back into existence as 427 Tactical Helicopter Squadron at CFB Petawawa, where it remains today.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=400|title = 427 Squadron History Tactical Helicopter Squadron|accessdate = 2009-01-22|last = Canadian Forces|authorlink = |date=December 2008[/tpl]
1 February 2006 saw command of 427 transferred to Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, as it took on a full-time role of special operations aviation support. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed as, "427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron (SOAS)." Unlike the 160th SOAR (US Army) and other units in CANSOFCOM – JTF 2, CSOR, and CJIRU – there are no specialized standards (in the "Special Operations" context) for any 427 SOAS members and entrance into 427 SOAS requires only "negotiations through Career Managers and losing units."[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/CFAWC/eLibrary/Journal/Vol3-2010/Iss1-Winter/Sections/05-The_Proposed_Canadian_Model_for_Special_Operations_Forces_Aviation-Part_2_e.pdf|title = The Proposed Canadian Model for Special Forces Aviation Part II|accessdate = 15 December 2010|last = Morehen|first = Travis A.|authorlink = |date=Winter 2010| work = The Canadian Air Force Journal[/tpl]
