The film clip starts off with Jade pinning up a poster in the record store she is working at. When a guy walks into the store that she tries to get his attention but fails. The second scene is Jade riding an electric scooter on the roads. The next scene is Jade going to a dance lesson where yet again there is the record store guy she tries to get to notice her. That scene switches between the dance practice and her bedroom. Then she follows him all around a house until it's discovered she is just a reflection.
