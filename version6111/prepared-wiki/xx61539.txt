The Peugeot 106 is a supermini produced by French automaker Peugeot from 1991 to 2004.

==Phase I==

The Peugeot 106 was introduced on 12 September 1991,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hxEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RQMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4874,1270397&dq=peugeot-106&hl=en |title=Peugeot offers new small car in Europe |publisher=Toledo Blade |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] as the French marque's entry level car slotting in beneath the 205, although it is now largely considered the exact replacement to the 205.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] It was a substantial development of the Citroën AX platform, intended to make it both heavier and safer. It was aimed directly at the Renault Clio, which had gone into production a year earlier, and as a more modern alternative to the slightly larger 205 which had been a massive success for Peugeot and was still proving popular almost a decade after its launch. Like the AX and the 205, the car had all independent suspension with Macpherson struts at the front, and compact transverse torsion bars at the rear. Winning praise for its attractive modern styling, comfortable ride, excellent handling and cheap running costs, the 106 quickly became popular. Going against the appeal were limited interior space and budget interior plastics.
Trim levels were basic XN, mid-range XR, top-spec XT, and the sporty XSi model mentioned above. In addition, from 1994 onwards there was a "Rallye" model offered. This was different from the XSi model with the TU2 series 1.3 litre petrol injection engine ([tpl]convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl]), and was only available in red, white or black. This stripped out version was designed for the sporting driver, and had little in the way of creature comforts, such as electric windows or power assisted steering. On the phase 1 model, a sunroof and anti lock brakes were the only options available from the factory, although many came with foglights or spoilers from the XSi models. In France and Portugal there was a special edition of 50 units of the Rallye, called R2, which feature extensive use of sporting material from the Peugeot-Talbot racing division which went even further with the extreme nature of the Rallye, with changes to the suspension, brakes, new 14 inch speedline rims, racing seatbelts, and engine management and exhaust upgrades, to produce [tpl]convert|106|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Phase II==

In early 1996, the Peugeot 106 also formed the basis for the near identical looks and size Citroën Saxo, and at this time the 106 received a facelift which saw all engines get fuel injection ad equipment levels raised. The XSi was dropped in favour of the new GTi model with a 1.6 16v engine.
From 1997–98, the Phase 2 Rallye was offered, and these combined the light, nimble chassis of the Phase 1 Rallye, with a 1.6 litre petrol injection engine (TU5J2, [tpl]convert|103|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) and updated looks and safety features of the later models (1996–1999). Optional Extras on the Phase 2 Rallye were; Power assisted steering, airbag and a sunroof. From 1996–1999 trim levels were XN, XL, XR, XT, XS and GTi. Note that in some European markets (e.g. Greece) the phase 2 Rallye adopted GTi's 1.6L 16v engine performing 120hp from 1998 onwards. That boosted its sales and made the car the hottest small hatch at the time.
At the end of 1998, the Peugeot 106 range was reduced to the 1.1 L petrol (Independence, XN, XL, XT Look or Zest 1/2/3), 1.4 petrol (XR, Roland Garros or Quiksilver), 1.6 8v petrol (XS or Rallye) and 1.5 L diesel (XND)  models as well as the 1.6 16v petrol (GTi/S16). This was due to the launch of the larger 206, which stole many sales from the 106. Peugeot initially intended to phase the 106 out and market the 206 as its replacement, but later decided to replace the 106 with another all-new model.
After 13 years in production, the last Peugeot 106 rolled off the production line in early 2004.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Its replacement, the 107, has been available since early 2005. By the time production ceased, the Peugeot 106 was one of the longest running production cars still made in Europe but it was still proving fairly popular, especially in its home market of France.

==Equipment==

Although the interior seemed reasonably plush at the time, the low-end models did have areas of visible metal work on the doors and a generally more sparse interior. 1.0L and some early 1.1L cars were fitted with a 4 speed manual gearbox, with all other models having a 5 speed manual with an automatic gearbox as an option.
Many of the cars sold in the UK were special editions, carrying such names as Graduate, Inca, Aztec and Independence. These were often based on the XN trim vehicles, but with the addition of bodywork graphics carrying the name of the special edition, and a few other basic options such as a tilt and slide sunroof.
Most models had only basic features, with even a radio being only an option on some variants such as the 106 'Kid' special edition (which had denim effect fabrics).
No Phase I cars had power steering in right-hand drive markets such as the UK as there was no space for the power-steering pump in these cars. This was rectified in Phase II cars, where power steering was available as standard in higher specification models, or as an option on lower specification models.
Higher up the range, electric windows, central locking (standard on the Quicksilver / XR models) manual pop-up sunroof (electric sunroof was a very rare extra), radio-cassette or radio-CD and rear wash-wipe were available.  A drivers airbag was introduced in the Phase II model as an optional extra, although it came standard on late GTis.
The GTi had black leather upholstery (optional in early models as cloth interior was standard), 14" Raptor alloy wheels, a body kit and disc brakes all round.  The leather was much of the reason for the increase in price over the otherwise near-identical Citroën Saxo VTS. GTi's built after the year 2000 are fitted with side airbags in the leather seats for added safety.
As with the Saxo, air-conditioning was never an option on right-hand-drive 106's because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk-head on the drivers side.  As a result, there was insufficient space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger side and then at the expense of the glove-box.  Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective.  The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the passenger side space.

==Electric version==

In 1995, Peugeot launched an electric powered version of the 106, called the 106 Electrique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/document/publication/history_group1083692907.pdf |title=PSA Peugeot Citroën’s Key Facts |publisher=PSA Peugeot Citroën |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] This was offered in a number of European countries including France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.
The electric powertrain was developed and built by French engineering company Heuliez. The car used Nickel-cadmium battery technology manufactured by Saft Groupe S.A., had a top speed of 56 mph (90 km/h) and had an official range of [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].
Despite the high price of the vehicle, Peugeot anticipated demand for around 15,000–20,000 Peugeot 106 Electriques each year, with an expected total production run of 100,000 vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-mobility.org/month-issue/highlight/histoiry-of-the-electric-vehicle-along-development-process.html |title=The history of the electric vehicle: a long development process |publisher=Sustainable mobility |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] In the end only 6,400 Peugeot 106 électriques were sold between 1995 and 2003, most purchased by the French Administration.

==Durability==

Although of lightweight construction, the 106 has gained a reputation for being, along with the 205 one of the most corrosion resistant cars in its class, with many early models still rust free. Many of the diesels have suffered Lucas injection pump failure, due to owners attempting to run unmodified cars on vegetable oil fuel. At high mileages the 106 is prone to wear of the rear axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. Rear suspension torsion bar/trailing arm bearings wear is the only unusual mechanical failure. If this is not repaired in time, it damages the torsion bar axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.http://www.citroen-owners-club.co.uk/citroen/index.php?/topic/10225-zx-volcane-rear-suspension/http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/forum/post/index.htm?t=17115http://www.docstoc.com/docs/122038287/Citroen-ZX-Suspension-and-steeringhttp://www.frenchcarforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=129058http://www.sspengineering.co.uk/
