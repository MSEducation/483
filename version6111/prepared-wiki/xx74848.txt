[[Don Valley Parkway]]

CATEGORIES: Don Valley, Toronto highways, Expressways in Canada

The Don Valley Parkway (DVP) is a controlled-access, municipal expressway in Toronto connecting the Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto with Ontario Highway 401, the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway. North of Highway 401, it continues as Ontario Highway 404. The parkway runs through the parklands of the Don River Valley, after which it is named. It has a maximum speed limit of [tpl]convert|90|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |title=By-Law No. 922-2003: To amend further Metropolitan By-law No. 109-86, respecting maximum rates of speed on certain former Metropolitan Roads, regarding Don Valley Parkway. |type=PDF |url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2003/law0922.pdf |date= September 24, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2011[/tpl] for its entire length of [tpl]convert|15.0|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is six lanes for most of its length but it is eight lanes north of York Mills and four lanes south of Eastern. As a municipal road, it is patrolled by the Toronto Police Service.
The parkway was the second expressway to be built by Metropolitan Toronto (Metro). Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new alignment through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401.
The parkway operates well beyond its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day and is known for daily traffic jams; some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day. Planned as part of a larger expressway network within Toronto, it was one of the few expressways built before the public opposition which cancelled many of the others.

==Route description==

The Don Valley Parkway begins at an interchange with the Gardiner Expressway near the mouth of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway 401.
 
 

===South of the Forks===

At its southern end near the mouth of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.[ref]

Less than [tpl]Convert|500|m[/tpl] north of the Gardiner, the Canadian National (CNR)/GO Toronto railway viaduct passes over the parkway. The interchange is constrained by that distance for the Gardiner – Don Valley two-lane ramps bridge the difference in height from ground-level under the viaduct with the height of the Gardiner. Acceleration and deceleration lanes for the Lake Shore – Don Valley ramps connect under the viaduct.
From the viaduct, the parkway proceeds north as a four-lane highway on a straight course along the east bank of the channelized Don River, passing beneath Eastern Avenue and veering slightly to the east as it passes below Queen Street East.[ref]
</ref>
On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each adding a lane to both carriageways. The expressway continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between the highway and Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the elevation of the highway is close to the level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.[ref]
</ref>
North from Riverdale Park, the valley widens considerably.[tpl]sfn|Whiteson|1982|pp=137–139[/tpl] The expressway rises from the floor of the valley and passes beneath the towering Prince Edward Viaduct bridge, which connects Bloor Street with Danforth Avenue and carries a subway line.[ref]
</ref>
The highway runs along the eastern wall of the valley for the next several kilometres,[tpl]sfn|Whiteson|1982|pp=137–139[/tpl] rising and dipping repeatedly.
The expressway curves eastward into a cut in the hillside as it passes the 'Half-mile' railway bridge. Immediately to the north, it meets the Bayview Avenue – Bloor Street interchange. The long off-ramp to these roads was the original southern terminus of the parkway in 1961.[ref]
</ref>
The off-ramp was later proposed as the eastern terminus of the proposed Crosstown Expressway. This expressway, opposed by the City of Toronto, was never built:[ref]
</ref>
it was intended for construction only after the completion of the Spadina Expressway, which itself was cancelled in 1971.[ref]

Just north of the Bayview–Bloor interchange, the expressway passes over Pottery Road. To the east is Todmorden Mills, a collection of historic buildings and a former industrial site, the original "Don Mills".[tpl]sfn|Darke|1995|p=9[/tpl] The nearby pond was a section of the Don River cut off by the parkway construction. Further north, to the west where the highway crosses Beechwood Avenue, is Crothers' Woods, a restoration site.[ref]
</ref>
The expressway continues due east along the southern edge of the valley.[tpl]sfn|Whiteson|1982|pp=137–139[/tpl] The opposing lanes split as the expressway passes beneath the Leaside Viaduct, the southbound lanes at a lower level. The lanes rejoin as they approach the Don Mills Road interchange at the "forks of the Don". Just east of the Don Mills Road interchange, several large white sculptures resembling human teeth are installed on both sides of the road. The sculptures, called The Elevated Wetlands,[ref]
