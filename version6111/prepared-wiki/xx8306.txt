He has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action films. Cage is known for his prolificacy, appearing in at least one film per year nearly every year since 1980, with the exception of 1985 and 1991.
In the early years of his career, Cage starred in films such as Valley Girl (1983), Racing with the Moon (1984), Birdy (1984), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Raising Arizona (1987), Moonstruck (1987), Vampire's Kiss (1989), Wild at Heart (1990), Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), and Red Rock West (1993).
Cage received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance as an alcoholic Hollywood writer in Leaving Las Vegas (1995) before coming to the attention of wider audiences with mainstream films such as  The Rock (1996), Face/Off (1997), Con Air (1997), City of Angels (1998), and National Treasure (2004).

==Early life==

Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to parents August Floyd Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy (Vogelsang), a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family.[tpl]cite news |title=Nicholas[tpl]sic|hide=y[/tpl] Cage is back with digit-al thriller 'Knowing'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/03/15/2009-03-15_nicholas_cage_is_back_with_digital_thril.html|publisher=Daily News|accessdate=July 27, 2011|location=New York|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=This much I know: Karen Koster|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/weekend/features/this-much-i-know-karen-koster-155089.html|publisher=Irish Examiner|accessdate=July 27, 2011[/tpl] His father was of Italian descent and his mother is of German and Polish descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earsxxi.blogspot.ca/2004_09_01_archive.html |title=CRC's EARS Blog :: EARS: September 2004 |publisher=Earsxxi.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl] His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata, Italy.
Through his father, Cage is the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and of actress Talia Shire, and the cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman. Cage's two brothers are New York radio personality Marc "The Cope" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy. He cites James Dean as the key inspiration for his career, saying: "I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause, East of Eden. Nothing affected me - no rock song, no classical music - the way Dean affected me in Eden. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'."[tpl]cite web |title=Nicholas Cage on the rise of the celebutard|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/nicholas-cage-on-the-rise-of-the-celebutard-it-sucks-to-be-famous-right-now-9184901.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=March 14, 2014[/tpl]

==Career==

===Acting career===

To avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage, inspired in part by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage. Since his minor role in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, with Sean Penn, Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat. He tried out for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film The Outsiders, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. He was also in Coppola's films Rumble Fish and Peggy Sue Got Married.
Other Cage roles included appearances in the acclaimed 1987 romantic-comedy film Moonstruck, also starring Cher; The Coen Brothers cult-classic comedy Raising Arizona; David Lynch's 1990 film Wild at Heart; a lead role in Martin Scorsese's 1999 New York City paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead; and Ridley Scott's 2003 drama film Matchstick Men, in which he played an agoraphobic, mysophobic, obsessive-compulsive con artist with a tic disorder.
Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, winning once for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas. His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in Adaptation. Despite these successes, most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles. The suspense thriller 8mm (1999) is considered a cult film. He took the lead role in the 2001 film Captain Corelli's Mandolin and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part. He made his directorial debut with 2002's Sonny. In 2005, two films he headlined, Lord of War and The Weather Man, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his acting in those roles. Poor reviews for The Wicker Man resulted in low box office sales. The much criticized Ghost Rider (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45 million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208 million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007. Also in 2007, he starred in Next, which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage's film, The Family Man (2000).
Most of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. In his second-highest grossing film to date, National Treasure, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. Other action hits include The Rock, in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates Alcatraz Island in hopes of neutralizing a terrorist threat, Face/Off, a John Woo film where he plays both a hero and a villain, and World Trade Center, director Oliver Stone's film regarding the September 11, 2001 attacks. He had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the S.S. from the B-movie double feature Grindhouse.
Cage made his directorial debut with Sonny, a low-budget drama starring James Franco as a male prostitute whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theatres. Cage's producing career includes Shadow of the Vampire, the first effort from Saturn Films.
In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests. On The Dresden Files for the Sci-Fi Channel, Cage is listed as the executive producer.
In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a Ring of Honor wrestling show in New York City researching his role for The Wrestler. The role was ultimately played by Mickey Rourke, who received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.
Wrestler Director Darren Aronofsky, in an interview with slashfilm.com, said of Cage's decision to leave the film that: "Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race. "
In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film Bangkok Dangerous. The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinct South-East Asian flavor. In 2009, Cage starred in science fiction thriller Knowing, directed by Alex Proyas. In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son's elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that have already come true lead him to believe the world is going to end at the close of the week, and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction. The film received mainly negative reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend. Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog. He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Cage received lauds for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writing "Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest." This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in Ghost Rider. In 2010, Cage starred in the period piece Season of the Witch, playing a 14th-century knight transporting a girl accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which he played the sorcerer.
In 2012, Cage reprised his role in Ghost Rider's sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. He voiced the character Grug Crood in the animated film The Croods, which was released in 2013. The Croods received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $585 million against a budget of $135 million.[tpl]cite web|title=The Croods|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=croods.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=October 4, 2013[/tpl]

==Acting style==

In February 2011, Cage said that, at a certain point in his career, he realized that he had developed his own method of acting, which he described as "Nouveau Shamanic." He noted, "at some point I'll have to write a book" about it.Nicolas Cage Has His Own Acting Method and It’s Called ‘Nouveau Shamanic’" Movieline. Retrieved August 23, 2011

==Praise==

Cage's acting has been praised by influential film critic Roger Ebert, who wrote in his "Great Movies" essay, about the film Adaptation, that: "There are often lists of the great living male movie stars: De Niro, Nicholson and Pacino, usually. How often do you see the name of Nicolas Cage? He should always be up there. He's daring and fearless in his choice of roles, and unafraid to crawl out on a limb, saw it off and remain suspended in air. No one else can project inner trembling so effectively... he always seems so earnest. However, improbable his character, he never winks at the audience. He is committed to the character with every atom and plays him as if he were him." In response to mixed reviews of Knowing and their focus on criticizing Cage, Ebert defended both Cage as an actor and the movie to which, in contrast to other critics, Ebert gave four out of four stars.
Lord of War co-star Ethan Hawke said of Cage: "He's the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art of acting; he's successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours." While stating that Cage had hurt his career by working on too many poor projects ("He's put a little too much water in his beer"), Hawke added: "If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/cacojck?context=3 | title=I am Ethan Hawke - AMAA | work=Reddit | date=June 5, 2013 | accessdate=June 14, 2013 | author=Hawke, Ethan[/tpl]

Now he's more like a performer."People Magazine. "Picking on Nic: Nicolas Cage bites back after Sean Penn ridicules his career."

Weston was the lead singer of the black metal band Eyes of Noctum, but broke up in 2012; Arsh Anubis, his new band of the same genre, was formed in 2011. Weston also appeared in Cage's film Lord of War as Vladimir, a young Ukrainian mechanic who quickly disarms a Mil Mi-24 helicopter.
Cage has been married three times. His first wife was actress Patricia Arquette (married on April 8, 1995, divorce finalized on May 18, 2001).
Cage's second marriage was to singer/songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley. Cage is an Elvis fan and used the star as the base of his performance in Wild at Heart. Presley and Cage married on August 10, 2002 and filed for divorce on November 25, 2002 which was finalized on May 16, 2004. The divorce proceeding was longer than the marriage.
Cage met his third and current wife Alice Kim, a former waitress who previously worked at the Los Angeles restaurant Kabuki and at the Los Angeles-based Korean nightclub, Le Privé. She bore their son, Kal-El, (after Superman's birth name) on October 3, 2005. Cage was once considered for the role of Superman in a film to be directed by Tim Burton.

So you get from the movie is far more interesting than I could ever offer."Nicolas Cage talks "Knowing", religion

===Real estate and tax problems===

Nicolas Cage is one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40 million in 2009 according to Forbes Magazine.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cage-foreclosure8-2010apr08,0,2028352.story?track=rss |title=Foreclosure auction of Nicolas Cage's mansion is a flop |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 8, 2010 |author=Lauren Beale |accessdate=April 11, 2010 [/tpl]
Cage had a Malibu home where he and Kim lived, but sold the property in 2005 for $10 million. In 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] island in the Exuma archipelago, some [tpl]convert|85|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.
He once owned the medieval castle of Schloss Neidstein in the Oberpfalz region in Germany, which he bought in 2006 and sold in 2009 for $2.5 million. His grandmother was German, living in Cochem an der Mosel.
In August 2007, Cage purchased "Grey Craig", a [tpl]convert|24000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] brick-and-stone country manor in Middletown, Rhode Island. With an estate occupying [tpl]convert|26|acre|m2[/tpl] the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the Norman Bird Sanctuary to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases until eclipsed that same year, 2007, by the $17.15 million sale of the Miramar mansion on Bellevue Avenue in Newport.
Also in 2007, the actor purchased Midford Castle in Somerset, England. Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put homes in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Nevada, and California, as well as a $7 million island in the Bahamas, up for sale.
On July 14, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a federal tax lien against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleges that Cage failed to pay over $6.2 million in federal income tax for the year 2007. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004. Cage filed a $20 million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud. The lawsuit states that Levin "had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed Cage in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses'." Cage is also facing separate lawsuits from East West Bank and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multimillion dollar loans.
Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that "instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences", Levin's complaint continued: "Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."
In his filing Levin says that in 2007 Cage's "shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items." One of those exotic items was a dinosaur skull of a Tarbosaurus for which Nicolas Cage paid $276,000 in an auction after winning a bidding contest against Leonardo DiCaprio.
According to Cage, he owned the "Most Haunted House in America", a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. The home is known as "The LaLaurie house" after its former owner Delphine LaLaurie. The house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009 along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5 million, in the wake of his financial problems.[tpl]cite news |title=Nicolas Cage: Movie star, foreclosure victim |first=Hibah |last=Yousuf |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/13/real_estate/Nicolas_Cage/index.htm?cnn=yes |publisher=CNN |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009[/tpl]
His Bel Air home, which had six loans totaling $18 million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4 million, substantially less than the $35 million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000 had been owned by Dean Martin and singer Tom Jones.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cage-foreclosure8-2010apr08,0,2028352.story | title=Foreclosure auction of Nicolas Cage's mansion is a flop | date=April 8, 2010 | first=Lauren | last=Beale |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=December 25, 2010[/tpl] The home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5 million.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/11/business/la-fi-nicolas-cage-home-20101111 | title=Nicolas Cage's Bel-Air home goes to new owner for just $10.5 million | date=November 11, 2010 | first=Lauren | last=Beale |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=December 25, 2010[/tpl] Another home in Nevada also faces foreclosure auction.
In November 2011, Cage also sold his Action Comics 1 in an online auction for a record-breaking $2.16 million (the previous record being 1.5), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/us/superman-comic/index.html?iref=allsearch | work=CNN | title=Super price for Superman comic - CNN.com | date=December 2, 2011[/tpl]

===Legal issues===

In December 2009, Christina Fulton sued Cage for $13 million and the house she is living in. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling that was brought about by Cage's financial difficulties.
On April 15, 2011, at 11:30 pm, Cage was arrested in New Orleans in the city's famed French Quarter district for suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public intoxication, after a police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/16/us-cage-arrest-idUSTRE73F24J20110416|title=Actor Nicolas Cage arrested in New Orleans|agency=Reuters | date=April 16, 2011[/tpl] Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane "Dog" Chapman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/04/niccage.html?imw=Y&f=most-viewed-24h5|title=Nicolas Cage Arrested in New Orleans (Updated)|author=Mike Vilensky|publisher=Vulture[/tpl] He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42624176/ns/today-entertainment|title=Nicolas Cage arrested in New Orleans|publisher=MSN[/tpl] On May 5, 2011, it was announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped.[tpl]cite web|author=Eugene Ernest|date=May 9, 2011|title=Court Cleared all Allegations on Nicolas Cage|url=http://www.mjbstar.com/celebrities/2011/05/09/court-cleared-all-allegations-on-nicolas-cage/[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date=May 6, 2011|title=Domestic Abuse Charges Against Nicolas Cage Dropped|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/05/06/domestic_abuse_charges_against_nicolas[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date=May 6, 2011|title=Charges dropped against Nicolas Cage in New Orleans|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=4739763&sponsor=[/tpl]
