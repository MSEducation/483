==History==

BBC Radio 3 was launched on 30 September 1967 as a result of a BBC Radio reshuffle following the launch of new pop music station Radio 1.[tpl]cite book|author=Humphrey Carpenter|title=The Envy of the World: Fifty Years of the BBC Third Programme and Radio 3, 1946-1996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bei4GwAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-81830-4[/tpl][tpl]rp|247[/tpl] All of the BBC's radio stations were relaunched to the new numbered system – BBC Radio 3 had succeeded the BBC Third Programme (that launched on 29 September 1946)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/thirdprogramme/ |title=BBC Radio 3 – Sixty Years On |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] and the BBC Music Programme (that transferred to the Third Programme daytime frequencies in 1964-5 from the Home Service) and launched alongside BBC Radio 2, formerly the Light Programme, and BBC Radio 4, formerly the BBC Home Service.

===Broadcasting in the Seventies===

The new station continued on the various strands and programmes that had previously occupied those frequencies – the Third Programme, the Music Programme and various sports and adult education programmes[tpl]rp|247[/tpl] – even persuading Patricia Hughes to return to her broadcast career.
On 4 April 1970, the Broadcasting in the Seventies document was published. Later described in 2002 by Jenny Abramsky, Head of Radio and Music, as "the most controversial document ever produced by radio",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/abramsky_oxford1.shtml |title=Sound Matters – Soundtrack for the UK – How did we get here?|accessdate=26 September 2008 |publisher=Text of a lecture given by Jenny Abramsky, News International Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media 2002 at Green College, Oxford University[/tpl] the document outlined each station's target audience and what content should be broadcast on each channel. This concept went against the earlier methods laid out by the BBC's first Director General John Reith and caused controversy at the time, despite laying out the current radio structure that is recognisable today.[tpl]cite news|title=Gerard Mansell – Obituary|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/8227237/Gerard-Mansell.html#|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 December 2010[/tpl]
At the time of the review, Radio 3 faced several problems. An early option to cut costs, required under the proposals, was to reduce the number of networks from four to three, so that Radio 3 would not broadcast during the day and would use the frequencies of either Radio 1 or 2 as the two stations would merge content. However "Day-time serious music would be the casualty" of these proposals and caused some controversy.[tpl]rp|249[/tpl] A further rumour was expressed that Radio 3 could be closed altogether as a strong statistical case existed against the station according to The Guardian.[tpl]rp|251[/tpl] However, the Director-General, Charles Curran, publicly denied this as "quite contradictory to the aim of the BBC, which is to provide a comprehensive radio service".[tpl]rp|251[/tpl] Curran had earlier dismissed any suggestion that Radio 3's small audience was a consideration: "What is decisive is whether there is a worthwhile audience, and I mean by worthwhile an audience which will get an enormous satisfaction out of it."[tpl]rp|251[/tpl]
As a result of Broadcasting in the Seventies, factual content, including documentaries and current affairs, were moved to BBC Radio 4 and the separate titled strands were abolished. The document stated that Radio 3 was to have "a larger output of standard classical music" but with "some element in the evening of cultural speech programmes – poetry, plays".[tpl]rp|253[/tpl] Equally, questions were being asked by the poet Peter Porter about whether other spoken content, for example poetry, would remain on the station. These concerns also led to the composer Peter Maxwell Davies and the music critic Edward Greenfield to fear that "people would lose the mix of cultural experiences which expanded intellectual horizons".Radio Times, 4–10 April 1970, BBC Magazines However, Radio 3 controller Howard Newby reassured these concerns by replying that only the coverage of political and economic affairs would be passed to Radio 4: Radio 3 would keep drama, poetry, and talks by scientists, philosophers and historians.
The Broadcasting in the Seventies report also proposed a large cutback in the number and size of the BBC's orchestras. In September 1969, a distinguished campaign group entitled the Campaign for Better Broadcasting was formed to protest, with the backing of Sir Adrian Boult, Jonathan Miller, Henry Moore and George Melly.Briggs (1985), p. 353 The campaign objected to "the dismantling of the Third Programme by cutting down its spoken word content from fourteen hours a week to six"  and "segregating programmes into classes".Briggs (1985), p. 355 Mention of the campaign even reached debate in the House of Commons.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stonehouse|title=British Broadcasting Corporation|journal=Hansard|date=16 October 1969|volume=788|pages=575–577|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/oct/16/british-broadcasting-corporation|accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl]

===The 'arts' controllers===

From the launch until 1987, the controllers of Radio 3 showed preferences towards speech and arts programming as opposed to focus on classical music and the Proms. The first controller, Newby, made little contribution to the station, focusing on the transition from the Third programme to Radio 3 and as a result of the Broadcasting in the Seventies report.
The second controller, Stephen Hearst who assumed the role in 1972, was different. As Hearst had previously been head of television arts features[tpl]cite news|last=Purser|first=Philip|title=Stephen Hearst obituary|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/30/stephen-hearst-obituary|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 March 2010[/tpl] his appointment was seen with scepticism among the staff who viewed him as a populariser.[tpl]rp|269[/tpl] According to Hearst when interviewed for Humphrey Carpenter's book, the main rival candidate for controller Martin Esslin, head of Radio Drama, had said to the interviewing panel that audience figures should play no part in the decision making process over programming.[tpl]rp|268[/tpl] Hearst said he responded to the same question about this issue by commenting that as the station was financed by public money it needed to consider the size of its audience – there was a minimum viable figure but this could be increased with "a lively style of broadcasting",[tpl]rp|268[/tpl]
Hearst attempted to make the content of the channel more accessible to a wider audience, but his efforts, which included the evening drivetime programme Homeward Bound and Sunday phone-in request programme Your Concert Choice (the former an uninterrupted sequence of musical items identified only at the end of the programme; the latter a resurrection from the old Home Service), were criticised.[tpl]rp|289, 296[/tpl] However, during this time the long running arts discussion programme Critics’ Forum was launched[tpl]rp|290[/tpl] as well as themed evenings and programmes of miscellaneous music including Sounds Interesting.Radio Times, Saturday 1 April 1978, BBC Magazines
In 1978, Ian McIntyre took over as controller of Radio 3 but quickly faced uncomfortable relationships between departments. At approximately the same time Aubrey Singer became Managing Director of Radio and began to make programming on the station more populist in a drive to retain listeners in face of possible competition from competitors using a "streamed format".[tpl]rp|304[/tpl] An example of this is the replacement of Homeward Bound in 1980 with an extended, presenter-driven programme called Mainly for Pleasure. The same year an internal paper recommended the disbandment of several of the BBC's orchestras and of the Music Division, resulting in low morale and industrial action by musicians that delayed the start of the Proms.[tpl]rp|306–307[/tpl] Senior management was also getting dissatisfied with listening figures leading to the Director-General Alasdair Milne to suggest that presentation style was "too stodgy and old-fashioned".[tpl]rp|313[/tpl]

===The 'music' controllers===

In 1987 the positions of Controller of Music and Controller of Radio 3 were merged, and with it the operation of the Proms, under the former Music Controller John Drummond. Drummond, like Hearst, believed that the music programmes' presentation was too stiff and formal[tpl]rp|326[/tpl]Drummond (2001), p. 354 and he therefore encouraged announcers to be more natural and enthusiastic. Repeats of classic drama performances by the likes of John Gielgud and Paul Scofield was also included after he found that newer drama was "gloomy and pretentious".Drummond (2001), p. 370-371 He also introduced features and celebrations of the anniversaries of famous figures including William Glock, Michael Tippett and Isaiah Berlin. Drummond also introduced the show Mixing It which targeted the music genres that fell between Radios 1 and 3, often seen as a precursor to the programme Late Junction.
During Drummond's time, Radio 3 also began to experiment with outside broadcasts including an ambitious Berlin Weekend to mark the reunification of Germany in 1990 and a much praised weekend of programming that was broadcast from London and Minneapolis-St Paul – creating broadcasting history by being the first time a whole weekend had been transmitted "live from another continent".[tpl]rp|331[/tpl] However, Drummond complained about the former that "not one single senior person in the BBC had listened to any part of it",[tpl]rp|331[/tpl] reflecting his general feeling that the BBC senior management paid little attention stating: "I can't remember ever having a serious conversation with anyone above me in the BBC about Radio 3 ... I would much rather have had the feeling that they thought it mattered what Radio 3 did."[tpl]rp|328–329[/tpl]
Drummond's successor was Nicholas Kenyon, previously chief music critic of The Observer, who took over in February 1992 and was immediately faced with the looming launch date for commercial competitor Classic FM who were, and still remain, Radio 3's biggest rivals. Kenyon, similar to Singer a decade earlier, believed that Radio 3 had to make changes to its presentation before the new station began broadcasting rather than react later.[tpl]rp|304, 339[/tpl] As a result three senior producers were sent to study classical music stations in the United States[tpl]rp|339[/tpl] and the station hired advertising agents Saatchi & Saatchi to help improve public perception. Kenyon's tenure was to met with much controversy: in attempts to update the station's presentation, popular announcers Malcolm Ruthven, Peter Barker and Tony Scotland were axed; drama was cut by a quarter resulting in a letter of protest to The Times signed by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Fay Weldon among others;[tpl]rp|342[/tpl] two new programmes for drive time, entitled On Air and In Tune, were launched[tpl]rp|341[/tpl] and a new three-hour programme of popular classics on Sunday mornings fronted by Brian Kay was also launched.[tpl]rp|342[/tpl]
These moves were defended by Kenyon who argued that the changes were not "some ghastly descent into populism" but were instead to create "access points" for new listeners.[tpl]rp|341[/tpl] However there was still "widespread disbelief"[tpl]rp|357[/tpl] when it was announced in the summer that a new morning programme would take the 09:00 spot from the revered Composer of the Week and would be presented by a signing from Classic FM – the disc jockey Paul Gambaccini. The criticism, especially once the programme went on air a few weeks later, was so unrelenting that Gambaccini announced the following spring that he would not be renewing his contract with Radio 3.[tpl]rp|357[/tpl]
However, Kenyon’s controllership was marked by several highly distinguished programming successes. Fairest Isle was an ambitious project from 1995 which marked the 300th anniversary of the death of Henry Purcell with a year-long celebration of British music and the programme Sounding the Century, which ran for two years from 1997, presented a retrospective of 20th-century music. Both won awards.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7162929.stm |title=Knighthood for ex-Proms supremo |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 October 2008 | date=29 December 2007[/tpl]
He also introduced a number of well received specialist programmes including children’s programme The Music Machine, early music programme Spirit of the Age, jazz showcase Impressions, vocal music programme Voices and the arts programme Night Waves.
BBC Radio 3 began nighttime transmissions in 1996 with the introduction of Through the Night, consisting of radio recordings from members of the European Broadcasting Union and distributed to some of these other stations under the title Euroclassic Notturno.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/euroclassicnotturno/| title=Euroclassic Notturno| publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] The introduction of 24-hour broadcasting resulted in the introduction of a 22.00 fixed programming point so that if live programme overran, later programming could be cancelled to allow Through the Night to begin promptly.
In 1998, Roger Wright took over as controller of the station. Soon after his appointment some changes were made to showcase a wider variety of music; a new, relaxed, late-night music programme Late Junction featured a wide variety of genres; programmes focusing on jazz and world music were given a higher profile as were programmes presented by Brian Kay, focusing on light music, and Andy Kershaw, whose show was previously dropped by Radio 1. In these changes, Wright believed that, in the case of the former, he was addressing "this feeling people had that they didn't want to put Radio 3 on unless they were going to listen carefully" and in the latter cases that he was "not dumbing down but a smarting up" the programmes.[ref]

By 2004, Radio 3's programming and services were being recognised by the corporation at large, as seen in the 2003/4 Charter renewal application and the Annual report for the year which reported that Radio 3 had "achieved a record audience reach in the first quarter of 2004",BBC Annual Report 2003/04, p. 34 and by the government: the Secretary of State's foreword to the government’s Green Paper in 2005 made special mention of "the sort of commitment to new talent that has made Radio 3 the largest commissioner of new music in the world" as a model for what the BBC should be about.Review of the BBC’s Royal Charter: A strong BBC, independent of government,  Department for Culture, Media and Sport, March 2005, p. 3
By 2008 however, the station faced pressures to increase its audience by making programmes more accessible while loyal listeners began to complain about the tone of these new changes. Presentation was described as "gruesome in tone and level"[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/arts/12742/part_3/update-on-three.thtml |title=Update on Three |publisher=The Spectator| year=2004|accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] and global music output was mocked as "street-smart fusions" and "global pop".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/michael-church-the-bbcs-growing-debasement-of-world-music-485175.html|publisher=The Independent on Sunday|title=The BBC’s growing debasement of world music|accessdate=24 September 2008 | location=London | date=28 February 2005[/tpl] At the same time RAJAR began to record lower listening figures and decisions on policy were being changed resulting in the children's programmeMaking Tracks, experimental music programme Mixing It, theatre and film programme Stage and Screen and Brian Kay’s Light Programme being dropped, a reduction in the number of concerts[ref]

In spite of the changes, figures still continued to fall.<ref>[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/aug/16/radio1 |title=Radio 3 hits all-time low |publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=24 September 2008 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=16 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080908133151/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/aug/16/radio1| archivedate= 8 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]</ref>
The mid to late 2000s did however offer new projects undertaken on the station: The Beethoven Experience in June 2005 saw the broadcast of his works broadcast non-stop for six days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/beethoven/index.shtml |title=The Beethoven Experience |publisher=BBC website |accessdate=16 December 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081230213618/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/beethoven/index.shtml| archivedate= 30 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] A similar project occurred six months later when A Bach Christmas was ran for ten days in the lead to Christmas[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/bach/ |title=A Bach Christmas |publisher=BBC website |accessdate=16 December 2008[/tpl] and in February 2007 when a week was similarly given over to the works of Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/tchaikovsky/radio_highlights.shtml |title=Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky on Radio 3 |publisher=BBC website |accessdate=16 December 2008[/tpl] As part of the original Beethoven Experience, the BBC trialled its first music downloads over the internet by offering free music downloads of all nine symphonies as played by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra under Gianandrea Noseda. The stated aim was "to gauge audiences' appetite for music downloads and their preferred content, and will inform the development of the BBC strategy for audio downloads and on demand content".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/05_may/27/beethoven.shtml | publisher=BBC, 27 May 2005 |title=BBC to offer Beethoven downloads |accessdate=3 December 2008[/tpl] The experiment was wildly successful, attracting 1.4 million downloads but was met with anger from the major classical record labels who considered it unfair competition and "devaluing the perceived value of music".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/downloading-trouble-at-the-bbc-498238.html |publisher=Independent on Sunday, 10 July 2005 |title=Anthony Barnes, Downloading trouble at the BBC |accessdate=3 December 2008 | location=London | date=10 July 2005[/tpl] As a result, no further free downloads have been offered, including as part of the BBC iPlayer service, and the BBC Trust has ruled out any classical music podcasts with extracts longer than one minute.
In 2007, Radio 3 also began to experiment with a visual broadcast as well as the audio transmissions. In October 2007, Radio 3 collaborated with English National Opera in presenting a live video stream of a performance of Carmen, "the first time a UK opera house has offered a complete production online"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/26/carmen.shtml |publisher=BBC, 26 October 2007 |title=Radio 3 and ENO offer first UK videostreaming of opera online | accessdate=3 December 2008[/tpl] and in September 2008, Radio 3 launched a filmed series of concerts that was available to watch live and on demand for seven days "in high quality vision".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/09_september/12/radio3.shtml |publisher=BBC, 12 September 2008 |title=Radio 3 to film live concerts for online broadcast |accessdate=3 December 2008[/tpl] This strategy was also introduced to some of the BBC Proms concerts.
By the latter years of the 2000s, Radio 3's prospects were improving. The year 2008/9 saw the introduction of more concerts[ref]
