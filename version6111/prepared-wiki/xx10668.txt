==Biography==

Jordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He served two tours in Vietnam (from 1968 to 1970) with the United States Army as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with "V" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm. After returning from Vietnam he attended The Citadel where he received an undergraduate degree in physics. After graduating he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977. He was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe collecting. He described himself as a "High Church" EpiscopalianDragonmount, the Robert Jordan blog (June 1, 2007), and received communion more than once a week.Dragonmount, the Robert Jordan blog (September 27, 2007). He lived with his wife Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan's editor) in a house built in 1797.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/jordan/bio.html|title=Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time|accessdate=August 10, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012024117/http://www.tor.com/jordan/bio.html|archivedate=October 12, 2007[/tpl] Responding to queries on the similarity of some of the concepts in his Wheel of Time books with Freemasonry concepts, Jordan admitted that he was a Freemason. However, "like his father and grandfather," he preferred not to advertise, possibly because of the negative propaganda against Freemasonry. In his own words, "no man in this country should feel in danger because of his beliefs."[tpl]cite web |title=Freemasonry and the Wheel of Time|url=http://13depository.blogspot.com/2002/03/freemasonry-and-wheel-of-time.html[/tpl]

==The Wheel of Time==

Jordan published 11 books of a total 14 in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series. Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments owing to the expansion of scale of the series as a whole.Cannon, Peter. CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT (Book). Publishers Weekly; December 23, 2002, Vol. 249 Issue 51, p.50
Because of his health problems, Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment A Memory of Light (later split into three volumes beginning with The Gathering Storm), but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death, and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/?p=66 |title=Robert Jordan's Official Blog |publisher=Dragonmount.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] He maintained that in doing so the book will get published even if "the worst actually happens."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/30/robert-jordan-illness-tech-media_cx_hc_books06_1201jordan.html |title=Forbes article on Jordan's illness |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] On December 7, 2007, Tor Books announced that Brandon Sanderson had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series.

==Other published works==

===Cheyenne Raiders===

Cheyenne Raiders is a western published in 1982 under the pen name Jackson O'Reilly for the Forge imprint of Tor Books.

===The Fallon Saga===

The Fallon Blood (1980), published under the pen name Reagan O'Neal, was Jordan's second novel and first published novel. It was edited and published by Jordan's future wife, Harriet McDougal, for her personal imprint, Popham Press. After they finished promoting the book on tour, they began dating, and when Jordan asked McDougal to marry him, he began selling his books directly to Tom Doherty at Tor Books.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=108#21 | title=Sydney Independent Theatre Q&A | publisher=Theoryland | author=Robert Jordan | date=1999-08-30 | accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl] The following two books, The Fallon Pride (1981) and The Fallon Legacy (1982) were published under Tor's Forge imprint. Jordan originally planned to take the series much further:

===Conan the Barbarian===

Jordan was one of several writers who have written new Conan the Barbarian stories. When Tom Doherty obtained the rights, he needed a novel very quickly, so Jordan's wife Harriet McDougal recommended him because she knew he had written his first novel, Warriors of the Altaii, in thirteen days.

Jordan wrote seven novels in the series:
Some bibliographies also include Conan: King of Thieves; this was actually the working title of the second Conan movie, and hence also the title of Jordan's novelization. Jordan had already been hired to do the novelization and Tor had already applied for an ISBN when the title was changed to Conan the Destroyer.WOT Encyclopaedia
They were packed into two separate volumes:
Jordan also compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.

==Unpublished works==

===Warriors of the Altaii===

Warriors of the Altaii is Jordan's first novel, which remains unpublished; it is 98,000 words in length, and he finished it in thirteen days. Donald A. Wolheim at DAW Books made an offer for it, but revoked the offer when Jordan requested a small change in his contract.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=168#11 | title=SFRevu Interview with Robert Jordan | publisher=SFRevu | author=Ernest Lilley | date=2003-01-21 | accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl] When Harriet McDougal was Editorial Director for Ace Books, Tom Doherty hired Jim Baen to work under her, and when Doherty left Ace to start Tor Books in 1980, Baen followed, working at Tor for a few years before starting his own imprint, Baen Books.[tpl]cite web | url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html | title=Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel (WorldCon 2008, Denver) | publisher=仮 | author=Peter Ahlstrom | date=2008-08-31 | accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://david-drake.com/topic/01-about-me/10-jim-baen/ | title=Jim Baen (obituary) | publisher=david-drake.com | author=David Drake | date=2006-11-22 | accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl] Baen did not have a very high opinion of fantasy, and so he bought Warriors for Ace Books as a science fiction novel. When he left Ace for Tor, Susan Allison took his place and reverted the rights for the novel to Jordan. When McDougal returned to Charleston to start her own imprint, Popham Press, she met Jordan and published his first novel, The Fallon Blood.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=203#3 | title=Fine Print Interview with Robert Jordan | publisher=Fine Print Audio | author=Rick Kleffel | date=2003-01-20 | accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl]

===Infinity of Heaven===

Jordan mentioned several times that he planned another fantasy series set in a different kind of world. He said that it would be a Shōgun-esque series about a man in his 30s who is shipwrecked in an unknown culture which would be similar to Seanchan culture in his Wheel of Time serieshttp://linuxmafia.com/waygate/no-haunt/jordan.letter and world. The books would detail his adventures there and would have been titled Infinity of Heaven.Tarvalon.net News[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
He said that he would have begun writing these after finishing his work on the 12th and final main sequence book of The Wheel of Time. Jordan said, "Infinity of Heaven almost certainly will be written before the prequels, though I might do them between the Infinity books." Also according to Dragonmount.com, Jordan planned to write some side-story novels, before completely abandoning his decades-long work. Jordan had particularly stressed that this series would be significantly shorter than The Wheel of Time saga (about 6 books long and essentially two trilogies).
