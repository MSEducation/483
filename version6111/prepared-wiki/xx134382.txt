Lille Cathedral, the Basilica of Notre Dame de la Treille (French: Basilique-cath√©drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille de Lille), is a Roman Catholic cathedral and basilica, and a national monument of France, located in the city of Lille.
It has been the seat of the Bishop of Lille since the creation of the diocese in 1913, although construction of the church of Notre Dame de la Treille began in 1854. The church takes its name from a 12th-century statue of the Virgin Mary.
