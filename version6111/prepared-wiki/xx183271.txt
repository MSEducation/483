[[Toyota Racing Series]]

CATEGORIES: Toyota Racing Series, Recurring sporting events established in 2005

The Toyota Racing Series is New Zealand's premier "open-wheeler" motorsport category. The Series includes races for every major trophy in New Zealand circuit racing including the New Zealand Motor Cup and the Denny Hulme Memorial Trophy. The cars are also the category for the New Zealand Grand Prix – one of only two races in the world with FIA approval to use the Grand Prix nomenclature outside Formula One.

==Summary==

The Toyota Racing Series is an incubator and showcase for the next generations of New Zealand racing talent, the Series offers emerging drivers the chance to gain valuable experience with carbon-fibre composite chassis, aerodynamics and slick tyres.
The Series has the full endorsement of Motorsport New Zealand, the sport's governing body.
Previously, the country's leading drivers had to go offshore to step up to this level. High profile graduates from the series to date includes Brendon Hartley, now signed to race Formula Three for the respected Carlin Motorsport team in the UK and Earl Bamber.http://www.toyotaracing.co.nz/Default.aspx?pageid=629
For 2008, the series has also gone "green". Fuels for all cars racing in the series are now an E85 biofuel blend of 85 per cent ethanol made from whey, a dairy industry by-product; and petrol. Reduced emissions, reduced carbon "footprint" and reduced use of fossil fuels are all being showcased in this unique New Zealand programme. The 2008 New Zealand Grand Prix thus becomes the first ever biofuel grand prix in the world.
Because of the Series' format during the Southern Hemisphere summer, drivers overseas are now participating in the season.  Drivers from Europe and the Americas are participating in the 2014 season.
