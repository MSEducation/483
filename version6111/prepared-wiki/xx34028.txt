[[Trisiras]]

CATEGORIES: People in Hindu mythology

Trisiras (Tamil: Tirichira) is the three-headed son of Tvashta in Hinduism. He was created by Tvashta to dethrone Indra. With one head, he ate; with another head, he observed his surroundings; with his last head, he read the Vedas.  He grew so powerful that Indra became frightened of him, especially after Trisiras scorned the women Indra sent to seduce him.  Indra killed him and Trisiras' father, Tvashta, created Vritra to gain revenge.
Trisiras was also known as Viśvarūpa (in the Bhagavata Purana).
