Fountain Elms is a historic home located at Utica in Oneida County, New York. It is part of the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute. The original block was completed in 1852 in the "Italian Style".  It is basically a cube with a center hall plan.  The original rear wing was remodeled in 1883 and a third two story wing added.  An additional wing and piazza was added in 1908, resulting in the current irregular plan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6035|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Fountain Elms|date=March 1972|accessdate=2010-01-08 |author=T.
