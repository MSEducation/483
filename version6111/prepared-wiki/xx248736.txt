==History==

The Polaris Project was founded in 2002, by Derek Ellerman and Katherine Chon, who were seniors at Brown University, when they were inspired to create a nonprofit organization that focuses on ending human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The inspiration came to them after learning about a forced labor criminal case which exposed how six South Korean women were forced to work at a brothel in Providence, Rhode Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/democracy-english/2009/March/20090309102700ebyessedo0.7852594.html |title=Katherine Chon and Derek Ellerman: Fighting Human Trafficking |publisher=America.gov |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl] The organization was named after the North Star, which slaves in the Southern United States used to help them find their way along the Underground Railroad to freedom in the North. The organization is committed to ending human trafficking and slavery and focuses its efforts in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/05/battling-the-modern-slave-trade/ |title=Fighting modern slave trade | Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl] Polaris Project is one of the few organizations working on all forms of trafficking, including supporting survivors who are male, female, transgendered and children, US citizens and foreign nationals and survivors of both labor and sex trafficking. In April 2013, Polaris Project launched their Global Human Trafficking Hotline Network to connect with international anti-trafficking organizations running hotlines and coordinate efforts.
