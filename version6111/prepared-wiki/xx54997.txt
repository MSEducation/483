[[Peppermint EP]]

CATEGORIES: 1992 EPs, Sloan albums, Murderecords albums, Debut EPs

Peppermint EP was the first album released by Canadian rock band Sloan.  It was released on their own label, Murderecords, in 1992.  The sound of the band at this point was often described as a mix between Sonic Youth and The Beatles.  Three of the songs on the EP (Marcus Said, Underwhelmed, and Sugartune) were also included on the band's first full-length album, Smeared, although Underwhelmed appears here in a different version.
The EP was recorded at Sound Market Studios in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada by Terry Pulliam, who also engineered the recording. Jennifer Pierce of the group Jale provides additional backing vocals on two selections in the recording ("Marcus Said" and "Torn").
