The Snowy Mountains Highway is a highway in New South Wales, Australia. Its two sections connect the New South Wales South Coast to the Monaro region, and the Monaro to the South West Slopes via the Snowy Mountains. The higher altitude regions of this road are subject to snow over the winter months, and the road also provides access to many parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The highway bears the B72 shield along its entire length.
The highway originally bore then name Monaro Highway until 1958, when it received its current name. It originally ran from [tpl]NSWcity|Tathra[/tpl] to [tpl]NSWcity|Wagga Wagga[/tpl] but has been shortened to run from the Princes Highway to the Hume Highway instead. Part of the roadway was reallocated to what is now known as the Monaro Highway in 1955. Reservoirs created as a result of dams built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme required the creation of major realignments to avoid submerged areas. Previous to New South Wales' conversion to alphanumeric route markers, it was signed as National Route 18.

==Route description==

The Snowy Mountains Highway begins at a T-intersection with the Princes Highway at [tpl]NSWcity|Stony Creek[/tpl], north of [tpl]NSWcity|Bega[/tpl]. It heads roughly west through hilly terrain, the terrain smoothes eventually and the road crosses the Bemboka River at Morans Crossing. A short distance further, the road passes through [tpl]NSWcity|Bemboka[/tpl]; taking on the name Loftus Street within the urban area. West of Bemboka, the road follows the southern bank of the Bemboka River, before crossing the Nunnock River near its confluence with the Bemboka River at the base of the Great Dividing Range escarpment. Up until this point the immediate landscape surrounding the road has so far consisted of farmland. From the base of the range the road enters South East Forest National Park and follows a steep and winding alignment up the range from about [tpl]convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, to over [tpl]convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. At the top of the range the road then enters Glenbog State Forest before once again traversing farmland for a short distance until it meets the Monaro Highway at [tpl]NSWcity|Steeple Flat[/tpl], south of [tpl]NSWcity|Nimmitabel[/tpl]. This intersection is a T-intersection, through traffic continues north on the Monaro Highway, while traffic heading to the south from either direction must turn. To reach the western section of the Snowy Mountains Highway the Monaro Highway must be taken north towards [tpl]NSWcity|Cooma[/tpl] at this point.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/doingbusinesswithus/downloads/lgr/reg_table_for_internet_31jan11.pdf | title=Schedule of Classified Roads and Unclassified Regional Roads | publisher=NSW Roads and Maritime Services | date=August 2013 | accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
The western section begins at the Bombala and Sharp Street roundabout in Cooma. The highway takes on the name Sharp Street from this intersection as it heads west within Cooma urban area. Upon leaving Cooma, the road heads west via farmland to the village of [tpl]NSWcity|Pine Valley[/tpl]. Here the road meets a T-intersection, with through traffic taking Kosciuszko Road southwest towards [tpl]NSWcity|Jindabyne[/tpl]. The highway turns to continue on its westerly heading. The roadway then makes its way through undulating terrain for some distance before it passes through [tpl]NSWcity|Adaminaby[/tpl], and on into Kosciuszko National Park. The road winds through mountainous terrain as it climbs towards the abandoned mining settlement of [tpl]NSWcity|Kiandra[/tpl], situated at an altitude of around [tpl]convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The landscape becomes open grassland at this point and remains relatively flat as the road continues relatively gently up an alpine valley created by the Eucumbene River and its numerous tributaries. At the top of the valley the road reaches its highest point a little below [tpl]convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The road then descends into part of a similar valley created by the Murrumbidgee River as it passes by the access roads for Yarrangobilly Caves. The highway then veers northwest back into forested terrain and continues along the same rough heading through hilly terrain for some distance before a mountainous descent from [tpl]convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], near the town of [tpl]NSWcity|Talbingo[/tpl] which is located a few kilometres west of the highway. Continuing on, the roadway passes by Jounama Dam and then roughly parallels the eastern side of Blowering Reservoir (created by Blowering Dam further downstream). It then leaves the National Park descending into farmland on the Tumut Plains, roughly [tpl]convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level.
From here the highway then crosses the Tumut River and heads into the town of [tpl]NSWcity|Tumut[/tpl] itself, taking on the names Blowering Street, Fitzroy Street, and Adelong Street within the urban area. West of Tumut the road crosses a large valley created by Gilmore Creek and Deep Creek, before a small climb through Adelong Gap into the town of [tpl]NSWcity|Adelong[/tpl], taking on the names Tumut Street, Inglis Street, and Lynch Street within the urban area. Beyond Adelong, the road continues northeast through undulating terrain before crossing Hillas Creek and then following it for the last few kilometres until the Snowy Mountains Highway's western terminus at the Hume Highway, located roughly halfway between [tpl]NSWcity|Gundagai[/tpl] and [tpl]NSWcity|Tarcutta[/tpl].
High altitude sections subject to snow and ice have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes double or triple height); in contrast to the white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.[tpl]cite web | url=http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/drivers/badweather/snowdriving.html | title=Snow driving | publisher=NSW Government - Transport for New South Wales | date=4 July 2013 | accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/alpha/72/b72.htm | title=NSW Route B72 | publisher=Ozroads | work=Photos of route B72 - Bega to Tumblong | date=27 July 2013 | accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The Snowy Mountains Highway was listed as a State Highway by the New South Wales Main Roads Board (MRB) in their 1928 annual report. The following year, the MRB's hierarchical system which supported this listing was proclaimed with the passing of the Main Roads (Amendment) Act, April 1929. The highway was classified as State Highway 4, and originally known as the Monaro Highway. It ran from [tpl]NSWcity|Tathra[/tpl], via [tpl]NSWcity|Bega[/tpl], [tpl]NSWcity|Cooma[/tpl], [tpl]NSWcity|Tumut[/tpl], and various other towns and villages, to [tpl]NSWcity|Wagga Wagga[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/environment/downloads/heritage/rta_thematic_history.pdf | title=RTA Thematic History |edition=2nd | publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority | date=February 2006 | accessdate=23 July 2013 | author=Kass, Terry | pages=37[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article987060 | title=The New Roads Policy | work=The Canberra Times | date=2 October 1928 | accessdate=23 July 2013 | page=2[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/shopnsw/documents/agency22/RTA018.pdf | title=Snowy Mountains Highway | publisher=NSW Department of Main Roads | work=Main Roads | date=December 1955 | accessdate=23 July 2013 | pages=44, 51[/tpl] In 1933, the Department of Main Roads (DMR) which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year; proclaimed the portion of the Snowy Mountains Highway between Wagga Wagga and the Hume Highway at Lower Tarcutta to be part of the Sturt Highway. The Snowy Mountains Highway then terminated at its own junction with the Hume Highway instead.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/environment/downloads/heritage/rta_thematic_history.pdf | title=RTA Thematic History |edition=2nd | publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority | date=February 2006 | accessdate=23 July 2013 | author=Kass, Terry | pages=84[/tpl]
