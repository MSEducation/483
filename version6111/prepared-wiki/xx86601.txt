Gaël Duval (born 1973) is a graduate of the Caen University in France, where he studied networks and documentary applications. In July 1998, he created Mandrake Linux (now Mandriva Linux), a Linux distribution originally based on Red Hat Linux and KDE. He was also a co-founder of MandrakeSoft (now merged in Mandriva) with Jacques Le Marois and Frédéric Bastok.
Gaël Duval was responsible for communication in the Mandriva management team until he was laid off by the company in March 2006, in a round of cost-cutting. Duval suspected part of the reason for his dismissal was disagreement with management over the company's future strategy, resulting in a lawsuit against the company.La page perso de Gaël Duval, créateur de Mandrake Linux/Mandriva Linux, co-fondateur de Mandrakesoft/Mandriva - FAQ Mandriva Interview of François Bancilhon, CEO of Mandriva
