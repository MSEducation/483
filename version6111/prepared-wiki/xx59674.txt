[[Variety (botany)]]

CATEGORIES: Botanical nomenclature, Plant taxonomy

In botanical nomenclature, variety (abbreviated var.; in Latin: varietas) is a taxonomic rank below that of species: as such, it gets a three-part infraspecific name. 

==Example==

The pincushion cactus, Escobaria vivipara (Nutt.) Buxb., is a wide-ranging variable species occurring from Canada to Mexico, and found throughout New Mexico below about [tpl]convert|2600|m|ft[/tpl]. Nine varieties have been described. Where the varieties of the pincushion cactus meet, they intergrade. The variety Escobaria vivipara var. arizonica is from Arizona, while Escobaria vivipara var. neo-mexicana is from New Mexico.
