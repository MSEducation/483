Phosphorus pentafluoride, PF5, is a phosphorus halide. It is a colourless gas at room temperature and pressure.

==Structure==

Single-crystal X-ray studies indicate that the PF5 molecule has two distinct types of P−F bonds (axial and equatorial): the length of an axial P−F bond is 158.0 pm and the length of an equatorial P−F bond is 152.2 pm.  Gas-phase electron diffraction analysis gives similar values: the axial P−F bonds are 158 pm long and the equatorial P−F bonds are 153 pm long.
Fluorine-19 NMR spectroscopy, even at temperatures as low as −100 °C, fails to distinguish the axial from the equatorial fluorine environments.  The apparent equivalency arises from the low barrier for pseudorotation via the Berry mechanism, by which the axial and equatorial fluorine atoms rapidly exchange positions.  The apparent equivalency of the F centers in PF5 was first noted by Gutowsky.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gutowsky, H. S.; McCall, D. W.; Slichter, C.

Berry pseudorotation influences the 19F NMR spectrum of PF5 since NMR spectroscopy operates on a millisecond timescale.  Electron diffraction and X-ray crystallography do not detect this effect as the solid state structures are, relative to a molecule in solution, static and can not undergo the necessary changes in atomic position.
