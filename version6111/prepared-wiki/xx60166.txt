James White was the first European settler in the district and established Burrangong Station in 1826 with a squatting claim of [tpl]convert|100|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. Gold was found in the district in 1860.  Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat, a reference to the grazing of sheep that was the main industry until mining.  The town was gazetted in 1861.  The goldfields produced 470,000 ounces of gold sent by escort from the fields. Up to 20,000 miners worked the fields including about 2,000 Chinese miners.
Lambing Flat Post Office opened on 1 March 1861 and was renamed Young in 1863.[tpl]Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions |url=https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&country= | accessdate = 2011-05-26[/tpl]
From November 1860 through to June 1861 anti-Chinese miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area, now known as the infamous Lambing Flat riots.  As gold became scarce, European miners began to resent what they saw as the greater success of the more industrious Chinese, and hence many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed.  The anti-Chinese rebels rallied in numbers of up to 3,000.  Eventually the rioters were controlled, Chinese miners had their claims restored to them, but the New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill which restricted the number of Chinese that could be brought into New South Wales on any ship and imposed a tax per head on entry.
In 1889 Young was the first town in Australia to install electricity into the streets and homes of the township, Tamworth NSW installed electricity to the streets only the previous year.t
Young is acknowledged as the first Local Government Area to institute a rural school bus system in New South Wales

==The Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens==

Young Shire Council has established these gardens adjacent to the site of Chinamans Dam, which is an old railway dam about 4 km south of Young. They are intended to create an ambience similar to the Japanese Gardens at Cowra. Chinamans Dam, with an initial capacity of over [tpl]convert|2|e6impgal|m3[/tpl] when it was in railway use, is situated at a very small place called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. The story goes that the dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedemann, to provide water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. At some time in the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site.
The story of the dam as a railway facility began in 1882 when the NSW Railway Commissioners gave notice of the intention to build the first part of the Blayney-Demondrille railway. To provide water for its steam locomotives, the Commissioners decided to provide a dam and pump water from it to a facility, known as Young Tank, at the [tpl]convert|246|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] post. It is not known whether the railways enhanced the existing dam or built a new facility.
From 1885 to 1901, locomotives stopped at Young Tank to replenish their water. In 1901, watering facilities were built at Young Station. The supply of water was obtained from Chinamans Dam. The capacity of the dam was enlarged in 1911.
The dam was a popular spot for swimming. Whilst officially frowned upon, it was tolerated.
Following the connection to the South West Tablelands Water Supply Scheme, which provided water from Burrinjuck Dam, the railways ceased to draw water from Chinamans Dam after 1936. The site was returned to the Crown in 1962 and in the following year, a [tpl]convert|36|acre|adj=on[/tpl] reserve was established and the Shire Council appointed as Trustees. The dam has since been enlarged.Chinaman's Dam Young Sharp, Stuart Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, January, 2002 pp3-8
