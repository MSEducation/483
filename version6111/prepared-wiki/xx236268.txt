==History==

The festival concept was born in 1993. At first it was called Jeunesses Musicales International Festival and hosted only classical music events, but the idea of the festival was changed in 2002. Together with the new name of EUROPAfest, three more music genres were added to the festival's agenda: jazz, blues and pop.
In 2005 the festival came under the patronage of Their Royal Highnesses Princess Margarita and Prince Radu.Prince Radu blog, 8 April 2010
Every year, the EUROPAfest brings more than 300 musicians from 45 countries.
