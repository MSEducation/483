[[Anouschka]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Germany, Eurovision songs of 1967

"Anouschka" was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, composed by Hans Blum and performed in German by Inge Brück.
The song was performed ninth on the night, following Finland's Fredi with "Varjoon - suojaan" and preceding Belgium's Louis Neefs with "Ik heb zorgen". At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 8th in a field of 17.
The song is a ballad, with Brück telling a friend ("little Anouschka") that "he" - presumably a former lover - will come back to her soon enough, and that she shouldn't cry.
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1968 Contest by Wencke Myhre with "Ein Hoch der Liebe".
