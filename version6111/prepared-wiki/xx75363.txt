==Etymology==

The word Samut originates from the Sanskrit word Smudra meaning ocean, and the word Songkhram from Sanskrit Sangrama meaning war. Hence the name of the province literally means War Ocean.

==Geography==

Samut Songkhram is located at the mouth of the Mae Klong river to the Gulf of Thailand. With several canals (khlong) the water of the river is spread through the province for irrigation. At the coast are many lakes for producing sea salt. The sandbar Don Hoi Lot at the mouth of the river is famous for its endemic shell population of Solen regularis.

==History==

In the Ayutthaya period the area of Samut Songkhram was known as Suan Nok (Thai สวนนอก, Outer garden) and was administrated by Ratchaburi. During the reign of King Taksin it was made a province. It was the birthplace of Queen Amarindra of King Rama I, who also initiated the name Suan Nok. The birthplace of King Rama II in Amphawa district is now a Memorial Park.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows a drum over a river. The Thai word for drum is klong, thus refers to the Mae Klong river, as well as the old name of the province, Mae Klong. On both sides of the river coconut trees are displayed as one of the main product of the province.

The provincial slogan is City of Hoi Lot, Top Lychee, King Rama II Memorial Park, the Mae Klong River, and Luangpho Ban Laem.
