[[Jainism in North Karnataka]]

CATEGORIES: Jain community, Culture of Karnataka, Religion in Karnataka, Jainism in India

Jainism in North Karnataka  flourished under the Chalukyas, Kadamba and Rashtrakutas, and Vijayanagara empire. 
Imbued with an intense religious feeling, lavish patronage was extended towards the building of basadis, temples and magnificent statues. Jainism enjoyed the highest repute among the people particularly the ruling classes and the mercantile community thus virtually becoming the state religion.

==Introduction==

The earliest dated structure is a basadi at Halasi built under the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi thus laying the foundation for Jain architecture in North Karnataka. 
Besides the Kadambas, the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas made liberal endowments towards the propagation of art and architecture to which the Jain contributions have been of classical significance. 
The Chalukyas of Badami built cave temples at Badami and Aihole. Puligere was a strong centre of religious activities of the Jain monks during this era.  
Imbued with an intense religious feeling, lavish patronage was extended towards the building of basadis, temples and magnificent statues. 
Many Jain basadis erected by them are proof of their secular spirit in encouraging this religion.
Jain architecture can be classified into two categories namely basadis and bettas. 
Basadi is a Jain monastery or temple where an image of one of the twenty-four tirthankaras (saints) is installed and worshipped. They were built in the Dravidian style and the oldest basadi can be traced back to the 8th century AD. Betta is a hill with an open courtyard containing the image of Gommata or Gommateswara. Lakkundi and Humcha or Humbaj have, over the centuries, been some of the important centres of Jains, in South India.
North Karnataka contributed richly to the development of Jaina architecture 
in Karnataka. After the seventeenth century, the construction of Jaina temples did not become artistic creations but served the religion. Thus the long tradition of Jaina monuments which perhaps started by the early centuries of the Christian era ended by the eighteenth century AD. in North Karnataka.

==Contribution to Kannada literature==

The literary zeal of the Jains continued well into the age of the Rashtrakutas, covering not only religion but 
also embracing many secular branches of learning including mathematics and astronomy. Giant literary figures 
like Pampa, Ponna and Ranna, thrived under the enlightened rule of the kings of this dynasty.

===Literary figures of the Jains===

The Kannada poet Adikavi Pampaâ€™s works include Vikramarjuna Vijaya, also known as Pampa Bharata, Adipurana, narrating the story of Rishabha, the first tirthankara. 
Ranna was the author of Sahasra Bhima Vijaya, describing the fight between Bhima and Duryodhana. Neminatha Purana, a history of the 22nd tirthankara, provides a Jain interpretation for the story of Krishna and the Pandavas. Under the patronage of Amoghavarsha I, Ganithasarasangraha was a work on mathematics by Mah%C4%81v%C4%ABra_(mathematician).

==Monuments in North Karnataka==

Jainism exerted considerable influence over the cultural life of Karnataka during the rule of the Rashtrakutas. Several basadis were erected for the further propagation of the religion in the State. Important among them is the Parsvanatha Basadi at Ron with its exquisitely carved grills depicting gandharvas in scrollwork.

===Kadambas===

===Badami Chalukyas===

After the rule of the Kadambas of Banavasi most parts of north Karnataka came under the rule of the early Chalukya or Badami Chalukyas.
The Jaina architectural beginnings made earlier by the Kadambas of Banavasi, crystallised into better structures in stone during the early Chalukyas (Badami Chalukyas) period. Badami Chalukyas used stone as the medium of their architecture.

He had appointed the famous Jaina saint Gunabhadra as the teacher for his son Krishna. Krishna gave liberal donations to the Jaina temple at Mulgund. 
Many of the Rashtrakuta feudatories like Rattas of Saundatti were staunch supporters of Jainism, an estimate of at least one third of the total population of the Deccan during the period were Jains.
The Jaina monuments of the Rashtrakutas period are found at Pattadakal, Malkhed, Lakshmeshwar, Koppal, Bankur, of North Karnataka

The Neminatha basadi at Malkhed, the capital of the Rashtrakutas belongs to the 9th century A. D.

===Kalyani Chalukyas===

Most parts of North Karnataka came under the rule of Kalyani Chalukyas With the decline of the Rashtrakutas, they built Jaina temples, granted gifts to Jaina establishments and individual saints. The development of Kalamukhas on the one side and the Virasaivism of Basavanna on the other were making great progress in North Karnataka and naturally this did not give enough scope for Jainism to blossom as it did in the earlier Rashtrakuta period. 
Attimabbe, known as danachintamani is a well known personality of this period. She is said to have made one 1000 copies of Ponna's Santi purana and distributed as Sastradana. Attimabbe built a Jaina temple at Lakkundi to which the king 
provided a golden Kalasa. Somesvara's minister Santinatha persuaded Lakhma to build the Mallikamoda Santinatha basadi at Baligrama. 
The Chalukyas of Kalyana were great temple builders all over Karnataka and they brought out new development in various components of temple.
