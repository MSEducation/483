==Critical reception==

Giving it three stars out of five, Billy Dukes of Taste of Country thought that some of the songs were "sleepy" but praised "What'cha Gonna Do?" and "The Shade".[tpl]cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/oak-ridge-boys-its-only-natural/|title=It's Only Natural review|last=Dukes|first=Billy|work=Taste of Country|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl] A four-star review came from Bobby Peacock of Roughstock, who thought that its new songs were mostly well-suited to the group, and praised the re-recordings for their arrangements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/the-oak-ridge-boys-it-s-only-natural/|title=It's Only Natural review|last=Peacock|first=Bobby|date=20 September 2011|work=Roughstock|accessdate=7 March 2012[/tpl]
