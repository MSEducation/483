The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) maintains many cemeteries specifically devoted to veterans. Most have various rules regarding what must take place in order to be interred there.
The VA only permits graphics on Government-furnished headstones or markers that are approved emblems of belief, the Civil War Union Shield (including those who served in the U.S. military through the Spanish American War), the Civil War Confederate Southern Cross of Honor, and the Medal of Honor insignia. Arlington National Cemetery has similar restrictions on headstones, though it is maintained by US Department of the Army.
The religious symbols are rendered as simple inscriptions without sculptural relief or coloring other than black.
Generally the VA adds a new symbol a few months after receiving a petition from a faith group.  However, the Wiccan symbol was only added in 2007 to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of several families by Americans United for the Separation of Church and State in November 2006.[tpl]cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Neela|title=Use of Wiccan Symbol on Veterans’ Headstones Is Approved|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/washington/24wiccan.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 24, 2007[/tpl] The VA added emblem of belief #37 – "WICCA (Pentacle)".[tpl]cite press release|url=https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/veterans-affairs-department-must-accommodate-wiccan-symbol-on-memorial-markers|title=Veterans Affairs Department Must Accommodate Wiccan Symbol On Memorial Markers At Government Cemeteries, Says Americans United|publisher=AU|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stewart v.
