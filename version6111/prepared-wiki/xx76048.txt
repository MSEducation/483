==Manufacturing==

In addition to stocking a variety of regional brand products, The Kroger Company also employs one of the largest networks of private label manufacturing in the country. Thirty-seven plants (either wholly owned or used with operating agreements) in seventeen states create about 40% of Kroger's private label products. Similar to most major supermarket retailers, Kroger uses a three-tiered private label marketing strategy. One private brand emphasizes no-frills products at the lowest possible price, another is intended to be comparable to leading national brands but a better value, and the third is a premium–often organic–brand.

===Manufacturing plants===

====Dairies====

Kroger operates 15 dairies, 2 ice cream plants, and 2 cheese plants:

====Bakeries====

Kroger operates 6 bakeries, 2 frozen dough plants and 1 deli plant:

====Grocery items====

Kroger operates 5 grocery and 2 beverage plants:

====Meat plants====

Kroger operates 2 meat plants:

==Private brands==

Kroger brand products are produced and sold in three quality tiers:[tpl]cite web|title=Three-Tier Marketing Strategy|url=http://www.thekrogerco.com/about-kroger/operations/manufacturing|publisher=Kroger|accessdate=17 December 2013[/tpl]

===Kroger Value===

The Kroger Value line of products was introduced in 1981 by the name of Cost Cutter and was known for its near-generic product labeling. It was then succeeded by FMV, which was a backronym to mean For Maximum Value, originally meaning Fred Meyer Value. It offered staple products such as sugar, flour, bread, and canned goods at the lowest price for that particular product in the store. Though some FMV products (such as their cheese made with water and partially hydrogenated soybean oil) use a lower-quality manufacturing process, other products appear to be indistinguishable from their banner brand equivalent (FMV sugar and Kroger sugar, for example) other than the price.
In early 2007, Kroger replaced FMV with the new Kroger Value brand. This has led to a situation where Kroger brand and Kroger Value brand products are sold side-by-side with little to distinguish them except for packaging and price. The brand change departed from the typical orange-fade-to-yellow labels and is now simply white with blue and red. Since then Kroger has expanded the line to many other items, such as frozen food, butter, dog and cat food, ice cream, paper towels, bleach, and other food and household items. Most Kroger Value brand items are bilingually labeled (in English and Spanish).

===Banner Brands===

Banner Brands, goods that bear the name of Kroger or its subsidiaries (i.e., Ralphs, King Soopers, etc.) or make reference to them (i.e., Big K) are offered with a "Try it, Like it, or Get the National Brand Free" guarantee, where if the customer does not believe the Kroger brand product is as good as the national brand, they can exchange the unused portion of the product with their receipt for the equivalent national brand for free. Many of Kroger's health and beauty goods, one of the company's fastest-growing private label categories, are manufactured by third-party providers; these products include goods like ibuprofen and contact lens solution.

===Private Selection===

Products marked Private Selection are offered to compare with gourmet brands or regional brands that may be considered more upscale than the standard Kroger brand products.
While the Private Selection name includes many products, two of the most popular Private Selection items are ice cream and deli meat.

===Simple Truth Organic===

Simple Truth Organic is a brand offered to compare with other organic brands with often simpler packaging and is becoming larger in 2014 as a part of Kroger's marketing.

===Other private label brands===

As well as the major grocery brands, Kroger's manufacturing creates a variety of general merchandise brands. These are featured especially in Fred Meyer stores, where more than half the goods sold are non-food, or in the smaller Fred Meyer-based Marketplace stores. The following brands might be found in various Kroger-owned stores:
Bread
Dairy
Deli
Drug & General Merchandise
Frozen Food
Grocery and General Merchandise
Whole Health (Nutrition)

===Disney Magic Selections===

In 2006, Kroger partnered with the consumer products division of The Walt Disney Company to add the Disney Magic Selections line to its private label offerings.[tpl]cite web | publisher=The Kroger Co | title=Kroger introduces Disney Magic Selections in stores nationwide| url=http://www.thekrogerco.com/corpnews/corpnewsinfo_pressreleases_07252006.htm | accessdate=8 October 2006[/tpl] In reality, many of these products have been substituted in place of Kroger's Signature brand equivalents on the shelf, often with an increase in price. With packaging featuring animated Disney and Pixar characters, such as Mickey Mouse as Chef Mickey, these products are marketed to help promote healthy eating among children. Most of the approximately one hundred initial products contain zero grams of trans fat and include food offerings such as yogurt, breakfast foods, and small fresh fruit cups.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] This product offering was phased out and re-replaced with Kroger Br

==Pharmacy Group==

Kroger previously owned and operated the SupeRx drug store chain. In 1985, Kroger outbid Rite Aid for the Hook's Drug Stores chain, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, and combined it with SupeRx to become Hook's-SupeRx. In 1994, Kroger decided to get out of the stand-alone drug-store business, and sold its SupeRx stores to Revco, which later was sold to CVS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hooksmuseum.org/our-history/|title=Our History |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |publisher=Hook's Drug Store Museum and Soda Fountain |accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl]
Today, Kroger operates more than 1,948 pharmacies. Most of them are located inside its supermarkets. The Kroger Pharmacies continue as a profitable portion of the business, and have been expanding to now include pharmacies in City Market, Dillons, Fred Meyer, Fry’s, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs, Smith’s Food and Drug, and Kroger Supermarkets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jobs.kroger.com/kroger/go/Pharmacy-Jobs/395412/|title=Pharmacy Careers |publisher=Kroger|accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl]

==Supermarket Petroleum Group==

Since 1998, Kroger has added fuel centers in the parking lots of its supermarkets. As of the first quarter of 2013, Kroger operated 1,182 supermarket fuel centers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thekrogerco.com/about-kroger/operations/grocery-retail|title=Supermarket petroleum group |publisher=Kroger|accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl] In 2006, Kroger introduced a new common logo for all of its convenience store chains that is now also used at the fuel centers of all of its supermarket chains—a rhombus with a white, stylized image of the continental United States in the center bordered by four colored areas:  dark blue representing the Pacific Ocean; red representing Canada; green representing the Atlantic Ocean; and yellow representing the Gulf of Mexico.

==Movie rentals==

Most Kroger locations now feature Redbox movie rental kiosks.  Previously, some Kroger locations featured kiosks from The New Release (aka Moviecube); most of these kiosks have since been replaced by Redbox kiosks. Also, until 2012, Kroger locations in the Columbus, Ohio area featured kiosks by Blockbuster Express (originally DVD Play).

==Distribution/Logistics==

Food distribution and buying takes place under various subsidiaries and divisions. These include:[tpl]cite web|title=Standard Vendor Agreement for Merchandise (Products) |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.thekrogerco.com/docs/default-document-library/standard-vendor-agreement-(sva)-document-merchandising.pdf|publisher=Kroger|accessdate=17 December 2013[/tpl]
Kroger operates its own fleet of trucks and trailers to distribute products to its various stores, in addition to contracts with various trucking companies.

==Financial services==

Kroger Personal Finance was introduced in 2007 to offer various stores' branded Visa; mortgages; home equity loans; pet, renter's and home insurance, identity theft protection and wireless services. In 2011, Kroger dropped its contract with MasterCard, and now offers store credit and debit cards through Visa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.123rewardscard.com/ |title=KPF:1-2-3 Rewards® Visa Card |publisher=123rewardscard.com |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-03[/tpl]

===i-wireless (Wireless services)===

i-wireless is a national private label wireless service provider sold in over 2,200 retail locations within the Kroger family of stores across 31 states. i-wireless allows customers to accrue minutes on their i-wireless phone in exchange for using their shopper's card on qualifying purchases. The i-wireless service functions over the Nationwide Sprint Network. Customers can choose from monthly, unlimited, or pay-per-use plans that do not have contracts, activation fees, or the ability to roam.
