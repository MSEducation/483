[[Nebraska Cornhuskers]]

CATEGORIES: Nebraska Cornhuskers, College sports teams in Nebraska

The Nebraska Cornhuskers (often abbreviated to Huskers) is the name given to several sports teams of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference. The Cornhuskers compete in NCAA Division I, fielding 22 varsity teams in 15 sports.
Early nicknames for the university's athletic teams included the "Hawkeyes" (which is now associated with the University of Iowa), the "Antelopes" (which the University of Nebraska at Kearney later adopted), the "Old Gold Knights", the "'Bugeaters'" and the "Mankilling Mastodons".  The name Cornhuskers first appeared in the school newspaper as "We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours" referring to a 20–18 upset victory over Iowa in 1893.  The name would be used again, this time to refer to Nebraska by Charles "Cy" Sherman in The Nebraska State Journal during the 1899 season and would replace all other names by 1900.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=2802http://www.huskernews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/1999/01/01/380d0d7a3
The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, Herbie Husker and Lil' Red.
The Cornhuskers participate in 21 sports sponsored by the Big Ten Conference. In addition the Huskers field varsity teams in two sports not sponsored by the Big Ten, namely rifle and bowling. The rifle team is a member of the single-sport Great America Rifle Conference, while the bowling team competes as an independent.
For over 100 years, the Cornhuskers participated in what is now known as the Big 12 Conference, having been a member since the conference's earliest predecessor, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, later the Big Eight Conference, was founded.

===Cross country===

The Nebraska Cornhuskers field both a male and female cross country team coached by Jay Dirksen. They currently run on a course through Pioneer's Park in Lincoln. The men's team started in 1938 and the women's team started in 1975 as a result of title IX. The Nebraska Cornhuskers have never won a Big 12 conference championship. The only men's conference championship was in 1940 Big Six meet. The women have won the conference championship 5 times.

===Football===

The Husker football team began competitive play in 1890, claimed 46 conference championships and part or all of five national championships: 1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997. The latter three mark one of only three times that a team has won three NCAA Division I-A/FBS national football championships in four seasons.  The other two were Notre Dame in 1946, 1947 and 1949, and Alabama in 2009, 2011 and 2012. Over the past 25 years, the Huskers' three Division I national championships are tied with Florida and Florida State for the third-most of any Division I FBS university, behind only Miami (Florida) and Alabama, which have respectively won five and four titles.
The winningest head coach in Cornhusker history is Tom Osborne, who led the team for 25 seasons and also had the highest winning percentage of any Nebraska coach during his tenure from 1973 to 1997; his final record at Nebraska was 255–49–3. The Cornhuskers won three national titles under Osborne, including one in his final season.
Nebraska's home games always open with the Tunnel Walk, which signifies the entry of the team onto the field. When the Cornhuskers play at home in Memorial Stadium, the stadium holds more people than Bellevue (the third-largest city in Nebraska). The current attendance record was set on Saturday, September 26, 2009, when 86,304 people watched the Cornhuskers play Louisiana-Lafayette.  They currently hold the NCAA record for the most consecutive sold out home games; the sellout streak dates back to November 3, 1962.
On December 2, 2007, athletic director Tom Osborne named Bo Pelini head football coach at Nebraska. Pelini left his previous position as defensive coordinator at LSU after the 2008 National Championship win against Ohio State. Pelini was defensive coordinator at Nebraska in 2003 and was interim head coach for the 2003 Alamo Bowl game, replacing former head coach Frank Solich.
Pelini won his first three bowl games (including the 2003 Alamo Bowl) and lost his fourth and fifth.  After his first four years as head coach, Pelini has a record of 39–16 as head coach at Nebraska.  This record includes bowl victories in the Gator Bowl on January 1, 2009, against the Clemson Tigers and the 2009 Holiday Bowl against the Arizona Wildcats.  The 2009 Holiday Bowl was notable in that Nebraska gave the bowl game its first shutout in its 32-year history. This also earned Nebraska its first shutout in 46 bowl appearances.  On December 31, 2010, Nebraska played in the Holiday Bowl for a second consecutive year, this time against the Washington Huskies. Nebraska lost the game 19–7, even though the Huskers had played Washington earlier in the non-conference season and won 56–21. On January 2, 2012 Nebraska lost to South Carolina 13–30 in the 2012 Capital One Bowl played in Orlando, Florida.
The previous Husker coach was Bill Callahan, who was hired before the 2004 football season and was later fired by interim Athletic Director Tom Osborne on November 24, 2007.  Callahan represented a break from tradition in many ways. First, Callahan was the first head coach since 1956 not to be hand-picked by his predecessor. Second, Bill Callahan had implemented the West Coast Offense at Nebraska. The Huskers had previously been known for the tough running game; specifically, running the option with a strong backfield, while their new style relies heavily on a balance between the run and the pass. The previous three head coaches were Frank Solich, Tom Osborne, and Bob Devaney.
Nebraska achieved 800 total wins on October 14, 2006 with a 21–3 victory over Kansas State. As of April 2011, there are eight teams with 800 wins: Michigan, Texas, Notre Dame, Nebraska, Ohio State, Penn State, Oklahoma, and Alabama.

===Women's soccer===

Nebraska became the first team in the Big Eight to create women's soccer as a varsity sport in the 1995 season. John Walker was hired to coach the soccer team in April 1994 and was determined to get the Huskers into an NCAA tournament by 2008. During his second season, he led the Huskers to the NCAA tournament followed by an addition nine consecutive trips to the tournament, with his first miss in the 2006 season. The team has reached the Sweet sixteen eight times and to the Elite Eight on two occasions. John Walker has earned NSCAA/Umbro National Coach-of-the-Year, NSCAA/Umbro Central Region Coach-of-the-Year and Big 12 Conference Coach-of-the-Year over his tenure at Lincoln. The Husker program has created many professional athletes that went on to the WUSA.  The Huskers record is 256-108-23 through the 2011 season.

===Volleyball===

Nebraska is home to one of the nation's most storied collegiate women's volleyball programs. The Nebraska women's volleyball team has won three NCAA Women's Volleyball National Championships, in 1995, 2000, and 2006 and has had three NCAA National Runner-up finishes in 1986, 1989, and 2005 as well as 5 other NCAA National Semifinal (Final Four) appearances in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2008 bringing the program total to 11 NCAA Final Four appearances.  The Nebraska program is second only to Stanford in all-time NCAA Tournament wins, all-time NCAA Tournament winning percentage, number of NCAA National Semifinal (Final Four) appearances, and in the number of NCAA National Championships won.  Nebraska has made an NCAA Tournament appearance in every year of the tournament's existence except for the tournament's first year in 1981. Nebraska has had more combined AVCA 1st and 2nd team All-Americans than any other program, tops the nation in the number of AVCA 1st team All-Americans, and has produced 4 AVCA National Player of the Year award winners.  Nebraska also is one of only three programs east of the west coast to have won a NCAA Women's Volleyball National Championship.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&KEY=&SPID=23&SPSID=18| title = Nebraska volleyball history | last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = August 1, 2008[/tpl]
Nebraska volleyball is a very popular spectator sport in the state.  In 2008, AVCA executive director Kathy DeBoer described Nebraska as "the epicenter of volleyball fandom". The four largest ever NCAA volleyball crowds were in the state of Nebraska, including the largest ever crowd of 17,209 for the 2006 National Championship game between Nebraska and Stanford. In 2005, an NCAA volleyball-record 13,252 tickets were pre-sold for the NCAA regionals. The vast majority of these sales are attributed to Nebraska volleyball fans, as these games were played at the Qwest Center in Omaha.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=11&SPID=23&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=219589| title = Omaha breaks NCAA ticket sales mark | last =  | first =  | date = December 7, 2005  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = August 1, 2008[/tpl] The Huskers also have the ongoing NCAA record for consecutive home sellouts in a women's sport at the Nebraska Coliseum in Lincoln.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=1604564| title = Huskers Sweep Bears, 3-0 | last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = [/tpl]
The 4,030-seat Nebraska Coliseum has provided the Nebraska volleyball program with an unmatched home-court advantage. Nebraska has had 15 undefeated seasons at home compiling an all-time record of 454-30 (.938) under its roof. Only three times in 33 years of regular-season Big Eight/Big 12/Big Ten play has a conference opponent ever won in Lincoln.
At the Coliseum, the Huskers are the current holders of the NCAA record for the most consecutive sellouts in a women's sport.
The Nebraska Coliseum is one of the few collegiate arenas that is designed specifically for volleyball.  It is noted for its classical architecture, intimate setting with fans close to the floor, perpetually sold-out crowds, and deafening acoustics.  The Coliseum has statistically proven to be one of the most difficult venues for visiting teams to win in all of sports, has anecdotally been described as 'the arena that the volleyball gods would build', and has drawn comparisons to Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium due to its design, acoustics, and intimate atmosphere.  It has also been the subject of a CBS Sports documentary.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&KEY=&SPID=23&SPSID=399| title = Nebraska Coliseum | publisher = NU athletics[/tpl]
The Nebraska Cornhuskers Women's Volleyball team holds 4 NCAA team records:

==Winter varsity sports==

===Men's basketball===

While the University of Nebraska has experienced varying amounts of success for their intercollegiate athletic programs, men's basketball has been an exception. Nebraska has not won a conference title since sharing the Big Seven Conference with Kansas and Kansas State in 1950, and they haven't won an outright conference title since going a perfect 12–0 through the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletics Association in 1916.
Nebraska is one of the few major BCS conference programs never to win a single game in the NCAA Tournament. In fact, the first trip to the NCAA Tournament for Nebraska did not come until 1986, after 90 years. Much of the team's success came under the tenure of Danny Nee, head coach from 1987 to 2000. Nee is the team's all-time winningest head coach with a record of 254–190. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their six NCAA Tournament appearances, six bids to the National Invitation Tournament, including the 1996 NIT Championship.
The most recent head coach was Doc Sadler, until his firing in March, 2012.Nebraska Cornhuskers fire Doc Sadler as coach - ESPN When he was hired, he replaced Barry Collier, who led Nebraska from 2000 to August 2006. Collier left to become athletic director at Butler University.Sadler signs six-year contract with Cornhuskers - Men's College Basketball - ESPN
Tim Miles was hired on March 24, 2012 as the next head men's basketball coach at Nebraska. Miles came to Nebraska after a five-year stint at Colorado State University.

===Women's basketball===

Women’s basketball started as a club sport in 1970 and five years later it became a varsity sport when scholarships were offered. George Nicodemus was the first head coach and had a 22-9 record in his first season, taking the Huskers to the AIAW where they lost in the second round of the tournament. Five different head coaches would be hired after Nicodemus left the program in 1971 until 1986 when Angela Beck took a stable head coach position. Beck led the Huskers to their first NCAA bid after winning the Big 8 championship in 1988. She led the Huskers back to the NCAA in 93 and 96. She left the program in 1996 to pursue other opportunities and was replaced by Paul Sanderford. Sanderford led the Huskers to a NCAA sub-regional in 1998 and 1999 and received a third consecutive NCAA bid in 2000. Connie Yori became the head coach in 2002 and has led the Huskers to WNIT in 2004, 2005, 2006, and NCAA in 2007, 2008, and 2010.

===Bowling===

Bowling has been an official varsity sport at Lincoln since the 1996-1997 season. Before bowling became a varsity sport, it was a club sport coached by Bill Straub who led the club team to two national IBC titles in 1991 and 1995. Bill Straub was hired as the full-time bowling coach and has led the team to three more IBC titles in 1997, 1999 and 2001. In 2003, the NCAA created a tournament for Women’s bowling and the Nebraska Women’s Bowling team has been one of the top college bowling teams since the start of NCAA competition, which the Huskers won the first two national titles in a row, came in third place during the third NCAA tournament and have won three of the first six NCAA tournaments. The Huskers added a fourth NCAA championship in 2013.  The huskers have been ranked in the top 5 teams since 1990 and have never been ranked below 17th place. The Huskers can be seen bowling at the East Campus Bowling Lanes.

===Men’s gymnastics===

The Nebraska Men's Gymnastics team is one of the most successful teams in the nation with 8 national team titles and 41 NCAA event titles. Ten huskers have gone on to represent the United States in the Olympics. The Huskers compete in the Big Ten Conference, along with fellow Big Ten conference schools Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio State and Penn State.

===Women’s gymnastics===

The Nebraska Women’s Gymnastics team was first established in 1975. After the first season, the school hired head coach Karen Balke to lead a team of all freshman and sophomores for one year. Judy Schalk took over as head coach in 1977 until 1983. She led the Huskers to five conference titles and to one AIWA bid. In 1983, Rick Walton was hired to serve as head coach and led the Huskers to their first NCAA women’s gym event title when Michele Bryant came in first place on the vault. He captured four straight Big 8 championship titles and led the huskers to the NCAAs four times in a row. After the 1993 season, Rick Walton left the program and Dan Kendig was brought in. In his first year he became the Big 12 coach of the year after leading the Huskers to a Big 8 championship. In 1997 the Huskers reached the Super Six Finals for the first time by beating #1 ranked Utah. Kendig was named national coach of the year in 1999 after earning 6 conference championships in a row. Kendig's team has won four event titles when Heather Brink won two NCAA event titles in all around and vault in 2000 and Richelle Simpson won the all around title and the floor exercise title in 2003. The huskers have never had a losing season.

===Rifle===

Rifle is classified as a co-ed sport by the NCAA and is currently classified as a women's sport at the University of Nebraska.  Rifle got its start as an official sport of the university during the 1998-1999 season under coach Karen Anthony.  The team practices and has meets at the 10-point indoor firing range located in the Military and Naval Sciences Building (ROTC).  The current coach is coach Morgan Hicks who started in the 2007-2008 season.  The team has had several invitations to the NCAA tournament and has won two individual national titles.

===Men's indoor track and field===

The indoor Nebraska track and field team started in 1922 under coach Henry Schulte who led the Huskers to nine conference titles before his retirement. His assistant Ed Weir replaced Schulte and won five addition indoor conference titles before moving on to be the assistant athletic director. Jerry Lee would lead the team for a single season in 1955 before Frank Sevigne took over the program. Under Sevigne, the Huskers won 11 individual national championships, with 42 all-American athletes and 103 individual conference champions in combined indoor and outdoor track and field. After his retirement in 1983, current coach Gary Pepin took over the program and coaches both the men’s and women’s teams.

===Women's indoor track and field===

The Nebraska Cornhuskers Women's track and field team was created in the 1975-76 academic year and started competing in the 1976 season in the Big 8 conference.  The starting coach, Roger Capan, would only be at Nebraska for one season before leaving the program; he was replaced by Carol Frost, who stayed at Nebraska through the 1980 season.  The current coach, Gary Pepin, took over the program in 1981 and has led the women huskers to three national titles.  The NCAA started awarding the national title for Women's Track and Field in 1983, prior to that the award was given by the AIAW.

===Wrestling===

With over 100 years of history, Nebraska wrestling is one of the most storied programs in the collegiate wrestling ranks. The first official Nebraska wrestling team started in 1910 with Dr. R.G. Clapp as coach. Current Head Coach Mark Manning has taken the Huskers to new heights in his tenure and has established himself as one of the top wrestling coaches in the nation.[tpl]cite web|title=The Leader|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=3114|publisher=Nebraska-Omaha University|accessdate=2014[/tpl]  Former standouts from the Nebraska Wrestling Team include 2004 Greco-Roman Olympic Gold Medalist at 120 kg Rulon Gardner, and NCAA Champion in 2009 and 2011 Jordan Burroughs who won the 2011 Freestyle World Championships at 74 kg in Istanbul, Turkey.  Burroughs subsequently won the Gold Medal at 74 kg at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

===Baseball===

Nebraska baseball has seen a resurgence since the turn of the century. After many years of being a perennial doormat, the 2000 Huskers became the first team in school history to advance to the Super Regionals in the NCAA tournament. In 2001 and 2002, the Huskers made their first and second appearances in the College World Series. Much of the success of these teams and the teams that have followed is due to the efforts of Dave Van Horn, who compiled a record of 214-92 while leading Huskers from 1998-2002. After the 2002 season, Van Horn left to accept a position at his alma mater, Arkansas; assistant coach Mike Anderson became head coach.
The Huskers moved venues in 2002 from Buck Beltzer to Hawks Field at Haymarket Park, widely considered one of the best collegiate baseball facilities in the country. They have been in the top 30 for average attendance every year since the move to the field. Their home record at Hawks field is 249-88-1.
The 2005 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team had their most successful season ever, going 57-15 and advancing to the College World Series for the third time in five years while Alex Gordon won the Dick Howser Trophy.
The 2008 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team was the last team to make the NCAA tournmanet hosting a regional but like 2003 and 2006 they couldn't advance to a super regional ending their season.
From 2009 to 2011 came a disappointing streak of seasons for the Big Red. 2009 was the worst season since 1997 going 25–28–1 while not making the Big 12 tournament for the first time and didn't make a regional for the first time in 5 years. Hoping to come back from a down season, the 2010 and 2011 Huskers improved but were still not able to make the Big 12 tournament or an NCAA regional going 27–27 and 30–24 respectively to end the Huskers affilition in the Big 12 Conference.
Before moving to the Big 10 Conference, Mike Anderson and the entire coaching staff were terminated on May 22, 2011 after going 82–79–1 and missing the Big 12 tournament the last three seasons[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=205153857 | title = Osborne Announces Change in Baseball Program| date = May 22, 2011 | publisher = Huskers.com [/tpl] and the University of Nebraska hired former Husker and Major League All-Star Darin Erstad on June 2, 2011 to replace Mike Anderson as head coach of the team after 1 season as a volunteer assistant coach.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=205156686 | title = Erstad Named Nebraska Head Baseball Coach | date = June 2, 2011 | publisher = Huskers.com [/tpl] A few days later, Ted Silva was hired as pitching coach[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=205160813 | title = Silva Named Pitching Coach at Nebraska | date = June 16, 2011 | publisher = Huskers.com [/tpl] as well as former huskers Will Bolt as associate head coach[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=205157990 | title = Bolt Returns to Nebraska as Associate Head Coach | date = June 8, 2011 | publisher = Huskers.com [/tpl] and Jeff Christy as volunteer assistant coach.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=205179166 | title = Christy Joins Husker Baseball Staff | date = July 5, 2011 | publisher = Huskers.com [/tpl]
