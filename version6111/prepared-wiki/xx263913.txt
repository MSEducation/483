CATEGORIES: Lactones

cis''-3-Methyl-4-octanolide''', also called cis-β-methyl-γ-octalactone' or 5-butyldihydro-4-methylfuran-2(3''H'')-one, is a chemical compound of the lactone family with formula [tpl]chem|C|9|H|16|O|2[/tpl].  It exists in two optical isomers: 3R,4R ("+") and 3S,4S ("-").  
The 3S,4S isomer, commonly known as whisky lactone or quercus lactone is an important ingredient in the aroma of whiskey (where it was first identified by Suomalainen and Nykänen in 1970),and other alcoholic beverages that have been aged in oak barrels. It is sometimes added to the liquor as a flavoring agent.NITS Material Measurement Laboratory, Cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide.
