Quintillus ([tpl]lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Claudius Quintillus Augustus[/tpl];In Classical Latin, Quintillus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS AVRELIVS CLAVDIVS QVINTILLVS AVGVSTVS.Jones, pg. 759 c. 220 – April 270), commonly known as Quintillus, was Roman Emperor for less than a year in 270.

==Early life and election as Emperor==

Quintillus was born at Sirmium in Lower Pannonia."These men are usually called the Illyrian emperors since they all were born in that province (Illyricum) and were raised to power by legions stationed there." The Ancient World, Joseph Ward Swain Originating from a low-born family, Quintillus came to prominence with the accession of his brother Claudius II Gothicus to the imperial throne in 268. Quintillus was possibly made Procurator of Sardinia during his brother’s reign.Canduci, pg. 92 He was declared emperor either by the Senate or by his brother’s soldiers upon the latter's death in 270.
Eutropius reports Quintillus to have been elected by soldiers of the Roman army immediately following the death of his brother.Eutropius IX:12 The choice was reportedly approved by the Roman Senate. Joannes Zonaras reports him elected by the Senate itself.Zonaras, 12:26  Records however agree that the legions which had followed Claudius in campaigning along the Danube were either unaware or disapproving of Quintillus' elevation. They instead elevated their current leader Aurelian as emperor.Gibbon, Ch. 11

==Reign of Quintillus==

The few records of Quintillus' reign are contradictory. They disagree on the length of his reign, variously reported to have lasted as few as 17 days and as many as 177 days (about six months).Southern, pg. 110  Records also disagree on the cause of his death. Historia Augusta reports him murdered by his own soldiers in reaction to his strict  military discipline.Historia Augusta, Claudius, 12:5  Jerome reports him killed, presumably in conflict with Aurelian.Jerome, Chronica s.a. 271 John of Antioch and Joannes Zonaras reported Quintillus to have committed suicide by opening his veins and bleeding himself to death.  John reports the suicide to have been assisted by a physician.John of Antioch, fr. 154 FHG IV, p. 599 Claudius Salmasius pointed that Dexippus recorded the death without stating causes.Historia Augusta, Claudius, 12:6 All records however agree in placing the death at Aquileia.
Quintillus was reportedly survived by his two sons.Historia Augusta, Claudius, 13:9
The Historia Augusta reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia. who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to Constantius Chlorus.Historia Augusta, Claudius, 13:1 Some historians however suspect this account to be a genealogical fabrication to flatter Constantine I.Banchich, www.roman-emperors.org/quintil.htm
Surviving Roman records considered Quintillus a moderate and capable Emperor.See Eutropius, IX:12  He was seen as a champion of the Senate and thus compared to previous Emperors Servius Sulpicius Galba and Publius Helvius Pertinax. All three were highly regarded by Senatorial sources despite their failure to survive a full year of reign.
