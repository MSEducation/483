WWE, also known by its legal name of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.,[tpl]cite web|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|url=http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/quickquote.html?ticker=wwe|publisher=New York Stock Exchange|accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=WWE Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 29, 2011|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/documents/WWE2011ShareholdersMeeting.pdf|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2011-05-08|date=2011-02-18[/tpl] is an American publicly traded, privately controlled entertainment company that deals primarily in professional wrestling, with major revenue sources also coming from film, music, product licensing and direct product sales.
"WWE" also refers to the professional wrestling promotion itself, founded by Jess McMahon and Toots Mondt in 1952, and, as of 2014, the largest in the world, holding about 320 house shows a year and broadcasting to about 36 million viewers in more than 150 countries.http://corporate.wwe.com/company/events.jsp
As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate sporting contests, but purely entertainment-based, featuring storyline-driven, scripted and choreographed matches, though they often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury if not performed correctly. WWE first acknowledged this publicly in 1981, breaking the gentlemen's agreement that previously existed among promoters.[tpl]cite web|last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |title=How Pro Wrestling Works |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl]
Vince McMahon is the majority owner, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Together with his wife Linda,  children Shane and Stephanie, and son-in-law Paul "Triple H" Levesque, the McMahon family holds approximately 70% of WWE's equity and 96% of the voting power in the company. The company's headquarters are located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in New York City, Los Angeles, London, Shanghai, Tokyo, Singapore, and Mumbai.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/overview.jsp|title=WWE Corporate - Company Overview|date=2011-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2011/2011.5.24.jsp|title=WWE Corporate - WWE OPENS MUMBAI OFFICE|date=2011-06-15[/tpl]
The promotion was previously called the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC), the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Since 2011, the company has officially branded itself solely as "WWE", which is no longer an initialism, though the company's legal name was not changed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000144530513000441/wwe12311210kdoc-use.htm|title=Annual Report (Form 10-K)|author=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|date=March 1, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013|quote=WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

==Company history==

===Capitol Wrestling Corporation (1952-1963)===

Roderick James "Jess" McMahon was a successful boxing promoter who began working with Tex Rickard in 1926. With the help of Rickard, he began promoting boxing at the third Madison Square Garden. A few years prior, professional wrestler Joseph Raymond "Toots" Mondt had created a new challenge of professional wrestling that he called “Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling”. He convinced wrestler Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow to implement this new solution into the wrestling industry. Following this, he formed a promotion with both men and persuaded many wrestlers to sign contracts with their Gold Dust Trio. After much success, a disagreement over power caused the trio to dissolve and, with it, their promotion. Mondt later formed partnerships with several other promoters, including Jack Curley in New York City. Mondt eventually took over the New York wrestling scene, due to the fact Curley was dying, with the aid of several bookers, one of whom was Jess McMahon.
Together, McMahon and Mondt created the Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd. (CWC), which later joined the National Wrestling Alliance in 1953. In November 1954, Jess McMahon died and Ray Fabiani, one of Mondt's associates, brought in Vincent James McMahon.[tpl]cite book|last=Kaelberer|first=Angie Peterson |title=Fabulous, Freaky, Unusual History of Pro Wrestling|year=2010|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=1-4296-4789-2|page=32[/tpl] McMahon and Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated Northeast region. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt left the NWA and created the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF).

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963-1979)===

In early 1963, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was formed by McMahon and Mondt, following a dispute with the NWA over "Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers being booked to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011[/tpl] Both men left the company in protest following the incident and formed the WWWF in the process, awarding Rogers the new WWWF World Championship in April of that year. He lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, 1963, after suffering a heart attack a week before the match.
The WWWF operated in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories;[tpl]cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png |title=WrestlingTerritories.png  |work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl] it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly, usually featuring a babyface champion wrestling various heels in programs that consisted of one to three matches.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=June 3, 1991[/tpl]  After gaining a television program deal and turning preliminary wrestler Lou Albano as a manager for Sammartino’s heel opponents, the WWWF was doing sell out business by 1970.
Mondt left the company in the late sixties and although the WWWF had withdrawn from the NWA, Vince McMahon, Sr. quietly re-joined in 1971. At the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and WWWF employee Jim Barnett all withdrew from the organization.

===World Wrestling Federation / Titan Sports Inc. (1979-1999)===

====The Golden Era (1980-1992)====

In March 1979, for marketing purposes, the World Wide Wrestling Federation was renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).[tpl]cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|page=193|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3[/tpl] That same year, the son of Vincent J. McMahon, Vincent K. McMahon, founded Titan Sports, Inc. originally incorporated in Massachusettshttp://www.leagle.com/decision/19882005690FSupp1315_11786.xml/TITAN%20SPORTS,%20INC.%20v.%20COMICS%20WORLD%20CORP.[tpl]cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|page=353|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3[/tpl] and was incorporated on February 21, 1980. The younger McMahon bought his father's stock in the WWF in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the industry.[tpl]cite news |first=William |last=Johnson |title=Wrestling With Success |work=Sports Illustrated |date=25 March 1991 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm[/tpl]
In an interview with Sports Illustrated, McMahon noted:
Upon taking over the company, McMahon immediately worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established 'boundaries' of the different wrestling promotions. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.
McMahon gained significant traction when he hired AWA talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in Rocky III as Thunderlips.[tpl]IMDb title|0084602[/tpl] McMahon signed Rowdy Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward signed Jesse "The Body" Ventura. Other wrestlers took part of the roster, such as André the Giant, Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka, The Magnificent Muraco, Junkyard Dog, "Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff, Greg "The Hammer" Valentine, Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, Nikolai Volkoff and the Iron Sheik.
The WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would required a huge capital investment; one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of not just McMahon's experiment, but also the WWF, the NWA, and the whole industry came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, WrestleMania. WrestleMania was a major pay-per-view success; and was marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. However, the concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had been running Starrcade a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that he wanted it to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with MTV to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection, due to the cross-promotion of pop-culture and professional wrestling.
The WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his babyface hero, Hulk Hogan, for the next several years. The introduction of Saturday Night's Main Event on NBC in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had ever been broadcast on network television since the 1950s. The 1980s 'Wrestling Boom' peaked with WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat - Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-10-14[/tpl] A rematch of the Wrestlemania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and André the Giant took place on The Main Event soon after and was seen by 33 million people, and is still the record for the most watched wrestling match in North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat — Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

Subsequently, a "new" Titan Sports, Inc. (originally WWF, Inc.) was established in Delaware in 1987 and was consolidated with the Massachusetts entity in February 1988. http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005812/0000950130-99-005812.txt

====New Generation Era (1993-1997)====

The WWF was hit with allegations of steroid abuse and distribution in 1992 and was followed by allegations of sexual harassment by WWF employees the following year.[tpl]cite web|last=Spotlight|first=Developmental|title=History: Vince McMahon and the Steriod trial|url=http://pwchronicle.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/history-vince-mcmahon-and-steroid.html|work=PW Chronicle Blogspot|publisher=The Pro-Wrestling Chronicle|accessdate=10 April 2013[/tpl] McMahon was eventually exonerated, but it was a public relations nightmare for the WWF. The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time when revenues were at an all-time low. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers to the only major competition at the time, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), including former WWF Champion Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted itself under the banner of "The New WWF Generation", featuring Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Razor Ramon, Bret Hart and The Undertaker, in an effort to promote and push young talent into the spotlight. A few remaining superstars of the 1980s like Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Tito Santana, and Bob Backlund would mainly be used as enhancement talent.
In 1993, the WWF broke new ground in televised professional wrestling with the début of its cable program WWF Monday Night Raw. After becoming a runaway success, WCW countered in 1995 with its own Monday night program, WCW Monday Nitro, which broadcast in the same timeslot as Raw.[tpl]cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53|accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing ratings competition (known as the Monday Night Wars) until mid-1996. At this point, WCW began a nearly two-year domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the New World Order (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (a.k.a. Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (a.k.a. Diesel).[tpl]cite web|last=Scaia|first=Rick|title=RAW vs. Nitro: Year One|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught Wrestling|accessdate=10 April 2013[/tpl]

====The Attitude Era (1997-2001)====

[tpl]Main|The Attitude Era[/tpl] [tpl]see also|Montreal Screwjob[/tpl]
As the Monday Night Wars continued between Monday Night Raw and WCW's Monday Nitro, the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult oriented product, known as The Attitude Era. The era was spearheaded by Vince McMahon and head writer Vince Russo, who drastically changed the way professional wrestling television was written.
1997 ended with McMahon facing real-life controversy following Bret Hart's controversial departure from the company, later known as the Montreal Screwjob.[tpl]cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|page=648|isbn=0-06-103101-1[/tpl] This proved to be one of several founding factors in the launch of the Attitude Era as well as the creation of McMahon's on-screen character, "Mr. McMahon".
Prior to the Montreal Screwjob which took place at the 1997 Survivor Series, former WCW talent were being hired by the WWF, including Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind and Vader. Steve Austin was slowly brought in as the new face of the company despite being promoted as an anti-hero, starting with his Austin 3:16 speech shortly after defeating Jake Roberts in the tournament finals at the King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1996.[tpl]cite book |author=Mick Foley |title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2000 |page=229 |isbn=0-06-103101-1[/tpl] The creation of the Mr. McMahon character soon led to the Austin vs. McMahon feud, the central storyline during the Attitude Era. The feud even involved former boxing champion, Mike Tyson, which helped give the company mainstream media attention and a significant increase in ratings.

===World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. (1999-2002)===

On April 29, 1999, the WWF made its return to terrestrial television by launching a special program known as SmackDown! on the fledgling UPN network. The Thursday night show became a weekly series on August 26, 1999. In 2000 the WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, announced the creation of the XFL, a new professional football league that debuted in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2000/2000_02_03.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc. announces the formation of the XFL – a new professional football league|accessdate= 2007-05-05|date=3 February 2000[/tpl] The league had high ratings for the first few weeks, but initial interest waned and its ratings plunged to dismally low levels (one of its games was the lowest-rated prime-time show in the history of American television). NBC walked out on the venture after only one season, but McMahon intended to continue alone. However, after being unable to reach a deal with UPN, McMahon shut down the XFL.[tpl]cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/05/10/xfl_folds_ap/|title=XFL folds after disappointing first season|accessdate =2007-05-05|date=2001-05-10 | work=CNN[/tpl]

====Acquisition of WCW and ECW====

By the fall of 1999, The Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night Wars into WWF's favor. After Time Warner merged with AOL, Ted Turner's control over WCW was considerably reduced, and the newly merged company announced a complete lack of interest in professional wrestling as a whole, and decided to sell WCW in its entirety. Although Eric Bischoff, whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc. Acquires WCW from Turner Broadcasting|accessdate=2007-05-05|date=23 March 2001[/tpl] Shortly after WrestleMania X-Seven, the WWF launched the ill-fated Invasion storyline integrating the incoming talent roster from WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). With this purchase, WWF now became by far the largest wrestling promotion in the world. The assets of ECW, which had folded after filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2001, were purchased by WWE in mid-2003.[tpl]cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=58|accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl]

===World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. / WWE (2002-present)===

On May 5, 2002, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the World Wide Fund for Nature regarding the "WWF" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.

====Brand extension====

In March 2002, WWE decided to create two separate rosters, Raw and SmackDown! due to the overabundance of talent left over from the Invasion storyline. This was dubbed as the WWE Brand Extension. Despite much of the originally drafted talent departing by 2004, WWE continued to separate the shows, taking on younger talent, and holding a Draft Lottery every year. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the relaunch of Extreme Championship Wrestling as a WWE brand. The new ECW program aired until February 16, 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=WWE brings ECW to Sci Fi Channel|publisher=WWE.com|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|accessdate=2006-08-28[/tpl]
Beginning with the August 29, 2011, episode of Raw, it was announced that Raw would feature talent from both Raw and SmackDown, and would be known as Raw Supershow (the "Supershow" suffix would be dropped on July 23, 2012). Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; the "Supershow" format would mark the end of the brand extension, as all programming and live events since the initial announcement was made have featured the full WWE roster.[tpl]cite web|author=BY Tom HerreraPage 11 of 11January 11, 2014 |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/the-most-important-moments-in-raw-history/page-11 |title=The 10 most important moments in Raw history |publisher=WWE.com |date=2014-01-11 |accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]
In 2013, the company built a sports medicine and training center in east Orange County, Florida in partnership with Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida. The training facility is targeted at career development for wrestlers and athletic development.County Business Briefs July 2013 Florida Trend

===WWE Network===

On February 24, 2014, WWE launched a 24/7 streaming network. The network includes past and present WWE shows, pay-per-views, and shows from the WWE Library.http://corporate.wwe.com/company/initiatives/wwenetwork.jsp

==Wellness Program==

The Talent Wellness Program is a comprehensive drug, alcohol, and cardiac screening program initiated in February 2006, shortly after the sudden death of one of their highest profile talents, 38 year-old Eddie Guerrero.[tpl]cite web|url= http://corporate.wwe.com/documents/TalentWellnessProgramOutline2-27-06CORPweb.pdf|title=WWE Talent Wellness Program|accessdate=2007-10-11|date=2007-02-27|publisher= Corporate WWE Web Site[/tpl] The policy tests for recreational drug use and abuse of prescription medication, including anabolic steroids. Under the guidelines of the policy, talent is also tested annually for pre-existing or developing cardiac issues. The drug testing is handled by Aegis Sciences Corporation. The cardiac evaluations are handled by New York Cardiology Associates P.C.
After the double murder and suicide committed by one of its performers, Chris Benoit, with a possible link to steroids abuse encouraged by WWE, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested that WWE turn over any material regarding its talent wellness policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20002071/|title=Congress wants WWE's info on steroids, doping|accessdate=2007-07-29[/tpl]
In August 2007, the program was defended by WWE and its employees in the wake of several illegal pharmacy busts that linked WWE performers to steroid purchases even after the policy was put into place. Ten professional wrestlers were suspended for violating the Wellness Policy after reports emerged they were all customers of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. According to a statement attributed to WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, an eleventh wrestler was later added to the suspension list.[tpl]cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/08/30/wrestlers/|title=Fourteen wrestlers tied to pipeline|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Paul|last=Farhi|title=Pro Wrestling Suspends 10 Linked to Steroid Ring|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101961.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-09-01|accessdate=2007-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.headlineplanet.com/base/articles/1188623664.html|title=WWE Suspends Yet Another Wrestler|date=2007-09-01|work=Headline Planet|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071107162727/http://www.headlineplanet.com/base/articles/1188623664.html|archivedate=November 7, 2007[/tpl]
Because of the Wellness Policy, physicians were able to diagnose one of its performers with a heart ailment that would otherwise likely have gone unnoticed until it was too late. In August 2007, then-reigning United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter (real name Hassan Assad) was diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/08102007/articles/mvpmostvaluableprogram|title=MVP's Most Valuable Program|publisher=WWE|date=2007-08-10|accessdate=2007-12-07[/tpl] which can be potentially fatal if gone undiagnosed. The ailment was discovered while Assad was going through a routine Wellness Policy checkup.
On September 13, 2010, WWE updated their list of banned substances to include muscle relaxers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_43853.shtml|title=WWE News: WWE officially updates Wellness Policy to ban the "non-medical use" of muscle relaxant Soma|date=2010-09-17|accessdate=2010-09-18|work=Pro Wrestling Torch[/tpl]

==Legal disputes==

==="WWF" name dispute===

In 1994, Titan Sports had entered into an agreement with the World Wide Fund for Nature (also trademarked WWF), an environmental organization, regarding Titan's use of the "WWF" acronym, which both organizations had been using since at least March 1979. Under the agreement, Titan had agreed to cease using the written acronym "WWF" in connection with its wrestling promotion, and to minimize (though not eliminate) spoken uses of "WWF" on its broadcasts, particularly in scripted comments. In exchange, the environmental group (and its national affiliates) agreed to drop any pending litigation against Titan, and furthermore agreed not to challenge Titan's use of the full "World Wrestling Federation" name or the promotion's then-current logo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005741/0000950130-99-005741.txt|title=Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1|author=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc.|date=1999-10-13|accessdate=2013-12-25|at=Exhibit 10.16: Agreement between WWF - World Wide Fund for Nature and Titan Sports, Inc. dated January 20, 1994[/tpl]
In 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. in the United Kingdom, alleging various violations of the 1994 agreement.[tpl]Cite journal|author=John K.

The last televised event to market the WWF logo was the UK based pay-per-view Insurrextion 2002. On May 5, 2002, the company launched its "Get The F Out" marketing campaign and changed all references on its website from "WWF" to "WWE", while switching the URL from WWF.com to WWE.com.[tpl]cite web|title=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Drops The "F" To Emphasize the "E" for Entertainment|publisher=WWE|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_05_06.jsp|accessdate= 2006-08-28[/tpl] The next day, a press release announced the official name change from World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., or WWE, and the change was publicized later that day during a telecast of Monday Night Raw, which was broadcast from the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.
Following the name change, the use of the WWF "scratch" logo became prohibited on all WWE properties. Additionally, past references to the WWF trademark and initials in 'specified circumstances' became censored.[tpl]cite news|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_05_06.jsp|title=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Drops The "F" To Emphasize the "E" for Entertainment|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-12-20|date=2002-05-06[/tpl] Despite the litigation, WWE was still permitted use of the original WWF logo, which was used from 1979 through 1994 and had been explicitly exempted under the 1994 agreement, as well as the similar "New WWF Generation" logo, which was used from 1994 through 1998. Furthermore, the company could still make use of the full "World Wrestling Federation" and "World Wrestling Federation Entertainment" names without consequence. In 2003, WWE won a limited decision to continue marketing certain classic video games from THQ and Jakks Pacific that contained the WWF "scratch" logo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2003/2003_04_17.jsp |title=WWE Corporate - English Court Repudiates World Wide Fund for Nature; Ends Legal Block To Sale of THQ/Jakks WWE Videogames |publisher=Corporate.wwe.com |date=2003-04-17 |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl] However, the packaging on those games had all WWF references replaced with WWE.
