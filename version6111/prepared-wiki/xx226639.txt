[[Tropical Storm Julio (2002)]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 in Mexico, 2002 Pacific hurricane season, Pacific hurricanes in Mexico

Tropical Storm Julio  in 2002 was a weak and short-lived tropical storm that made landfall along the southern Mexican coast. An area of convection organized into a tropical depression on September 25. Initially forecast to stay offshore, the depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm that same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked as a minimal tropical storm just before landfall near Lázaro Cárdenas, on September 26. The storm soon weakened into a tropical depression and later on September 26, it rapidly dissipated over Mexico.
Prior to making landfall, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for a portion of the Pacific coast of Mexico. After making landfall, three fatalities and 18 injuries were reported from Julio when a bus flipped over. Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding. In the latter city, many trees were brought down and numerous streets were flooded. The highest rainfall reported was [tpl]convert|16.10|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] at Zihuatanejo and La Unión, resulting in devastation. In all, about 2,000 homes were flooded while 100 families were evacuated. About a month after Julio, Hurricane Kenna affected some of the same locations as Julio.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Tropical Storm Julio were from a persistent monsoon-like area of convection (possibly related to Hurricane Isidore) that was situated off the west coast of Central America on September 21. Convective activity generally increased over the next two days, and it is estimated that a poorly defined surface circulation developed late on September 23. The low gradually became better organized and at 0000 UTC on September 25, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that the disturbance had developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E about [tpl]convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] southwest of Acapulco.[tpl]cite report|url= http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2002julio.shtml|work=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|type=Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=United States National Hurricane Center|type=Tropical Cyclone Report|title=Tropical Storm Julio|accessdate=May 19, 2013|date=December 11, 2002|author=Jack Beven| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080922225808/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2002julio.shtml|archivedate=September 22, 2008| deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]EPAC hurricane best track[/tpl]
Initially, the storm was expected to pass very close to the Mexican coast and attain a peak intensity of [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl].[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/ep132002.discus.001.html|work=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|publisher=United States National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Discussion 1|series=|accessdate=May 19, 2013|date=September 25, 2002|author=James Franklin[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, the NHC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Julio based on intensity estimates from the Dvorak technique. By this time, Julio was now expected to move onshore the Mexican coast and meander.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/ep132002.discus.002.html|work=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|publisher=United States National Hurricane Center|series=|title=Tropical Storm Julio Discussion 2|accessdate=May 19, 2013|date=September 25, 2002|author=James Franklin[/tpl] At 0000 UTC on September 26, Tropical Storm Julio attained its peak intensity of [tpl]convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] while also reaching its minimum barometric pressure of [tpl]convert|1000|mb|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. At peak, the storm was centered just west-northwest of Lázaro Cárdenas. After turning northwest, Julio made landfall along the coast of Southwestern Mexico. After landfall, Julio rapidly deteriorated over the mountainous terrain. At 1200 UTC September 26, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression. Even though the storm was initially expected to enter the extreme southern Gulf of California and regain tropical storm strength,[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2002/dis/ep132002.discus.005.html|work=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National weather Service|publisher=United States National Hurricane Center|series=|title=Tropical Storm Julio Discussion 5|coauthor=Eric Blake|accessdate=May 19, 2013|date=September 26, 2002|author=James Franklin[/tpl] Julio dissipated near Manzanillo later that day instead.

==Preparations, impact, and aftermath==
