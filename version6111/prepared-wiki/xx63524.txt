Engineered wood, also called composite wood, man-made wood, or manufactured board; includes a range of derivative wood products which are manufactured by binding or fixing the strands, particles, fibers, or veneers or boards of wood, together with adhesives, or other methods of fixationhttp://www.dataholz.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/dataholz.woa/wa/baustoff?baustoff=Brettsperrholz&language=en to form composite materials. These products are engineered to precise design specifications which are tested to meet national or international standards. Engineered wood products are used in a variety of applications, from home construction to commercial buildings to industrial products.A Guide To Engineered Wood Products, Form C800. Apawood.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-10. The products can be used for joists and beams that replace steel in many building projects.Naturally:wood Engineered wood. Naturallywood.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-10.
Typically, engineered wood products are made from the same hardwoods and softwoods used to manufacture lumber. Sawmill scraps and other wood waste can be used for engineered wood composed of wood particles or fibers, but whole logs are usually used for veneers, such as plywood, MDF or particle board. Some engineered wood products, like oriented strand board (OSB), can use trees from the poplar family, a common but non-structural species.Canadian Wood Council OSB
Alternatively, it is also possible to manufacture similar engineered bamboo from bamboo; and similar engineered cellulosic products from other lignin-containing materials such as rye straw, wheat straw, rice straw, hemp stalks, kenaf stalks, or sugar cane residue, in which case they contain no actual wood but rather vegetable fibers.
Flat pack furniture is typically made out of man-made wood due to its low manufacturing costs and its low weight, making it easy to transport.

==Types of products==

Engineered wood products are used in a variety of ways, often in applications similar to solid wood products. Engineered wood products may be preferred over solid wood in some applications due to certain comparative advantages:

Engineered wood products also have some disadvantages:
Plywood and OSB typically have a density of 35 to 40 pounds per cubic foot (550 to 650Â kg per cubic meter).
For example, 3/8" plywood sheathing or OSB sheathing typically has a weight of 1.0 to 1.2 pounds per square foot.[ref]

==Adhesives==

The types of adhesives used in engineered wood include:
A more inclusive term is structural composites. For example, fiber cement siding is made of cement and wood fiber, while cement board is a low density cement panel, often with added resin, faced with fiberglass mesh.

==Other fixations==

Some engineered products such as CLT Cross Laminated Timber can be assembled without the use of adhesives using mechanical fixing. These can range from profiled interlocking jointed boards,http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/interlocking-cross-laminated-timber-could-use-square-miles-beetle-killed-lumber.htmlhttp://www.soligno.com/de/wandelemente-aus-holz/40-0.html proprietary metal fixings,http://www.massivholzmauer.de/en/was_die_mhm_alles_kann.html nails or timber dowelsBrettstapel (Brettstapel - single layer or CLThttp://www.rombach-holzhaus.com/pics/file/Rombach-Folder%20belgisch.pdfhttp://www.holzhaus-100.de/das_system/das_patent.php).
