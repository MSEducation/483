CATEGORIES: 1888 births, 1966 deaths, Australian architects, Architects from Melbourne

Harry Norris (12 June 1888 – 15 December 1966) was an Australian architect whose works are spread across Melbourne. He was well known for his strong Art Deco Style combining American and Australian architecture. He was one of the most prolific commercial architects between 1920 and 1930. Most of his works were inspired by his regular overseas trips to observe current architectural trends, mainly to the United States, which became annual from 1928 to 1941. As a consequence, his style developed and transformed continually. In 1929, Harry’s client, George James Coles sent him to Europe and America to study trends in designing chain stores. Soon after he came back, he finished the design of the new Coles store (now David Jones) in Bourke Street, Melbourne. He was elected an associate of RVIA 21 February 1946.
