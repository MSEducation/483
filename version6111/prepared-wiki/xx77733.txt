Mark Roberts is a British streaker who has run naked during several international events.
A father of three, Roberts' streaking began when he saw a female streaker run naked down a 1993 Rugby Sevens game in Hong Kong.  After a bet in a bar, he went naked in front of the crowd himself the next day.
Roberts, who lives on unemployment benefits has only ever had one job which ended in arrest.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/north-east-news/2011/12/11/streaker-at-posh-north-art-bash-revealls-all-79310-29932631/ | work=Sunday Sun | title=Streaker at posh North art bash revealls all  | date=11 December 2011[/tpl]www.museumstreak.com 
Roberts has done this, as of 2013, 518 times, targeting such events as Hamilton Race Course, a Mr. Universe contest, a Miss World contest, tennis matches, the bull run in Pamplona, the synchronized swimming world championship in Barcelona, and his specialty, association football matches.Mark Roberts, Professional Streaker, accessed 23 November 2007 Nowadays, he is forced to give out his passport and other important documents before football games, as a way to ensure he won't be streaking at these events.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestreaker.org.uk/streaks/facup01/facup01.htm |title=FA Cup Final 2001 |publisher=Mark Roberts |date=May 2001 |accessdate=2007-10-08[/tpl]
Arguably his most famous streak was on a live 1995 broadcast of This Morning, where he swam onto Fred Talbot's floating weather map and proceeded to emulate Talbot's trademark leap from Scotland to Ireland.[tpl]cite web|title=TV streaker Mark Roberts makes nude protest over Sir Fred Goodwin...|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2009/04/07/tv-streaker-mark-roberts-makes-nude-protest-over-sir-fred-goodwin-but-ends-up-in-wrong-bank-86908-21259952/|date=7 April 2009|publisher=Daily Record|accessdate=3 September 2009[/tpl]
In January 2003, Roberts flew to San Diego, California, United States, where he planned to streak at the Super Bowl XXXVII. He was unable to get tickets to that game, but succeeded next year on Super Bowl XXXVIII, in Houston, Texas. Just before the start of the second half, he ran onto the field disguised as a referee, undressed, and performed a little dance wearing only a thong. Tackled by members of the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers, as well as by police and security, he was taken into custody. In June 2004 he was given a fine of $1000 for trespassing.Streaker Avoids Jail, Sky News, 22 July 2004
Roberts planned on retiring by streaking at the 2006 World Cup final in Germany, but was stopped before he entered the stadium. Later on, in 2007 Roberts ran out on the field of Wembley Stadium during the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins. The very next year, Roberts struck again, this time in the final of the World Snooker Championship 2008 between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Ali Carter. He did so previously at the same venue in 2004.[tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl]
