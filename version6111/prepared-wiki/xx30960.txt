==Etymology==

First attested in English in the late 14th century CE, the word scar derives from Old French escharre, from Late Latin eschara,[ref]eschara, 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus[/ref] which is the latinisation of the Greek ἐσχάρα (eskhara), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise".[ref]ἐσχάρα, 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on perseus[/ref]Online Etymology Dictionary

==Types==

All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different. Scars differ from other scars in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

===Hypertrophic===

Hypertrophic scars occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. Hypertrophic scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gauglitz GG, Korting HC, Pavicic T |title=Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies |journal=Mol Med |volume =17 |issue= 1-2 |pages=113–125 |month=January–February |doi=10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 |url= http://www.molmed.org[/tpl]

====Keloid====

Keloid scars are a more serious form of hypertrophic scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) neoplasms.
Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC |title=Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=108–16 | date=January 2004 |pmid=14746360 |pmc=2594768 |doi= |url=[/tpl] Keloid scars are all hypertrophic, but "only a small percentage of hypertrophic scars" are keloid.
Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.Martini, Frederic H. (2006). Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology, Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco. They can be caused by surgery, accident, acne or, sometimes, body piercings. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the shoulders and chest. Hypertrophic scars and its subset keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.

===Atrophic===

An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as fat or muscle, are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,[tpl]cite pmid|10971560[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|20981308[/tpl] chickenpox, other diseases Staphylococcus (or MRSA) infection, surgery, or accidents.

===Stretch marks===

Stretch marks (technically called striae) are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during pregnancy,[tpl]cite doi|10.1002/14651858.CD000066[/tpl] significant weight gain, or adolescent growth spurts),[tpl]cite pmid|19400881[/tpl] or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near joints). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.
Elevated corticosteroid levels are implicated in striae development.[tpl]cite pmid|16384751[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

If a wound becomes covered with epithelial tissue within two weeks, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form.[ref]
</ref> Generally, if a wound takes longer than three to four weeks to become covered, a scar will form.<ref name=bursurg/> Deep second-degree burns heal with scarring and hair loss.<ref name=Kraftlynde>
</ref> Sweat glands do not form in scar tissue, which impairs the regulation of body temperature.<ref name="sweatgland">
[/ref]
The endometrium is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic shedding and regeneration without scarring; shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7 day window, on a monthly basis.[ref]
</ref> All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.
The scar is a result of the body's repair mechanism after injury in many tissues.
Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation, a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.[ref]
</ref>
To mend the damage, fibroblasts slowly form the collagen scar. The fibroblast proliferation is circular[ref]
