==Summary==

The year 2011 began with The Black Eyed Peas continuing their reign at the top of the UK Dance Chart with the first single from The Beginning, "The Time (Dirty Bit)". The single originally reached the top spot on 13 November 2010, spending seven consecutive weeks at the peak; with another two consecutive weeks in 2011.
The reign was ended when David Guetta and Rihanna's collaborative single "Who's That Chick?" climbed to the peak on 16 January 2011, having spent six consecutive weeks at the number two spot. The single spent two weeks at the peak, before being replaced by the fourth single from Chase & Status' second studio album No More Idols, "Blind Faith" – which also featured soul singer Liam Bailey. Having spent three consecutive weeks at the top spot, "Blind Faith" was replaced by "Who's That Chick?"; which returned to the top spot for another two weeks. 6 March saw a fourth single reach the spot when Tiësto's collaboration with Diplo and Busta Rhymes, "C'mon (Catch 'em by Surprise)" climbed to the top spot, where it currently spends a second week.
On 20 March, The Black Eyed Peas returned to the top spot with second single from The Beginning, "Just Can't Get Enough". The single spent two consecutive weeks at the peak, bringing the band's total of 2011 to four weeks. April 4 saw dance-duo LMFAO climb to the number-one spot with "Party Rock Anthem". The track, which also featured Lauren Bennet and GoonRock, marks the duo's second number-one dance hit after "(Let the Bass Kick) in Miami" with Chuckie topped the chart in January 2010. The single remained at the peak for nine consecutive weeks, also managing to climb to the peak on the UK Singles Chart on April 17; where it remained for four weeks.
The nine-week reign of LMFAO was ended when Romanian artist Alexandra Stan topped the chart with debut single "Mr. Saxobeat" on 4 June. However, the single was pushed to number 2 the following week when British rapper Example scored his first dance number-one single with "Changed the Way You Kiss Me" – which also topped the singles chart and independent chart. After four weeks at the peak, Example was replaced by producer DJ Fresh and the commercial breakthrough "Louder". The single, which featured vocals from Sian Evans topped the chart with impressive sales of 140,571 copies – also topping the UK chart. 
Five weeks later saw the dethroning of "Louder" – with dubstep group Nero taking its place atop the chart. The group also topped the UK chart with third single "Promises" despite selling an underwhelming 46,700 copies. A string on one-week number-ones followed Nero, with Emeli Sandé and Calvin Harris each spending a week at the summit with "Heaven" and "Feel So Close" on 21 August and 28 August respectively. 4 September saw Example claim a second number-one single of the year, with single "Stay Awake".
Having spent three weeks at the summit of the chart, "Stay Awake" was dethroned on 25 September – when Calvin Harris reclaimed the number-one with single "Feel So Close". The following week saw Spanish DJ Sak Noel claim his first number-one with the chart-topping "Loca People". Following a midweek release from Rihanna, the lead single from the sixth studio album Talk That Talk, "We Found Love" debuted at number-one on both the singles and dance chart. The track, which features production from Calvin Harris sold 87,573 copies in just under four days. The single dominated the charts worldwide in late 2011, spending eight consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, six non-consecutive weeks atop the UK Singles Chart and eleven consecutive weeks atop the UK Dance Chart. On its twelfth week charting (25 December), "We Found Love" was dethroned by "Levels" from DJ Avicii.
