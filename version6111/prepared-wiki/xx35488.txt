Yarra Ranges is a national park in Victoria, Australia, 92Â km east of Melbourne.  It covers the headwaters of the Yarra River in the ranges themselves and several water catchments for Melbourne's domestic water supply.
Whilst the park was established only in 1995, the area has been protected for a century to protect Melbourne's water.  Almost all of the park is closed-off to visitors for this reason, however the park is one of the most popular day trip destinations for Melbourne residents.  However, logging occurs in much of the forest, including some of the water catchment areas.

==Flora and fauna==

The park contains approximately 40 different mammal species, including the endangered Leadbeater's Possum and 120 species of birds. The bird species include the Sooty Owl, Powerful Owl, Barking Owl, Pink Robin, Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo, Australian King-Parrot, Grey Goshawk and Crimson Rosella.Parks Victoria: Yarra Ranges National Park

==Heritage==

As the forest is very dense the area was not particularly favoured by the aboriginal people. The European settlers also found it difficult to access the area. It was eventually settled in 1860 and was seen as a valuable area for timber. Soon after, the area was recognised as a good place for water catchments, so the Maroondah and Upper Yarra dams were built.
