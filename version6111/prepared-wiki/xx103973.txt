Delta Geminorum (δ Gem, δ Geminorum) is a star in the constellation Gemini. It has the traditional name Wasat. The traditional name comes from the Arabic word for "middle". It has an apparent visual magnitude of +3.53, allowing it to be seen with the naked eye. Wasat is only two-tenths of a degree south of the ecliptic, and therefore is occasionally occulted by the Moon and, more rarely, by a planet. The last occultation by a planet was by Saturn on June 30, 1857, and the next will be by Venus on August 12, 2420.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In 1930, the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered about 0.5° to the east of this star by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh.

==Properties==

Delta Geminorum is a subgiant star with the stellar classification F0 IV. It is about [tpl]Convert|60.5|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] distant. This star has 1.57 times the mass of the Sun and is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of [tpl]nowrap|129.7 km s–1[/tpl]. The estimated age is 1.6 billion years.
Wasat is a member of a triple star system. The inner components form a spectroscopic binary with a period of 6.1 years (2,238.7 days) and an orbital eccentricity of 0.3530. A cooler class K companion is not apparent to the naked eye but clearly visible in a small telescope. It orbits the inner pair with a period of 1,200 years and an eccentricity of 0.11. Although according to  its radial velocity is away from the Sun, it is actually approaching the Solar System. In about 1.1 million years, it will make its closest approach at a separation of roughly [tpl]Convert|6.7|ly|pc|abbr=on[/tpl].
