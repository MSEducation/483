==Biography==

Born in Tripoli in Libya in 1930, Halfon was a member of a Zionist youth movement. In 1947 he attempted to make aliyah to Mandatory Palestine via Italy, aboard the Aliyah Bet ship Medinat HeYehudit. However, he was detained by the British authorities and sent to an internment camp in Cyprus. The following year he reached Israel, and joined the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade, with whom he fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
He was involved in helping other Libyan Jews who had made aliyah, and in 1949 he was amongst the founders of moshav Hatzav. He became involved in the Southern branch of the Moshavim Movement, and became the movement's representative in the Labor Party.Ben-Sion Halfon: Public Activities Knesset website He served as national co-ordinator of the movement's purchasing organisation and on the board of the Agricultural Bank.
