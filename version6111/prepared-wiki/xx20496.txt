[[TIE fighter]]

CATEGORIES: Star Wars starfighters

TIE fighters are fictional starfighters in the Star Wars universe. Propelled by Twin Ion Engines (hence the TIE acronym), TIE fighters are depicted as fast, fragile starfighters produced by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Galactic Empire. TIE fighters and other TIE craft appear in the original Star Wars trilogy—Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)—and throughout the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Several TIE fighter replicas and toys, as well as a TIE flight simulator, have been released by merchandise companies.

==Origin and design==

Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell created the concept model that established the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for A New Hope.  Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter models for the first Star Wars movie were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in the next two movies shifted back to being a muted blue.  Sound designer Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiefighter/?id=bts|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE fighter (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Star Wars: The Power of Myth|publisher=DK Publishing|pages=27|date=2000-03-01|isbn=978-0-7894-5591-8[/tpl]
Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel X-wings in A New Hope were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light and Magic completed the movie's special effects.[tpl]cite video|people=Burns, Kevin and Edith Becker|date=2004|title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy|medium=Documentary[/tpl] The Jedi starfighter, created for Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, was designed to bridge the appearance of the Jedi starfighter in Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the TIE fighter design from the original trilogy.[tpl]cite web|work=Star Wars Databank|title=Jedi starfighter (Behind the Scenes)|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/delta7/?id=bts|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=July 2007[/tpl] Dark Horse Comics' Sean Cooke designed the TIE predator in Star Wars: Legacy, set 130 years after the events of A New Hope, to appear both reminiscent of and more advanced than the original TIE fighter.Interview in Star Wars Insider #89

==Depiction==

Star Wars literature states that Sienar Fleet Systems manufactures TIE fighters and most TIE variants. TIE fighters' solar panels power a twin ion engine (TIE) system that accelerates gases at a high speed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiefighter/?id=eu|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE fighter (Expanded Universe)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiefighter/|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE fighter (The Movies)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070713154718/http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiefighter/? |archivedate=2007-07-13[/tpl] Described as lacking a hyperdrive, life support, or shield generators, the fragile TIE fighters are deployed in large numbers from bases or larger ships; a Star Destroyer carries a wing of 72 various TIE craft. Although Expanded Universe material often describes the TIE fighter as lacking an ejection seat, the player can eject from TIE craft in LucasArts' TIE Fighter flight simulator. Expanded Universe material holds that TIE fighter pilots, who undergo intense physical and psychological testing, are trained to be intensely loyal to Emperor Palpatine and the Empire, willing to sacrifice themselves and their wingmates to accomplish their mission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/tiefighterpilots/?id=eu|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE fighter pilots (Expanded Universe)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Other TIE craft===

In addition to the TIE fighter, a variety of other TIE craft appear throughout the films.
Darth Vader flies a TIE Advanced x1 in A New Hope. ILM gave it a design different from the other TIE fighters to make it instantly recognizable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tieadvancedx1/?id=bts|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE Advanced X1 Starfighter (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The next movie, The Empire Strikes Back, introduces a TIE shuttle and TIE bombers, which ferry Captain Needa (Michael Culver) to Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer and bomb asteroids in the hunt for the Millennium Falcon, respectively. Both TIE craft have a design that stems from an unused "TIE boarding craft" concept developed for A New Hope.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tieshuttle/?id=bts|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE shuttle (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiebomber/?id=bts|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE bomber (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The TIE bomber's double-hull design led ILM's modelmakers to dub the ship a "double chili dog" fighter. TIE interceptors—faster TIE fighters with dagger-shaped wings and four laser cannons—appear at various points in Return of the Jedi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tieinterceptor/|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE interceptor|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070618145707/http://starwars.com/databank/starship/tieinterceptor/? |archivedate=2007-06-18[/tpl] Two scales of TIE interceptor models were used during filming.[tpl]cite web|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE interceptor (Behind the Scenes)|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tieinterceptor/?id=bts|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-08-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Additionally, LucasArts Star Wars video games introduce several TIE variants, such as the TIE hunter starfighter in Rogue Squadron III and the TIE mauler surface vehicle in Empire at War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swempireatwar/indexFlash.html|publisher=LucasArts|accessdate=2007-07-25|title=LucasArts: Star Wars: Empire at War[/tpl] Gallery -> The Armies -> TIE Mauler The TIE avenger and TIE defender—heavily upgraded derivatives of previous craft seen in the Star Wars universe—first appear in TIE Fighter as player-pilotable craft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/tiedefender/?id=bts|work=Star Wars Databank|title=TIE defender (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The plot of Rebel Assault II revolves around destroying the Empire's ability to manufacture the cloaking TIE phantom starfighter, and a campaign in X-Wing Alliance centers on destroying experimental remote-control TIE fighters.
Star Wars literature also introduces TIE varieties.
