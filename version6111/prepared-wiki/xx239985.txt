After spending his adolescence in Rouen, Martineau moved to Paris to study film and theatre at the University of the New Sorbonne.  In 1988 he directed a short musical comedy, Le Goût de plaire.  In the same year, he acted as assistant to his mentor, Jacques Demy, on the film Trois places pour le 26, the last film Demy completed before his death in 1990.  Ducastel spent the early 1990s working as a sound editor on various films.imdb.com 
In 1995 Ducastel met Jacques Martineau, and the two began a professional and personal relationship.  Their first collaborative venture, Jeanne et le Garçon formidable, (an HIV/AIDS-themed musical comedy inspired by the films of Demy, and featuring Virginie Ledoyen and Demy's son Mathieu) was released in 1998. The film was entered into the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1998/02_programm_1998/02_Programm_1998.html |title=Berlinale: 1998 Programme |accessdate=2012-01-21 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl]
Ducastel and Martineau have since directed further films with gay-related storylines, including the ambitious, almost three hour-long Nés en 68 starring Laetitia Casta and Yannick Renier.Biography at cinefil.com (in French)
