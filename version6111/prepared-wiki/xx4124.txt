Henry John Heinz (October 11, 1844 â€“ May 14, 1919) was an American businessman of German descent who founded the H. J. Heinz Company. Heinz Field, which is the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team, is named in his honor.

==H. J. Heinz Company==

The company continued to grow, and in 1888 Heinz bought out his other two partners and reorganized the company as the H. J. Heinz Company, the name it carries to the present day. Its famous slogan, "57 varieties", was introduced by Heinz in 1896. The reason for "57" is unclear. Heinz said he chose "5" because it was his lucky number and the number "7" was his wife's lucky number.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/fashion/13iht-design13.html?_r=1|title=An Icon, Despite Itself |last=Rawsthorn|first=Alice|date=12 April 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-09[/tpl]
H. J. Heinz was incorporated in 1905, and Heinz served as its first president, remaining in the position for the rest of his life. Under his tutelage, the company was noted for fair treatment of workers and for pioneering safe and sanitary food preparation. He provided his employees with free medical care, recreation facilities such as gyms, swimming pools, and gardens; and educational opportunities such as libraries, free concerts, and lectures. Heinz led a successful lobbying effort in favor of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. During World War I, he worked with the Food Administration.[tpl]Cite Collier's|Heinz, Henry John|year=1921[/tpl]

At the time of Heinz's death in Pittsburgh at the age of 74, the H. J. Heinz Company had over twenty food processing plants, and also included seed farms and container factories. Heinz was the grandfather of H. J. Heinz II, great-grandfather of U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania in the United States and great-great grandfather of Henry John Heinz IV, Andre Thierstein Heinz and Christopher Drake Heinz.
