Once the operators of the scheme "dump" their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. Stocks that are the subject of pump and dump schemes are sometimes called "chop stocks".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sec.gov/answers/pumpdump.htm |title=Pump and Dump Schemes |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |date=March 12, 2001[/tpl]
