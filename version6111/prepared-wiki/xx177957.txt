This album features the core members of Praxis, guitarist Buckethead, bassist Bill Laswell, drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia and keyboardist Bernie Worrell.
The set includes two cover versions of previously recorded music; "Night of the Slunk", originally featured on Buckethead's album Monsters and Robots (1999), and the song "Machine Gun", from the Jimi Hendrix album Band of Gypsys (1970).
An extended recording of that show, including tracks that are missing from the 2007 CD release, is available as paid download from the Bonnaroo web-site.http://www.livebonnaroo.com/live-music/0,2595/Praxis-mp3-flac-download-6-11-2004-This-Tent-Bonnaroo-TN.html
