Maysalun ([tpl]lang-ar|ميسلون[/tpl]) is a mountainous region in southwestern Syrian located on the eastern slopes of the Anti-Lebanon mountains about 12 kilometers west of Damascus, in the Rif Dimashq Governorate and has an altitude of about 1090 meters. The area is situated on the ancient route between Damascus and Lebanon and has long been famous for its khans and rest-stops. The closest town in the area is al-Dimas.
Maysalun is enshrined in Syrian history as the site where the Syrian minister of war, Yusuf al-Azma refused to give in to the French and English Colonial designs by putting up a fight.William Cleveland, A history of the Modern Middle East, Third Edition, p. 166. King Faisal of Syria decided not to fight the French and withdrew, eventually gaining a kingdom in Iraq. Azma decided otherwise and went ahead to fight the French even with the knowledge that his forces would be outnumbered and outgunned. The French entered Syria to impose their colonial ambitions and the artificial borders agreed upon by the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1917.William Cleveland, A history of the Modern Middle East, Third Edition, p. 167. The battle was a decisive French victory, which enabled them to march to Damascus and start dividing and colonizing Syria.
