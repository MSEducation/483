===Football career===

After graduating he played football for the Old Carthusians as well as joining the Corinthian amateur club which had been founded two years earlier. He joined Corinthian in time for their December 1884 tour of the north of England when they played seven matches against professional clubs in eight days.
The first match of the tour was against the FA Cup holders, Blackburn Rovers and, according to Rob Cavallini in his History of the Corinthian Football Club, "what happened next was truly remarkable and firmly established the Corinthian FC as a major power in the football world (as) Corinthian FC simply overwhelmed the FA Cup holders at their own stadium 8–1"[tpl]cite book | author=Rob Cavallini| title=Play Up Corinth: A History of the Corinthian Football Club | publisher= Tempus Publishing | year=2007| pages=13–14|isbn=0-7524-4479-4[/tpl] Amos played at centre half in this match and amongst the goalscorers was Tinsley Lindley with three goals. Amos played in five of the seven tour matches.
His England call up came, as an Old Carthusians player, for the Home International Championship match against Scotland on 21 March 1885 when Amos played at left-half in a 1–1 draw.England 1 - Scotland 1; 21 March 1885 (Match summary) His next international call-up came a year later against Wales. Until recently the second goal in this match was credited to Tinsley Lindley but a review of contemporary records revealed that Amos scored the goal, and this is now recognized by most current reference sources.[tpl]cite book | author=Graham Betts| title=England: Player by player | publisher=Green Umbrella Publishing | year=2006|page=12| isbn=1-905009-63-1[/tpl]Wales 1 - England 3; 29 March 1886 (Match summary)
Amos continued to play for Corinthian until November 1889, and made 47 appearances. He subsequently played for Hitchin Town.
