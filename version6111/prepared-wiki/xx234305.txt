The American Federation of School Administrators or AFSA represents public school principals, vice principals, administrators, and supervisors in the United States. The trade union belongs to the AFL-CIO as one of the organizations smallest members.
The union was established by the Council of Supervisory Associations, a local union representing principals and other supervisors in the New York City Department of Education.  Rather than becoming a directly affiliated local union, the AFL-CIO chartered the organization as the School Administrators and Supervisors Organizing Committee.
Because the Taft–Hartley Act does not recognize supervisors as union-eligible under federal law, AFSA only negotiates collective bargaining agreements in states where local labor rules permit them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/taft-hartley-signed-60-years-ago/|title=Taft-Hartley Signed 60 Years Ago|last=Gruenberg|first=Mark|date=2007-06-11|publisher=Political Affairs Magazine|accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]  In most areas, the organization functions as a professional association rather than a traditional union.  A majority of the union's memership remains in New York City, however.
The organization publishes The AFSA Administrator and presents the Distinguished Leadership Award to highlight member achievements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050503006299/en/AFSA-Announces-Winners-School-Administrator-Leadership-Award|title=AFSA Announces Winners of School Administrator Leadership Award|last=|first=|date=2005-05-03|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]
