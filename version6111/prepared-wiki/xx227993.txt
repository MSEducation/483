==History==

In 1926, the U.S. highway system was implemented. U.S. Routes 1, 5, 6, and 7, plus 202 were used as designations on several primary state highways, replacing New England routes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The other New England routes that were not re-designated as U.S. routes became ordinary state highways but kept their number designation, which are used even today (with some realignment).
