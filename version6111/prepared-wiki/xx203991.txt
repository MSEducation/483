==Whiteadder Sailing Centre==

Although the reservoir and the Outdoor Education Centre are in East Lothian, it has been managed by the Outdoor Education department of Scottish Borders Council for over 20 years. Through a partnership between East Lothian Council, Scottish Borders Council and Borders Sailing Club, funds were obtained for a major refurbishment, and the new Centre was opened in 2005.

==Antiquities==

Gamelshiel Castle ruin is not far from the reservoir, and the so-called "Packman's Grave" is also close by.
