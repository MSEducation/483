</ref> In a chapter co-authored by [[David G. Bromley]], Anson Shupe, and Susan E. Darnell, the Handbook states that exit counsellors or deprogrammers either made donations themselves, or had client families make donations to the "Old CAN", and that these donations made up as much as one-third of "Old CAN" revenues.<ref name="oxford" /> While the "Old CAN" was set up as a tax-exempt organization serving educational purposes, coercive depogramming referrals remained an integral part of its economy and response pattern, a contradiction that was concealed, but not resolved by the "Old CAN" publicly renouncing deprogramming while covertly engaging in referrals.<ref name="oxford" /> Ironically, the authors state, the "Old CAN" was finally "undone by the same kind of civil suit strategy it had employed against [[new religious movement|NRM]]s [new religious movements], in a case involving the same type of coercive practices it accused cults of employing".<ref name="oxford" />

===Landmark Education===

According to the (Old) Cult Awareness Network's executive director, Landmark Education and the Church of Scientology were the two groups for which CAN received the highest number of inquiries from concerned relatives â€“ twenty-five per month per group.[ref]
