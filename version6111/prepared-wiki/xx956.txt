The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations (called wards or branches) and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 83,000 missionaries worldwide and a membership of over 15 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/15-million-member-milestone-announced-at-churchs-general-conference |title=15 Million Member Milestone Announced at Church's General Conference[/tpl] It is ranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth largest Christian denomination in the United States.2011 Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches, 2011, National Council of Churches.  It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening.
Adherents, sometimes referred to as Latter-day Saints or, less formally, Mormons, view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as the central tenet of their religion.Joseph Fielding Smith, ed. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (1976) p. 121 ("The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.").Thomas S. Monson, "The Way of the Master", Ensign, January 2003, pp. 2–7. LDS theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ,"For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ." Book of Mormon; Mosiah 3:12 though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts:[tpl]lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8[/tpl] the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation spoken by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets.
Under the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president, whom adherents regard as a modern-day "prophet, seer, and revelator". The current president is Thomas S. Monson. Individual members believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives."Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We have a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This channel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in obedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge." Dallin H. Oaks, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, April 2008 LDS General Conference, [tpl]cite web |url=http://lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-851-10,00.html |title=Testimony |author= Dallin H. Oaks [/tpl] The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Worthy male members, after reaching age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood. Women do not hold positions within the priesthood, but do occupy leadership roles in church auxiliary organizations.[tpl]Citation| last = Ballard | first = M. Russell | authorlink = M.

Both men and women may serve as missionaries, and the church maintains a large missionary program which proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. Faithful members adhere to laws regarding sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church as a tithe. In addition, the church teaches sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament (holy communion), endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality), which are of great significance to church members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lds.org/liahona/2001/11/ordinances-and-covenants |title=Ordinances and Covenants |author=Neuenschwander, Dennis B. |authorlink=Dennis B.

==History==

The history of the LDS Church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches; (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of Brigham Young and his 19th-century successors; and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as Utah achieved statehood.

===Beginnings===

The LDS Church was formally organized by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830, in Western New York.Scholars and eye-witnesses disagree whether the church was organized in Manchester, New York at the Smith log home, or in Fayette at the home of Peter Whitmer. [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=109[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23[/tpl] (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements). The LDS Church officially favors organization in Fayette. [tpl]Citation|last=Lloyd|first=R. Scott|title='Major discovery' discussed at Mormon History Association Conference|periodical=Church News of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|publisher=LDS Church|date=May 22, 2009|url=http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/57380/Major-discovery-discussed-at-Mormon-History-Association-Conference.html|accessdate=May 22, 2009[/tpl] Initial converts were drawn to the church in part because of the newly published Book of Mormon, a self-described chronicle of indigenous American prophets that Smith said he had translated from golden plates.Book of Mormon, Introduction.
Smith intended to establish the New Jerusalem in North America, called Zion.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=122[/tpl]; LDS D&C 57:1–3 (revelation dated July 20, 1931, stating that "the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at County, Missouri, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation"). In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio (the eastern boundary of Zion),[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=97[/tpl] (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in [tpl]Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=111[/tpl]). In 1834, Smith designated Kirtland as one of the "stakes" of Zion, referring to the tent–stakes metaphor of Isaiah 54:2. and began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri (Zion's "center place"),[tpl]Harvtxt|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=162[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=109[/tpl]. where he planned to eventually move the church headquarters.Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to "retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years". (Doctrine and Covenants 64:21). However, in 1833, Missouri settlers brutally expelled the Latter Day Saints from Jackson County,[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=137[/tpl] (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media). and the church was unable via a paramilitary expedition to recover the land.[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=322[/tpl]. Nevertheless, the church flourished in Kirtland[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=101[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Arrington|1992|p=21[/tpl] (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); Desert Morning News 2008 Church Almanac p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881). as Smith published new revelations and the church built the Kirtland Temple, culminating in a dedication of the building similar to the day of Pentecost.[tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19[/tpl]; [tpl]Harv|Brodie|1971|p=178[/tpl]. The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after a financial scandal rocked the church and caused widespread defections.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=328–38[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=221[/tpl] ("Ultimately, the rituals and visions dedicating the Kirtland temple were not sufficient to hold the church together in the face of a mounting series of internal disputes.") Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri,[tpl]Harvtxt|Roberts|1905|p=24[/tpl] (referring to the Far West church as the "church in Zion"); [tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=345[/tpl] (The revelation calling Far West "Zion" had the effect of "implying that Far West was to take the place of Independence".) but tensions soon escalated into violent conflicts with the old Missouri settlers.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=357–364[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=227–30[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Remini|2002|p=134[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=97–98[/tpl]. Believing the Saints to be in insurrection, the Missouri governor ordered that the Saints be "exterminated or driven from the State".[tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=367[/tpl] (Boggs' executive order stated that the Mormon community had "made war upon the people of this State" and that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace"). In 1976, Missouri issued a formal apology for this unconstitutional order [tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=398[/tpl]. In 1839, the Saints converted a swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River into Nauvoo, Illinois, which became the church's new headquarters.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=383–84[/tpl].
Nauvoo grew rapidly as missionaries sent to Europe and elsewhere gained new converts who then flooded into Nauvoo.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=409[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=258, 264–65[/tpl]. Meanwhile, Smith introduced polygamy to his closest associates.[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=334–36[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=437, 644[/tpl]. He also established ceremonies, which he stated the Lord had revealed to him, to allow righteous people to become gods (joint heirs with Christ, see theosis)[tpl]Citation |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/132/18-20 |title=D&C 132 18–20 |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |publisher=LDS Church[/tpl][tpl]Citation |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1975/10/the-lords-plan-for-men-and-women |title=The Lord’s Plan for Men and Women |accessdate=May 9, 2010 |publisher=LDS Church[/tpl] in the afterlife,[tpl]Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119[/tpl] (Smith echoed the words of Paul that faithful saints may become co-heirs with Jesus Romans 8:17); [tpl]Harvtxt|Roberts|1909|pp=502–03[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98[/tpl] (the second anointing provided a conditional guarantee that those persons who were pure and faithful would be exalted, even if they sinned, if they were sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise). and a secular institution to govern the Millennial kingdom.[tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=120–22[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=519–21[/tpl] (describing the Council of Fifty noting that Smith prophesied "the entire overthrow of this nation in a few years", at which time the Kingdom of God would be prepared to lead) He also introduced the church to a full accounting of his First Vision, in which two heavenly "personages" (God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ) appeared to him at age 14. This vision would come to be regarded by the LDS Church as the most important event in human history since the resurrection of Jesus.[tpl]Citation |author= LDS Church |title= Joseph Smith Home Page/Mission of the Prophet/First Vision: This Is My Beloved Son.

On June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois,Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History p. 824. [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=393–94[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005[/tpl]. while being held on charges of treason.Many local Illinoisans were uneasy with Mormon power, and their unease was fanned by the local media after Smith suppressed a newspaper containing an exposé regarding plural marriage, theocracy, and other sensitive and oft misinterpreted issues. The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for "inciting a riot".  On June 25, Joseph let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason. Legal Trials of Joseph Smith Because Hyrum was Joseph's designated successor,Brigham Young later said of Hyrum, "Did Joseph Smith ordain any man to take his place. He did. Who was it? It was Hyrum, but Hyrum fell a martyr before Joseph did. If Hyrum had lived he would have acted for Joseph." Times and Seasons, 5 15, 1844: 683. their deaths caused a succession crisis,[tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|p=143[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=398[/tpl]. and Brigham Young assumed leadership over the majority of Saints.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=556–57[/tpl]. Young had been a close associate of Smith's and was senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve.Smith's position as Prophet and President of the Church was originally left vacant, but later filled when the apostles could regroup based on the restored principle that the most senior apostle would always be the next President of the Church. As a result, Young, and any other senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve, would be ordained President of the Church as a matter of course upon the death of the former President, subject to unanimous agreement of the Quorum of the Twelve. Other splinter groups, excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, followed other leaders in their own interpretation of the Latter Day Saint movement.[tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=198–211[/tpl].

===Pioneer era===

For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war,In 2004, the State of Illinois recognized the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints as the "largest forced migration in American history" and stated in the adopted resolution that, "WHEREAS, The biases and prejudices of a less enlightened age in the history of the State of Illinois caused unmeasurable hardship and trauma for the community of Latter-day Saints by the distrust, violence, and inhospitable actions of a dark time in our past; therefore, be it resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-third General Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we acknowledge the disparity of those past actions and suspicions, regretting the expulsion of the community of Latter-day Saints, a people of faith and hard work." "Official House Resolution HR0793 (LRB093 21726 KEF 49525 r), Illinois General Assembly, April 1, 2004 Joseph Smith had predicted that the church would go to the West and be established in the tops of Rocky Mountains. Brigham Young took Smith's advice and led his followers, known in modern times as the Mormon pioneers, to Nebraska and then in 1847 to what became the Utah Territory."Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History & Culture", U.S. National Park Service. "The great Mormon migration of 1846–1847 was but one step in the LDS' quest for religious freedom and growth." As groups (over 60,000) arrived over a period of years, LDS settlers branched out and colonized a large region now known as the Mormon Corridor.
Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a theocratic leader. He also publicized the practice of plural marriage,The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the Twelve Apostles Orson Pratt and Smith's successor Brigham Young in a special conference of the elders of the church assembled in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on August 28, 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the Deseret News Only a small percentage of church leaders participated in plural marriage believing it was a part of a restitution of ancient Priesthood blessings and a commandment of god to raise up a righteous generation. At the time, it was not barred by statute within the United States.[tpl]Cite news| title = Minutes of conference : a special conference of the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, August 28th, 1852, 10 o'clock, a.m., pursuant to public notice | work = Deseret News Extra | date = September 14, 1852 | page = 14[/tpl].  See also The 1850s: Official sanction in the LDS Church a form of polygamy.
By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Young.See Tullidge, Edward, History of Salt Lake City, 132-35 (Original from the University of Michigan, 1886). The Utah Mormon War ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful
The most notable instance of violence during this war was the tragic Mountain Meadows massacre, in which leaders of a local Mormon militia, contrary to top church leaders orders, ordered the massacre of a civilian emigrant party who had the misfortune of traveling through Utah during the escalating military tensions.  The Mormons feared the mobs which murdered their families at the Haun's mill massacre and other illegal thefts of land, and murders which had plagued them back east.
