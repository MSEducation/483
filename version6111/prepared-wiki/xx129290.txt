"Another Weekend" is the name of a 1988 hit single by the British pop group Five Star. It peaked at #18 on the UK singles chart, but reached #1 on the UK Dance chart. In the US, the single reached #23 on the R&B charts.
The single was a return to the charts for the group after a short break to record their fourth LP Rock The World. Due to declining record sales, the group were intent on changing their clean-cut image. They opted for a new, raunchier leather-clad look in the accompanying video, whilst the track demonstrated a slightly harder edged dance sound. However, the changes were not enough to reverse the group's decline, and sales continued to dwindle.
