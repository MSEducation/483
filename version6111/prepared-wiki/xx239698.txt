==Peruvian Amazon==

The Peruvian amazon covers more the 60 percent of Peru's land.The Peruvian Amazon is traditionally divided into two distinct ecoregions:
The Lowland Jungle (in Spanish Selva Baja) is also known as Omagua Region, Walla, Anti, Amazonian Rain Forest, or Amazon Basin. This ecoregion is the largest of Peru, standing between 80 and 400 meters above sea level (masl). It has very warm weather with an average temperature of 28 °C, high relative humidity (over 75 percent) and large amounts of rainfall. Its soils are very heterogeneous, but almost all have river origins, and due to high temperatures and high rainfall they are poor soils with few nutrients. It contains long and strong rivers such as the Amazon, Ucayali, Marañón, Putumayo, Yavarí, Napo and Pastaza Tigre.
The Highland Jungle (in Spanish Selva Alta) is also called Rupa-Rupa region, andean jungle, ceja de selva or ceja de montaña. This ecoregion extends into the eastern foothills of the Andes, between 400 to 1000 masl. Temperatures are warm in the lowlands and cold in higher altitudes. There are many endemic fauna because of the isolation caused by the rugged terrain of this area.Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú. Edit.
