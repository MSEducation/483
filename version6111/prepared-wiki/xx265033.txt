==Track listing==

LP side AAt least one source (Japanese link) indicates the album's track listing as written on the rear cover (of at least one pressing) is mis-labeled and the contents of side 'A' are actually the six tracks from a different recording: Flip Phillips Quartet (1950, Mercury MG 25023 / Clef MGC105) = "Feelin' the Blues," "Sleepy Head," "Lover," "Don't Take Your Love from Me," "Lover Come Back to Me" and "Blue Room" with Phillips, Rich, Jones and Ray Brown on bass.
