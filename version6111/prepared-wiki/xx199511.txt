Literally [tpl]nihongo|ai ai gasa|相合傘[/tpl] means to share an umbrella,See 相合傘 on Wiktionary. however, it could also be read as "Love-Love Umbrella", as the word for love (愛) is also pronounced ai. As such, sharing an umbrella as a couple in Japan is considered a romantic expression, and teens often draw an umbrella with their name and the name of their crush, the way one would in a heart.  In Tegomass's video, the two are creating rain to make a young boy and girl walk under an umbrella together.
