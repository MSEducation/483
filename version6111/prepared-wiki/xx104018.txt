Delta Aquarii (δ Aqr, δ Aquarii) is the third-brightest star in the constellation Aquarius. It has the traditional name Skat, which has also been used for Beta Pegasi. The apparent visual magnitude is 3.3, which can be seen with the naked eye. The distance to this star is estimated as [tpl]Convert|160|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] based upon parallax measurements.

==Properties==

The spectrum of Skat matches a stellar classification of A3 V, indicating this is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. This star has double the Sun's mass and a radius 2.4 times as large. It is radiating 26 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of around 9,000 K. This heat gives it the characteristic white-hued glow of an A-type star. It has a relatively high rate of rotation, with a projected rotational velocity of 81 km s−1.
Delta Aquarii has been closely examined for a companion, but none has been discovered. Nor does it display a strong signal of excess infrared emission that might indicate the presence of circumstellar matter. Delta Aquarii is a probable stream star member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, which has an estimated age of 500 million years.

==In culture==

The traditional name has generally been thought to derive from the Arabic as-saq (الساق) "leg" or "shin"; however, the medieval forms Scheat, Seat, Sheat suggest it may be instead from the Arabic ši'at (شئت) "wish".[tpl]ref|allen[/tpl]
