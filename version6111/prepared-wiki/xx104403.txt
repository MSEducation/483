Langå municipality ceased to exist due to Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007).  The southern part of Langå municipality was merged with Hadsten, Hammel, Hinnerup, and Hvorslev municipalities to form the new Favrskov municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 487 km² and a total population of ca. 41,596 (2005).  The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland ("Mid-Jutland Region"). The remainder of Langå municipality was incorporated into an enlarged Randers municipality.
