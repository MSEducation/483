Hiberno‐English (sometimes referred to as Irish English[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=p3vDuPNG7nUC&lpg=PA418&ots=PYmZEr_M8C&dq=%22irish-english%22&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Irish English: history and present… |publisher= Google Books |accessdate = 28 February 2011[/tpl]) is the dialect of English written and spoken in Ireland ([tpl]lang-la|Hibernia[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url = http://dho.ie/drapier/node/193 |title=Hiberno-English Archive | work = DRAPIer |publisher= DHO | location = IE | accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl] It comprises a number of sub-dialects, such as Ulster English, Dublin English and Cork English.
English was brought to Ireland as a result of the Norman invasion of the late 12th century. Initially, it was mainly spoken in an area known as the Pale around Dublin, with Irish spoken throughout the rest of the country. By the Tudor period, Irish culture and language had regained most of the territory lost to the colonists: even in the Pale, "all the common folk… for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit, and of Irish language".[tpl]Citation | url = http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 | title = Culture and Religion in Tudor Ireland 1494–1558 | publisher = University College Cork[/tpl] However, the English conquest and colonization of Ireland in the 16th century marked a revival in the use of English. By the mid-19th century, English was the majority language spoken in the country.[tpl]Refn | group = lower-alpha | According to the 1841 census, Ireland had 8,175,124 inhabitants, of whom four million spoke Gaelic.[tpl]Citation | first = John O'Beirne | last = Ranelagh | title = A Short History of Ireland | place = Cambridge | year = 1994 | page = 118[/tpl][/tpl]  It has retained this status to the present day, with even those whose first language is Irish usually being fluent in English as well.
Modern Hiberno-English has some features influenced by the Irish language and it also retains some archaic English elements. Most of these are more used in the spoken language than in formal written language as used in say the Irish Times, which is much closer to Standard British English, with a few differences in vocabulary. Unlike the United States and Canada, Ireland does not have its own spelling rules and uses British English spelling.

==Vocabulary==

===Loan words from Irish===

A number of Irish-language loan words are used in Hiberno-English, particularly in an official state capacity.  For example, the head of government is the Taoiseach, the deputy head is the Tánaiste, the parliament is the Oireachtas and its lower house is Dáil Éireann. Less formally, people also use loan words in day-to-day speech, although this has been on the wane in recent decades and among the young.[tpl]cite book |title = A dictionary of Hiberno-English: the Irish use of English |last= Dolan |first= Terence Patrick | year= 2004 | publisher= Gill & Macmillan | location= Dublin, IE | isbn= 978-0-7171-3535-6 | page = xix | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uPo0oB19gDUC&lpg=PR19&dq=decline%20of%20hiberno-english%20words&pg=PR19#v=onepage&q=decline%20of%20hiberno-english%20words&f=false | accessdate= 29 January 2011 [/tpl]
Some examples include:

===Derived words from Irish===

Another group of Hiberno-English words are those derived from the Irish language. Some are words in English that have entered into general use, while others are unique to Ireland. These words and phrases are often Anglicised versions of words in Irish or direct translations into English. In the latter case, they often give a meaning to a word or phrase that is generally not found in wider English use.
Some examples include:

===Derived words from Old- and Middle-English===

Another class of vocabulary found in Hiberno-English are words and phrases common in Old- and Middle-English, but which have since become obscure or obsolete in the modern English language generally. Hiberno-English has also developed particular meanings for words that are still in common use in English generally.
Some examples include: 

===Others===

In addition to the three groups above, there are also additional words and phrases found in Hiberno-Irish whose origin is disputed or unknown. While this group may not be unique to Ireland, their usage is not widespread, and could be seen as characteristic of the language in Ireland.
Some examples include:

==Grammar and syntax==

The syntax of the Irish language is quite different from that of English. Various aspects of Irish syntax have influenced Hiberno-English, though many of these idiosyncrasies are disappearing in urban areas and among the younger population.
The other major influence on Hiberno-English that sets it apart from modern English in general is the retention of words and phrases from Old- and Middle-English.

===From Irish===

====Reduplication====

Reduplication is an alleged trait of Hiberno-English strongly associated with stage-Irish and Hollywood films.

====Yes and no====

Irish lacks words that directly translate as "yes" or "no", and instead repeats the verb used in the question, negated if necessary, to answer. Hiberno-English uses "yes" and "no" less frequently than other English dialects as speakers can repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of (or in redundant addition to) using "yes" or "no".

====Recent past construction====

Irish indicates recency of an action by "after" is added to the present continuous (a verb ending in "-ing"), a construction known as the "hot news perfect" or "after perfect".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1jpNgJhjJF4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=%22hot+news+perfect |title=A semantic and pragmatic examination ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-3-87808-372-6|year=1986[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aPPexF5hyIkC&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=%22after+perfect%22+irish |title=Dialects across borders: selected ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-90-272-4787-2|year=2005[/tpl] The idiom for "I had done X when I did Y" is "I was after doing X when I did Y", modelled on the Irish usage of the compound prepositions i ndiaidh, tar éis, and in éis: bhí mé tar éis/i ndiaidh/in éis X a dhéanamh, nuair a rinne mé Y.
A similar construction is seen where exclamation is used in describing a recent event:
When describing less astonishing or significant events, a structure resembling the German perfect can be seen:
This correlates with an analysis of "H1 Irish" proposed by Adger & Mitrovic,Adger (2004) in a deliberate parallel to the status of German as a V2 language.

====Reflection for emphasis====

The reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context.  Herself, for example, might refer to the speaker's boss or to the woman of the house. Use of herself or himself in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question. Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, She's coming now
This is not limited only to the verb to be: it is also used with to have when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb to do is used. This is most commonly used for intensification.

====Prepositional pronouns====

There are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb to have in Irish. Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition at, (in Irish, ag.). To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ag "at" and mé "me" to create agam.
In English, the verb "to have" is used, along with a "with me" or "on me" that derives from Tá … agam.  This gives rise to the frequent
Somebody who can speak a language "has" a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.
When describing something, rural Hiberno-English speakers may use the term "in it" where "there" would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ann (pronounced "oun" or "on") fulfilling both meanings.
Another idiom is this thing or that thing described as "this man here" or "that man there", which also features in Newfoundland English in Canada.
Conditionals have a greater presence in Hiberno-English due to the tendency to replace the simple present tense with the conditional (would) and the simple past tense with the conditional perfect (would have).
Bring and take: Irish use of these words differs from that of British English because it follows the Gaelic grammar for beir and tóg. English usage is determined by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one takes "from here to there", and brings it "to here from there". In Irish, a person takes only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone else[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and a person brings at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).

====To be====

The Irish equivalent of the verb "to be" has two present tenses, one (the present tense proper or "aimsir láithreach") for cases which are generally true or are true at the time of speaking and the other (the habitual present or "aimsir ghnáthláithreach") for repeated actions. Thus, "you are or generally" is tá tú, but "you are repeatedly" is bíonn tú. Both forms are used with the verbal noun (equivalent to the English present participle) to create compound tenses.
The corresponding usage in English is frequently found in rural areas, especially Mayo/Sligo in the West of Ireland and Wexford in the south-east, along with border areas of the North and Republic. In this form, the verb "to be" in English is similar to its use in Irish, with a "does be/do be" (or "bees", although less frequently) construction to indicate the continuous, or habitual, present:

===From Old- and Middle-English===

In old-fashioned usage, "it is" can be freely abbreviated ’tis, even as a standalone sentence. This also allows the double contraction ’tisn’t, for "it is not".
Irish has separate forms for the second person singular (tú) and the second person plural (sibh).
Mirroring Irish, and almost every other Indo European language, the plural you is also distinguished from the singular in Hiberno-English, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word ye [tpl]IPA|jiː[/tpl]; the word yous (sometimes written as youse) also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and across Ulster. In addition, in some areas in Leinster, north Connacht and parts of Ulster, the hybrid word ye-s, pronounced "yis", may be used. The pronunciation differs with that of the northwestern being [tpl]IPA|jiːz[/tpl] and the Leinster pronunciation being [tpl]IPA|jɪz[/tpl].
The word ye, yis or yous, otherwise archaic, is still used in place of "you" for the second-person plural. Ye'r, Yisser or Yousser are the possessive forms, e.g. "Where are yous going?"
The verb mitch is very common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school. This word appears in Shakespeare, but is seldom heard these days in British English, although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably South Wales, Devon, and Cornwall). In parts of Connacht and Ulster the mitch is often replaced by the verb scheme, while Dublin it is replaced by "on the hop/bounce".
Another usage familiar from Shakespeare is the inclusion of the second person pronoun after the imperative form of a verb, as in "Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed" (Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene IV). This is still common in Ulster: "Get youse your homework done or you're no goin' out!" In Munster, you will still hear children being told, "Up to bed, let ye" [tpl]IPA|lɛˈtʃi[/tpl]
For influence from Scotland see Ulster Scots and Ulster English.

===Other grammatical influences===

Now is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning. Examples include "Bye now" (= "Goodbye"), "There you go now" (when giving someone something), "Ah now!" (expressing dismay), "Hold on now" (= "wait a minute"), "Now then" as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.  It is also used in the manner of the Italian 'prego' or German 'bitte', for example a barman might say "Now, Sir." when delivering drinks.
So is often used for emphasis ("I can speak Irish, so I can"), or it may be tacked onto the end of a sentence to indicate agreement, where "then" would often be used in Standard English ("Bye so", "Let's go so", "That's fine so", "We'll do that so"). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement ("You're not pushing hard enough" – "I am so!"). (This contradiction of a negative is also seen in American English, though not as often as "I am too", or "Yes, I am".) The practice of indicating emphasis with so and including reduplicating the sentence's subject pronoun and auxiliary verb (is, are, have, has, can, etc.) such as in the initial example, is particularly prevalent in more northern dialects such as those of Sligo, Mayo, Cavan, Monaghan and other neighbouring counties.
Sure is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement, roughly translating as but/and/well. Can be used as "to be sure", the famous Irish stereotype phrase. (But note that the other stereotype of "Sure and …" is not actually used in Ireland.) Or "Sure, I can just go on Wednesday", "I will not, to be sure." "Sure Jaysus Jesus" is often used as a very mild expletive to express dismay. The word is also used at the end of sentences (primarily in Munster), for instance "I was only here five minutes ago, sure!" and can express emphasis or indignation.
Sure Sure is an old phrase making a modern comeback within colloquial English. Unlike the above definitions of "sure," "sure sure" conveys a positive connotation for the statement, and is commonly used as a short and quick linguistic mechanism for describing extreme admiration. It means so much more than simply "whatever." In fact, the phrase has been attributed to many prominent figures while discussing epic events. For example, "Tom= Did you see the European girl smile with her eyes? Bob= Yes, I did. It was epic. Tom= Sure sure."
To is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, "I'm not allowed go out tonight", instead of "I'm not allowed to go out tonight".
Will is often used where British English would use "shall" ("Will I make us a cup of tea?"). The distinction between "shall" (for first-person simple future, and second- and third-person emphatic future) and "will" (second- and third-person simple future, first-person emphatic future), maintained by many in England, does not exist in Hiberno-English, with "will" generally used in all cases.
Once is sometimes used in a different way from how it's used in other dialects.  An example is, "I've no problem laughing at myself once the joke is funny."  Other dialects of English would probably use "if" in this situation.

==Pronunciation==

Hiberno-English retains many phonemic differentiations that have merged in other English accents.
The naming of the letter H as "haitch" is standard, while the letter R is called "or", the letter A is often pronounced "ah", and the letter Z is often referred to as "e-zed" in working-class Dublin and Belfast accents or parodies of same.
Some words gain a syllable in Irish speech, like film, which becomes "fillum".

===Dublin===

Dublin has a number of dialects which differ significantly based on class and age group. These are roughly divided into three categories: "local Dublin", or the broad-working class dialect (sometimes referred to as the "working-class", or "inner city" accent); "mainstream Dublin", the typical accent spoken by middle-class or suburban speakers; and "new Dublin", an accent among younger people (born after 1970). Features include:All of the below information is from Dublin English: Evolution and Change; Raymond Hickey. John Benjamins 2005

====Rhoticity====

Rhoticity and rhotic consonants vary greatly in Dublin English. In Local Dublin, "r" can often be pronounced with an alveolar tap ([tpl]IPA|ɾ[/tpl]), whereas Mainstream Dublin has a velarised alveolar approximant [tpl]IPA|ɹˠ[/tpl] (which also may be found in Local Dublin) and New Dublin features a retroflex approximant, [tpl]IPA|ɻ[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/VCDE/ |author=Raymond Hickey |title=Variation and Change in Dublin English |publisher=Uni-due.de |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/IERC/phonology.htm |title=Phonology |publisher=Uni-due.de |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21[/tpl]
Post-vocalically, Dublin English maintains three different standards. Local Dublin is often non-rhotic (giving lie to the repeated claim that Hiberno-English is universally rhotic), although some variants may be variably or very lightly rhotic. In non-rhotic varieties, the [tpl]IPA|/ər/[/tpl] in "lettER" is either lowered to [tpl]IPA|ɐ(ɹ)[/tpl] or in some speakers may be backed and raised to [tpl]IPA|ɤ(ɹ)[/tpl]. In Mainstream Dublin, this sound is gently rhotic ([tpl]IPA|əɹ[/tpl]), while New Dublin features a retroflex approximant [tpl]IPA|əɻ[/tpl]. Other rhotic vowels are as follows:

====Dublin Vowel Lengthening====

In Local Dublin, long monophthongs are often diphthongised, and while some diphthongs are tripthongised. This process can be summarised with these examples:

====Consonants====

===Ulster===

Northern Hiberno-English (also called Ulster English) is an umbrella term for the dialects of Hiberno-English spoken by most people in the province of Ulster. The dialect has been influenced by Ulster Irish and also by the Scots language, which was brought over by Scottish settlers during the plantations.
It has two main subdivisions: South Ulster English and Mid Ulster English. South Ulster English is spoken in south Armagh, south Monaghan, south Fermanagh, south Donegal and north Cavan.[tpl]Cite book | last = Burchfield | first = Robert | title = The Cambridge History of the English Language | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1995 | page = 174 | isbn = 978-0-521-26478-5[/tpl][tpl]Cite book | last = Hickey | first = Raymond | title = Irish English: History and Present-Day Forms | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007 | page = 93 | isbn = 978-0-521-85299-9[/tpl][tpl]Cite book | last = Filppula | first = Markku | title = The Grammar of Irish English: Language in Hibernian Style | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | page = 32 | isbn = 978-0-415-14524-4[/tpl] Mid Ulster English is used in the area between these (including the main cities of Belfast and Derry) and has the most speakers.
