Founded in the 1920s,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/style/c-corrections-702093.html | work=The New York Times | title=Corrections | date=1993-03-28[/tpl] by Jewish Polish[tpl]Cite news|last=McCormick|first=Carlo|coauthors=|title=Kangol: Born in England, Raised on the Streets of New York|pages=|publisher=Kangol|date=|url=http://www.kangol.fr/en/galerie.html|accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=A beret good show: 70 years of Kangol|pages=|publisher=The Scotsman|date=2008-11-26|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/a-beret-good-show-70-years-of-kangol-1-1148612|accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl] refugee and World War I veteran Jacques Spreiregen, Kangol (the K from Knitting, the ANG from angora, the OL from wool) produced hats for workers, golfers, and especially soldiers. In 1938, Spreiregen moved operations and opened a factory at Cleator, Cumbria, England which he ran with his nephew Silvain Meisner. They were the major beret suppliers to the armed forces during World War II, including famously Field Marshal Montgomery.[tpl]cite news |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/A-beret-good-show-70.4735803.jp |title=A beret good show: 70 years of Kangol |publisher=The Scotsman |date=27 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-06[/tpl]
During and after the war, Kangol berets were the height of fashion. In the 1960s, designers Mary Quant and Pierre Cardin worked with the company, whose products graced the heads of the rich and famous, including the Beatles and Arnold Palmer, and later Diana, Princess of Wales. The company also supplied uniformed organizations such as the Scout Association.
In the 1980s Kangol berets entered a new phase of fashion history with their adoption by members of the hip-hop community, such as Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Kangol Kid of UTFO, and The Notorious B.I.G.. The brand was even more popularized by the 1991 movie New Jack City. The release of more consciously stylish products in the 1990s such as the furgora (angora-wool mix) Spitfire, was helped by its presence upon the head of Samuel L. Jackson in 1997. Kevin Eubanks, bandleader for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, sports a Kangol beret on an almost nightly basis. In 2009, Eminem wore the Cotton Twill Army Cap Kangol hat on his Beautiful video.
Kangol has been owned by Sports World since 2006, when they acquired the brand from private equity fund August Equity Trust. Licences to manufacture and sell Kangol apparel have been sold to many different companies including D2 and Topshop. The global rights to Kangol hats have been held by American hatmakers Bollman Hat Company since 2002.[tpl]cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article660042.ece |title=Sports World owner sees right fit for Kangol hats |publisher=The Times |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-06 |location=London[/tpl]
It was announced in February 2009 that Bollman were reviewing their worldwide operations, putting 33 jobs and the future of the Kangol head office in Cleator in doubt.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.whitehaven-news.co.uk/1.510908 |title=Kangol jobs at risk as Cleator hat factory faces closure |publisher=The Whitehaven News |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-06[/tpl] On 6 April 2009, it was announced that the original factory would be converted to a warehouse with the loss of 25 jobs. Only 7 employees now remain employed at the company's original site and the outlet shop will close at the end of August 2009. However, hats will continue to be made at their sites in Eastern Europe & the United States.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/7985058.stm |title=Further blow to textile industry |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-06[/tpl]
