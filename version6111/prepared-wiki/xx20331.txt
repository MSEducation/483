In the autumn of 1524 James dismissed his Regents and was proclaimed an adult ruler by his mother. Several new court servants were appointed including a trumpeter, Henry Rudeman.A. Thomas, Princelie Majestie, (Edinburgh 2005), pp. 32-33: Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 1, (Edinburgh 1908), pp. 492-4, nos. 3267-3282 The English diplomat, Thomas Magnus gave an impression of the new Scottish court at Holyroodhouse on All Saints' Day 1524; "trumpets and shamulles did sounde and blewe up mooste pleasauntely." Magnus saw the young king singing, with his horses, and playing with a spear at Leith, and was given the impression that he preferred English manners over French fashions.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 part 4 (1836), 209, Magnus & Radclyff to Wolsey, 2 Nov. 1524: cf. Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.4 (1875) no.830: 15 Nov. 1524: Ellis, Henry, ed., Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 1st Series, vol. 1 (1825), 251-252. In 1525, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, the young king's stepfather, took custody of James and held him as a virtual prisoner for three years, exercising power on his behalf. When James and his mother came to Edinburgh on 20 November 1526, she stayed in the chambers at Holyroodhouse which Albany had used, and James used the rooms above.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 part 4 (1836), 460, Christopher Dacre to Lord Dacre. In February 1527, [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Henry Fitzroy,
Duke of Richmond]], gave James twenty hunting hounds and a huntsman. Magnus thought the Scottish servant sent to Sheriff Hutton Castle for the dogs was intended to note the form and fashion of the Duke's household, for emulation in Scotland.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 part 4 (1836), 464-5, Magnus to Wolsey 14 February 1527: Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 (1875), no. 2885 James finally escaped from Angus's care in 1528 and assumed the reins of government himself.

==Reign and Religion==

His first action as king was to remove Angus from the scene. The Douglas family were forced into exile and James besieged their castle at Tantallon. He then subdued the Border rebels and the chiefs of the Western Isles. As well as taking advice from his nobility and using the services of the Duke of Albany in France and at Rome, James had a team of professional lawyers and diplomats, including Adam Otterburn and Thomas Erskine of Haltoun. Even his pursemaster and yeoman of the wardrobe, John Tennent of Listonschiels was sent on an errand to England, though he got a frosty reception.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie, John Donald (2005), 12-15, 36: Murray, Atholl, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society, vol. 10, (1965), 13-51.
James increased his income by tightening control over royal estates and from the profits of justice, customs and feudal rights.  He also gave his illegitimate sons lucrative benefices, diverting substantial church wealth into his coffers. James spent a large amount of his wealth on building work at Stirling Castle, Falkland Palace, Linlithgow Palace and Holyrood and built up a collection of tapestries from those inherited from his father.Dunbar, John G., Scottish Royal Palaces, Tuckwell (1999). James sailed to France for his first marriage and built up the royal fleet. In 1540 he sailed to Kirkwall in Orkney, then Lewis, in his ship the Salamander, first making a will in Leith, knowing this to be, "uncertane aventuris." The purpose of this voyage was to show the royal presence and hold regional courts, called "justice ayres."Historic Manuscripts Commission, Earl of Mar & Kellie at Alloa House, (1904), 15, Will 12 June 1540: Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 245-248.
Domestic and international policy was affected by the Reformation, especially after Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church. James V did not tolerate heresy and during his reign, a number of outspoken Protestants were persecuted. The most famous of these was Patrick Hamilton, who was burned at the stake as a heretic at St Andrews in 1528. Later in the reign, the English ambassador Ralph Sadler tried to encourage James to close the monasteries and take their revenue, so that he would not have to keep sheep like a mean subject. James replied that he had no sheep, he could depend on his god-father the King of France, and it was against reason to close the abbeys which, "stand these many years, and God's service maintained and kept in the same, and I might have anything I require of them."Clifford, Arthur ed., Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (1809), 30. (Sadler knew that James did farm sheep on his estates.)Amongst references to the royal sheep, after James's death 600 were given to James Douglass of Drumlanrig), HMC 15th report and appendix, part viii, Duke of Buccleuch, (1897), 17, 6 January 1543.
James recovered money from the church by getting Pope Clement VII to allow him to tax monastic incomes.Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 260. He sent £50 to Johann Cochlaeus, a German opponent of Martin Luther, after receiving one of his books in 1534.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.6 (1905), p.236. On 19 January 1537 Pope Paul III sent James a blessed sword and hat  symbolising his prayers that James would be strengthened against heresies from across the border.Hay, Denys, ed., Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 328:Reid, John J., 'The Scottish Regalia', PSAS, 9 December (1889), 28: this sword is lost. These gifts were delivered by the Pope's messenger while James was at Compiègne in France on 25 February 1537.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 18.
According to 16th-century writers, his treasurer James Kirkcaldy of Grange tried to persuade him against the persecution of Protestants and to meet Henry VIII at York.Steuart, A. Francis, ed., Memoirs of Sir James Melville of Halhill, Routledge (1929), 14-17. Although Henry VIII sent his tapestries to York in September 1541 ahead of a meeting, James did not come. The lack of commitment to this meeting was regarded by English observers as a sign that Scotland was firmly allied to France and Catholicism, particularly by the influence of Cardinal Beaton, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and a cause for war.Campbell, Thomas P., Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty, Tapesties at the Tudor Court, Yale (2007), 261:

==Marriages==

As early as August 1517, a clause of the Treaty of Rouen provided that if the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland was maintained, James should have a French royal bride. Yet the daughters of Francis I of France were promised elsewhere or sickly.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 51–52. Perhaps to remind Francis of his obligations, James's envoys began negotiations for his marriage elsewhere from the summer of 1529, both to Catherine de'Medici, the Duchess of Urbino, and Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, the sister of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. But plans changed. In February 1533, two French ambassadors, Guillaume du Bellay, sieur de Langes, and Etienne de Laigue, sieur de Beauvais, who had just been in Scotland, told the Venetian ambassador in London that James was thinking of marrying Christina of Denmark.Calendar of State Papers Venice, vol. 4 (1871), no.861.
Francis I insisted that his daughter Madeleine's health was too poor for marriage. Eventually, on 6 March 1536, a contract was made for James V to marry Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the Duke of Vendôme.  She would have a dowry as if she were a French Princess. James decided to visit France in person. He sailed from Kirkcaldy on 1 September 1536, with the Earl of Argyll, the Earl of Rothes, Lord Fleming, David Beaton, the Prior of Pittenweem, the Laird of Drumlanrig and 500 others, using the Mary Willoughby as his flagship.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 part 4 cont. (1836), pp.59-60. First he visited Mary of Bourbon at St. Quentin in Picardy, but then went south to meet King Francis I.Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 131. During his stay in France, in October 1536, James went boar-hunting at Loches with Francis, his son the Dauphin, the King of Navarre and Ippolito II d'Este.Hollingsworth, Mary, The Cardinal's Hat, Profile Books, (2004), 117.
James renewed the Auld Alliance and fulfilled the 1517 Treaty of Rouen on 1 January 1537 by marrying Madeleine of Valois, the king's daughter, in Notre Dame de Paris. The wedding was a great event: Francis I made a contract with six painters for the splendid decorations, and there were days of jousting at the Château du Louvre.Leproux, Guy-Michel, La peinture à Paris sous le règne de François Ier, Sorbonne (2001), 26.  At his entry to Paris, James wore a coat described as "sad cramasy velvet slashed all over with gold cut out on plain cloth of gold fringed with gold and all cut out, knit with horns and lined with red taffeta."Robertson, Joseph, Inventaires de la Royne d'Ecosse, Bannatyne Club, (1863), xii–xiii, note citing Thomson, Collection of Royal Inventories, (1815), 80–1. James V so liked red clothing that, during the wedding festivities, he upset the city dignitaries who had sole right to wear that colour in processions.  They noted he could not speak a word of French.Teulet, Piéces et documents inédits relatifs a l'histoire d'Ècosse, Bannatyne Club (1852), 122–5.
James and Madeleine returned from France on 19 May 1537, arriving at Leith, the king's Scottish fleet accompanied with ten great French ships.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4 cont., (1836), 79, Clifford to Henry VIII. As the couple sailed northwards, some Englishmen had come aboard off Bridlington and Scarborough. While the fleet was off Bamburgh on 15 May, three English fishing boats supplied fish, and the King's butcher landed in Northumbria to buy meat.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 7 (1907), 24.  The English border authorities were dismayed by this activity.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 12 part 1 (1890), nos. 1237–8, 1256, 1286, 1307.
Madeleine did not enjoy good health.  In fact, she was consumptive and died soon after arrival in Scotland in July 1537. Spies told Thomas Clifford, the Captain of Berwick, that James omitted "all manner of pastime and pleasure," but continually oversaw the maintenance of his guns, going twice a week secretly to Dunbar Castle with six companions.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 part IV cont., (1836) pp.94-95, Clifford to Henry VIII, 26 July 1537. James then proceeded to marry Mary of Guise, daughter of Claude, Duke of Guise, and widow of Louis II d'Orléans, Duke of Longueville, by proxy on 12 June 1538.  Mary already had two sons from her first marriage, and the union produced two sons. However, both died in April 1541, just eight days after baby Robert was baptised. Their daughter and James's only surviving legitimate child, Mary, was born in 1542 at Linlithgow Palace.

==Outside interests==

According to legend, James was nicknamed "King of the Commons" as he would sometimes travel around Scotland disguised as a common man, describing himself as the "Gudeman of Ballengeich" ('Gudeman' means 'landlord' or 'farmer', and 'Ballengeich' was the nickname of a road next to Stirling Castle – meaning 'windy pass' in Gaelic[tpl]citation | url = http://books.google.pl/books?id=-5DVKabC7PQC&pg=PA181&dq= | last = Black | title = Picturesque Tourist of Scotland | pages = 180–1[/tpl].).  James was also a keen lute player."The Court of Mary, Queen of Scots". BBC Radio 3. 28 February 2010. In 1562 Sir Thomas Wood reported that James had "a singular good ear and could sing that he had never seen before" (sight-read), but his voice was "rawky" and "harske."  At court, James maintained a band of Italian musicians who adopted the name Drummond. These were joined for the winter of 1529/30 by a musician and diplomat sent by the Duke of Milan, Thomas de Averencia de Brescia, probably a lutenist.Hay, Denys, ed., Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 163, 169, 170: Shire, Helena M., in Stewart Style, Tuckwell (1996), 129-133. The historian Andrea Thomas makes a useful distinction between the loud music provided at ceremonies and processionals and instruments employed for more private occasions or worship; the music fyne described by Helena Mennie Shire. This quieter music included a consort of viols played by four Frenchmen led by Jacques Columbell.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie, John Donald (2005), 92–4, 98: H. M. Shire, Song Dance and Poetry, (Cambridge 1969) It seems certain that David Peebles wrote music for James V and probable that the Scottish composer Robert Carver was in royal employ, though evidence is lacking.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie'', John Donald (1998), 105–7.
As a patron of poets and authors James supported William Stewart and John Bellenden the son of his nurse, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece into verse and prose.Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, The Renaissance in Scotland, Brill (1994), p.191-6, (Bellenden family; John's mother was Mariota Douglas, the king's nurse) Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, the Lord Lyon, head of the Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet.  He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540. James also attracted the attention of international authors. The French poet Pierre de Ronsard, who had been a page of Madeleine of Valois, offered unqualified praise;
 "Son port estoit royal, son regard vigoureux

 De vertus, et de l'honneur, et guerre amoureux

La douceur et la force illustroient son visage

Si que Venus et Mars en avoient fait partage"

His royal bearing, and vigorous pursuit

of virtue, of honour, and love's war,

this sweetness and strength illuminate his face,

as if he were the child of Venus and Mars.Bingham, Caroline, James V, Collins (1971), 12, Ronsard's verse quoted from William Drummond of Hawthornden, History of the 5 Jameses (1655), 348–9Drummond of Hawthorden, William, Works,  Edinburgh (1711), 115.
James was poet himself including "The Gaberlunzieman" and "The Jolly Beggar"[tpl]cite book|last=George|first=Eyre-Todd|title=Scottish Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|year=1892|publisher=W. Hodge and Co|location=Glasgow|pages=139...182[/tpl]
When he married Mary of Guise, Giovanni Ferrerio, an Italian scholar who had been at Kinloss Abbey in Scotland, dedicated to the couple a new edition of his work, On the true significance of comets against the vanity of astrologers.Ferrerio, Giovanni, De vera cometae significatione contra astrologorum omnium vanitatem. Libellus, nuper natus et aeditus, Paris , Vascovan, (1538). Like Henry VIII, James employed many foreign artisans and craftsmen in order to enhance the prestige of his renaissance court.Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie, the court of James V, John Donald, (2005), 226-243. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie listed their professions; he plenished the country with all kind of craftsmen out of other countries, as French-men, Spaniards, Dutch men, and Englishmen, which were all cunning craftsmen, every man for his own hand. Some were gunners, wrights, carvers, painters, masons, smiths, harness-makers (armourers), tapesters, broudsters, taylors, cunning chirugeons, apothecaries, with all other kind of craftsmen to apparel his palaces.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, The History of Scotland, Edinburgh, (1778), 238: abbreviated in Lindsay of Pitscottie, vol. 2, (1814), 359.  One technological initiative was a special mill for polishing armour at Holyroodhouse next to his mint. The mill had a pole drive 32 feet long powered by horses.Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1, HMSO (1957), 101-102, 242 290: Thomas Andrea, Princelie Majestie, John Donald (2005), 173. Mary of Guise's mother Antoinette of Bourbon sent him an armourer. The armourer made steel plates for his jousting saddles in October 1538, and delivered a skirt of plate armour in February 1540. In the same year, for his wife's coronation, the treasurer's accounts record that James personally devised fireworks made by his master gunners.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 95, 287 (taslet), 357 fireworks: Balcarres Papers, vol. 1, SHS (1923), 18, 20. When James took steps to suppress the circulation of slanderous ballads and rhymes against Henry VIII, Henry sent Fulke ap Powell, Lancaster Herald, to give thanks and to make arrangements for the present of a lion for James's menagerie of exotic pets.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 14 part 1, (1894), xix, no. 406: vol. 14 part 2, (1895), no. 781.

==War with England==

The death of James's mother in 1541 removed any incentive for peace with England, and war broke out. Initially the Scots won a victory at the Battle of Haddon Rig in August 1542. The Imperial ambassador in London, Eustace Chapuys, wrote on 2 October that the Scottish ambassadors ruled out a conciliatory meeting between James and Henry VIII in England until the pregnant Mary of Guise delivered her child. Henry would not accept this condition and mobilised his army against Scotland.Calendar State Papers Spanish, 1542-1543, vol.6 part 2, London (1895), p.144, no.66.
James was with his army at Lauder on 31 October 1542. Although he hoped to invade England, his nobles were reluctant.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 part 4 part 2, (1836), 213: Laing, David, ed., The Works of John Knox, vol. 1, (1846) pp.389-391]
He returned to Edinburgh on the way writing a letter in French to his wife from Falahill mentioning he had three days of illness.Strickland, Agnes, Lives of the queens of Scotland and English princesses, vol. 1, Blackwood (1850), 402 part translated only; now preserved as National Archives of Scotland SP13/27. Next month his army suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss.  He took ill shortly after this, on 6 December; by some accounts this was a nervous collapse caused by the defeat, although some historians consider that it may just have been an ordinary fever. John Knox later described his final movements in Fife.Knox, John, [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/15422.html |title=from History of the Reformation, book 2,[/tpl] Whatever the cause of his illness, he was on his deathbed at Falkland Palace when his only surviving legitimate child, a girl, was born. Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich brought the news of the king's death to Berwick. He said James died at midnight on Thursday 15 December; the king was talking but delirious and spoke no "wise words." According to George Douglas in his delirium James lamented the capture of his banner and Oliver Sinclair at Solway Moss more than his other losses.Bain, JS., ed., The Hamilton Papers, vol. 1, Edinburgh, (1890) 336-339. An English chronicler suggested another cause of the king's grief was his discomfort on hearing of the murder of the English Somerset Herald, Thomas Trahern, at Dunbar.Grafton's Chronicle, vol. ii, London (1809), 488. James was buried at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh.
Before he died, he is reported to have said, "it came wi a lass, it'll gang wi a lass" (meaning "It began with a girl and it will end with a girl"). This was either a reference to the Stewart dynasty's accession to the throne through Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce or to the medieval origin myth of the Scots nation, recorded in the Scotichronicon in which the Scots people are descended from the Princess Scota.

==Aftermath==

James was succeeded by his infant daughter Mary. He was buried at Holyrood Abbey alongside his first wife Madeleine and his two sons in January 1543. David Lindsay supervised the construction of his tomb. One of his French artists, Andrew Mansioun, carved a lion and an inscription in Roman letters measuring eighteen feet. The tomb was destroyed in the sixteenth-century, according to William Drummond of Hawthornden as early as 1544, by the English during the burning of Edinburgh.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (1908) 142-143: Works of Drummond of Hawthornden: History of the Five Jameses, (Edinburgh 1711), p. 116 Scotland was ruled by Regent Arran and was soon drawn into the war of the Rough Wooing.

Additionally, James V had nine known illegitimate children, at least three of whom were fathered before the age of 20.The Peerage — James V The young King was said to have been encouraged in his amorous affairs by the Angus regime to keep him distracted from politics.Thomas, Andrea, 'Women at the Court of James V' in Ewan & Meikle ed., Women in Scotland, c.1100-c.1750, Tuckwell (1999), 86 citing the chronicles of George Buchanan, Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, and David Lindsay's Complaynt of Scotland. In addition to these aristocratic liaisons, David Lindsay described the king's other affairs in his poem, The Answer to the Kingis Flyting; 'ye be now strang lyke ane elephand, And in till Venus werkis maist vailyeand.'Williams, Janet Hadley ed., Sir David Lyndsay, Selected Poems, Glasgow (2000), 98-100, 257-9.
Many of the sons of his aristocratic mistresses entered ecclesiastical careers. Pope Clement VII sent a dispensation to James V dated 30 August 1534, allowing four of the children to take holy orders when they came of age. The document stated that James elder was in his fifth year, James younger and John in their third year, and Robert in his first year.HMC: 6th Report & Appendix'', (1877), p.670

==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==

James's full style prior to acceding the throne was Prince James Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Lord Renfrew, Prince and Great Steward of Scotland
