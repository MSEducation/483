John Warner Barber (February 2, 1798 – June 1885) was an American engraver whose books of  state, national, and local history featured his vivid illustrations, said[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0806144.html |title=John Warner Barber |publisher=Infoplease.com |work=The Columbia Electrionic Encyclopedia, sixth edition |accessdate= August 23, 2006[/tpl] to have caught the flavor and appearance of city, town, and countryside scenes in his day.

==Life==

Barber was born in East Windsor, Connecticut, and  learned his craft from the East Windsor printmaker Abner Reed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chs.org/graphcoll/barberdraw1.htm |publisher=Connecticut Historical Society |title=Connecticut in 1836: Drawings by John Warner Barber |accessdate= August 23, 2006[/tpl] In 1823 he opened a business in New Haven, where he produced religious and historical books, illustrated with his own wood and steel engravings. 
He traveled around Connecticut, creating ink sketches of town greens, hotels, schools, churches, and harbors and collected local history as he went. He also delved into the works of historians. From all this he produced the book now commonly called Connecticut Historical Collections. The full title is Connecticut Historical Collections, Containing a General Collection of Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, Etc., Relating to the History and Antiquities of Every Town in Connecticut with Geographical Descriptions. 
The book has been called "the first popular local history published in the U.S."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/32217471.html |publisher=Bibliola.com |title=Warner's Historical Collections |accessdate= August 23, 2006 [/tpl] The book sold well—7,000 copies in its first year even though it cost three dollars, then an average week's pay. Twelve years later it was reissued and again sold well.
"Today, though his wood engravings are well known, few copies of the book Historical Collections remain," according to the Bibliopola Press Web site, which, as of August 2006, was selling a reprint version. "Antique dealers unfortunately do a brisk business selling the woodcuts from volumes they have 'broken.'"
Barber started with rough pencil sketches and developed them into more detailed wash drawings. He then transferred the drawings directly to small blocks of boxwood on which he engraved the designs.
"He talked with townspeople, gathered local documents and made quick sketches everywhere he went," according to a New York Times article from December 10, 1989, quoted on a print-selling Web site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.okworkshop.com/Catalogue/cat25.htm |publisher=One of a Kind Workshop |title=Reprinted from Historical Collections by John Warner Barber |accessdate= August 23, 2006[/tpl] "The illustrations depict each town center, with its homes and churches, academies and courthouses sailboats plying a river or harbor, an occasional factory belching puffs of smoke and always a tiny figure or two, often the artist  in his top hat, sketching the scene or pointing to the view."  
He died in New Haven, Connecticut in June 1885.
