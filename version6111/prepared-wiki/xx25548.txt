The CBL was the brainchild of Tony Riviera, a former major league scout, and the face of the league.  It was backed by former Microsoft product developer Charlton Lui, and later by former Yahoo! president, and part owner of the San Francisco Giants, Jeff Mallett."CBL receivership not a fall classic", Vancouver Courier, August 4, 2004  Canadian Baseball Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins was brought in to act as the league's Commissioner.
Riviera's vision had big goals, and he followed suit by making big promises.  Riviera stated that the CBL would be "AAA quality",Ballparkwatch.com, September 5, 2002 He was rumoured to have approached the Winnipeg Goldeyes about switching leagues, and even nominated Pete Rose for the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.No Rose, but former Blue Jays slugger Carter voted in, ESPN.com, March 13, 2003
The big plans initially appeared to be possible.

==Quick demise==

However, despite early promises that the league could, and would, average over 2,000 fans per game, it was clear that the CBL was not remotely close to projections.  Only two markets averaged over 1,000 fans per game:  Victoria at 1,700 and Calgary at 1,000.Empty Field of Dreams, thetyee.ca, April 5, 2004  Four teams averaged fewer than 300 per game: Kelowna (271), Saskatoon (256), Welland (181) and Trois-Rivi√®res (163).enterstageright.com, Jackson Murphy, July 21, 2003  The national TV deal was cancelled after only six weeks after the CBL was unable to find enough sponsors to cover the production costs.Empty Field of Dreams, thetyee.ca, April 5, 2004
The Montreal franchise never played a game in Montreal due to a lack of a playing field. Their home games were played at Stade Amedee Roy in Sherbrooke.
The CBL's swan song was the All-star game, held at Calgary.  Unwilling to absorb any more losses, Mallett pulled the plug on the entire operation, suspending operations following the game.  A crowd of over 5,700 watched the final game in CBL history end in a tie. Following the game, a home run derby was held that produced a combined total of zero home runs. Despite losing as much as $4 million on the CBL,Empty Field of Dreams, thetyee.ca, April 5, 2004 Mallett initially promised to bring the league back in 2004.  However, the remaining assets of the league were quietly auctioned off on December 1, 2003 in Vancouver and the league never returned.
