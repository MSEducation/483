Heuston Gate is a proposed skyscraper development for Dublin in Ireland. Heuston Gate was planned to contain at its heart a 32 storey tower, which would have been either Ireland's tallest or second tallest building depending on when the U2 Tower was completed.http://skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1333 Designed by Paul Keogh Architects the tower was commissioned by the Office of Public Works as part of the OPWâ€™s major urban renewal project at Military Road Kilmainham.http://www.pka.ie
It was planned to erect the tower on the western fringe of Dublin city centre facing onto Heuston Station, an important rail transport terminus from which the development gains its name. The proposal was to create a new mixed use neighbourhood and active ground level activities to encourage street life and a pedestrian-friendly public area.http://www.independent.ie/national-news/skyscrapers-scaling-new-heights-to-beat-council-cutoff-point-1280711.html It aspired to be a model of environmental sustainability, using energy saving technologies such as solar power, district heating, high insulation levels and heat recovery systems. The design was audited using the BREAM energy rating method. However, due to the economic downturn in Ireland, it was announced the project would not proceed.
