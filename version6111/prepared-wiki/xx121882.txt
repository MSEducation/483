==Development==

Seven months prior to the official launch of TMZ, America Online (AOL) had hinted that it was planning to launch a Hollywood- and entertainment-centric news site that would be produced in conjunction with Telepictures Productions and had shown interest in launching a website featuring a focus mainly on celebrities. At the time of the launch, AOL confirmed that the site would primarily feature and consist of Hollywood gossip, including interviews, photos and video footage of celebrities and information pertaining to industry news on movies, television shows, etc. The site was described as "an effort to further feed the current American obsession with celebrities". Mike Shields of MediaWeek.com wrote, "the site also boasts of an expansive collection of archived star photos and videos", allowing fans to "trace changing hairlines and waistlines of their favorites performers over the years".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001656883|date=2005-12-05|title=AOL-Time Warner Launches TMZ.com|author=Mike Shields|work=MediaWeek.com|accessdate=2009-11-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219061419/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001656883|archivedate=2006-02-19|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Background==

Since 2005, TMZ has signed Revlon, Chrysler, Hilton Hotels and New Line Cinema as charter advertisers to their website. The New York Times cited TMZ as "one of the most successful online ventures of the last few years." In October 2008, the New York Times reported that TMZ, at the time, was receiving more than 10 million viewers every month.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/business/media/26steal.html?scp=2&sq=TMZ.com&st=cse|author=Michael Cieply|title=A Star Watcher Has Star Power|work=NYTimes.com|date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] Alexa.com ranked TMZ as the five-hundred-fifth most trafficked website worldwide and as the one hundred-fifty-fifth most trafficked website in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tmz.com|title=TMZ.com - Site Info From Alexa|work=Alexa.com|accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl]
Levin has acknowledged that TMZ has passed on multiple notable coverage because he felt that, while the stories are true, he questioned how the sources obtained their information. Levin has acknowledged that TMZ pays source, but in the form of a "tip fee". Levin stated that TMZ pays for photos and for 'tips' and or leads on stories, and defended TMZ's position by stating that the sources and tips are verified before being used and or reported.
In November 2009, TMZ's revenue was publicly disclosed for the first time. Telepictures (which TMZ is operated by) stated: "Subject to certain performance adjustments and the reimbursement of expenses, revenues are split evenly between the parties ... Telepictures received payments of $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and $12.7 million, $9.6 million and $3.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively." Based on released figures, TMZ's revenues for 2008 was $25.4 million and is projected to have less revenue in the 2009 year with the revenue of $12.4 million in first three quarters of the year—unlike the previous year, which was within the $15 million range.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-with-aol-spinoff-tmz-to-move-to-time-warnertelepictures-as-expected-25m|title=With AOL Spinoff, TMZ To Move To Time Warner/Telepictures, As Expected; $25M 2008|work=PaidContent.org|author=Rafat Ali|date=2009-11-16|accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl]

It has been criticized for its usage of photographs and videos obtained from paparazzi. Some have questioned the effect that aggressive and obtrusive photographers have on the subjects they cover.

Tony Manfred of The Cornell Daily Sun strongly criticized TMZ in an article entitled "I Want My TMZ", in which Manfred criticizes various aspects of TMZ. Manfred described TMZ as being "a fusion of celebrity news blog and embarrassing video archive" and felt that the website had become "the poster child for the celebrity pseudo-news industry" and that the website has "distinct advantages" over "gossip magazines" because it can "show all the borderline pornographic clips that Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood can't." Manfred also noted that he felt that the website was "balanced", going on to say "by balanced I mean they strike a perfect equilibrium between three distinct categories of trashy video clip. I'll group these videos into the following categories: the 'Action Caused Either Entirely or More Than Partly By Alcohol,' the 'Celebrity Car Chase,' and the 'You're Not Famous but You're Near a Camera So Okay[tpl]'"[/tpl].
Jennifer Metz and David Muir of ABC News acknowledged that TMZ has long been criticized for their "aggressive tactics, antagonizing stars with video cameras" and noted that those "encounters, capturing at times violent celebrity confrontations with photographers, receive hundreds of hits online, and critics ask if entertainment reporters are crossing the line." Metz and Muir questioned whether TMZ's tactics "go too far".[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7946859&page=1|author=Jennifer Metz and David Muir|date=2009-06-27|title=TMZ Ahead of the Curve, but Do Tactics Go Too Far?|work=ABC News.com|accessdate=2009-12-02[/tpl]
Ken Sunshine, publicist for Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio, stated that his clients disliked the website because it has a tendency to be negative towards celebrities when reporting on them. "I hate that they have anything to do with trying to put celebrities into the worst light possible and that they play the 'gotcha' game".[tpl]cite news|title=Handed a 'smoking gun', TMZ's Levin ran with it|author=Donna Freydkin|work=USAToday.com|date=2006-08-01|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-07-31-gibson-tmz_x.htm|accessdate=2009-11-25[/tpl] The website has been harshly criticized for having a personality cult of figures such as Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton – celebrities who are known more as targets for paparazzi than for the work they do. In defense for TMZ's coverage, Levin said that certain celebrities are main subjects on the Web site because of their "relevancy" and because their relevancy helps draw viewership to the Web site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/tmzlive?autoplay=true&mediaKey=6b2ea4bc-5d5b-4f38-8189-f28499088e2b|work=TMZ|title=TMZ Live - 11/25/09 Part 3|author=TMZ|date=2009-11-25|accessdate=2009-11-25[/tpl] Liz Kelly of Washington Post attacked both Levin and TMZ in an article, stating "I know this is like spitting in the wind, but I have to say it: Harvey Levin, please stop it."
In what The Smoking Gun called "a colossal screw-up", TMZ published an "exclusive" picture on their Web site of a man purported to be John F. Kennedy on a ship with several naked women that could have "changed history" had it come out during his presidential campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/28/president-john-f-kennedy-photograph-jfk-photo-boat-yatch-nude-naked-women-mediterranean-sea-jackie-kennedy-ted-kennedy-senator-george-smathers-election|work=TMZ|title=The JFK Photo That Have Changed History|author=TMZ|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2009-12-28[/tpl] Despite having a Photoshop expert proclaiming the picture as "authentic", the picture was later discovered to have not been of Kennedy at all. The photo was discovered to have been part of a Playboy photoshoot from November 1967, which was later confirmed by Playboy representatives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/tmz-falls-jfk-photo-hoax|work=TheSmokingGun.com|title=TMZ falls for JFK Photo Hoax|author=The Smoking Gun|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2009-12-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/28/john-f-kennedy-playboy-photo-boat-nude-women|work=TMZ|title=Kennedy Picture -- A Fake?|author=TMZ|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2009-12-28[/tpl]
