Christoph Ludwig Agricola (November 5, 1667 â€“ August 8, 1719) was a German landscape painter. He was born and died at Regensburg (Ratisbon).
He trained as a painter in his native country. He  spent a great part of his life in travel, visiting England, the Netherlands and France, and residing for a considerable period at Naples.
His numerous landscapes, chiefly cabinet pictures, are remarkable for fidelity to nature, and especially for their skilful representation of varied phases of climate.  In composition his style shows the influence of Nicolas Poussin, while in light and colour he imitates Claude Lorrain. He stayed for some years circa 1712 in Venice, where he painted many works for the patron Zaccaria Sagredo.Boni, Page 8
His pictures can be found in Dresden, Braunschweig, Vienna, Florence, Naples and many other towns of both Germany and Italy.
