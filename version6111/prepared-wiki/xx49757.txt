==Career==

After graduation, Sabeer briefly worked for Apple Computer as a hardware engineer and Firepower Systems Inc. While working there he was amazed at the fact that he could access any software on the internet via a web browser. He, along with his colleague Jack Smith, set up Hotmail on 4 July 1996. 
Into the 21st century, Hotmail is the world's second largest e-mail provider with over 369 million registered users, a figure exceeded only by Google's Gmail service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://email.about.com/od/emailtrivia/f/how_many_email.htm |title=How Many Email Users Are There? |publisher=About.com |date= |accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl] As President and CEO, he guided Hotmail's rapid rise to industry leadership and its eventual acquisition by Microsoft in 1998. Bhatia worked at Microsoft for a little over a year after the Hotmail acquisition and in April 1999, he left Microsoft to start another venture, Arzoo Inc, an e-commerce firm.
Bhatia started a free messaging service called JaxtrSMS. He said that JaxtrSMS, would do "to SMS what Hotmail did for e-mail". Claiming it to be a disruptive technology, he says that the operators will lose revenue on the reduction in number of SMS's on their network but will benefit from the data plan that the user has to buy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jPy2cfze1jjm2uZialXZlYEm33hA?docId=CNG.9bdd1d5b82f023fa74048f611ee23327.801 |title=AFP: Hotmail co-founder launches free SMS service |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=23 November 2011[/tpl] To date, Jaxtr SMS service has failed to replicate the success of Hotmail.
