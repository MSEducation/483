Having studied at the university to gain doctorates in philology and history, Nazarenko revived the tenet of 19th-century Russian historiography that it's impossible to research early East Slavic history without detailed knowledge of ancient languages. Considered a disciple of Vladimir Pashuto, Nazarenko advocates tighter integration of historiography with the auxiliary disciplines of genealogy, numismatics, and sigillography. This approach allowed him to identify and publish a number of new (mostly foreign) sources on the history of Kievan Rus. 
Nazarenko's major findings were summarized in a monograph International Relations of Ancient Rus (Древняя Русь на международных путях: Междисциплинарные очерки, культурных, торговых, политических отношений IX—XII веков). Moskva: Russkiĭ fond sodeĭstviii︠a︡ obrazovanii︠u︡ i nauke, 2009 ISBN 5-91244-009-5 Upon its publication in 2009, the book won Nazarenko the Macarius Award of the Russian Orthodox Church.http://www.m-fond.ru/laureati/8/
