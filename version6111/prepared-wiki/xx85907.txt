The Notobranchaeidae  are a taxonomic family of floating sea slugs or "sea angels", pelagic marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks.
The small pelagic snails of this family have no shell (except in the early embryonic stage).  They are carnivores, equipped with swimming parapodia (fleshy wing-like flaps), strong jaws, and grasping tentacles, often with suckers resembling those of cephalopods.
