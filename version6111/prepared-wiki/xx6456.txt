[[Logarithm]]

CATEGORIES: Logarithms, Elementary special functions, Scottish inventions

The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number. For example, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3, because 10 to the power 3 is 1000: [tpl]nowrap|1000 [tpl]=[/tpl] 10 × 10 × 10 [tpl]=[/tpl] 103.[/tpl] More generally, for any two real numbers b and x where b is positive and b ≠ 1,
The logarithm to base 10 [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl](b = 10)[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering. The natural logarithm has the irrational (transcendental) number [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]e (≈ 2.718[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]) as its base;  its use is widespread in pure mathematics, especially calculus. The binary logarithm uses base 2 [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl](b = 2)[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] and is prominent in computer science.
Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations. They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily, using slide rules and logarithm tables. Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition because of the fact—important in its own right—that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:
provided that b, x and y are all positive and b ≠ 1.
The present-day notion of logarithms comes from Leonhard Euler, who connected them to the exponential function in the 18th century.
Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to smaller scopes. For example, the decibel is a logarithmic unit quantifying sound pressure and signal power ratios. In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulae counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.
In the same way as the logarithm reverses exponentiation, the complex logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers. The discrete logarithm is another variant; it has applications in public-key cryptography.

==Motivation and definition==

The idea of logarithms is to reverse the operation of exponentiation, that is raising a number to a power. For example, the third power (or cube) of 2 is 8, because 8 is the product of three factors of 2:
It follows that the logarithm of 8 with respect to base 2 is 3, so log2 8 = 3.

===Exponentiation===

The third power of some number b is the product of three factors of b. More generally, raising b to the [tpl]nowrap|n-th[/tpl] power, where n is a natural number, is done by multiplying n factors of b. The [tpl]nowrap|n-th[/tpl] power of b is written bn, so that
Exponentiation may be extended to by, where b is a positive number and the exponent y is any real number. For example, b−1 is the reciprocal of b, that is, [tpl]nowrap|1/b[/tpl]. (For further details, including the formula [tpl]nowrap|bm + n  bm · bn[/tpl], see exponentiation or [tpl]Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0b0igbb3WaQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl], esp. section 2 for an elementary treatise.)

===Definition===

The logarithm of a positive real number x with respect to base b, a positive real number not equal to 1[tpl]#tag:ref|The restrictions on x and b are explained in the section "Analytic properties".|group=nb[/tpl], is the exponent by which b must be raised to yield x. In other words, the logarithm of x to base b is the solution y to the equation[tpl]Citation|last1=Kate|first1=S.K.|last2=Bhapkar|first2=H.R.|title=Basics Of Mathematics|location=Pune|publisher=Technical Publications|isbn=978-81-8431-755-8|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v4R0GSJtEQ4C&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl], chapter 1
The logarithm is denoted "logb(x)" (pronounced as "the logarithm of x to base b" or  "the [tpl]nowrap|base-b[/tpl] logarithm of x"). In the equation y = logb(x), the value y is the answer to the question "To what power must b be raised, in order to yield x?". This question can also be addressed (with a richer answer) for complex numbers, which is done in section "Complex logarithm", and this answer is much more extensively investigated in the page for the complex logarithm.

===Examples===

For example, [tpl]nowrap|log2(16) [tpl]=[/tpl] 4[/tpl], since [tpl]nowrap|24 [tpl]=[/tpl] 2 ×2 × 2 × 2[/tpl] [tpl]=[/tpl] 16. Logarithms can also be negative:
since
A third example: log10(150) is approximately 2.176, which lies between 2 and 3, just as 150 lies between [tpl]nowrap|102 [tpl]=[/tpl] 100[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|103 [tpl]=[/tpl] 1000[/tpl]. Finally, for any base b, [tpl]nowrap|logb(b) [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|1=logb(1) = 0[/tpl], since [tpl]nowrap|b1 [tpl]=[/tpl] b[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|b0 [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl], respectively.

==Logarithmic identities==

Several important formulas, sometimes called logarithmic identities or log laws, relate logarithms to one another.All statements in this section can be found in [tpl]Harvard citations|last1=Shirali|first1=Shailesh|year=2002|loc=section 4|nb=yes[/tpl], [tpl]Harvard citations|last1=Downing| first1=Douglas |year=2003|loc=p. 275[/tpl], or [tpl]Harvard citations|last1=Kate|last2=Bhapkar|year=2009|loc=p. 1-1|nb=yes[/tpl], for example.

===Product, quotient, power and root===

The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers being multiplied; the logarithm of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of the logarithms. The logarithm of the [tpl]nowrap|p-th[/tpl] power  of a number is p times the logarithm of the number itself; the logarithm of a [tpl]nowrap|p-th[/tpl] root is the logarithm of the number divided by p. The following table lists these identities with examples. Each of the identities can be derived after substitution of the logarithm definitions [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]x = blogb(x)[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl], and/or [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]y = blogb(y)[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl], in the left hand sides.

===Change of base===

The logarithm logb(x) can be computed from the logarithms of x and b with respect to an arbitrary base k using the following formula:
Typical scientific calculators calculate the logarithms to bases 10 and e.[tpl]Citation | last1=Bernstein | first1=Stephen | last2=Bernstein | first2=Ruth | title=Schaum's outline of theory and problems of elements of statistics. I, Descriptive statistics and probability| publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-005023-5 | year=1999[/tpl], p. 21 Logarithms with respect to any base b can be determined using either of these two logarithms by the previous formula:
Given a number x and its logarithm logb(x) to an unknown base b, the base is given by:

==Particular bases==

Among all choices for the base, three are particularly common. These are b = 10, b = e (the irrational mathematical constant ≈ 2.71828), and b = 2. In mathematical analysis, the logarithm to base e is widespread because of its particular  analytical properties explained below. On the other hand, [tpl]nowrap|base-10[/tpl] logarithms are easy to use for manual calculations in the decimal number system:[tpl]Citation|last1=Downing|first1=Douglas|title=Algebra the Easy Way|series=Barron's Educational Series|location=Hauppauge, N.Y.|publisher=Barron's|isbn=978-0-7641-1972-9|year=2003[/tpl], chapter 17, p. 275
Thus, log10(x) is related to the number of decimal digits of a positive integer x: the number of digits is the smallest integer strictly bigger than log10(x).[tpl]Citation|last1=Wegener|first1=Ingo| title=Complexity theory: exploring the limits of efficient algorithms|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=978-3-540-21045-0|year=2005[/tpl], p. 20 For example, log10(1430) is approximately 3.15. The next integer is 4, which is the number of digits of 1430. The logarithm to base two is used in computer science, where the binary system is ubiquitous, and in music theory, where a pitch ratio of two (the octave) is ubiquitous and the cent is the binary logarithm (scaled by 1200) of the ratio between two adjacent equally-tempered pitches.
The following table lists common notations for logarithms to these bases and the fields where they are used. Many disciplines write log(x) instead of logb(x), when the intended base can be  determined from the context. The notation blog(x) also occurs.[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.mathe-online.at/mathint/lexikon/l.html |author1=Franz Embacher |author2=Petra Oberhuemer |title=Mathematisches Lexikon |publisher=mathe online: für Schule, Fachhochschule, Universität unde Selbststudium |accessdate=2011-03-22 |language=German[/tpl] The "ISO notation" column lists designations suggested by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 31-11).[tpl]Citation| title = Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)|author = B.

==History==

===Predecessors===

The Babylonians sometime in 2000–1600 BC may have invented the quarter square multiplication algorithm to multiply two numbers using only addition, subtraction and a table of quarter squares.[tpl]citation |title= Quarter Tables Revisited: Earlier Tables, Division of Labor in Table Construction, and Later Implementations in Analog Computers |last=McFarland |first=David |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5n31064n |page=1 |year=2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book| title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History |last=Robson |first=Eleanor |page=227 |year=2008 |isbn= 978-0691091822 [/tpl] However, it could not be used for division without an additional table of reciprocals (or the knowledge of a sufficiently simple algorithm to generate reciprocals). Large tables of quarter squares were used to simplify the accurate multiplication of large numbers from 1817 onwards until this was superseded by the use of computers.
The Indian mathematician Virasena worked with the concept of ardhaccheda: the number of times a number of the form 2n could be halved. For exact powers of 2, this is the logarithm to that base, which is a whole number; for other numbers, it is undefined. He described relations such as the product formula and also introduced integer logarithms in base 3 (trakacheda) and base 4 (caturthacheda)[tpl]citation| contribution=History of Mathematics in India|title=Students' Britannica India: Select essays|editor1-first=Dale|editor1-last=Hoiberg|editor2-first=Indu|editor2-last=Ramchandani|first=R.

In the 16th and early 17th centuries  an algorithm called prosthaphaeresis was used to approximate multiplication and division. This used the trigonometric identity
or similar to convert the multiplications to additions and table lookups. However, logarithms are more straightforward and require less work. It can be shown using Euler's Formula that the two techniques are related.

===From Napier to Euler===

The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms).[tpl]Citation|author=Ernest William Hobson|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614|year=1914|publisher=The University Press|location=Cambridge|url=http://www.archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala[/tpl] Joost Bürgi independently invented logarithms but published six years after Napier.[ref]

Johannes Kepler, who used logarithm tables extensively to compile his Ephemeris and therefore dedicated it to Napier,[tpl]Citation |title=John Napier: Logarithm John |first=Lynne |last=Gladstone-Millar |publisher=National Museums Of Scotland |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-901663-70-9[/tpl], p. 44 remarked:
[tpl]quote|...the accent in calculation led Justus Byrgius Bürgi on the way to these very logarithms many years before Napier's system appeared; but ...instead of rearing up his child for the public benefit he deserted it in the birth.|Johannes Kepler[tpl]Citation |last=Napier |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Napier (historian) |title=Memoirs of John Napier of Merchiston |publisher=William Blackwood |location=Edinburgh |year=1834 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=husGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl], p. 392.|Rudolphine Tables (1627)[/tpl]
By repeated subtractions Napier calculated [tpl]nowrap|(1 − 10−7)L[/tpl] for L ranging from 1 to 100. The result for L=100 is approximately [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]0.99999 = 1 − 10−5[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]. Napier then calculated the products of these numbers with [tpl]nowrap|107(1 − 10−5)L[/tpl] for L from 1 to 50, and did similarly with [tpl]nowrap|0.9998 ≈ (1 − 10−5)20[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|0.9 ≈ 0.99520[/tpl]. These computations, which occupied 20 years, allowed him to give, for any number N from 5 to 10 million, the number L that solves the equation
Napier first called L an "artificial number", but later introduced the word "logarithm" to mean a number that indicates a ratio: [tpl]lang|grc|λόγος[/tpl] (logos) meaning proportion, and [tpl]lang|grc|ἀριθμός[/tpl] (arithmos) meaning number. In modern notation, the relation to natural logarithms is:

where the very close approximation corresponds to the observation that
The invention was quickly and widely met with acclaim. The works of Bonaventura Cavalieri (Italy), Edmund Wingate (France), Xue Fengzuo (China), and
Johannes Kepler's Chilias logarithmorum (Germany) helped spread the concept further.[ref]

In 1647 Grégoire de Saint-Vincent related logarithms to the quadrature of the hyperbola, by pointing out that the area f(t) under the hyperbola from [tpl]nowrap|x [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl] to [tpl]nowrap|x [tpl]=[/tpl] t[/tpl] satisfies
