State Road 120 in the U.S. state of Indiana  is an east–west state highway located close to the Michigan border.  It runs from Elkhart in the west to the Michigan border at the eastern edge of Indiana.

==Route description==

The western terminus of State Road 120 is in Elkhart at Middleton Run Road (which was Indiana State Road 319 before 120 was shortened to this point) as a surface street and an eastern terminus on the short north–south border between Indiana and Michigan, where it becomes a county road  called Territorial Road (formerly M-120) a few miles east of Fremont. 
Indiana's three-digit state highways are generally "children" of one-digit or two-digit state or U.S. highways in a manner analogous to that of the U.S. highway system. Indiana 120 has U.S. Route 20 as its "parent", to which it is nearly parallel. Until the 1990s, when U.S. 20 was diverted to a limited-access highway to the south of Elkhart, State Road 120 had its western terminus in Elkhart on U.S. 20. After the realignment of U.S. 20, the two miles (3 km) of State Road 120 between the former U.S. 20 through Elkhart and Middleton Run Road were trimmed from it, effective 2000-09-11.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=09A3 Digest: Elkhart: City will assume control of part of S.R. 120 |url=http://www.etruth.com/Know/News/Story.aspx?id=270765 |work=Elkhart Truth |publisher= |date=2000-09-09 |accessdate=2008-04-07 [/tpl]
All of Indiana 120 is an undivided surface highway, lightly traveled throughout most of its route due to the nearby Indiana Toll Road (also known as Interstate 80 and Interstate 90) which carries most east–west long-distance travel through northern Indiana. Aside from Elkhart and Fremont, it does not traverse any towns with populations greater than 1000.
State Road 120 has direct access to the Indiana Toll Road and indirect access, through a short stretch of State Road 127, to Interstate 69 a few miles west of Fremont.
West to east, the following towns and villages can be found on State Road 120:

==History==

Before receiving the State Road 120 designation, the road was known as Toledo Road, as the section within Elkhart it used to occupy is still known, and is presently named Toledo Street as it passes through Orland and through Fremont.
At one time, State Road 120 was to have been rerouted onto Elkhart County Road 17 to end at U.S. 20.Indiana Highway Ends - SR 120
