Guts:8 Laws of Business from One of the Most Innovative Business Leaders of Our Time is a 2003 management book by Robert A. Lutz, former president of Chrysler.
A self-described "maverick", Lutz organizes the book around his "8 Immutable Laws of Business" which he poses as strawmen to demonstrate that even the best principles can be harmful if taken too far.  Lutz draws extensively from his personal experience to illustrate the business principles in the book.
