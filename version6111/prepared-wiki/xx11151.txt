==Early life==

Lee was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Jacqueline Carroll (née Shelton), a teacher of arts and black literature, and William James Edward Lee III, a jazz musician and composer. Lee also had three younger siblings Joie, David, and Cinqué, who all worked in many different positions in Lee's films. Director Malcolm D. Lee is his cousin. When he was a child, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York. During his childhood, his mother nicknamed him "Spike". In Brooklyn, he attended John Dewey High School.
Lee enrolled in Morehouse College, a historically black college, where he made his first student film, Last Hustle in Brooklyn. He took film courses at Clark Atlanta University and graduated with a BA in Mass Communication from Morehouse. He did graduate work at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts in Film & Television.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.morehouse.edu/about/boardbios/slee.html | publisher=Morehouse College | title=SHELTON "SPIKE" LEE '79 | date=April 9, 2012 | accessdate=April 9, 2012[/tpl]

==Career==

===Film===

Lee's thesis film, Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads, was the first student film to be showcased in Lincoln Center's New Directors New Films Festival.
In 1985, Lee began work on his first feature film, She's Gotta Have It. With a budget of $175,000, he shot the film in two weeks. When the film was released in 1986, it grossed over $7,000,000 at the U.S. box office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=shesgottahaveit.htm |title=She's Gotta Have It (1986) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=August 26, 1986 |accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]
Lee's 1989 film Do the Right Thing was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1989. Many people, including Hollywood's Kim Basinger believed that Do the Right Thing also deserved a Best Picture nomination. Driving Miss Daisy won Best Picture that year. Lee said in an April 7, 2006 interview with New York magazine that the other film's success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award.[tpl]cite web|last=Hill |first=Logan |url=http://nymag.com/anniversary/40th/culture/45772/ |title=Q&A with Spike Lee on Making 'Do the Right Thing |work=New York |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]
After the 1990 release of Mo' Better Blues, Lee was accused of antisemitism by the Anti-Defamation League and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as "Shylocks". Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that Lew Wasserman, Sidney Sheinberg or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and Universal Studios, were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and "that's a fact."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-spike-lee-s-jews-passage-benign-cliche-into-bigotry.html |title=Spike Lee's Jews and the Passage From Benign Cliche into Bigotry |last=James |first=Caryn |work=The New York Times |date=August 16, 1990 |accessdate=December 1, 2009[/tpl]

==Controversial remarks==

As Lee became more well known and his work and comments were followed more closely, he became embroiled in some controversies.
In May 1999, the New York Post reported that Lee made an inflammatory comment about Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association, while speaking to reporters at the Cannes Film Festival. Lee was quoted as saying the National Rifle Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, someone should "Shoot him with a .44 Bull Dog."[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905290188_1_nra-president-rash-of-school-shootings-remarks |title=Spike Lee Says Remark About Shooting Heston Was A Joke – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=February 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/08/entertainment/et-hestonletters8 |title=Heston was always a man of his words – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 13, 2013[/tpl] Lee said he intended it as a joke. He was responding to coverage about whether Hollywood was responsible for school shootings. Lee said, "The problem is guns," he said. Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey condemned Lee as having "nothing to offer the debate on school violence except more violence and more hate."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/log/1999/05/28/spike/index.html |title=Living foot to mouth |publisher=Salon.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]
In October 2005, Lee responded to a CNN anchor's question as to whether the government intentionally ignored the plight of black Americans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe by saying, "It's not too far-fetched. I don't put anything past the United States government. I don't find it too far-fetched that they tried to displace all the black people out of New Orleans."Lee Won't Dismiss Theories Of A Flooding Conspiracy  In later comments, Lee cited the government's past atrocities including the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male.All about Spike Lee's latest film[tpl]cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=R7j0SqSn14A |title=Clip of Lee expressing his views of the Hurricane Katrina and Tuskegee matters on Real Time with Bill Maher |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]
At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lee, who was then making Miracle at St. Anna, about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during World War II, criticized director Clint Eastwood for not depicting black Marines in his own WWII film, Flags of Our Fathers. Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima, pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was segregated during WWII, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. He angrily said that Lee should "shut his face". Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an "angry old man", and argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers, "there was not one black soldier in both of those films".[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5015524|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|title=Spike Strikes Back: Clint's 'an Angry Old Man|publisher=ABC News|date=June 6, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7439371.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|title=Eastwood hits back at Lee claims|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl] He added that he and Eastwood were "not on a plantation."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jun/09/news.usa|title='We're not on a plantation, Clint'|date=June 9, 2008|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|work=The Guardian[/tpl] Lee later claimed that the event was exaggerated by the media and that he and Eastwood had reconciled through mutual friend Steven Spielberg, culminating in his sending Eastwood a print of Miracle at St. Anna."Access Exclusive: Spike Lee On Clint Eastwood: 'We're Cool'" OMG!/Yahoo!

In March 2012, after the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Spike Lee was one of many people who used Twitter to circulate a message which claimed to give the home address of the shooter George Zimmerman. The address turned out to be incorrect, causing the real occupants, Elaine and David McClain, to leave home and stay at a hotel due to numerous death threats. Lee issued an apology and reached an agreement with the McClains which reportedly included "compensation", with their attorney stating "The McClains’ claim is fully resolved".[tpl]cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/28/justice/florida-teen-spike-lee/?hpt=us_c2|title=Spike Lee apologizes for retweeting wrong Zimmerman address |publisher=CNN |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-trayvon-martin-lee-settlement-20120329,0,7063902.story|title=Trayvon Martin: Spike Lee settles with family forced to flee home|first=Michael|last=Muskal|work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2012[/tpl] Nevertheless, in November 2013, the McClains filed a negligence lawsuit which accused Lee of "encouraging a dangerous mob mentality among his Twitter followers, as well as the public-at-large".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/spike-lee-tweet-lawsuit-675413 |title=Elderly Couple Sues Spike Lee Over Tweet |work=The Smoking Gun |date=November 8, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/spike-lee-sued-over-george-zimmerman-tweet-165719017--abc-news-topstories.html |title=Spike Lee Sued Over George Zimmerman Tweet |work=ABC News |author=Colleen Curry |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013[/tpl] The lawsuit, which a court filing reportedly valued at $1.2 million, alleged that the couple suffered "injuries and damages" that continued after the initial settlement up through Zimmerman's trial in 2013.
