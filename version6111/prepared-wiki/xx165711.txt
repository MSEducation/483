Arktika 2007 ([tpl]lang-ru|Российская полярная экспедиция "Арктика-2007"[/tpl]) was a 2007 expedition in which Russia performed the first ever crewed descent to the ocean bottom at the North Pole, as part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial claim, one of many territorial claims in the Arctic,The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons, by Shamil Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, August 2007 made possible, in part, because of Arctic shrinkage.  As well as dropping a titanium tube containing the Russian flag, the submersibles collected specimens of Arctic flora and fauna and apparently recorded video of the dives. The "North Pole-35" (abbreviated as "NP-35") manned drifting ice station was established.
On January 10, 2008 three of expedition members who performed the descent to the ocean bottom at the North Pole, Anatoly Sagalevich, Yevgeny Chernyaev and Artur Chilingarov were awarded titles Hero of the Russian Federation "for courage and heroism showed in extremal conditions and successful completion of High-Latitude Arctic Deep-Water Expedition."Президент России | Указ «О награждении государственными наградами Российской Федерации»

==Program==

The expedition, part of the Russian program for the 2007–2008 International Polar Year, used the Akademik Fedorov research ship, with both MIR submersibles on board and the nuclear icebreaker Rossiya (Russia) led it through the Arctic ice. The ships had two Mi-8 helicopters and geological probe devices, and Il-18 aircraft with gravimetric devices. Its aim was to investigate the structure and evolution of the Earth's crust in the Arctic regions neighbouring Eurasia, such as the regions of Mendeleev Ridge, Alpha Ridge and Lomonosov Ridge, to discover whether they are linked with the Siberian shelf.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Applications table at the website of the Russian International Polar Year programIPY ACTIVITIES - Russian plans for Arctic Ocean Activities in summer 2007 (map) at AARI

==Expedition==

The base ship Akademik Fedorov left Saint Petersburg on July 10, 2007 for the expedition. Off Baltiysk, it took aboard the two MIR Deep Submergence Vehicles manufactured by the Finnish company Rauma Oceanics  from Akademik Mstislav Keldysh   [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=129584&tid=47512&date=23.07.2007  On July 22 the vessel arrived at Murmansk, and sailed for the North Pole three days later, behind the nuclear icebreaker Russia.http://www.ipyeaso.aari.ru/news.html After five hours, the Akademik Fedorov began drifting in the Barents Sea because an electric motor controlling its propellor failed.Akademik Fyodorov Ship Engine Breakdown Removed — News — RZD-Partner Portal The Russia, 20 hours ahead by  that time, turned to help.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=131861&tid=47512&date=23.07.2007 Nine hours later the crew of Akademik Fedorov repaired the motor and the ship continued its voyage, staying close to the Russia.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] http://www.aari.ru/main.php?id=1&sub=0 On July 27 The icebreaker landed a group of marine biologists on the Kheysa island, the site of Russia's Krenkel observatory to conduct research for the International Polar Year.

===First stage: high-latitude deep-water Arctic expedition===

====Test descent====

On July 29 the Akademik Fedorov approached a large ice-hole, surrounded by thick ice at [tpl]coord|82|29|N|64|28|E[/tpl], 47 miles north of Franz Josef Land. There, the submersibles, each with one person on board, performed test dives. Anatoly Sagalevich took the MIR-1 down at 9:36 Moscow Time and Yevgeny Chernyaev followed at the controls of MIR-2 at 10:00. At 10:32 MIR-1 reached the seabed at a depth of 1311 metres, and by 11:10 MIR-2 also was at the ocean bottom. Both surfaced at 14:20.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl]MIR vehicles submerged in high latitudes of the Arctic.Russia races to North Pole seabed. CNN

====North Pole descent====

Descents were carried out on August 2, 2007 in both MIR Deep Submergence Vehicles. The MIR-1's crew consisted of pilot Anatoly Sagalevich (researcher of the Oceanology Institute), Russian polar explorer Arthur Chilingarov and businessman Vladimir Gruzdev. The MIR-2's crew comprised pilot Yevgeny Chernyaev of Russia, Australian adventurer Mike McDowell, and Swede Frederik Paulsen Jr., head of Ferring Pharmaceuticals).[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Russia submarines successfully end 1st travel to Arctic floor, ITAR-TASS, August 2, 2007 
MIR-1 began its dive at 9:28 Moscow Time and at 12:08 reached the seabed 4,261 metres (14,061 feet) below the North Pole. MIR-2 began its dive at 9:47 and at 12:35 reached the seabed 4,302 metres (14,196 feet) down. At 12:35 the bathyscaphes were 500 metres (1,650 feet) apart and MIR-1 moved near MIR-2. At 13:46 both submersibles began to ascend, with MIR-1 surfacing at 18:08 and MIR-2 at 19:15.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Unique Arctic Experiment by Russian Scientists Ended

====Controversy over TV images====

Russian state broadcaster Rossiya had enhanced footage of the Arktika expedition with sequences taken by MIR submersibles for the 1997 film Titanic, as an illustration of the submarines in action, in which the Finnish-built bathyscaphes had explored the wrecked liner on the Atlantic seabed.Russian arctic images “from Titanic, Daily Telegraph, London, 11 August 2007.Retrieved on 2007-08-12. The same images were rebroadcast by Reuters, which mistook them as actual footage of part of the expedition.

Retrieved on 2007-08-12. International news agency Reuters had on August 10 admitted it had wrongly captioned video it took from Russia’s Rossiya Television and which it had disseminated worldwide, London’s Guardian reported.[ref]Reuters gets that sinking feeling, The Guardian, London, 10 August 2007.Retrieved on 2007-09-19. ''Reuters has admitted that it took the images from Russian state television channel RTR and wrongly captioned them as file footage originating from the Arctic.
RTR had also used the footage to illustrate stories about the North Pole expedition, but it is thought as library footage, and it never claimed it was actually of the flag-planting.'[/ref] 
The agency, the daily reported, had admitted: it had “mistakenly identified this file footage as originating from the Arctic, and not the North Atlantic where the footage was shot.

====Finish of the first stage====

On its way back to Franz Josef Land to collect marine biologists, the Akademik Fedorov on August 4 met the French Tara expedition. The ship's MI-8 helicopter landed near the yacht, which had been drifting for eleven months, Rossiya's Vesti reported. The Russian expedition, led by Arthur Chilingarov, had supplied the Tara expedition with food[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Russian polar explorers supplied fruit to the crew of the French yacht Tara's schooner Agnès B had set out a year earlier to drift with the Arctic ice for two years, measuring the retreat of the Polar ice cap, its log shows. The Russians had asked to 'visit...on their return from the Pole, we accepted their request', the log reads'Visit of the Russian Deep Sea High Latitude Expedition 5 August 2007.retrieved on 2007-08-12. 'A group of a dozen officials and journalists' brought 'gifts of fresh fruit and vegetables and a few bottles of wine...we found the meeting somewhat surreal'. The French expedition had 9 tonnes of food and was growing its own — ‘...salad...is what we have grown...most date. Corn salad grows very well’, even at those latitudes but ‘...it seems a bit premature to consider us a self sufficient Arctic base food wise', the Agnès B's Bruno Vienne told hydroponics advisers Les Jardins SuspendusDaily Life: A Garden On Board Tara, Tara Expeditions, Paris, undated.Retrieved on 2007-08-12.
The first stage of the Arktika 2007 expedition ended on August 7, 2007, when both MIR submersibles were transferred from Akademik Fedorov aboard Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, met in Nagurskaya Bay, which is situated in the Cambridge Channel of Franz Josef Land.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] 2007/08 International Polar Year News Bulletin (issue 5—6, July—August 2007)

===Second stage: sailing eastwards===

Akademik Fedorov then sailed towards the "Ice Base", a group of nine polar explorers led by A.A.Visnevsky landed on June 7, 2007 from the nuclear icebreaker Russia at the point [tpl]coord|80|57|N|168|53|E[/tpl] The corresponding ice floe was a candidate for the "NP-35" establishment, but since then its area greatly reduced and became inappropriate for this. Sailing through the northern part of the Kara Sea Akademik Fedorov reached the northern part of Laptev Sea, then returned, passed by Schmidt Island and sailed southwards towards Shokalsky Strait of Severnaya Zemlya. 26 oceanographic stations were carried out and Mi-8 flights were performed from the research vessel to Schmidt Island for ornithology research and to north-eastern islands of Franz Joseph Land for glaciology, geology and ornithology research. Ornithology research was also conducted on Severnaya Zemlya islands. In particular, a significant part of the ivory gull range was observed and six new colonies of these birds found.News Release by AARI for August 20, 2007
By August 17 Akademik Fedorov passed Shokalsky Strait and six days later collected the "Ice Base".News Release by AARI for August 23, 2007 On August 28 the research vessel anchored by the Tiksi roadstead to perform the rotation of expedition members and left for New Siberian Islands next day. Akademik Fedorov skirted them around from the north, carrying out oceanographic stations and a Mi-8 flight to Bennett Island was performed for geology probe and pollution probe.News Release by AARI for August 29, 2007
On September 5 Akademik Fedorov met nuclear icebreaker Russia and started a search for an ice floe suitable for "NP-35" manned drifting ice station establishment, beginning the third stage of "Arktika 2007" expedition.News Release by AARI for September 6, 2007

===Third stage: drifting ice station "NP-35" establishment===

The search for appropriate ice floe for the establishment of the "North Pole-35" (abbreviated as "NP-35") manned drifting ice station lasted until September 18, when one with an area of 16 square kilometers was found. Some 300 tons of cargo was disembarked from the vessel to ensure long functioning of the station. "NP-35" started operations on September 21, 2007 at the point [tpl]coord|81|26|N|103|30|E[/tpl], when flags of Russia and Saint Petersburg were raised there. 22 scientists, led by A.A.Visnevsky are working on the ice floe. The station is believed to work for a year, drifting towards the Fram Strait.September 21, 2007 Press-Release by AARI
On September 22 Akademik Fedorov left for Murmansk and reached its home port, Saint Petersburg, on October 3, finishing the high latitude Arctic expedition Arktika 2007. Arthur Chilingarov sent a government telegram to congratulate expedition members on behalf of State Duma.Government Telegram from Arthur Chilingarov

Lindsay Parson, (head of the Law of the Sea Group at Southampton's National Oceanography Centre in the UK) stated that Denmark (via Greenland) and Canada would have equally good chances of claiming the territory on these grounds — which both nations have stated they will do — as the Lomonosov Ridge extends from Russia across the Arctic to Greenland and northern Canada.Russia: Polar Expedition Means 'Very Little' For Territorial Claims - RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY Denmark claimed that the [tpl]convert|1,500|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] Lomonosov Ridge was its property, the BBC's World Service radio reported early on August 12.
