[[Multilinear map]]

CATEGORIES: Multilinear algebra

In linear algebra, a multilinear map is a function of several variables that is linear separately in each variable.  More precisely, a multilinear map is a function
A multilinear map of two variables is a bilinear map.  More generally, a multilinear map of k variables is called a ''k''-linear map.  If the codomain of a multilinear map is the field of scalars, it is called a multilinear form.  Multilinear maps and multilinear forms are fundamental objects of study in multilinear algebra.
If all variables belong to the same space, one can consider symmetric,
antisymmetric and alternating k-linear maps. The latter coincide if the underlying ring (or field) has a characteristic different from two,
else the former two coincide.

In the case of 2×2 matrices we get

==Properties==

A multilinear map has a value of zero whenever one of its arguments is zero.
For n>1, the only n-linear map which is also a linear map is the zero function, see bilinear map#Examples.
