Flavors include azuki bean paste, green tea (matcha), yuzu, strawberry and chestnut. Nagoya is particularly famous for its uirō, but there are other regional versions, notably in Yamaguchi and Odawara. It can also be purchased in traditional Japanese confectionery shops throughout Japan. Uirō was originally the name of a medicine in the Muromachi period (1336 – 1573).  References to uirō as a confection first appear in the Wa-Kan Sansai Zue, Ryōan Terajima's massive Edo-period dictionary published in 1712.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten | title = 外郎 | trans_title = | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-07-02 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | oclc = 56431036  | trans_title = Uirō[/tpl]
