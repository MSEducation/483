[[Manning]]

Manning (aka Mannion, Manning) is a family name.

==Origin and meaning==

Manning is from an old Norse word - manningi - meaning a brave or valiant man; and one of the first forms of the name was Mannin; another cartography was Mannygn. One historian gives a Saxon origin for the family, which he calls "ancient and noble". According to him, Manning was the name of a town in Saxony, and from it the surname sprang.
Other historians make Mannheim, Germany, the cradle of the family, and begin its history with Ranulph, or Rudolph de Manning, Court Palatine, who, having married Elgida, aunt to King Harold I of England, had a grant of land in Kent, England. His name is also written de Mannheim - Rudolph de Mannheim. His place in Kent was Downe Court, and there the Mannings have been a power ever since. Simon de Manning, a grandson of Rudolph, was the first of the English barons to take up the cross and go forth to the Holy Wars. He was a companion of King Richard, Couer de Lion, and was knighted on the battlefield. We can easily see where the cross of the coat of arms comes from. At Downe Court these arms are seen graven upon tombstones of the Mannings. By the thirteenth century the family was well represented in over a score of countries and several towns bear their name - Manningham, Yorkshire, and Mannington, Norfolk.
The surname Manning is also an English patronymic name, being one of those names derived from the first name of a father. In this case it is derived from the old English personal name Manning and simply denotes 'son of Manning', while Manning itself may derive from the old Norse name Menning, meaning 'able'.
Early recorded English instances of the name includes a reference to one Mannicus in the Domesday Book of 1086 and Algarus Manningestepsune in 1130, mentioned in Ekwall's "Early London Personal Names". Seaman Lilius Manning appears in the Pipe Rolls for Essex in 1181 and Ainulf Manning in the Pipe Rolls for Kent in 1190.
The surname Manning is on the record in Ireland from the seventeenth century and is most numerous today in the counties  Cork and  Dublin. It is interesting to note that while it is essentially an English surname, Manning has occasionally been used as a synonym of the Gaelic surname O'Mannin and that, for example, Cornet John Manning of O'Neill's dragons in King James II's Irish army, was an O'Mannin.
Others trace the origins of the name to Ireland: Ó Mannin (anglicized Mannion) is the name of a Galway family who were formerly chiefs of Soghain (in what is now Ireland), a district nearly co-extensive with the barony of Tiaquin. Ó Mannin, King of Soghain, is mentioned in the Chronicon Scotorum in the year 1135, and a latter chief died at the Second Battle of Athenry in 1316.
They continued to form a distinct clan down to the time of James I of England. The chief resided at Menlough Castle, in the parish of Killascobe, Galway. In 1617, Aedh Ó Mannin (Hugh O'Mannin) surrendered his estates, but a small portion of it was restored under the Act of Settlement in 1676 where the name is still common in Galway and Roscommon, and has spread into other parts of Ireland.http://www.irishgen.com/surnames/details.asp?surname_id=1182
