A vert ramp is a form of half-pipe with vertical in it and its used in "extreme sports" such as Vert Skating, Vert Skateboarding and Vert BMX.
Vert ramps are so named because they transition from a horizontal plane (known as the flat-bottom) to a vertical section on top.
The typical height of a Vert Ramp is [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] with anywhere from [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] 
to [tpl]convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of vertical on top.
This vertical section makes it easier for the riders to take off and 'catch air' on a vert ramp rather than on a half-pipe.  
This is because the vert at the top causes the rider to naturally go straight up into the air instead of forward and off the ramp 
(as is the tendency on a half-pipes that does not go vertical up).
