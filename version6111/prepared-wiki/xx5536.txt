[[Geography of Kiribati]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Kiribati

This article describes the geography of the Republic of Kiribati. Kiribati consists of 32 atolls and one island scattered over all four hemispheres in an expanse of ocean equivalent in size to the continental United States. The islands lie roughly halfway between Hawaii and Australia in the Micronesian region of the South Pacific. The three main island groupings are the Gilbert Islands, Phoenix Islands, and Line Islands. On 1 January 1995 Kiribati moved the International Date Line to include its easternmost islands and make it the same day throughout the country.
Kiribati includes Kiritimati (Christmas Atoll; in the Line Islands), the largest coral atoll (in terms of land area, not dimensions) in the world, and Banaba (Ocean Island), one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific.
Most of the land on these islands is less than two metres above sea level.[tpl]cite web| first=Rodney|last=Dekker|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-09/tuvalu-kiribati-climate-change/3720408|title= Island neighbours at the mercy of rising tides| date =9 December 2011|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=9 Dec 2011[/tpl] A 1989 United Nations report identified Kiribati as one of the countries that could completely disappear in the 21st century if steps are not taken to address global climate change. 
Owing to a population growth rate of more than 2% and the overcrowding around the capital of South Tarawa, a program of migration was begun in 1989 to move nearly 5,000 inhabitants to outlying atolls, mainly in the Line Islands. A program of resettlement to the mostly uninhabited Phoenix Islands was begun in 1995.
The Phoenix Islands Protected Area constitutes 11.34% of Kiribatiâ€™s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and with a size of [tpl]convert|408,250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] it is the  second largest marine protected area (MPA) in the Pacific Ocean.
