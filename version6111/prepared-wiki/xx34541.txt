Kenneth Harry Clarke,  QC, MP (born 2 July 1940) is a British Conservative politician, the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe and a Minister without Portfolio in the UK Government.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/lady-warsi-kenneth-clarke-reshuffle | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | title=Lady Warsi and Kenneth Clarke first casualties of Cameron reshuffle | date=4 September 2012[/tpl] He was first elected to Parliament in 1970, and appointed as a minister in Edward Heath's Government in 1972. One of Britain's best-known politicians, he has served in the Cabinet as Education Secretary, Health Secretary, Justice Secretary, Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since 1997 he has been the President of the Tory Reform Group. He has contested the Conservative Party leadership three times – in 1997, 2001 and 2005 – being defeated each time. Although opinion polls have shown him to be popular with the general public, his pro-European views conflict with the Conservative Party's Euro-sceptic stance. He is the fifth longest serving cabinet minister in the modern era.[tpl]cite news|last=Parkinson |first=Justin |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22858351 |title=BBC News - Chasing Churchill: Ken Clarke climbs ministerial long-service chart |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]

==Early life==

Kenneth Clarke's father (also named Kenneth) worked as a mining electrician and then a watchmaker and jeweller.  He was born in West Bridgford, near Nottingham, in 1940 and was educated at Langley Mill Boys' School, Derbyshire, Highbury Primary School, Nottingham,Weekend Interview.  Daily Mail (London). 28 April 2012, p.6. and Nottingham High School (then a direct grant grammar school). He went on to Cambridge University, where he read law at Gonville and Caius College and graduated with a 2:1 honours degree. Clarke originally had Labour sympathies, his grandfather having been a Communist. However while at Cambridge, he joined the Conservative Party, and was chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association. Controversially, he invited former British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley to speak for a second year in succession, leading some Jewish students (including his future successor at the Home Office Michael Howard) to resign from CUCA in protest. Howard then defeated Clarke in one election for the presidency of the Cambridge Union Society, although Clarke was elected President of the Union a year later. He was elected President on 6 March 1963 by a majority of 56 votes.  He opposed the admission of women to the Union, being quoted as saying upon his election, "The fact that Oxford has admitted them does not impress me at all. Cambridge should wait a year to see what happens before any decision is taken on admitting them."[tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=News in Brief |day_of_week=Thursday |date=7 March 1963 |page_number=5 |issue=55643 |column=B [/tpl] In an early 1990s documentary, journalist Michael Cockerell played to Clarke some tape recordings of himself speaking at the Cambridge Union as a young man; Clarke displayed amusement at his own stereotypically upper class accent. Clarke was counted one of the Cambridge Mafia, a group of prominent Conservative politicians who were educated at Cambridge in the 1960s. On leaving Cambridge, Clarke was called to the Bar in 1963 by Gray's Inn and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1980.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Clarke_Kenneth.aspx |title= Kenneth Clarke |publisher= Conservative Party[/tpl]

==Member of Parliament==

Clarke sought election to the House of Commons almost immediately after university. He began by fighting the Labour stronghold of Mansfield in the 1964 and 1966 elections. In June 1970, at the age of 29, he gained the East Midlands constituency of Rushcliffe, south of Nottingham, from Labour MP Tony Gardner. Clarke was by 2005 one of the longest serving of all MPs.
Kenneth Clarke was soon appointed a Government whip, and served as such from 1972 to 1974; he helped ensure Edward Heath's government win key votes on entry to the European Economic Community (now the EU) with the assistance of Labour rebels. Even though he opposed the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975, he was appointed as her industry spokesman from 1976 to 1979, and then occupied a range of ministerial positions during her premiership.
He is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/exclusive-mps-splash-out-250000-of-public-money-on-vanity-portraits-9056130.html|title=Exclusive: MPs splash out £250,000 of public money on vanity portraits|last=Murphy|first=Joe|date=13 January 2014|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]

===Ministerial positions===

Clarke first served as junior transport minister, then Minister of State for Health (1982–85). He joined the Cabinet as Paymaster-General and Employment Minister (1985–87) (his Secretary of State, Lord Young, was in the Lords), and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister at the DTI (1987–88), with responsibility for the Inner Cities.  While in that position, Clarke announced the sale to British Aerospace of the Rover Group, a novel name for British Leyland, which previously had been nationalised in 1975 by the government of Harold Wilson.Hansard: "Rover Group (Privatisation)" debate, 29 Mar 1988
Despite being an ardent pro-tobacco advocate, he was appointed Health Secretary in 1988, in which office he introduced the controversial 'internal market' concept in the NHS.[ref]
