==History==

When the Euro-American settlers came to what is now Washington County, the area was inhabited by the Atfalati Native American group.  Smallpox epidemics struck the Atfalati and by the mid-1830s only 10 percent of the tribe was left. An 1855 government treaty removed the remaining Atfalati to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation where there are still about 20 individuals who identify themselves as Atfalati.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.laurelchurch.com/lookout/2010%20July%20Lookout-reduced.pdf | title= Lookout | publisher= Laurel Community Church | accessdate= 2010-07-02[/tpl]

In May 1879, the Laurel post office was established with Alfred Mulloy, Sr. as postmaster. Mail was delivered once per week until 1881 when deliveries increased to twice per week.

==Churches==

In 1876, community members started a congregation at Mountain Top with W.C. Kantner as preacher.Felton, Charles. “Evangelical mission work started Laurel Church in early 1870s”. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976, Schools and Churches, p. 6. A Baptist church was also started that year by the Brown, Steventon, Shamly, and Messinger families. The Mulloy family donated [tpl]convert|2|acre|m2[/tpl] to the church in 1878 for a chapel and cemetery, and a church was built and named the Mount Olive Baptist Church during the summer. The cemetery was laid out in 1880.
Laurel Church had its beginnings around 1888 when J.M. Beaumont, an Evangelical preacher, started preaching at the Baptist church. In 1892, the church was transferred to the Hillsboro mission of the church from the Newberg mission. In 1897, Rosilla and George Hathorn donated land and a new church was built, named Bethany United Evangelical Church. In 1800, the United Brethren Church was organized by Phillip Otterbein, with the churches merging in 1946.
In 1947, Lester Moore began the church's first full-time pastor. On September 22, 1948, the original church building burned down. A new structure was erected, and a dedication ceremony was held on January 29, 1950. In 1960, a new parsonage was added, followed by an expansion started in 1974.

The two main cross streets in Laurel are SW Laurel Road, and SW Campbell Road.  These used to be Laurel Road North, Laurel Road South, Laurel Road East, and Laurel Road West.  These were changed to their present name when the county got rid of the old route/box number of addresses and implemented the present street address system, which is more common in the western United States. Laurel is located along the Washington County Scenic Loop.
