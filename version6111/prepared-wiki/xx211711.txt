FC Kalush is a Ukrainian Football club that is from Kalush, Ivano-Frankivsk oblast that competes currently at the Amateur Level.
In 1994 the club, competing under the name of Khimik competed in the Zone 1 (Western Ukraine) Amateur competition and became champions given them an entry condition to join the professional leagues. The next season in 1995, Khimik entered the Druha Liha. Later that season they renamed themselves to FC Kalush.
The club struggled at this level of competition. In 2001 the club renamed themselves to FC LUKOR Kalush and the new sponsorship immediately improved the status of the club. In the next season the club won the Druha Liha 2002-03 Group A championship. However,at the end of the season the club was bought out by neighboring club FC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk and they were subsequently renamed and made into a reserve club.
The club renamed again to FC Spartak-2 Ivano-Frankivsk in 2004 and later in that year they were dissolved.
The club reformed in 2006 and plays at the Amateur level.
