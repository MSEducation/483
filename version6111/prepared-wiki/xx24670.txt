The Nathaniel Drake House is significant for its architecture and how the evolution of the building reflects the changes within Plainfield from an early colonial settlement to a modern suburb, its association with the Drake family, who were prominent early settlers in the region, as well as its association with General George Washington during the Battle of Short Hills."Home Page, Drake House Museum.

Goodman, Journal of Urban History, vol. 33 (May 2007), pp. 368-401.
