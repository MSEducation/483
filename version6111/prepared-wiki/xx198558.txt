==History==

Seokyeong University was established in October 1947 as Hanguk College ([tpl]lang|ko|한국대학[/tpl], lit. "Korea College"), which was the first 4-year evening college in Korea. It had difficulties during/after Korean War, and in 1955 the school foundation was succeeded by Gukje Hagwon ([tpl]lang|ko|국제학원[/tpl], lit. "International Academy"); the college was renamed Gukje College ([tpl]lang|ko|국제대학[/tpl], lit. "International College"; not to be confused with present-day Kookje College in Pyeongtaek).
The college was succeeded by several foundations and in 1988 it moved to the present campus. In 1989 an independent and dedicated foundation was established for the college. In April 1992 the college was chartered as a university, and in September 1992 it was renamed Seokyeong University. Since November 1998 the enrollment of the daytime students has been made larger than that of the evening students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seokyeong.ac.kr/01/about/about_d_02.htm#history2|title=학교소개|trans-title=About Seokyeong University: 연혁 (History)|language=Korean|accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]
