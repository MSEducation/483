Dirty Money is the fourth studio album by American group UGK. The album came after a five-year hiatus. However, they had been planning this album since 1998, and ads for it appeared in some of the late 1998 Jive albums. "Take It Off" was also featured on the soundtrack to The Corruptor. "Money, Hoes & Power" with Jermaine Dupri was also featured on Dupri's Instructions album. The album was released in explicit and edited versions. The song "Wood Wheel" was also removed from the edited version due to non-stop drug references. The track "Ain't That a Bitch (Ask Yourself)" was also edited in the explicit version due to sexually explicit and sexist lyrics. As of 2011, it has sold 522,943 copies.
