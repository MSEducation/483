==Representative history==

Lynn had been the Liberal candidate for the Werriwa by-election of January 1994 in which his ALP opponent was future Opposition Leader Mark Latham. Werriwa is a safe ALP seat and Latham was elected although Lynn succeeded in achieving a swing for the Liberal Party.
While Lynn was never expected to win Werriwa he did come close to being elected to the Federal Parliament when he was preselected as the Liberal candidate for the marginal ALP seat of Macarthur. However supporters of former NSW Liberal Premier John Fahey wanted Fahey to be in the Federal Parliament and Macarthur was the ideal seat for Fahey but Lynn refused to step aside for Fahey.
However a deal was brokered to accommodate both Fahey and Lynn when former State Liberal Minister Ted Pickering had retired from State Parliament. The deal was for Lynn to fill Pickering's Legislative Council seat in return for giving up the Macarthur preselection for Fahey. Lynn accepted the deal and was appointed to the aforementioned casual vacancy in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 19 October 1995 following the resignation of Pickering on 10 October. Fahey went on to win Macarthur at the 1996 Federal election.
Lynn as an MLC first stood for election in his own right in the 1999 New South Wales election.  He was placed fourth on the joint Liberal/Nationals election ticket.  He was re-elected after receiving the ninth highest quota of votes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/states/nsw/nsw-1999-lc.txt|title=ELECTION OF 27 MARCH 1999|accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl]
