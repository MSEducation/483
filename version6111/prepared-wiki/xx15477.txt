Mead ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|d[/tpl]; archaic and dialectal "medd"; from Old English "meodu") is an alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water, and frequently fruits, spices, grains or hops.http://www.yourdictionary.com/meadBeer is produced by the fermentation of grain, but grain can be used in mead provided it is strained off immediately. As long as the primary substance fermented is still honey, the drink is still mead.[tpl]cite book|title=Rites of Odin|first=Edward|last=Fitch|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=1990 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kg8nObaAZMEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=9780875422244|page=290|location=St. Paul, Minnesota[/tpl]Hops are better known as the bitter ingredient of beer.

Mead is known from many sources of ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. "It can be regarded as the ancestor of all fermented drinks," Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat has speculated, "antedating the cultivation of the soil."Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat (Anthea Bell, tr.)

This is principally because the confirmed presence of beeswax or certain types of pollen ... is only indicative of the presence of honey (which could have been used for sweetening some other drink) - not necessarily of the production of mead. [/tpl] however McGovern and other archaeological chemists consider the presence of beeswax markers and gluconic acid, in the presence of other substances known to ferment, to be reasonably conclusive evidence of the use of honey in ancient fermented beverages.http://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GrogGreeks.pdfhttp://www.penn.museum/sites/Midas/feastremains.shtml
Claude Lévi-Strauss makes a case for the invention of mead as a marker of the passage "from nature to culture."Lévi-Strauss, J. and D. Weightman, tr. From Honey to Ashes, London:Cape 1973 (Du miel aux cendres, Paris 1960) Mead has played an important role in the beliefs and mythology of some peoples. One such example is the Mead of Poetry, a mead of Norse mythology crafted from the blood of the wise being Kvasir which turns the drinker into a poet or scholar.

==History==

In Asia, pottery vessels containing chemical signatures of a mixture of honey, rice and other fruits along with organic compounds of fermentation dating from 6500-7000 BCE were found in Northern China.[tpl]cite journal| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| title=Fermented beverages of pre- and proto-historic China | date=December 6, 2004 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/51/17593.abstract?sid=0111bfc3-e87b-411a-b12c-8d99d0efbfd9| pmid=15590771| doi=10.1073/pnas.0407921102| last1=McGovern| first1=P.

==Etymology==

The English word mead derives from the Old English meodu, from Proto-Germanic meduz, from Proto-Indo-European *médʰu (honey, fermented honey drink). Slavic med / miod , which means both "honey" and "mead", (Russian, Czech, Slovak, Serbian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian: med vs. medovina, Polish 'miód' pronounce mju:t - honey, mead)  and Baltic medus "honey"/midus "mead", also derive from the same Proto-Indo-European root (cf. Welsh medd, Old Irish mid, Sanskrit madhu, Sogdian Old Iranian language: muð, Avestan Old Iranian language: maðu, Classical Persian: مُل mul, Classical and New Persian: مِی mey).Online Etymology Dictionary entry for 'mead'

==Distribution==

Mead was also popular in Central Europe and in the Baltic states. In the Polish and Russian language mead is called [tpl]lang|pl|miód pitny[/tpl] ([tpl]IPAc-pl|'|m|i|ó|t|-|'|p|i|t|n|y[/tpl]), meaning "drinkable honey". 
Since the 19th century, in Russia, mead has remained popular in the drinks medovukha and sbiten long after its decline in the West. Sbiten is often mentioned in the works of 19th-century Russian writers, including Gogol, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. In Montenegro, medovina has been considered a healthy elixir and mentioned often in folk literature.
In Finland, a sweet mead called [tpl]lang|fi|sima[/tpl] (cognate with the root of zymurgy) is still an essential seasonal brew connected with the Finnish Vappu (May Day) festival. It is usually spiced by adding both the pulp and rind of a lemon. During secondary fermentation, raisins are added to control the amount of sugars and to act as an indicator of readiness for consumption; they will rise to the top of the bottle when the drink is ready. However, the sugar used in modern practice is typically brown sugar, not honey.http://elisa.net/uutiset/ruoka/?id=4104
Ethiopian mead is called tej (ጠጅ, [tpl]IPA-am|ˈtʼədʒ|[/tpl]) and is usually home-made. It is flavored with the powdered leaves and bark of gesho, a hop-like bittering agent which is a species of buckthorn.  A sweeter, less-alcoholic version called berz, aged for a shorter time, is also made.  The traditional vessel for drinking tej is a rounded vase-shaped container called a berele.
Mead known as iQhilika is traditionally prepared by the Xhosa of South Africa.
In the USA, mead is enjoying a resurgence, starting with small home meaderies and now with a number of small commercial meaderies. As mead becomes more widely available, it is seeing increased attention and exposure from the news media.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehlk45lii/mead/ | work=Forbes | first=Andrew | last=Bender[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mead-the-honey-based-brew-producing-a-real-buzz/ | work=CBS News[/tpl]

==Varieties==

Mead can have a wide range of flavors depending on the source of the honey, additives (also known as "adjuncts" or "gruit") including fruit and spices, the yeast employed during fermentation and the aging procedure.Eoghan Odinsson, Northern Lore, p. 160  Some producers have marketed white wine sweetened and flavored with honey after fermentation as mead, sometimes spelling it "meade." This is closer in style to a Hypocras. Blended varieties of mead may be known by the style represented; for instance, a mead made with cinnamon and apples may be referred to as either a cinnamon cyser or an apple metheglin.
A mead that also contains spices (such as cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg), or herbs (such as meadowsweet, hops, or even lavender or chamomile), is called a metheglin [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɨ|ˈ|θ|ɛ|ɡ|l|ɪ|n[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|last=Tayleur|first=W.H.T.|coauthors=Michael Spink|title=The Penguin Book of Home Brewing and Wine-Making|publisher=Penguin|year=1973|isbn=0-14-046190-6|page=292[/tpl]Aylett, Mary (1953). Country Wines, Odhams Press. p. 79
A mead that contains fruit (such as raspberry, blackberry or strawberry) is called a melomel,Tayleur, p. 291. which was also used as a means of food preservation, keeping summer produce for the winter. A mead that is fermented with grape juice is called a pyment.
Mulled mead is a popular drink at Christmas time, where mead is flavored with spices (and sometimes various fruits) and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it .[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Some meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some may even be considered as dessert wines.  Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads.
There are faux-meads, which are actually wines with honey added after fermentation as a sweetener and flavoring.http://www.gotmead.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=1094
Historically, meads were fermented with wild yeasts and bacteria (as noted in the recipe quoted above) residing on the skins of the fruit or within the honey itself. Wild yeasts can produce inconsistent results. Yeast companies have isolated strains of yeast which produce consistently appealing products. Brewers, winemakers and mead makers commonly use them for their fermentations. White Labs, WYeast and Vierka have released yeast strains identified specifically for mead fermentation. These are strains that have been selected because of their characteristic of preserving delicate honey flavors and aromas.
Mead can also be distilled to a brandy or liqueur strength. A version called "honey jack" can be made by partly freezing a quantity of mead and straining the ice out of the liquid (a process known as freeze distillation), in the same way that applejack is made from cider.

==In literature==

Mead is featured in many Germanic myths and folktales such as Beowulf, as well as in other popular works that draw on these myths. Notable examples include books by Tolkien, George R. R. Martin and Neil Gaiman. It is often featured in books using a historical Germanic setting and in writings about the Viking era. Mead is mentioned many times in Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, American Gods; it is referred to as the drink of the gods. Also, in the books of the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini, it is often drunk by Eragon Shadeslayer at feasts in honor of him. Mead is also referenced in The Kingkiller Chronicle novel series by Patrick Rothfuss. The protagonist Kvothe is known to drink metheglin. The non-existent "Greysdale Mead" is also drunk, although it is merely water.
