Response to Celebration has ranged from an early visitor who said it resembled the too-perfect town of "The Stepford Wives," to those who see Celebration as an example of new urbanism with its safe, walkable community.[tpl]cite news  | title = Town-Building Is No Mickey Mouse Operation| publisher = The New York Times, Michael Pollan, December 14, 1997| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/magazine/town-building-is-no-mickey-mouse-operation.html?scp=10&sq=celebration%20florida%20disney&st=cse | date=December 14, 1997[/tpl]

DDC executives collaborated extensively with leaders in education, health and technology in addition to planners and architects to create the vision and operating policies for the town.

The Celebration Hotel hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during training camp until the 2009 season when the team moved training camp back to Tampa Bay. In autumn, leaf-shaped confetti shoots out of the lamp posts on Market Street to simulate falling leaves. During the holiday season, suds pour out of the lamp posts to replicate snow while Christmas music streams from the sidewalks.
There is a water fountain that comes out from the ground for children to play in located next to the lake, surrounded by palm trees and benches.

===Commerce===

The community started with a small number of merchants that the Disney Company selected.  There are now more than five hundred registered companies"Sunbiz.org" Division of Corporations – Florida Department of State listed as doing business in the shopping plazas, small office complexes, and the Disney World office building park.  This community does hold the only Class A office buildings in Osceola County.  There is a high number of home businesses.

===Villages===

Celebration is separated into areas referred to as "villages." The main village, closest to downtown, is where the first homes were constructed. North Village, closest to U.S. 192, houses the Georgetown Condos as well as Acadia Estate Homes. East Village includes Roseville Corner and Aquila Loop. Lake Evalyn, generally considered its own area of Celebration but not quite its own village, includes a small lake where one can find a multitude of ducks, alligators, and the occasional river otter. South Village houses the Spring Park Loop estate homes and Heritage Hall. Additionally, Siena Condos complete the outer edge of South Village by Celebration Blvd. Mirasol includes condos with concierge service and a day spa. Artisan Park is at the end of Celebration Ave and houses condos, town homes, single-family residences as well as a clubhouse consisting of a pool, gym, and restaurant.
Homes and condominiums are constructed along streets, with garages  and garbage pickup done in narrow but paved alleyways behind the homes, keeping the look of home fronts and sidewalks pristine. Utility service is underground.

===Transportation===

91% of residents who work outside their homes drive to work.Glaeser, Edward. Triumph of the City. Penguin Books, 2011, p. 215.
Most residents do not often drive long distances and there is a high amount of smart cars or low-speed vehicles to travel around the town.
Contrary to its design as a quintessential American town, Celebration does not have any road named Main Street. This is because there was already a Main Street in Osceola County, and street names cannot be duplicated in the county. The two main roads going through the center of the downtown area are named Market Street and Front Street. Other streets in Celebration include:
This is considered the main road in the town. The road stretches from U.S. 192 to Artisan Park where it ends in a traffic circle. Starting from U.S. 192 near the Disney Parks and the Celebration water tower, you can find a small shopping plaza. From there, Celebration Avenue passes the North Village, splits the Celebration golf course, winds through a few down-town shops and schools, and then proceeds into the parks and homes in the newer sections of Celebration.
Celebration Boulevard has two sections. The most public section is an avenue parallel to I-4 that includes many commercial businesses and Celebration High School. The architecture on the street is mostly Celebration Modern style. This style reflects art Streamline Moderne and  Art Deco influences with its sleek lines, sparse but effective ornamentation, and ample opportunities for individually expressive special features. The entire street is lined with two rows of Washington Palms. The buildings on the street include sitting areas under the shade of trees and trellises along their frontage. The other section of Celebration Boulevard lies on the other side of the golf course, closer to the Celebration Water Tower in the North Village. Here, Celebration Boulevard is almost completely residential. In addition to the homes perched behind white picket fences, this section of Celebration Boulevard flows past the Georgetown condominiums, the community pool, and soccer fields.
Celebration Place nearly spans the gap between the two sections of Celebration Boulevard, except that its eastern end terminates at the Water Tower Plaza instead of at the entrance to North Village on the other side of State Road 417. Celebration Place is a commercial road.

===Health===

The community is home to a 174-bed hospital operated by Florida Hospital that resembles a resort-style facility. Celebration Health has been recently expanded, and also houses a gym, the Fitness Centre. College Gameday host Lee Corso's brother Ralph Corso is a trainer at the fitness centre.

===Events===

Celebration hosts many events every year, including community-wide yard sales, an art show, an exotic car festival, an annual Radio Disney Holiday concert, an Oktoberfest Celebration, the "Great American Pie Festival" (televised on The Food Network)
