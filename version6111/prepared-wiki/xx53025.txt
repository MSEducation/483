=====Sixth Circuit=====

All four states under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit have a same-sex marriage case currently under appeal in that court:
Each case is currently being briefed before the court. The briefing schedule for DeBoer v. Snyder, Bourke v. Beshear, and Tanko v. Haslam all mirror each other, with each respective state's final brief due June 26, 2014. Obergefell v. Himes follows a slightly earlier schedule, with the last brief due May 30, 2014. Michigan officials want all sixteen (16) judges on the Sixth Circuit (as opposed to a random three-judge panel, the standard procedure) to initially hear its case, DeBoer. If such hearing en banc is granted, any ruling issued would be binding on the entire Sixth Circuit and take precedence over the other same-sex marriage cases pending in the circuit.[tpl]cite web|last=Borowski|first=Cheryl (Case Manager)|title=Letter Outlining Briefing Schedule, Obergefell v.
