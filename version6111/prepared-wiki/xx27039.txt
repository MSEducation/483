CATEGORIES: Demographics of Argentina

This article is about the demographic features of Argentina, including population density, ethnicity, economic status and other aspects of the population.
In the [tpl]census-ar|2001[/tpl], Argentina had a population of 36,260,130 inhabitants, and preliminary results from the [tpl]census-ar|2010[/tpl] census were of 40,091,359 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/proyecciones_provinciales_vol31.pdf |title= Proyecciones provinciales de población por sexo y grupos de edad 2001–2015 |accessdate= 2008-06-24 |work= Gustavo Pérez |format= pdf |publisher= INDEC |page= 16 |language= español[/tpl]Censo 2010: Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Argentina ranks third in South America in total population and 33rd globally. Population density is of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area, well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2008 was estimated to be 0.92% annually, with a birth rate of 16.32 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.54 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.
The proportion of people under 15, at 24.6%, is somewhat below the world average (28%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 10.8%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 7%.
Argentina's population has long had one of Latin America's lowest birth rates and population growth rates (recently, about 1% a year), but it enjoys a comparatively low infant mortality rate. The median age is approximately 30 years and life expectancy at birth is of 76 years. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension) and 9.3% speak Portuguese.Página/12, 27 December 2006.

==Population==

According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 40,412,000 in 2010, compared to only 17,150,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 24.9%, 64.5% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 10.6% was 65 years or older

==Cities==

Argentina is highly urbanized, with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1484|title=Major Cities|publisher=Government of Argentina|accessdate=2009-09-03[/tpl] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each, and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[tpl]cite web|url=http://turismo.municipalidad-salta.gov.ar:8081/ubicacion.aspx|title=Ubicacion|publisher=Directorate-General of Tourism, Municipality of the City of Salta|accessdate=2009-09-03[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] have at least half a million people each.
The population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with about 60% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in Buenos Aires Province, and 3 million each in Córdoba Province, Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Seven other provinces each have about one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Entre Ríos, Salta, Chaco, Corrientes and Misiones. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 60 inhabitants/km², the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has less than 1 inhabitant/km².
In the mid 19th century a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually became the second country in the world that received the most immigrants, with 6.6 millions, second only to the USA with 27 millions, and ahead of such immigration receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.http://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdfhttp://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf
Most of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.Rock, David. Argentina, 1516–1982. University of California Press, 1987. Urban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered around a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a damero, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street illumination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edelap.com.ar/120/llego.htm |title=EDELAP – 120 años de alumbrado público |publisher=Edelap.com.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]

==Vital statistics==

The table below gives an overview of the number of birth and deaths in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to construct the table.B.R. Mitchell. International historical statistics: the Americas, 1750-2000.http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001 United nations. Demographic Yearbookshttp://www.indec.mecon.ar/default.htm Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos The number of births in 2010 (756,176) was the highest number ever recorded. The number of deaths in 2010 also was the highest ever record. However, as the population of Argentina showed a sixfold increase during the past century, the birth and death rates in 2010 (18.7 and 7.9, respectively) were rather low in a histolorical perspective.

===UN estimates===

The Population Departement of the United Nations prepared the following estimates of vital statistics of Argentina.

==Ethnic groups==

===Indigenous peoples===

According to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004 - 2005, 600,000 indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Tobas, who live mostly in the northeast.INDEC
The officially recognized indigenous population in the country, according to the 2004–05 "Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples", stands at approximately 600,000 (around 1.4% of the total population), the most numerous of whom are the Mapuche people.

===Immigration to Argentina===

====European settlement====

As with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, New Zealand and Uruguay, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669|title=About Argentina|publisher=Government of Argentina|accessdate=2009-09-01[/tpl] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.
Most Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th and 20th century immigrants from Europe. An estimated 8% of the population is Mestizo, and a further 4% of Argentines are of Arab (in Argentina the Arab ethnicity is considered among the White people, just like in the USA Census) or Asian heritage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Argentina.html|title=Argentina|publisher=World Statesmen.org|author=Ben Cahoon[/tpl] In the last national census, based on self-identification, 600,000 Argentines (1.6% of the population) declared to be Amerindians[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|publisher=National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina|title=Encuesta Complementaria de Pueblos Indígenas 2004–2005[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.
The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuana, Estonia, Latvia and several other regions.
Italian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.feditalia.org.ar/arg/federaciones/feditalia_org_fed_regionales.html |title=Federaciones Regionales |publisher=Feditalia.org.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
Many Argentines have the gentilic of an Italian city, place, street or occupation of the immigrant as last name, many of them were not necessarily born Italians, but once they did the roles of immigration in Italy the name usually changed. Spanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdtradition.net/historical-references.php |title=Historical references |publisher=Cdtradition.net |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos14/gallegos/gallegos.shtml |title=Monografías |publisher=Monografias.com |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
Millions of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite news|last=Chavez |first=Lydia |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/travel/fare-of-the-country-teatime-a-bit-of-britain-in-argentina.html?sec=travel |title=New York Times: A bit of Britain in Argentina |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1985-06-23 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as Y Wladfa, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[tpl]cite book | editor= Diarmuid Ó Néill (ed.) | first=Paul W. |last=Birt | year=2005 | title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages | publisher=Y Lolfa | location=Talybont | page=146 | chapter=Welsh (in Argentina) | isbn=0-86243-723-7[/tpl] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[tpl]cite web|title=Wales and Argentina|url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/english/wales_and_argentina/wales_and_argentina.aspx |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|year=2008 |accessdate=24 December 2010 |work=Wales.com website [/tpl] The community is centered around the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cfQRcvqSW7UC&pg=PA176&dq=%22Y+Wladfa%22&hl=en&ei=JHnxTKLJNaqqhAfrj8GDDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Y%20Wladfa%22&f=false| first=Peter |last=Berresford Ellis |authorlink=Peter Berresford Ellis |year=1983 | title=The Celtic revolution: a study in anti-imperialism | publisher=Y Lolfa |location=Talybont | pages=175–178 |isbn=0-86243-096-8[/tpl]

====Recent immigrants====

According to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.Tendencias recientes de la inmigración internacional INDECInvestigación de la Migración Internacional en Latinoamérica (IMILA) Centro Latinoamericano y Caribeño de Demografía (CELADE). Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL). In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2001 INDEC.[tpl]cite press release |title=Cuadro P6.

Illegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and   Ecuador. 
The Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called Patria Grande ("Greater Homeland")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.patriagrande.gov.ar |title=Patria Grande |publisher=Patriagrande.gov.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2007/07/21/noticia_0035.html |title=Alientan la mudanza de extranjeros hacia el interior – Sociedad – |publisher=Perfil.com |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]

==Languages==

The official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] The most common accent of Castilian in Argentina is Rioplatense Spanish, and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú for the second person singular.

===Non-indigenous minority languages===

Many Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, Portuguese, French, Welsh, German, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.[tpl]CIA World Factbook link|ar|Argentina[/tpl]
English language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).
Standard German is spoken by around 500,000Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: Languages of Argentina, Retrieved on 2007-01-02.WorldLanguage website. Retrieved on 2007-01-29 Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources."Rápida recuperación económica tras la grave crisis" German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.
There are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina, as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.
There is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AR |title=Language of Argentina |accessdate=2008-08-21 |author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International |quote=Welsh (25,000) [/tpl] in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.

==Religion==

The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but until 1994 the President and Vice President had to be Catholic. The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.
Estimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,Marita Carballo. Valores good food here al cambio del milenio ISBN 950-794-064-2. Cited in La Nación, 8 May 2005 to as much as 90%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71446.htm|title=Argentina|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=U.S. Department of State|year=2006|accessdate=2009-09-01[/tpl] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service., the Jewish population is about 300,000(around 2% of the population). The community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2003/12/22/i-03001.htm |title=Clarín |publisher=Clarin.com |date=2003-12-22 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A recent study found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/08/27/um/encuesta1.pdf |title=Encuesta CONICET sobre creencias|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
