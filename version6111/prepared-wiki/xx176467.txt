==History==

Kalashnikovo was first mentioned in 1779 as a village belonging to the selo of Yegoryevskoye. At the time, it belonged to Novotorzhsky Uyezd of Tver Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed to Tver Governorate. The village has grown considerably after the railway construction was completed in 1851, and even more after the glass factory has been constructed in 1886—1887.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kalashnikovo.ru/history/2010/05/08/istoriya-poselka-kalashnikovo/|title=История поселка Калашниково|publisher= Kalashnikovo.ru|language=Russian|date=May 8, 2010|accessdate=April 2, 2014[/tpl] In 1918, the factory was nationalized.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kalashnikovo.ru/history/2010/05/08/istoricheskie-daty/|title=Исторические даты|publisher= Kalashnikovo.ru|language=Russian|date=May 8, 2010|accessdate=April 2, 2014[/tpl]
On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Likhoslavlsky District, with the administrative center in Likhoslavl, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=225&sid=767186|title=Справка об изменениях в административно-территориальном делении Тверской губернии - Калининской области|publisher=Архивы России|language=Russian|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] In 1932, Kalashnikovo was granted urban-type settlement status. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Likhoslavlsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. On July 9, 1937 Likhoslavlsky District was included into Karelian National Okrug, which was established as a Tver Karelians autonomy. On February 7, 1939 the okrug was abolished. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Likhoslavlsky District was merged into Torzhoksky District, but on March 4, 1964 it was re-established.
