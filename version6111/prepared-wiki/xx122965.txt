Stephen David James "Steve" Torpey (born 8 December 1970) is an English former footballer who played as a striker. He is currently York City's assistant manager.

==Playing career==

Born in Islington, London, Torpey had played for a number of clubs, before signing for Scunthorpe United from Bristol City in February 2000. He was Scunthorpe's record transfer signing, costing £175,000. Torpey broke the ten goal barrier in each of his first five seasons at Scunthorpe and represented the club over 250 times.
He was released at the end of the 2006–07 season, after only playing a small part in the club's promotion to the Championship. He subsequently signed for League Two side Lincoln City on a one-year contract on 27 June 2007, but was loaned out to Conference Premier side Farsley Celtic on 20 November until 7 January 2008. He was released by Lincoln on this date and joined Farsley on a permanent contract. He later joined the backroom staff at the club. He found himself consigned to the bench at the start of the 2008–09 season and, after making just two substitute appearances, moved on to North Ferriby United of the Northern Premier League Premier Division. He made his Ferriby debut as a substitute in a 2–1 home defeat to Kendal Town on 6 September 2008. With Ferriby he made 23 appearances and scored five goals in all competitions.

==Coaching career==

Torpey was appointed as youth team coach at York City on 15 December 2008 on a part-time basis, as this would allow him to continue training apprentices at Hull City. He offered his services as a player for York in April 2009 and he came on as a 79th minute substitute in a 1–0 victory over Eastbourne Borough on 18 April. He started the last game of the Conference Premier season, a 1–1 draw at Lewes on 26 April 2009, which was his last appearance as a player. He resumed his playing career after being registered by York on 3 September 2010. Following Martin Foyle's resignation on 24 September 2010 Torpey took over as assistant to caretaker manager Andy Porter before becoming player-caretaker manager on 8 October following Porter's departure. His first and only game in charge came the following day with a 4–0 defeat away at Newport County and his tenure ended on 13 October 2010 when Tamworth manager Gary Mills was appointed. After Nigel Worthington was appointed manager, Torpey was given the position of first-team coach on 5 March 2013, and after Worthington signed a new contract as manager on 3 May, Torpey was promoted to the position of assistant manager.
