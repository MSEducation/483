Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since the 1967,[tpl]cite book | last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | page =47 | isbn=1-74059-154-2[/tpl] Indonesia's population is projected to surpass USA and become the biggest after China and India by 2043. For the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. Some say family planning should be revitalized based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country, but this aim has faced a hurdle of religiously-based opinion that to follow family planning is equivalent to not being grateful to God.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/indonesia-facing-populace-larger-than-us-revives-birth-control/ |title=Indonesia Facing Populace Larger Than US Revives Birth Control |date=January 28, 2014[/tpl]
