Dormammu returns, now in a symbiotic link with Umar due to their previous merged state.  Together they petition the "Pan-dimensional Oversight Council" (counting Strange and Nightmare among its members) to perform a preemptive strike against Earth's superhumans, as "potential weapons of mass-destruction", and when the petition fails, Dormammu eats most of the present council-members, whereas Umar reduces the rest to "screaming blobs of mindless jelly".  The siblings then attack and overcome an avatar of the entity Eternity and use the acquired power to remake the universe in their image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of some of the original Defenders (Strange; the Hulk; and Namor the Sub-Mariner), with Dormammu retreating when Umar steals his power. The character also appears briefly during a storyline in which Strange contemplates his past.
Acting in secrecy, Dormammu empowers criminal mastermind the Hood, who in turn resurrects several dead supervillains and forms a crime army. When the Hood asks for information about his "benefactor" from the demoness Satana, she claims that Dormammu disposed of his sister off-page.Dark Reign: The Hood #3 (2009)
The character temporarily takes control of the "zombie" virus that decimates Earth-2149, and also takes advantage of the fact that Strange loses the title of Sorcerer Supreme, but the latter eventually exorcises his influence from the Hood together with Daimon Hellstrom and Doctor Voodoo.

===2010s===

Dormammu briefly appears when the newly appointed "Sorcerer Supreme" Doctor Voodoo enters his domain. The villain dismisses Voodoo as an "unworthy" opponent and refers to his vastly inferior "gutter gods". This, however, causes Voodoo to strengthen the seals to the entity's realm. The character also appears as one of the prospective "suitors" (holders of a slave-contract) for the hand of Satana.Deadpool Team-Up #892 (2010)
During the Fear Itself storyline, Dormammu attended the Devil's Advocacy where they talked about the threat of the Serpent on Earth.Journey Into Mystery #627
Dormammu appears in Uncanny X-Men. After Illyana Rasputin is pulled into Limbo it is revealed that Dormammu is responsible for taking over the realm.Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #5 Inexplicably far weaker than previous portrayals as a cosmic threat, Dormammu is apparently killed by Illyana off-page.Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #6

==Character==

Dormammu has been described as "something worse than a demon". It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien, conventional-laws-of-physics-defying realm separate from the regular Marvel Universe, and certain similar beings, such as the Dweller-in-Darkness are known to predate it. He is known to well precede the creation of the current demonic netherworlds; to have clashed with Agamotto hundreds of millions of years ago, to have served as the primary enemy of the Vishanti ever since, and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of "pre-cataclysm" Atlantis.
Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of "the Faltine", fictional higher-dimensional mystical energy beings. Not native to the "Dark Dimension", Dormammu and "his" sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor "Sinifer" (and what was considered a morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter), whereupon they journeyed there in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms.Doctor Strange vol.3, #22 (October 1990) Dormammu merged with the local "Flames of Regency" to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure. After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable Mindless Ones behind a barrier Dormammu enslaved the entire realm to be worshipped as its sole deity, and continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.Dr. Strange vol.2 #72
The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years, whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity. However, although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments, and has a tendency to indulge, and brag to, technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off.Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural #1 (2010) 
What makes Dormammu different from other prominent Marvel supervillains with similar aims, is that he has been shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities, even without external power sources and outside of the "Dark Dimension".
Dormammu and his sister (originally genderless siblings) Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes being loyal and collaborating, and other times gladly betraying and taking the other's power for themselves. Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother's obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism. 
Writer Keith Giffen has described them as "Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions." Whereas Dormammu himself is "completely inhuman",[tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=37585 |title=Giffen & Dematteis Talk Defenders And A Little Bit Of Everything |publisher=Google.se |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12[/tpl] the kind of character that "commits mass murder... on a whim".[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=34406 |title=Defending Drax With Keith Giffen |publisher=Google.se |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12[/tpl]

==Powers and abilities==

Presented as one of the most powerful known mystical entities within the Marvel Universe, Doctor Strange refers to Dormammu as his "most terrible foe"; a threat to "the life of the universe itself", that "at full power no one could stand against."
The character is an interdimensional entity composed of mystical energy that can be used to achieve almost any effect he desires, including: energy projection; matter transmutation; size shifting and teleportation; body possession; resurrection of the dead; bestowing of power; and creating demon lords.[ref]The individual powers list as examples are from:
