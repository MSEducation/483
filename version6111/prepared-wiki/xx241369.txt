==World War I==

Ponder joined the French air service in the fall of 1917. He was originally assigned to Escadrille SPA 67, then Escadrille SPA 163.[tpl]cite book |title=American Aces of World War 1 |page= [/tpl] While with this unit, he used a Spad to down three German planes between 28 May and 11 August 1918; one of these victories was shared with Thomas Cassady.

==Between the World Wars==

Like many pilots of his day, in ideological dispute with prohibition, Ponder once flew beer in from Mexico into Texas in May 1932, in violation of prohibition - a feat which earned him added hero bonus points, especially from servicemen dying in hospitals who were in need of a last beverage of their choice.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/ponder.php Retrieved 8 April 2010.

==World War II and beyond==

Ponder worked for Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation in Fort Worth. He then founded the Ponder Aircraft Sales Company. He was on a sales trip for his company when he died of a heart attack in a hotel room in Amarillo on 27 February 1947.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/ponder.php Retrieved 8 April 2010.[tpl]cite book |title=American Aces of World War 1 |page= [/tpl]
