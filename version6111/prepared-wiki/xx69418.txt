Since the arrival of commercial television, SVT's combined viewing sharehas declined steadily and digital channels have also provided competition. The commercial TV4 became the most watched station in 1995 and maintained its position until 2002, when SVT1 regained the status. TV4 became the most watched channel again 2006.
The combined viewing share of the SVT channels declined from 50% in 1997 to 40% in 2005. However, SVT remains the most watched network in Sweden with a share of 38.3% in 2006, although all three major commercial channels attract a higher share of 15-24 year-olds than the two SVT channels combined.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mms.se/arsrapp/%C5rsrapport%202006.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ã…rsrapport 2006 |publisher= Mms.se |date= |accessdate= [/tpl]
