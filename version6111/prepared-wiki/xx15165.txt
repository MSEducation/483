The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance aircraft. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. In role and operational design, the Global Hawk is similar to the Lockheed U-2. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and long-range electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as [tpl]convert|40000|sqmi|sqkm|-4[/tpl] of terrain a day.
The Global Hawk is operated by the United States Air Force and U.S. Navy. It is used as a high-altitude platform for surveillance and security. Missions for the Global Hawk cover the spectrum of intelligence collection capability to support forces in worldwide military operations. According to the United States Air Force, the superior surveillance capabilities of the aircraft allow more precise weapons targeting and better protection of friendly forces. Cost overruns have led to the original plan to acquire 63 aircraft being cut to 45, and to a 2013 proposal to mothball the 21 Block 30 signal-intelligence variants. Each aircraft was to cost US$35 million in 2005,"$143M for Global Hawk Cost Overruns". Defense Industry Daily, 25 April 2005. but this had risen to $222.7M per aircraft (including development costs) by 2013. The U.S. Navy has developed the Global Hawk into the MQ-4C Triton version for maritime surveillance.

==Development==

===Origins===

The Global Hawk took its first flight on 28 February 1998.
The first seven aircraft were built under the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, sponsored by DARPA, in order to evaluate the design and demonstrate its capabilities. Demand for the RQ-4's abilities was high in the Middle East; thus, the prototype aircraft were actively operated by the U.S. Air Force in the War in Afghanistan. In an unusual move, the aircraft entered initial low-rate production while still in engineering and manufacturing development. Nine production Block 10 aircraft, sometimes referred to as RQ-4A, were produced; of these, two were sold to the US Navy and an additional two were deployed to Iraq to support operations there. The final Block 10 aircraft was delivered on 26 June 2006."Last Block 10 Global Hawk Arrives For Check Flights"."
In order to increase the aircraft's capabilities, the airframe was redesigned, with the nose section and wings being stretched. The modified aircraft, designated RQ-4B Block 20,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=13225 |title= RQ-4 Global Hawk fact sheet |publisher=US Air Force |date= 27 January 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012|archiveurl=http://archive.is/7V1r|archivedate=12 December 2012[/tpl] allow it to carry up to 3,000 lb of internal payload. These changes were introduced with the first Block 20 aircraft, the 17th Global Hawk produced, which was rolled out in a ceremony on 25 August 2006."Northrop unveils next generation Global Hawk", Aerotech News and Review, 1 September 2006. First flight of the Block 20 from the USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California to Edwards Air Force Base took place on 1 March 2007. Developmental testing of Block 20 took place in 2008.McGee, Chris, "Global Hawk in demand, passes 10,000 flight hours milestone", Aerotech News and Review, 11 August 2006.

===United States Navy version===

The United States Navy took delivery of two of the Block 10 aircraft to be used to evaluate maritime surveillance capabilities, designated N-1 (BuNo 166509) and N-2 (BuNo 166510).Northrop Grumman Press Release, 13 June 2005. The initial example was tested in a naval configuration at Edwards Air Force Base for several months, later ferrying to NAS Patuxent River on 28 March 2006 to begin the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program. Navy squadron VX-20 was tasked with operating the GHMD system.Selinger, M. "U.S. Navy To Receive First Global Hawk Next Week." Aviation Week & Space Technology. 1 October 2004.First Unmanned Global Hawk Delivered to U.S. Navy[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]U.S. Department of Defense Transformation News Story
The GHMD aircraft flew in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise for the first time in July 2006. Although RIMPAC operations were in the vicinity of Hawaii, the aircraft was operated from Edwards, requiring flights of approximately [tpl]convert|2500|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] each way to the operations area. Four flights were performed, resulting in over 24 hours of persistent maritime surveillance coordinated with [tpl]USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|2[/tpl] and [tpl]USS|Bonhomme Richard|LHD-6|2[/tpl]. As a part of the demonstration program, Global Hawk was tasked with maintenance of maritime situational awareness, contact tracking, and imagery support of various exercise operations. In operation, images from Global Hawks were transmitted to NAS Patuxent River for processing before being forwarded to the fleet operations off Hawaii."Navy Global Hawk Performs in RIMPAC", Aerotech News and Review, 18 August 2006.
Northrop Grumman entered a version of the RQ-4B in the US Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV contract competition. On 22 April 2008, the announcement was made that the Northrop Grumman RQ-4N had won the bid, with the Navy awarding a contract worth US$1.16 billion.Navy Awards Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aircraft System Contract In September 2010, the RQ-4N was officially designated the MQ-4C.BAMS given MQ-4C designation
On 11 June 2012, a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk crashed near Salisbury, Maryland, during a training flight from Naval Air Station Patuxent River."Navy drone crashes in Maryland""Investigators Look Into BAMS-D Loss""Navy UAV crashes in Md.; no injuries reported"
The Navy MQ-4C differs from the Air Force RQ-4 mainly in its wing. While the Global Hawk remains at high altitude to conduct surveillance, the Triton climbs to 50,000 ft to see a wide area and can drop to 10,000 ft to get further identification of a target. The Triton's wings are specially designed to take the stresses of rapidly decreasing altitude. Though similar in appearance to the Global Hawk's wings, the Triton's internal wing structure is much stronger and has additional features including anti-icing capabilities and impact and lightning strike protection.Triton Testing Ahead of Schedule - News.USNI.org, 21 February 2014

===Cost increases and procurement===

Program development cost overruns had put the Global Hawk system at risk of cancellation. Per-unit costs in mid-2006 were 25% over baseline estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies as well as increase the system's capabilities. This caused some concerns about a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified."Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk"[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Flight International, 18 April 2006."Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk", SBAC.com However, in June 2006, the Global Hawk program was restructured. Completion of an operational assessment report by the Air Force was delayed from August 2005-November 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays. The operational assessment report was released in March 2007 and production of the 54 air vehicles planned has been extended by two years to 2015.http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/11/21/Navigation/196/210621/Global+Hawk+costs+soar+to+%2410bn.html[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] Flight International, 21 November 2006.
In February 2011, the Air Force reduced its planned purchase of RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft from 22 to 11 in order to cut costs.Putrich, Gayle. "Northrop: Global Hawk not slowing down even with cuts". Flight International, 22 February 2011. In June 2011, the U.S. Defense Department's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) found the RQ-4B "not operationally effective" for its mission due to reliability issues."Pentagon Says Northrop Drone Isn’t ‘Effective’." Bloomberg News, 6 June 2011.
In June 2011, the Global Hawk was certified by the Secretary of Defense as critical to national security following a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy Amendment; the Secretary stated: "The Global Hawk is essential to national security; there are no alternatives to Global Hawk which provide acceptable capability at less cost; Global Hawk costs $220M less per year than the U-2 to operate on a comparable mission; the U-2 cannot simultaneously carry the same sensors as the Global Hawk; and if funding must be reduced, Global Hawk has a higher priority over other programs.""Nunn-McCurdy Certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum for the Restructured RQ-4A/B Unmanned Aircraft System Global Hawk." Memorandum for Secretary of the Air Force, 14 June 2011.
On 26 January 2012, the Pentagon announced plans to end Global Hawk Block 30 procurement as the type was found to be more expensive to operate and with less capable sensors than the existing U-2."Defense Budget Priorities and Choices", p. 11. US DoD, January 2012.Clark, Colin. "Air Force To Cut 10,000; Global Hawks Get Warehoused." Aol Defense, 27 January 2012.

From 2010-2013, costs of flying the Global Hawk fell by more than 50%. In 2010, the cost per flight hour was $40,600. Contractor logistic support, which accounts for much of the overall per flight hour cost, was $25,000 per flight hour. By mid-2013, cost per flight hour dropped to $18,900, with contractor logistic support dropping to $11,000 per flight hour. Cost was driven down in part by higher usage, which meant logistics and support costs were spread over a higher number of flight hours.Cost of flying Northrop’s Global Hawk down over 50% sources - sUASNews.com, 14 September 2013

===EuroHawk===

The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ordered a variant of the RQ-4B, to be equipped with a customized sensor suite, designated EuroHawk. The aircraft was based on the RQ-4B Block 20/30/40 and was to be equipped with an EADS-built SIGINT package; it was intended to fulfill Germany's requirement to replace their aging Dassault-Breguet Atlantique electronic surveillance aircraft of the German Navy (Deutsche Marine). The EADS sensor package is composed of six wing-mounted pods;[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/euro-hawk-program-cleared-for-takeoff-03051/ |title=RQ-4 Euro Hawk UAV Readying for Takeoff |date= 15 May 2013 |work=Defense Industry Daily[/tpl] reportedly these sensor pods could potentially be used on other platforms, including manned aircraft.
The EuroHawk was officially rolled out on 8 October 2009 and its first flight took place on 29 June 2010.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=195403 |title=Northrop Grumman and EADS Defence & Security's Euro Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Completes Successful First Flight |date=30 June 2010 |agency=GlobeNewswire[/tpl] It underwent several months of flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base.[tpl]Cite news |last=Norris |first=Guy |title=Northrop Grumman Unveils Euro Hawk |work=Aerospace Daily and Defense Report |date=12 October 2009[/tpl] On 21 July 2011, the first EuroHawk arrived in Manching, Germany; after which it was scheduled to receive its SIGINT sensor package and undergo further testing and pilot training until the first quarter of 2012.

==Design==

===Overview===

The Global Hawk UAV system comprises the RQ-4 air vehicle, which is outfitted with various equipment such as sensor packages and communication systems; and a ground element consisting of a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and a Mission Control Element (MCE) with ground communications equipment.http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/globalhawk_gs/ Each RQ-4 air vehicle is powered by an Allison Rolls-Royce AE3007H turbofan engine with [tpl]convert|7,050|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] thrust, and carries a payload of [tpl]convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=off[/tpl]. The fuselage comprises an aluminum, semi-monocoque construction; the wings are made of lightweight high-strength composite materials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.as.northropgrumman.com/products/ghrq4b/index.html|accessdate=2010-08-16 |title=RQ-4 Block 20 Global Hawk[/tpl]

===System and ground facilities===

The Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) is provided by Raytheon and consists of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electro-optical (EO), and infrared (IR) sensors. Either the EO or the IR sensors can operate simultaneously with the SAR. Each of the sensors provides wide area search imagery and a high-resolution spot mode. The SAR has a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) mode, which can provide a text message providing the moving target's position and velocity. Both SAR and EO/IR imagery are transmitted from the aircraft to the MCE as individual frames, and reassembled during ground processing. An onboard inertial navigation system, supplemented by Global Positioning System updates, comprises the aircraft's onboard navigational suite. Global Hawk is intended to operate autonomously and "untethered" using a satellite data link (either Ku or UHF) for sending data from the aircraft to the MCE. The common data link can also be used for direct down link of imagery when the UAV is operating within line-of-sight of compatible ground stations.
The ground segment consists of a Mission Control Element (MCE) and Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), provided by Raytheon. The MCE is used for mission planning, command and control, and image processing and dissemination; an LRE for controlling launch and recovery; and associated ground support equipment. (The LRE provides precision differential global positioning system corrections for navigational accuracy during takeoff and landings, while precision coded GPS supplemented with an inertial navigation system is used during mission execution.) By having separable elements in the ground segment, the MCE and the LRE can operate in geographically separate locations, and the MCE can be deployed with the supported command's primary exploitation site. Both ground segments are contained in military shelters with external antennas for line-of-sight and satellite communications with the air vehicles.

===Sensor packages===

The Global Hawk carries the Hughes Integrated Surveillance & Reconnaissance (HISAR) sensor system."Hughes Integrated Surveillance & Reconnaissance (HISAR)". Jane's Information Group HISAR is a lower-cost derivative of the ASARS-2 package that Hughes developed for the Lockheed U-2. HISAR is also fitted in the US Army's RC-7B Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARLM) manned surveillance aircraft, and is being sold on the international market. HISAR integrates a SAR-MTI system, along with an optical and an infrared imager. All three sensors are controlled and their outputs filtered by a common processor and transmitted in real time at up to 50 Mbit/s to a ground station.
The SAR-MTI system operates in the X-band and provides a number of operational modes; such as the wide-area MTI mode with a radius of [tpl]convert|62|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl], combined SAR-MTI strip mode provides [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] resolution over [tpl]convert|23|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] wide sections, and a SAR spot mode providing [tpl]convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] resolution over [tpl]convert|3.8|mi2|km2|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl].
The visible and infrared imagers share the same gimballed sensor package, and use common optics, providing a telescopic close-up capability. It can be optionally fitted with an auxiliary SIGINT package. To improve survivability, the Global Hawk is fitted with a Raytheon developed AN/ALR-89 self-protection suite consisting of the AN/AVR-3 Laser Warning System, AN/APR-49 Radar Warning Receiver and a jamming system. An ALE-50 towed decoy also aids in the Global Hawk's deception of enemy air defenses.Aerotech News and Review, vol 21, issue 27, August 4, 2006AN/ALQ to AN/ALT – Equipment Listing
In July 2006, the US Air Force began testing the Global Hawk Block 30 upgrades in the Benefield Anechoic Facility at Edwards AFB; such as the Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload, an extremely sensitive SIGINT processor. In 2006, a specialist radar system, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, or MP-RTIP, began testing on the Scaled Composites Proteus; one modified Global Hawk shall carry the radar following validation. In 2010, Northrop spoke on the sensor capabilities of the new Block 40 aircraft, including MP-RTIP radar, emphasising surveillance over reconnaissance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/16/346116/next-generation-of-global-hawks-ready-to-roll.html |accessdate=2010-08-16 |title=Next generation of Global Hawks ready to roll [/tpl]
On 14 April 2014, a Block 40 Global Hawk completed the first Maritime Modes program risk reduction flight to enhance the Air Force's maritime surveillance capabilities.  The flight took place off the California coast and lasted for 11.5 hours.  Maritime Modes is made up of a Maritime Moving Target Indicator and a Maritime Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (MISAR) that function together to provide ISR information on vessels traveling on the water's surface.  The MISAR collected data on over 100 items of interest.  Maritime Modes is planned to be integrated with the RQ-4B's existing MP-RTIP radar that detects and produces synthetic aperture radar imagery of ground vehicles.Air Force tests new surveillance capability - AF.mil, 28 April 2014

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force===

Air Force Global Hawk flight test evaluations are performed by the 452nd Flight Test Squadron at Edwards AFB. Operational USAF aircraft are flown by the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, 12th Reconnaissance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base. They are also flown by the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, 348th Reconnaissance Squadron at Grand Forks Air Force Base.
Global Hawk ATCD prototypes have been used in the War in Afghanistan and in the Iraq War. Since April 2010, they fly the Northern Route, from Beale AFB over Canada to South-East Asia and back, reducing flight time and improving maintenance. While their data-collection capabilities have been praised, the program lost three prototype aircraft to accidents,Global Hawk Crashes: Who’s to Blame?.

The crashes were reported to be due to "technical failures or poor maintenance", with a failure rate per hour flown over 100 times higher than the F-16 fighters flown in the same wars. The manufacturer stated that it was unfair to compare the failure rates of a mature design to that of a prototype aircraft.
