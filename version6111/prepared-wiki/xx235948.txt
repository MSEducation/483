Size Five Games (formerly Zombie Cow Studios) is a British independent video game developer founded by Dan Marshall in 2008. Dan Marshall's previous games were retroactively brought under the Zombie Cow banner upon its founding.
Their first new release was a donationware adventure game called Ben There, Dan That!, released in 2008. It was widely praised by the adventure game community and downloaded 50,000 times but brought in only "a couple of hundred quid" due to its donation model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zombie-cow.com/?page_id=17|title=Ben There, Dan That!|publisher=Zombie Cow Studios|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Marshall self-funded the games development, telling the BBC in 2010 "What I do keeps me fed and warm. I'm not sure I get to lead the most extravagant lifestyle, or how my earnings compare to people working in the mainstream games industry." Marshall later said of the game "I didn’t think people would really pay money for it ... I think that was a bit naive, in retrospect. It’s well worth a couple of quid, and I do regret not charging for it initially. You can always move the price down, you can’t really move it up." A 2011 updated edition of the game, which added a soundtrack and other features, was sold on a "pay what you want" model, with a minimum price.
The sequel, Time Gentlemen, Please!, was released in 2009 to positive reviews. PC Gamer called it "point-and-click adventuring done right for a change."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/timegentlemenplease|title=Time Gentlemen, Please! reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl] It holds a Metacritic score of 84%.
In 2010, Zombie Cow Studios released Privates, a sex education game funded by Channel 4 and intended to match the "personal, social, and health education" guidelines of the National Curriculum The Xbox 360 version was cancelled when Microsoft confirmed that the game contravened the Xbox Live guidelines on sexual content of games, but the company released the Microsoft Windows version for free download from Channel 4's website.  The game won a BAFTA award in the "Learning - Secondary" category.
In May 2011 Zombie Cow Studios changed their name to Size Five Games.http://www.sizefivegames.com/2011/05/20/formerly-zombie-cow-studios
