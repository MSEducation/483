It contains the text of the four Gospels on 235 paper leaves (23.8 by 19.5) with lacunae (several leaves at the end, they were supplied by a later hand). The text is written in 1 column per page, 26-27 lines per page. It contains numerals of the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (chapters), in Greek, at the left margin, the Ammonian Sections, (not the Eusebian Canons), and pictures. The Euthalian Apparatus was added in 1641.
The manuscript lacks the additions in Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43.44); 23:17; John 5:3.4 (the descent of the angel); Pericope Adulterae (7:53-8:11).[ref]
