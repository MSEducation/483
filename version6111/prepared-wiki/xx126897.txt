The Roman Catholic Diocese of Peterborough ([tpl]lang-la|Dioecesis Peterboroughensis[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic diocese that includes part of the Province of Ontario. It was first established July 11, 1882 by Pope Leo XIII and was found through the union of the Vicariate of Northern Canada and the western part of the Diocese of Kingston. As an Episcopal see, it extended from the shores of Lake Ontario north to Georgian Bay and from the shores of Lake Superior to the border of the Archdiocese of St. Boniface, Manitoba. The diocese had a Catholic population of about 30,000 and Bishop Jean Francois Jamot, the first Bishop, took residence here. The present geographical area of the Diocese of Peterborough includes the districts of Muskoka and Parry Sound, the counties of Peterborough, Northumberland and Victoria, that portion of the Regional District of Durham which formally was the County of Durham, and five south western townships of the County of Haliburton.  It is currently led by Bishop Nicola De Angelis.
As of 2006, the diocese contained 43 parishes, 104 priests, 9 religious priests, and 88,741 Catholics.  It also had 101 Women Religious, and 12 deacons.
