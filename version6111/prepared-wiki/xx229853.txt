[[List of examples of convergent evolution]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Biology-related lists

Convergent evolution—the evolution of similar traits in unrelated lineages (usually geographically distant)—is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary biome, as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of cryptic species, it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics.  Unrelated organisms often develop analogous structures by adapting to similar environments.

==In fungi==

There are a variety of saprophytic and parasitic organisms that have evolved the habit of growing into their substrates as thin strands. This is most typical of the "true" fungi, but it has also evolved in Actinobacteria (bacteria), oomycetes (stramenopiles, like kelp), parasitic plants, and rhizocephalans (parasitic barnacles).

==In proteins, enzymes and biochemical pathways==

===Proteins undergoing functional convergence===

Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar functions with different structure.

===Proteins undergoing structural convergence===

Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar tertiary structures but different functions. Whole protein structural convergence is not thought to occur but some convergence of pockets and secondary structural elements have been documented.
