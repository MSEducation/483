Each week two celebrities go head to head in a number of games, hoping to win Â£10,000 for their chosen charity. They compete in subjects such as sport, science, celebrity, nature, music and mental agility. Each of the games is run and hosted by a different puppet character, who is an "expert" in their field.[tpl]cite web|last1=Plunkett |first1=John |last2=Patterson |first2=John |url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/that-puppet-game-show-muppets-successor |title=This is what we call That Puppet Game Show |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Tobin |first=Christian |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a487527/bbc-one-announces-new-saturday-night-series-that-puppet-game-show.html |title=BBC One announces new Saturday night series 'That Puppet Game Show' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]
