[[Vigna mungo]]

CATEGORIES: Vigna, Edible legumes

Vigna mungo, known as black gram, black lentil (not to be confused with the much smaller true black lentil (Lens culinaris)), white lentil, black ''matpe'' bean, is a bean grown in Indian subcontinent.  It, along with the mung bean, was placed in Phaseolus, but has since been transferred to Vigna. At one time it was considered to belong to the same species as the mung bean.  The product sold as "black lentil" is usually the whole urad bean or urad dal.  The product sold as "white lentil" is the same lentil with the black skin removed.
Black gram originated in India, where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India and Pakistan. The coastal Andhra region in Andhra Pradesh is famous for black gram after paddy. The Guntur District ranks first in Andhra Pradesh for the production of black gram. Black gram has also been introduced to other tropical areas mainly by Indian immigrants.
