==Legacy==

Jefferson Davis served in many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, he served as a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, although he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis’ performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.
Numerous memorials to Jefferson Davis were created. The largest is the [tpl]convert|351|foot|adj=on[/tpl] concrete obelisk located at the Jefferson Davis State Historic Site in Fairview, Kentucky, marking his birthplace. Construction of the monument began in 1917 and finished in 1924 at a cost of about $200,000.
In 1913, the United Daughters of the Confederacy conceived the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, a transcontinental highway to be built through the South.[tpl]cite web| last=Weingroff| first=Richard F.| url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/jdavis.cfm| title=Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway| work=Highway History|publisher=Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation| date=April 7, 2011| accessdate=2011-09-29[/tpl][ref]

Davis appeared on several postage stamps issued by the Confederacy, including its first postage stamp (issued in 1861). In 1995, his portrait appeared on a United States postage stamp, part of a series of 20 stamps commemorating the 130th anniversary of end of the Civil War.[ref]
