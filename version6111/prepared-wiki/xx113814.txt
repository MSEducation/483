[[Cross-border town naming]]

CATEGORIES: Geography, Divided cities

Cross-border town naming occurs where towns or villages with the same or equivalent names are divided between two different countries. This does not necessarily imply that those towns or villages are located in geographic proximity, or that they are located near a current border (for that, see Divided cities). Reasons for this taking place may include the following :
Most of these places are located in Europe, but there are also some examples in North America and Asia. In Europe, until the first half of the 20th century, and again in the post-Schengen 21st century, such divisions could be mostly ignored by the inhabitants.

==Examples==

Note that this list includes only places with similar names that are in someway connected (by history, geography or otherwise) across modern-day international borders. Towns that have the same name but bear no relationship to each other are also very common but not particularly notable.
