[[Marking blue]]

CATEGORIES: Dyes, Inorganic pigments, Metalworking measuring instruments

Marking blue, layout stain or Prussian blue is a dye used in metalworking to aid in marking out rough parts for further machining. It is sometimes called Dykem (after a popular brand). It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath.  The advantages are that any existing scratches are covered with the dye and the new lines have a contrasting background.
Marking blue is made by mixing methylated spirits with shellac and gentian violet.[tpl]Citation | last = Brink | first = C. | last2 = McNamara | first2 = B. | title = Engineering Fabrication & Boilermaking | page = 44 | publisher = Pearson South Africa | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=coOZXYLqqPoC&lpg=PA44 | isbn = 978-1-77025-374-2[/tpl].  This is not to be confused with engineer's blue, made by mixing Prussian Blue with oil.

==Alternatives==

A felt tip marker can be used as they are convenient and tend not to dry up as quickly; marking blue in the form of dye or ink has a tendency to dry in the containers and become unusable quickly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces. This thin copper coating is more resistant to rough handling and the action of cutting fluid.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
