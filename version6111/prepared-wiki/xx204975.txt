===Marvel Noir===

In the Marvel Noir universe, Norman Osborn is the major Crime Lord in New York. His close henchmen are all recruited from various sideshows: Kraven the Hunter, a feral Adrian Toomes, and Chameleon. He is also romantically involved with Felicia Hardy. He had J. Jonah Jameson captured before the series started so that Chameleon could be a mole inside the Daily Bugle. At the end, he and Spider-Man have a stand off, ripping at each other's faces, where Spider-Man is revealed to Osborn as Parker, and Osborn is revealed to have green skin, referencing The Goblin. Before Kraven dies, he ends up touching Norman Osborn causing the spiders that infested Kraven to apparently kill Norman Osborn. In the Spider-Man:Shattered Dimensions video game it is implied that Norman survived due to the spiders not piercing his scaly skin and stole a fragment of "The Tablet of Order and Chaos", using it to increase his strength. His green skin also becomes more prominent, resembling that of his "Ultimate" counterpart.Spider-Man Noir
