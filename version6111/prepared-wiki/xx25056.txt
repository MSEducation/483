Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofski,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003001/ |title=Krusty the Clown (Character) from "The Simpsons" (1989) |publisher=IMDB |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-23[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title=Today I Am a Clown |episodelink=Today I Am a Clown |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H.; Kruse, Nancy |network=Fox |airdate=2003-12-07 |season=15 |number=6[/tpl] better known as Krusty the Clown, is a cartoon character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa's favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes, most of which also spotlight Bart.
Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson with clown make-up, with the original idea being that Bart worships a television clown who looks like his own father. His voice is based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989 in the Tracey Ullman Show short "The Krusty the Clown Show".

==Role in The Simpsons==

Krusty the Clown, born Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofski, was born in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Hyman Krustofski. Hyman strongly opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract him from his religion, wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father's back. One day, he was performing at a rabbi's convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofski found out, he disowned his son, and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa.[tpl]cite episode |title=Like Father, Like Clown |episodelink=Like Father, Like Clown |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Bird, Brad; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-04 |season=3 |number=6[/tpl] It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by "acting up." Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi.[tpl]cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Busted |episodelink=Krusty Gets Busted |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Bird, Brad |network=Fox |airdate=1990-04-29 |season=1 |number=12[/tpl] Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that she started hating clowns, and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty.[tpl]cite episode |title=Insane Clown Poppy |episodelink=Insane Clown Poppy |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Frink, John; Payne, Don; Anderson, Bob |network=Fox |airdate=2000-11-12 |season=12 |number=03[/tpl]
Krusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield: The Krusty the Clown Show, which is aimed towards a children's audience and has many followers, including Bart Simpson.[tpl]cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Kancelled |episodelink=Krusty Gets Kancelled |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-13 |season=04 |number=22[/tpl] Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries, including Ireland, China, Jamaica, and Romania, that produce localized versions.[tpl]cite episode |title=Yellow Subterfuge |episodelink=Yellow Subterfuge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H; Anderson, Bob |network=Fox |airdate=2013-12-08 |season=25 |number=07[/tpl] Some of the early details of Krusty's career have been revealed in clips, but many have been contradictory. For example, Krusty once said that he was banned from television for consecutive 10- and 22-year periods taking him from 1957 to 89.[tpl]cite episode |title=Day of the Jackanapes |episodelink=Day of the Jackanapes |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Marcantel, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=2001-02-18 |season=12 |number=13[/tpl] Yet an episode of Krusty's show exists from 1961 in which he interviews AFL-CIO president George Meany.[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart of Darkness |episodelink=Bart of Darkness |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=McGrath, Dan; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-04 |season=06 |number=01[/tpl] Krusty's show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost then dumping a load of snow on the poet. The show later took a different turn, featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged-out version of The Doors' "Break on Through (To the Other Side)" in 1973.[tpl]cite episode |title=I Love Lisa |episodelink=I Love Lisa |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Mula, Frank; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1993-02-11 |season=04 |number=15[/tpl] By the 1980s, the show had devolved into a children's entertainment show. During the series, the Krusty the Clown Show is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children and features many characters, including Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Tina Ballerina, and Corporal Punishment.[tpl]cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |episodelink=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1990-12-20 |season=02 |number=09[/tpl] Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty's main sidekick, but years of constant abuse led to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery, although Bob was eventually foiled by Bart. Bob has since been replaced by Sideshow Mel, who has remained loyal to Krusty. He seems to retire from and then get back into show business repeatedly throughout his career. His most recent retirement was almost permanent because of recently paroled Sideshow Bob's latest scheme – wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending him up on stage. When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob at the last minute, however, Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission. Bob and Krusty later reconciled, with Krusty exclaiming that Bob's attempts at Krusty's life make his ratings shoot through the roof.
Bart Simpson is one of Krusty's biggest fans. In the episode "Krusty Gets Busted" (Season 1, Episode 12) he declared "I've based my life on Krusty's teachings" and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and has treated Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director brought in Barney Gumble with Clown make-up. This pushed Bart over the edge and he finally decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.[tpl]cite episode |title=Kamp Krusty |episodelink=Kamp Krusty |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-09-24 |season=04 |number=01[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=128-129[/tpl]
Krusty is a multi-millionaire who amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of sub-standard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, which in one episode boasted a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products was launched by Bart, who ate a jagged metal Krusty-O and had to have his appendix removed.[tpl]cite episode |title='Round Springfield |episodelink='Round Springfield |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Sternin, Joshua; Ventimilia, Jeffrey; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=1995-04-30 |season=06 |number=22[/tpl] The "Krusty Korporation," the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10[/tpl] In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones,[tpl]cite episode |title='Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky |episodelink='Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Greaney, Dan; Grazier, Allen; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-30 |season=14 |number=14[/tpl] as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills; eating condor-egg omelets; spending huge sums on pornographic magazines; and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas to betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.
Krusty is a hard-living entertainment veteran, sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax.[tpl]cite episode |title=Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington |episodelink=Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-09 |season=14 |number=14[/tpl] He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling;[tpl]cite episode |title=Homie the Clown |episodelink=Homie the Clown |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1995-02-12 |season=06 |number=15[/tpl] Marge states in "The Sweetest Apu", that, "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man". In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as "the wizened veteran, the total pro" who lives the celebrity life but is miserable and needs his celebrity status.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=392-394[/tpl] In "Bart the Fink", Bart inadvertently reported Krusty as a tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money. Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declared that he was finished with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage.[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart the Fink |episodelink=Bart the Fink |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1996-02-11 |season=07 |number=15[/tpl] Finally, Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinced Krusty to return.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=392-394[/tpl] Krusty has been described as "the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people."[tpl]cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2002 |title=Commentary for the episode "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming".

In the fourteenth season, Bart convinced Krusty to run for Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline re-routing bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With the help of the Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.

===Creation===

Krusty first appeared in "The Krusty the Clown Show," one of The Simpsons shorts from The Tracey Ullman Show that first aired on January 15, 1989.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=15[/tpl] The character was partially inspired by TV clown "Rusty Nails" whom both The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and director Brad Bird watched as children while growing up in Portland, Oregon.[tpl]cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subjectlink=Matt Groening |interviewer=Terry Gross |title=Fresh Air |program=National Public Radio |callsign=WHYY-FM |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1476480 |city=Philadelphia |date=2003-10-23 |accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] Groening describes Rusty Nails as being a sweet clown whose show sometimes had a Christian message, but whose name scared Groening.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Bird, Brad; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace |date=2001 |title=Commentary for the episode "Krusty Gets Busted". The Simpsons: The Complete First Season |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television's Bob Bell who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984.[tpl]cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |accessdate=2007-08-15 |date=2000-10-21 |publisher=TV Guide |author=Joe Rhodes[/tpl]
Many events in Krusty's life parallel those of comedian Jerry Lewis, including his Jewish background, addiction to Percodan, and hosting of telethons.[tpl]cite interview |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-anatomy-krusty-clown-inspired-470898.html |title=The Anatomy of Krusty the Clown (or Who or What Inspired the Famous "Simpsons" Clown...and Why Clowns Get a Bad Rap) |accessdate=2012-01-29 |date=2007-07-30 |author=Greg Brian |work=Yahoo![/tpl] When asked, Groening has simply noted that "Simpsons characters are collaborations between the writers, animators, and actors" without specifically confirming or denying the association.[tpl]cite interview |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening |accessdate=2012-01-29 |date=2006-04-26 |author=Nathan Rabin |publisher=AV Club[/tpl]
Krusty's appearance and design is basically just that of Homer Simpson with clown make-up.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date=2007-07-26 |author=Larry Carroll |publisher=MTV[/tpl] Groening said that "The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshiped a clown who looked exactly like his father," a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047268,00.html |title=Talking about The Simpsons |accessdate=2008-04-05 |date=2007-07-20 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl] Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that "at some point, we decided he looked a clown all the time." The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown make-up but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in "Krusty Gets Busted" and "Like Father, Like Clown." Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his "grotesque appearance" is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, "This ain't makeup." In Bart the Fink, after he drops is "Rory B. Bellows" persona and swims towards shore, he leaves a trail of yellow makeup in his wake, revealing his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Carrington, Michael; Silverman, David |date=2004 |title=Commentary for the episode "Homer's Triple Bypass."

===Development===

The third season episode "Like Father, Like Clown" is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish. Krusty's religion had not been part of the original concept, and the idea came from Jay Kogen. The episode is a parody of The Jazz Singer, which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. In order to make "Like Father, Like Clown" a full parody of The Jazz Singer, the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a Rabbi. Krusty's real last name, Krustofski, was pitched by Al Jean.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Bird, Brad; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarski, Wallace; Jean, Al; Castellaneta, Dan; Kavner, Jean |date=2003 |title=Commentary for the episode "Like Father, Like Clown". The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Krusty's father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofski was played by Jackie Mason, who won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |accessdate=2008-04-05[/tpl] It was established in "Krusty Gets Busted" that Krusty is illiterate. This was shown in subsequent episodes like "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character.[tpl]cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2002 |title=Commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge".

Krusty's design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years. For the episode "Homie the Clown", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David; Silverman, David; Kirkland, Mark |date=2005 |title=Commentary for the episode "Homie the Clown". The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] In the episode "Lisa's Wedding", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.[tpl]cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's Wedding" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
Krusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for showbusiness jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David |date=2004 |title=Commentary for the episode "Krusty Gets Kancelled". The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.
In 1994, Matt Groening pitched a live-action spin-off from The Simpsons that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta. He and Michael Weithorn[tpl]cite news |author=Olly Richards |title=Life In Development Hell |pages=76 |publisher=Empire |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2007-10-19[/tpl] wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84306,00.html |title=Send in the Clown |accessdate=2008-04-04 |date=1999-04-15 |author=Dan Snierson |publisher=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl]

==Reception==

In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in "Today I Am a Clown", an episode that heavily features Krusty.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117908929.html?categoryid=1603&cs=1 |title=Emmy speaks for Homer |accessdate=2008-04-04 |date=2004-08-10 |author=Michael Schneider |publisher=Variety[/tpl] Several episodes featuring Krusty have been very well received. In 2007, Vanity Fair named "Krusty Gets Kancelled" as the ninth best episode of The Simpsons. John Ortved felt, "This is Krusty's best episode — better than the reunion with his father, or the Bar Mitzvah episode, which won an Emmy much later on. The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is top-notch, and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty's flailing showbiz career.
