Since 1982, the stadium is served by St James Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro. The station is decorated in a black and white colour scheme, with archive photographs of the club's players.
The club's current training ground is located at Darsley Park, which is north of the city at Benton. The facility was opened in July 2003, and is also used by the Newcastle Falcons rugby team.

==Ownership==

Newcastle United was set up as a private company limited by shares on 6 September 1895. The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9% of the club for £3 million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a public limited company, with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner Freddy Shepherd. Later that year Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by John's son Douglas. In December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for £10m, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the April 1999 Competition Commission, brought in due to government concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.
In 2007, businessman Mike Ashley purchased the combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41% share in the club, through a holding company St James Holdings, with a view to buy the rest. Upon purchasing this share he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to sell their shares.
Since completing the purchase of the club, Ashley has twice announced that he planned to sell the club.  The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan on 14 September 2008, when Ashley stated "I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do". However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009 it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of £100 million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market.

==Social responsibility==

Newcastle United established the Newcastle United Foundation in summer 2008, which seeks to encourage learning and promote healthy living amongst disadvantaged children, young people and families in the North East region, as well as promoting equality and diversity. The Foundation's manager Kate Bradley told charity news website The Third Sector, "Children look up to players as their heroes, and anything they say is instantly taken on board. If Newcastle defender Steven Taylor tells them not to eat a Mars bar for breakfast, they'll listen." In 2010, the charity taught over 5,000 children about healthy living.
The Foundation's commitment, along with a similar foundation run by West Bromwich Albion, the unique relationship that Aston Villa has with Acorns Children's Hospice and Tottenham Hotspur has with SOS Children's Villages UK, are some leading examples of commitment in the highest level of football to responsibility and change in the communities in which they work and who enrich them through their support and ticket sales. The work of these clubs, and others, are changing the way professional sport interacts with their communities and supporters.
In December 2012 the club announced that it had become the world’s first carbon positive football club.[tpl]cite web|title=fcbusiness Magazine – Newcastle United Becomes World’s First ‘Carbon Positive’ Football Club|url=http://fcbusiness.co.uk/news/article/newsitem=2166/title=newcastle+united+becomes+world%92s+first+%91carbon+positive%92+football+club|accessdate=5 December 2012|date=5 December 2012[/tpl]

==Supporters and rivalries==

Supporters of Newcastle United are drawn from all over the North East and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world. The club's supporters are also known as the Magpies, the Geordies or the Toon Army. The name Toon originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town. In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total distance travelled for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2009–10 when the club were playing in English football's second tier, the Football League Championship, the average attendance at St James Park was 43,388, the fourth best for an English club that season. At the end of the 2011–12 Premier league season, Newcastle United held the third highest average attendance for the season of 49,935.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/eng.1/year/2011/barclays-premier-league?cc=5739 |title=English Premier League Team Attendance Statistics – 2011–12 – ESPN FC |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2012-05-13 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] This figure was only supassed by Arsenal and Manchester United, the only two clubs in the premier league with larger stadiums.
The club's supporters publish a number of fanzines including True Faith and The Mag, along with NUFC.com, which was established in 1996.  They set up Newcastle United Supporters Trust in September 2008, aiming to "represent the broad church of Newcastle United's support".
In addition to the usual English football chants, Newcastle's supporters sing the traditional Tyneside song Blaydon Races.
Traditionally, Newcastle's main rivals are Sunderland, against whom the Tyne–Wear derby is competed.
