Edge of Eternity is a 1959 CinemaScope film directed by Don Siegel shot on location in the Grand Canyon. 

==Plot==

The film begins with an attempted assassination of a man looking into the Grand Canyon with his binoculars.  The assassin disables the emergency brake from the man's car and attempts to run him over as the car goes off the edge.  The man leaps out of the way and kills his assassin by throwing him off the rim.  He is seen wandering by Eli, an old prospector who attempts to tell a Deputy Sheriff (Cornel Wilde).  However Eli has a reputation for telling tall tales, so the deputy ignores him to chase an attractive woman (Victoria Shaw) speeding recklessly down the road.  The unidentified man is later found dead, hanging bound and gagged in a former mining office in an abandoned gold mine.
The Deputy and Janice Kendon, the speeding woman, team up to solve the murders and a plot to illegally mine gold to sell in Mexico.
