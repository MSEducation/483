Diphydontosaurus was a sphenodontian reptile from the Late Triassic of England (UK). This small animal was related to the living tuatara, which survives on the island of New Zealand. Diphydontosaurus may have hunted and eaten insects in the crevices of ancient caves. It may have grown to a length of 4 inches (10 centimeters).[tpl]cite web | work = Vertebrate Paleontology | publisher = Insubria University | first = Silvio | last = Renesto | title = Diphydontosaurus | url = http://dipbsf.uninsubria.it/paleo/diphydontosaurus.htm[/tpl]
