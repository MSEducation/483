Mortimer Nova is an experimental indie / anti-folk / indietronic group fronted by former Halfway There drummer/guitarist/vocalist Michael Vilches based out of the Tampa Bay area in Florida. Early Mortimer Nova began as a solo indie-folk project. Over the years, the band has acquired more musicians that have come and gone but Vilches has always remained in the band. The bands particular brand of music acts as flowed storytelling without any poetic rhyme. Mortimer Nova uses an effected acoustic guitar, multi-vocal harmony, synthesized/sampled noise and a drum kit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Mortimer+Nova |title=Mortimer Nova on Last.fm[/tpl]

===Formation and Debut===

The band formed in Tampa, Florida in 2002.
