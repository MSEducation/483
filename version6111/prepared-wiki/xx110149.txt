Barrenjoey High School is a co-educational high school located in the Sydney suburb of Avalon, in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. The campus backs onto the Northern end of Avalon Beach.
The first student intake was in 1968 with a single grade (known at the time as 'Form 1') which formally graduated from the school in 1973. The inaugural Graduating year of 1973 remains closeknit and has recently held a reunion with an outstanding number of students in attendance (more than 70, close to 40 years after last seeing each other).
The location of the school right at the beach lent itself to many curricular and non curricular beach activities.
Over ensuing years, the school has grown in enrolments to its current level, necessitating expansion of the campus and construction of additional facilities.
Barrenjoey's feeder primary schools include Avalon Public School, Bilgola Plateau Public School and others in the local area.
There appears to be a trend towards increasing achievement at the school, with the class of 2008 achieving 150 Band 6 results in a range of subjects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

==House System==

In 2009 Barrenjoey High School introduced the house system. Students are placed into one of the four houses in year 7. The houses are made up in alphabetical order, according to students last name. The four houses are Maluka (which is blue), Akuna (which is yellow), Iluka (which is red) and Tingara (which is green). Students can win 'house points' through various activities including getting merit certificates and participating in school carnivals.
