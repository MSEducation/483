Faciens misericordiam (Granting forgiveness) was a papal bull issued by Pope Clement V on August 12, 1308, as part of the trial against the Knights Templar. It called for a new Ecumenical council to be held in 1310, and set out some structure for the collection of depositions from the arrested Templars.

==Date==

The bull was written on August 8, and then read aloud on the 12th at the College of Cardinals.

==Content==

The document created papal commissions which were charged with investigating the actions of the Templars.  It also called for an ecumenical council to convene in 1310 to discuss urgent problems facing Christianity, such as the organization of a new Crusade.  Regarding the Templars, the bull ordered the collection of depositions from Templars across Christendom, which would be gathered and brought to the Pope for determination on the fate of the Order, which fate would be decided and announced by the Pope at the 1310 council.
