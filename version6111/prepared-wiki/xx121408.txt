===The Wire===

thumb|left|Williams at Harvard University for a panel discussion on The Wire, November 8, 2010Williams is known for his portrayal of Omar Little in The Wire, which began filming in 2002. The character was based on Donnie Andrews, as well as other crime figures in Baltimore.[tpl]cite news|last=Fenton |first=Justin |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-donnie-andrews-inspiration-for-omar-character-on-the-wire-dies-20121214,0,3207915.story |title=Donnie Andrews, inspiration for Omar character on "The Wire," dies |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2012-12-20[/tpl] Williams received the part after only a single audition. He was initially told that the character was slated to appear in just seven episodes of the first season and feared that the character would be killed before the end of the season. However, creator David Simon stated that they always planned to keep the character as part of the continuing ensemble should the show be renewed beyond the first season.
For his portrayal of Omar, Williams was named by USA Today as one of ten reasons they still love television. The character was praised for his uniqueness in the stale landscape of TV crime dramas and for the wit and humor that Williams brings to the portrayal. Omar has been named as one of the first season's richest characters, a Robin Hood of Baltimore's west side projects.  The Baltimore City Paper named the character one of their top ten reasons not to cancel the show and called him "arguably the show’s single greatest achievement". In 2007 he was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Omar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/features/e3i1df4dfd4706f9fc31fefc3974392be1d|title=2007 Image Award nominees and winners|accessdate=2007-11-05|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|year=2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Williams pursued the role because he was intrigued by the character's contradictory nature. He felt the character's popularity stemmed from his honesty, lack of materialism, individuality and his adherence to his strict code. He feels that the role has been a breakthrough in terms of bringing attention to him and getting further roles. Williams has received both positive and negative reactions to the character's homosexuality and feels that he is successful in challenging attitudes and provoking discussion with the role. During the previous year, before the third season, he discovered Felicia Pearson (Snoop) in a Baltimore bar.
In 2008, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama cited The Wire as his favorite television show, and called Omar Little his favorite character. About Omar, Obama said, "That’s not an endorsement. He's not my favorite person, but he's a fascinating character... he's the toughest, baddest guy on the show."[tpl]cite web|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/01/barack-obama-on.html |title=Chicago Tribune: Barack Obama on his favorite TV show |publisher=Featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]
