==History==

On 28 July 1912, a pier in Binz on the island RÃ¼gen, Germany collapsed under the load of 1,000 people waiting for the cruise steamer Kronprinz Wilhelm. Sailors of the German navy were able to save most people, but 17 people died because they could not swim, including seven children. This catastrophe led to the foundation of the "Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft (DLRG)" (German lifesaving organization) on 19 October 1913 in Leipzig.
With almost 560,000 members in approximately 2,100 local groups, the DLRG is the largest voluntary water rescue organization in the world. Including donors, over one million people support the work of the DLRG.
