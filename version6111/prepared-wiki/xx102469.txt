It is the fifth of the five daily prayers–http://www.qul.org.au/ishanmaghrib.htm (salat) evening begins at maghrib. The five daily prayers collectively are one pillar of the Five Pillars of Islam, in Sunni Islam, and one of the ten Practices of the Religion (Furū al-Dīn) according to Shia Islam. It is a 4 rak'ah prayer and the first 2 rak'ah are prayed aloud. When travelling, according to some madhhabs, it may be reduced to two rak'ahs.
In Islam, the Isha' daily prayer has four required (Fard) rak'ah. However, in Sunni Islam, the two Sunnah rak'ah following the Isha' are highly recommended and  so is the 3 rakat Wajib Witr. There are a few optional prayers that can be recited after the Isha' prayer, including the Nafilat ul-Layl prayers (together termed tahajjud), as well as the tarawih in Ramadan.
