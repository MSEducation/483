Marcus Paterson (1712 – 12 March 1787, near Bray)[tpl]Rayment-hc-ie|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ml-AAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Marcus%20Paterson%22%20Ballynakill&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Robert Marshall, of Clonmell, Esq. |work=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society|year=1897|author=F. Elrington Ball|volume=III|number=25|page=273|accessdate=2010-12-31[/tpl] was an Irish politician, Solicitor-General for Ireland and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.  He became the Member of Parliament for Ballynakill in 1756 and Lisburn in 1768. He was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1764 and became Chief Justice of Common Pleas in 1770. He held office until his death although he had been contemplating retirement due to ill health.
He was a native of Ennis, County Clare; and was the third son of Montrose Paterson. He went to school in Limerick and graduated from the University of Dublin.
In character he seems to have been an eighteenth-century "rake": he was famed for his hospitality, shortened his life by heavy drinking and fought numerous duels. On the other hand he was  a considerable scholar, a fine lawyer and a diligent and zealous law officer.
