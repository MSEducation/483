The frequency spectrum of a time-domain signal is a representation of that signal in the frequency domain.  The frequency spectrum can be generated via a Fourier transform of the signal, and the resulting values are usually presented as amplitude and phase, both plotted versus frequency.
Any signal that can be represented as an amplitude that varies with time has a corresponding frequency spectrum.  This includes familiar concepts such as visible light (color), musical notes, radio/TV channels, and even the regular rotation of the earth.  When these physical phenomena are represented in the form of a frequency spectrum, certain physical descriptions of their internal processes become much simpler.  Often, the frequency spectrum clearly shows harmonics, visible as distinct spikes or lines at particular frequencies, that provide insight into the mechanisms that generate the entire signal.

==Light==

Light from many different sources contains various colors, each with its own brightness or intensity.  A rainbow, or prism, sends these component colors in different directions, making them individually visible at different angles.  A graph of the intensity plotted against the frequency (showing the brightness of each color) is the frequency spectrum of the light.  When all the visible frequencies are present equally, the perceived color of the light is white, and the spectrum is a flat line.  Therefore, flat-line spectrums in general are often referred to as white, whether they represent light or another type of wave phenomenon (sound, for example, or vibration in a structure).
==Sound== 
Similarly, a source of sound can have many different frequencies mixed.  A musical tone's timbre is characterized by its harmonic spectrum.  Sound in our environment that we refer to as noise includes many different frequencies.  When a sound signal contains a mixture of all audible frequencies, distributed equally over the audio spectrum, it is called white noise.[ref]
