Chợ Lớn ([tpl]Audio|Cholon.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl]) is a Chinese-influenced section of Ho Chi Minh City (former Saigon). It lies on the west bank of the Saigon River, having Bình Tây Market as its central market. Cholon consists of the western half of District 5 as well as several adjoining neighborhoods in District 6.
The Vietnamese name Cholon literally means "big" ([tpl]unicode|lớn[/tpl]) "market" ([tpl]unicode|chợ[/tpl]). The Chinese name (and original name) of Cholon is 堤岸 (pronounced Tai-Ngon in Cantonese and Dī'àn in Mandarin, which means "embankment" (French: quais). The Vietnamese reading of the Chinese name is [tpl]unicode|Đê Ngạn[/tpl], but this is rarely used. Vietnamese speakers exclusively use the name [tpl]unicode|Chợ Lớn[/tpl], while Chinese speakers (both inside Vietnam and in China) are the only users of the latter.
In 1778, the Hoa (Chinese minority of Vietnam) living in Biên Hòa had to take refuge in what is now Cholon because they were retaliated against by the Tây Sơn forces for their support of the Nguyễn lords. In 1782, they were again massacred by the Tây Sơn and had to rebuild. They built high embankments against the flows of the river, and called their new settlement Tai-Ngon (meaning "embankment" in Cantonese).
Cholon was incorporated as a city in 1879, 11 km from Saigon. By the 1930s, it had expanded to the city limit of Saigon. On April 27, 1931, the two cities were merged to form Saigon-Cholon. In 1956, "Cholon" was dropped from the name and the city became known as Saigon.
During the Vietnam War, soldiers and deserters from the United States Army maintained a thriving black market at Cholon, trading in various American and especially U.S Army-issue items.  This was the area, near the Quan Âm Pagoda where photojournalist Eddie Adams took his famous execution photograph.[tpl]cite book|first=John |last=Faber |title=Great News Photos and the Stories Behind Them |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1978 |page=136 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DqwLVaPdDgoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Four Australian journalists were also killed in Cholon during the Tet Offensive in 1968.[tpl]cite news|first=Hal G.P |last=Colebatch |title=The Saigon media slaughter |newspaper=The Australian |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/the-saigon-media-slaughter/story-e6frg6q6-1225792583446[/tpl]
