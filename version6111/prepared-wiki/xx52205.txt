 The Klinikum Aachen, full German name "Universit√§tsklinikum Aachen" (University Hospital Aachen), abbreviated UKA, formerly known as "Neues Klinikum", is the largest hospital in Europe, located in Aachen (Germany).  It is part of the RWTH Aachen and contains its whole medical faculty.
Seen from far away, for many visitors the Klinikum Aachen looks like an oil refinery rather than a hospital, due to the huge striped ventilation pipes that are attached to the outer walls.
The Klinikum Aachen contains many specialised clinics, theoretical and clinical institutes and other research facilities, lecture halls, schools for jobs in the medical field, and all facilities necessary for a hospital like a laundry and central sterilisation.
It is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011|reason=University Hospital Gasthuisberg of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven has more beds, more staff, more consults, ... in one building[/tpl]

==History==

In 1966 the faculty of medicine at the RWTH Aachen was founded.  Automatically the municipal hospitals in Aachen became university hospitals, but soon it was realised that they were too small.
In 1972 the constructions of the Klinikum Aachen began.  Ten years later the first rooms could be used by the faculty.  The rest of the building was finished section by section.  The constructions were delayed due to problems with too soft ground material that could not sustain the whole building. 
The official opening was celebrated in 1985.  Its original name was "Neues Klinikum" (New Klinikum) because there was already a hospital called "Klinikum" in Aachen.  That doesn't exist anymore, so it was renamed.
