Australasia is the full-length debut album by Chicago post-metal band Pelican. It was released November 4, 2003 on Hydra Head Records.
Guitarist Trevor de Brauw has noted that because of budget restrictions, the Australasia sessions had to be rushed. The studio was also under construction during recording and had a few impediments. Despite this, critical reception has been largely positive.
The track "Drought" was used in the 2009 war film The Messenger.
